      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy John Bruton.  I now call on Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking your leave, Sir, to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the urgent and important matter of what has been described by the Lord Mayor of Belfast as one of the darkest nights of terror we have witnessed in Belfast in recent years.  This involved the murder of four men and the wounding of a five week old baby.</P>
      <P>This House, as well as having an opportunity of expressing its revulsion at this savagery, should have an opportunity to debate what immediate steps can be taken to enhance security throughout this island and thereby contribute to the ending of violence, which is a necessary precondition to a durable political solution.</P>

      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by Standing <Col N="1590" /> Order 30.  Therefore I cannot grant leave to move the motion.  There are ample ways and means open to the Deputies to raise this matter on ordinary notice and in fact it may be adverted to in the ensuing debate of today.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 11 and 10.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, and subject to the agreement of the House that: (1) No. 11 shall be decided without debate; (2) In the debate on No. 10, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and (3) The Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last few days the Taoiseach has indicated that the extension of the powers of the European Affairs Committee requires legislation. At least he has said that that committee is itself established under legislation.  Has the Taoiseach decided that it is not possible to give the committee the extra powers in advance of the legislation, or must the legislation first be introduced before the committee can be given the powers suggested for it under the joint programme?  In view of that, let me ask the Taoiseach when the legislation will actually be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any particular objection to the committee exercising these functions in advance of legislation but, as the committee was established by legislation, it would be totally desirable that any addition to <Col N="1591" /> or expansion of its functions should also be made by legislation.  It is the intention of the Government to bring in legislation as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the most speedy and effective method of proceeding with this matter would be to introduce a resolution in the House granting the committee the extra powers and then subsequently introducing confirmatory legislation? Would the Taoiseach agree to follow that course in view of the urgent necessity of ensuring that preparations for Maastricht, for example, involve this House effectively through the committee in question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go gcomhaontóidh Dáil Éireann leis an Taoiseach d'ainmniú na Teachtaí Uinseann Ó Brádaigh agus Nollaig Ó Dobharáin chun a gceapaithe ag an Uachtarán mar chomhaltaí den Rialtas.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputies Vincent Brady and Noel Davern for appointment by the President to be members of the Government.</P>
      <P>Subject to the motion being approved, I would propose to assign the Department of Defence to Deputy Vincent Brady. The other proposed arrangements about the assignment of Departments to members of the Government and about the removal and appointment of Ministers of State which I mentioned in my speech yesterday will remain in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim McDaid indicated to the House yesterday evening that he had asked me to withdraw his name for nomination as Minister for Defence.  He gave a totally convincing rebuttal of the false and deplorable accusations from the Opposition benches that he was opposed to extradition, that he was a Provisional IRA sympathiser and similar unfounded charges.  He went on to inform the House that, lest there be the slightest suspicion <Col N="1593" /> of any kind attaching to the Minister for Defence, and in the broader national interest, he had asked me to withdraw his name.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that Deputy McDaid is completely innocent of the allegations made against him.  He is an honourable man, a respected Member of this House, courageous and outspoken, who is totally opposed to the IRA and their abhorrent campaign of violence.</P>
    <P>I accepted that in the circumstances it would not be appropriate to proceed with Deputy McDaid's appointment as Minister for Defence.  Accordingly, as I have already indicated, I am putting forward the name of Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, for appointment as Minister for Defence along with that of Deputy Noel Davern for appointment as Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I feel I must at this stage make a brief comment on the tone of yesterday's proceedings. Yesterday's debate was a further manifestation of a new and deplorable style of political assault in this House.  The character and reputation of a decent and honourable Deputy, who I am sure would have made a very capable Minister and who I am certain would have acted correctly in every way, was crucified in an outrageous and indefensible manner.  It is a dark day for civil liberties in this country when a respectable member of the community and a Deputy of this House, who along with members of all parties champions the innocence of an accused person, subsequently released by the Supreme Court, is attacked as virulently as Deputy McDaid was yesterday.  I am tired, and the country is tired, of these hypocrites of virtue, ever ready with the instant moral judgment, the accusing finger, totally ignoring the basic right of everyone inside and outside this House to the integrity of their reputation until conclusively demonstrated otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I recommend the new <Col N="1594" /> ministerial appointments and the reallocation of ministerial responsibilities to the House.  They represent an able and effective team that will set to work at once to implement our ambitious and comprehensive Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There should have been two resignations yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday in the Dáil I said that this Government were prefoundly unstable because they had no sense of common purpose and as a result they were providing no leadership for the people.  The events of yesterday have proven, far more eloquently than I could have foreseen, how deep seated is the inherent lack of common purpose or indeed basic understanding within the Government.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with yesterday's events let me quote the precise words I used yesterday to describe the Government:</P>
      <P>As long as this Government continue, everything is provisional.  The maximum timeframe is two years, the minimum is two weeks.  That is no way to run a country.</P>
      <P>How wrong I was; the maximum timeframe for this Government in adhering to any decisions they take proved to be no more than about five hours.  Nothing more eloquently demonstrates the makeshift character of this Government than what happened yesterday.  Let us recall the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach knew that he would have to replace two Ministers as long ago as last Friday &mdash; three full working days, apart from Saturday.  In the intervening days he had several recorded meetings with the leader of his Coalition partner party, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and probably many telephone conversations.  Both the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Malley had fully accessible to them throughout that period reports from the Garda on court cases, on who gave evidence in them, on who associated <Col N="1595" /> themselves with the defendants and the anti-extradition protests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And judgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Haughey would also have had personal recollections of newspaper reports on the Clarke case.  Both knew all this since last Friday.</P>
      <P>The position is that either the Taoiseach, as would be normal in a Coalition Government, discussed his proposed appointment with the leader of his Coalition partner party &mdash; in that case Deputy Des O'Malley is equally to blame with the Taoiseach for the shambles which occurred yesterday &mdash; or alternatively the Taoiseach did not discuss this proposed appointment before it was made with the leader of his Coalition partner party.  Perhaps Deputy O'Malley did not even seek a discussion before the announcement was made in this House and heard it all for the first time yesterday when the nominations were announced.  Quite frankly, I do not believe that is true; but, if it is, then truly this Government are doomed.</P>
      <P>A Government in which there is such a lack of trust and consultation between the party leaders that a matter of this kind would not be discussed between them before the leader of one party announced it in the House is the worst possible kind of Government we could have and a Government who are quite truly profoundly unstable.  If Deputy O'Malley was not consulted about this appointment before it was made and given ample opportunity to comment on it, then why in God's name do the Progressive Democrats want to continue with this sort of Government for the next two and a half years?  As I said, I believe that Deputy Des O'Malley was fully and amply consulted by the Taoiseach well before this nomination was made.  That is what I believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I further believe that Deputy Des O'Malley agreed to this nomination well in advance of its being made.  If Deputy <Col N="1596" /> Des O'Malley did agree to the nomination and then subsequently changed his mind he is most certainly not fit to be a Minister let alone leader of a political party, however small.  His party in sustaining him as leader in these circumstances demonstrate their own irrelevance, just as the Fianna Fáil Party demonstrated their own lack of purpose in maintaining their leader last Saturday.</P>
    <P>Let me say to the Fianna Fáil Deputies that they were incoherent in their rage and humiliation here last night, but this is not the end of it.  This is about the fifth time in this House in this Dáil that they have been brought to the brink and this is going to continue for as long as this Government continue.  This humiliation is going to continue as long as this Government continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is going to continue as long as a Government stay in office under the joint &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; of Deputies Haughey and O'Malley.  It is not a mutual partnership; it is a mutual paralysis.  It is most certainly not a government.  To the Fianna Fáil Deputies I say that their party have internal contradictions to resolve.  They should resolve them in opposition, not in Government at public expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am utterly convinced no good will come from the continuance of what we have seen during the past two years and most graphically their humiliating instability during the past 24 hours. The first requirement for a renewal in this country is that we establish a Government who have a clear sense of purpose, which undoubtedly this one do not have. You cannot perform in Government unless you have a sense of purpose.  The fundamental problem with this Government is that neither the Taoiseach nor <Col N="1598" /> the Government have a clear sense of purpose.  I have no fears regarding the election of a new Dáil, the sooner the 27th Dáil is elected the better because only then will we have a stable Government with a sense of purpose.</P>
      <P>Yesterday marked the end of the 26th Dáil and those who wish to prolong it artificially are doing no service to their country.  I say that with great clarity to Deputies opposite, some of whom are silent while others are noisy.  I intend to spend the remaining time available to me talking, not about the sad, almost pathetic events of the past few days, but about the basis upon which a new Government can and will be formed in the 27th Dáil when the people are given a chance to elect them.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the basis for such a Government under six headings: Northern Ireland, financial policy, jobs, Europe, collective responsibility and the reform of the Dáil.  In the next Dáil we can and will elect a Government who will make real, durable progress in regard to Northern Ireland, based on an explicit recognition in our Constitution which will never come from this Government, on the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide their own future; no territorial claims over the heads of the people of Northern Ireland should be made because they are entitled to their rights as we are to ours.  No claim should exist in our Constitution which arbitrarily claims to govern them regardless of their dignity as people.  That can only be changed in a new Dáil and progress will only come, as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, when that aspect of our Constitution is changed.  Such a change, which will come in a new Dáil in a Government not led by either of the present parties, will usher in a new era of progress, harmony and co-operation on this island, of a kind which has not existed for 300 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to financial policies.  In recent times the Taoiseach went so far as to undermine his then Minister for Finance.  The rift which broke wide open in Fianna Fáil last Saturday can be traced <Col N="1599" /> directly back to the bypassing of the Minister for Finance in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations. This was followed by the deliberate undermining of the interviews of the Minister for Finance on the economy on the radio.  It was all a game.  The work of earlier years was wasted as far as economic policy is concerned because there never was and never will be any common sense of economic purpose in this Government.  The recently revised Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats joint programme bears all the marks of this collapse of collective and individual responsibility in economic matters.  The programme's promises on taxation and PRSI cannot be met without raising an additional £640 million by some other means.  However, this so-called policy does not tell us where one penny of that will be raised.  A Government and a coalition of parties which can simply talk about what they will raise, are not a Government with a policy but one with empty aspirations.  The document was merely a list of empty aspirations without any choices being made to back it up.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> had similar flaws; it contained commitments amounting to £888 million but again we were not told where one single penny of the money to pay for that would be found.  Again, like the joint programme, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is not a policy, it is no more than an aspiration.  It is not a policy because a policy is about choices and no choices are made &mdash; or ever will be made &mdash; in a coherent sense by this Government as far as economic policies are concerned.  I am determined that the 27th Dáil will elect a Government who will have clear economic polices.  It is Fine Gael's intention to lead the formation of such a Government.  However, we will insist that, before the Government are formed, prior to taking office there will be agreement on certain basic parameters.  There will have to be negotiated agreement on a limit to Exchequer borrowing for each year and an agreement that there will be a balanced current <Col N="1600" /> budget over a ten year period so that we can get our debt-GNP ratio down to 60 per cent which we must do, as all Members know, if we are to participate in a single European currency.</P>
    <P>I am also determined that there will be explicit agreement prior to the formation of a government in the next Dáil that taxation will not be allowed to exceed its present proportion of GNP.  Basic budgetary policy must be agreed in advance of the formation of the Government in the next Dáil &mdash; and it will be.</P>

      <P>There is no area in which the Government have shown a greater lack of any sense of collective purpose than in their response to the growing crisis of unemployment.  They do not have a job strategy, they do not even have a Minister taking overall responsibility for employment.  They rejected dismissively the suggestion of an all-party forum on jobs put forward by the Fine Gael Party during the summer and supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  However, in dismissing that they do not have a policy of their own.  I am determined that the Government to be elected in the 27th Dáil will resolutely tackle Ireland's chronic unemployment problem.  My party have already started work on a jobs Bill designed in one, comprehensive overall measure to clear the blockages to job creation right across our social system in areas like taxation, social insurance, labour law, rent policy, means tests and sectoral policies.</P>

      <P>Our aim is to have one comprehensive measure which can be put into effect in the first three months of a new administration in a new Dáil.  In the next Dáil we will also ensure that all Members can play a constructive role in helping to solve our jobs crisis.  We will establish an all-party jobs forum to work with the social partners, something which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have refused to countenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> The Government have no policy on how Europe should develop.  The Taoiseach going to Europe is like somebody going to a meeting with the notice and agenda in his pocket and no proposals to make.  Ireland is no more than a passive bystander in the debates being conducted by other countries about the future of Europe.  Ireland is simply waiting under the Government for something to emerge so that it can agree or disagree because it has no policy of its own.  It is my aim, however, that in the 27th Dáil a Government will be elected who will be committed to a clear, explicit and well understood policy on Europe.  It will, I hope, be a Government committed to the creation of a federal Europe, but it will also be committed to the radical reform of European institutions in order to protect small nations in a democratic way through the establishment of an elected European Senate with equal representation for all states similar to that in other federal democracies like the United States of America.  It will be a Government explicitly committed to a social Europe and not just to a free trade area. It will stand for a Europe in which Ireland will give a lead in matters like aid for the Third World rather than be the worst in the OECD, as we are under the present Government.  It will also stand for a Europe in which there will be no hiding place for terrorists.  I want to see a Government in this State fully committed to effective extradition throughout Europe where political motives will never excuse violent crime.  I do not believe we have such a Government today.</P>
    <P>I am also determined that in the next Dáil we will have a Government that behave in a collectively responsible way, unlike this Government, and in full accord with the provisions of the Constitution in that matter.  We do not have such a Government now.  The present Government have not honoured the provisions of collective responsibility as far as the Constitution is concerned.  In the past two days some of their members have talked about standing aside from Cabinet decisions in regard to the sacking <Col N="1603" /> of junior Ministers.  Was there ever a more eloquent expression of a lack of commitment to collective responsibility than the statement by the Minister for Energy that he was not going to participate in a particular Cabinet decision? Is he and his party part of the Government or not?</P>

      <P>I have been consistently interrupted and I would ask you to allow me to complete my speech.  It is my intention that the next Dáil will elect a Government that will adhere strictly to the sound principle of collective responsibility. I hope that the next Government will not continue the luxury of rival internal press offices, financed by the taxpayer and briefing against one another and against individual Ministers.  It is my intention that the next Government will conduct their business in Cabinet, with proper minutes and proper accountability, rather than in the private home of the Taoiseach or any other Minister.  It is my intention that the next Government will respect the independence and integrity of the office of the Minister for Finance. No financial commitments will be entered into that do not have his or her consent or the authority of a prior Government decision.  The next Dáil will end for good the aberration of personal Government that we have seen for the last four years, and for the last two years with the aid of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Dáil will not operate on the basis of inner circles or evasive answers. It is my intention that the Government in the next Dáil will establish a comprehensive committee system in which every member of Government will be answerable and every Member of this House will have a constructive voice.  If, for example, the privatisation of a State company is being contemplated, each step along the road will be explained by Ministers to a committee of this House <Col N="1604" /> and not decided in the Taoiseach's home. Decisions by Ministers to appoint consultants will be taken on the basis of open tender, not on the basis of private conversations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is obviously as sad as it is unprecedented and it warrants a certain amount of reflection.  In the course of the debate in this House yesterday some remarks were made in relation to the difficulties experienced by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garrett FitzGerald, in the Cabinet reshuffle of 1986.  Those remarks were accompanied by a certain amount of preening and boasting about the quality of the exercise carried out yesterday.  I imagine that the Minister for Justice, if he comes into the House today, may well be in a position to withdraw some of the remarks he made yesterday, particularly the boastful remarks which were totally unhelpful.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice was not the only one to make remarks yesterday that were unhelpful.  A number of statements were made in this House and a number of inferences drawn about the character of a Member of the House that simply do not stand up to critical examination. Remarks that described that Member, Deputy McDaid, as a fellow-traveller and that implied he would give away secrets to the Provos if he were appointed to the Cabinet were unworthy of the people who made them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that they too, if the opportunity arises today, will wish to <Col N="1607" /> retract those remarks.  This House can on occasion, as we have just witnessed, be a rough place.  It is a Chamber where tough questioning and political charge and counter-charge have their legitimate place.  I have never felt constrained personally to draw back from trenchant criticism where I felt it was necessary and I know very few Members of the House who would, or should, feel so constrained.</P>
      <P>We all have to be very careful about the inferences we draw about the character and honour of the people we are criticising.  To draw attention to the involvement of Deputy McDaid in the James Pius Clarke case was legitimate and perhaps necessary; to question him closely and give him the opportunity to reply was desirable, but the explicit accusations that were levelled against him were not based on any detailed examination of his track record.  He was in effect tried, condemned, and executed on the basis of one incident, an incident that ran counter to his general public position as far as we can tell.  I wonder how many Members on all sides of this House could withstand that sort of campaign if it were based on one incident in which any of us were involved.</P>
      <P>In short, I have to say that the honour of this House was somewhat besmirched by what happened here yesterday.  It was redeemed somewhat by the dignified and creditable way in which Deputy McDaid responded to the accusations against him and withdrew his name last night.  I, for one believed him when he spoke in this House last night, as I believe most of the Irish people will, and particularly when he said that he wanted only to act in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was among those critical of his appointment yesterday.  My criticisms were based primarily on his inexperience, and on the wisdom of appointing anyone with so little experience to so sensitive a post.  I believe, as I said yesterday, that his appointment was a foolish and dangerous one; but I do not, however, subscribe to the notion that the honour of any individual is fair game.  That <Col N="1608" /> approach sadly turns politics into a very nasty game.</P>
    <P>On the morning after one of the most brutal and vicious nights of slaughter that the North of Ireland has seen for many years, we cannot afford to be playing games here.  I know that Deputy James McDaid was as horrified as every Member of this House was at the news from the North last night.  I know and believe that he would do everything in his power, as every other Member of this House would, to bring the murderers involved in last nights awful atrocities to justice.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, I believe that many Members on all sides of this House will have cause to regret what happened yesterday.  I hope that no one regrets it more than the Taoiseach.  Criticism of the Taoiseach is, I believe, a different proposition.  In this case there is a long track record to examine, a long series of questions that still remain to be answered, and a number of inferences that must be drawn from his actions and even from his silences on occasions. Deputy McDaid will, I hope, recover from the events of yesterday, and indeed his family likewise.  The Taoiseach, I believe, does not deserve to recover from the incidents of yesterday.  He has shown the most incredible contempt for his own party in the planning of this reshuffle, and in his contempt he has failed to take even the slightest account of the sensitivity of the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a well established precedent in this House, and a tradition that exists for very good reason, that Deputies from the Border counties are not normally appointed to this sensitive office.  Any such Deputy becomes intensely vulnerable and is placed at personal risk by trying to occupy either of the security portfolios and to function as a Dáil representative at the same time. In addition, it has to be said that the Taoiseach either knew or should have known about the Clarke incident.  He knew, or should have known, about the perceptions that would be created by Deputy McDaid's appointment and the way in which it would be used by people <Col N="1609" /> who are totally inimical to Ireland and our interests.  Not only was the involvement yesterday of Ivor Stanbrook and Jim Kilfedder and others in the controversy at an early hour somewhat nauseating, it was also entirely predictable. Clearly, if the Taoiseach was anxious to show preferment to Deputy McDaid, as he was entitled to do, he should have been appointed to a less sensitive position. The Taoiseach's track record in relation to such appointments is unfortunately suspect and demonstrates a total lack of sensitivity to the country's needs. This latest fiasco is one for which the Taoiseach himself must carry total responsibility.  As I said yesterday in the course of my speech I now say again that the Taoiseach must consider his own position as Taoiseach of this country.</P>
    <P>Another issue to be considered, which should be considered this morning if either the Fianna Fáil Party or the Cabinet are meeting is the question of the Taoiseach's prime constitutional authority in this State.  It appears to me that the Taoiseach has abandoned this to the Progressive Democrats; and perhaps the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, will speak on the role he played in yesterday's selection and proposed appointments.  Is the Taoiseach able to stand up in this House and say that he is still a Taoiseach with authority? Has he abandoned the substance of that office to hold on to the vestiges of power?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was arrogant yesterday and has shown gross misjudgment and insensitivity and therefore he must consider very seriously his position.  The Taoiseach was given, it would appear, a temporary lease of life in relation to his position by the events of the parliamentary party meeting last weekend. There was an assumption &mdash; and members of his party were saying &mdash; that he, the Taoiseach would go in his own good time.  However, once the indication is given and this statement is made, I question whether a man can retain authority to run the State at a time when the State needs authority, perhaps more than <Col N="1610" /> ever before.  I hope that Deputy O'Malley, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, will take the opportunity to come before his House to explain to us his involvement in the nominations of yesterday. From my observation, Deputy O'Malley's role in yesterday's affair certainly represents a considerable stain on his record in this House.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the events of last weekend would bring a new era to politics. We have had a number of rough weeks both inside and outside Dáil Éireann, but I am afraid that as long as Deputy Haughey is Taoiseach that is not going to happen.  It would appear that Fianna Fáil Deputies have made their decision by a considerable majority last weekend, but one wonders if the question were on the agenda this morning whether they would decide likewise.  Indeed, it is not for me or any party other than Fianna Fáil to advise as to what they need to do. However, I would say it is very obvious at this stage what needs to be done.  The events of yesterday have brought this House to a new low and we are in an unprecedented situation.  People must be asking themselves what authority has a Taoiseach who at 10.30 a.m. seeks to nominate Members to Cabinet and by 9 p.m. that evening has to come before this House to withdraw those nominations. The Taoiseach must and should, together with his Cabinet colleagues, consider his own position.</P>

      <P>It would be wrong and unthinkable to begin my contribution to this debate other than with a total and utter condemnation of the murderous attacks carried out in Belfast last night by the Provisional IRA which left four men dead and one young child seriously injured.  Most of us believed that over the past two decades the Provisional IRA had gone as low as possible, but we have seen them plumb new depths during the past few weeks; a bomb attack on a hospital and last night's mass sectarian murder.  What sort of organisation sees the sick and injured as legitimate <Col N="1611" /> targets?  What type of organisation is prepared to shoot and seriously injure an infant girl of just a few weeks old?</P>
      <P>The Provisional IRA have long ago abandoned any pretence of being anything other than a sectarian murder gang. Their campaign has nothing to do with the unity of this island or of its people. The majority of their victims are Irish people.  Indeed, the Provisional IRA have now killed more Irish people than the despised Black and Tans.  Ritual condemnations of the Provisional IRA are no longer enough.  It is not enough to condemn individual Provo atrocities and then ignore the source of the problem until the next outrage.  Society must take a stronger stand.  The Provos in their military and political forms must be challenged and confronted at every opportunity &mdash; on local authorities, the work place, the trade union movement, residents associations, sporting groups, in the pubs and on the streets and in the courts.  Individually and collectively we must &mdash; this is a particular obligation on Members of this House &mdash; make it clear that as long as the Provos continue with their murderous activity, their members and those who act as supporters or apologists will be shunned and ostracised by all democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background that the controversy surrounding the Taoiseach's attempt to nominate Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence must be viewed.  I was the first Deputy to raise the matter in this House yesterday and I stand over everything I said and I make no apology what so ever for doing so.  I accept Deputy McDaid's statement that he deplores the campaign of the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland but I have to put it to him that his enthusiastic involvement in the campaign of James Pius Clarke to evade extradition did not give that message.  I have heard Deputy McDaid and other Fianna Fáil Deputies protest the innocence of Mr. Clarke.  I am not sure whether they were saying he was innocent of the ten counts of attempted murder and wounding with intent to do grevious bodily harm, and <Col N="1612" /> the possession of firearms with intent to endanger life, for which he was sentenced to 18, 15 and 14 years to run concurrently in prison; or were they saying he was innocent of involvement in the mass breakout of Provo prisoners from the Maze Prison in 1983, during which a warder was murdered; or were they saying he was innocent when he was arrested in the Republic in December 1984 and charged with hijacking a car following a Provo gun attack on the Border which resulted in the deaths of three people?  Or are they suggesting that Mr. Clarke was innocent of attempting with other top Provisional IRA prisoners to blast and shoot his way out of Portlaoise Prison in 1985&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a dark day for civil liberties in this country when a respectable member of the community and a Deputy of this House who along with members of all parties champions the innocence of an accused person subsequently released by the Supreme Court, is attacked as virulently as Deputy McDaid was yesterday.</P>

      <P>They simply did not decide on the innocence of Mr. Clarke in the Supreme Court.  What they decided &mdash; for a number of legal reasons <Col N="1613" /> not related to the guilt of Mr. Clarke or, indeed, his innocence &mdash; was that he should not be extradited.  So the Taoiseach, rather than clearing up the situation here today, is in fact muddying the waters.</P>
      <P>Just as Deputy McDaid recognised that his taking office as Minister for Defence would damage the country, it is my view that Deputy Haughey should also recognise the fact that his continued position as Taoiseach of this country is damaging the country and that the kind of statement heard in the Dáil today does nothing to reassure anybody inside or outside this House.</P>
      <P>Mr. Clarke was over a long period of time actively involved in Provisional IRA activity.  He participated in the Provisional IRA structure in Portlaoise jail. It is against that background that the involvement of a Minister for Defence designate has to be viewed.</P>

      <P>I accept that it is quite legitimate for any TD to express concern about the legal rights of any person whose extradition is sought from this State.  I also accept that other members of Donegal County Council were concerned about the possible extradition of Mr. Clarke, but the other members of Donegal County Council did not come down to the Four Courts and join with the Provo mob in celebrating the release of Mr. Clarke.  Given the continuing murderous events in Northern Ireland, there is an obligation on public representatives to ensure that they are not used in any way as part of any Provo propaganda campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as Deputy McDaid was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that I had a case in Dublin North-West in which Mr. Ellis was being sought to be extradited.  I refused &mdash; as indeed did Deputy Tunney, who sits on the Fianna Fáil benches, <Col N="1614" />&mdash; to be drawn into that campaign and refused to accept that we should be involved in any way in a Provo propaganda campaign which sought to undermine the legitimate law of this State in relation to extradition.</P>
    <P>At best, Deputy McDaid showed a major error of judgment.  His appointment as Minister for Defence would have damaged the Government and would, as I said yesterday, have sent entirely wrong signals to the victims of the violence in Northern Ireland.  I welcome the fact that Deputy McDaid decided to withdraw his name last night.  By doing so he has saved the country from enormous international embarrassment and potential damage.  I acknowledge the personal sacrifice he has made in doing so.</P>
    <P>This whole debacle has thrown the judgment of the Taoiseach into question once again, however.  When he nominated Deputy McDaid, did he know of the Deputy's involvement with the Clarke case?  Did he not consider that that was important?  Did he not give any consideration to the way in which the appointment would be viewed in Northern Ireland and in Britain, or does he regard that as unimportant?</P>
    <P>For a Minister designate to have to withdraw even before his nomination is voted on by the Dáil is unprecedented. Deputy Haughey was being hailed after the week-end as a masterful parliamentary tactician.  Yesterday's events show that the Fianna Fáil hero of the weekend has feet of clay.  His record of own goals and fatal errors of judgment is unprecedented in Irish politics.</P>
    <P>The rejection of Deputy McDaid is a rejection of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach. Just as Deputy McDaid recognised that his taking office as Minister for Defence would damage the country, Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, should also recognise that his clinging to power as Taoiseach is contrary to the national interest.  His latest contribution to public life should now be to resign as Taoiseach and to make way for a successor who, if he will not have the confidence of all of the Members of the Dáil &mdash; which would be highly unlikely &mdash; would at least have <Col N="1615" /> the confidence of the Members of his own party.</P>

      <P>What do the events of yesterday say about the Progressive Democrats?  Deputy O'Malley has some explaining to do to this House.  When he spoke yesterday I invited him to comment on the suitability of Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence.  He refused point blank to do so.  He made no reference whatsoever to either Deputy McDaid or Deputy Davern.  I am sure that Deputy O'Malley will speak in the debate again today and again I invite him to answer some questions.  Was Deputy O'Malley consulted in advance by the Taoiseach about the nomination of Deputy McDaid?  Did he approve of the nomination? Did he know about Deputy McDaid's involvement in the Clarke case when he spoke with the Taoiseach?  Was it that he knew about the case but was prepared to turn a blind eye to it in the hope that it would not be raised in the debate?  Was it only when the matter was raised by me and subsequently taken up by other Deputies that it became a matter of embarrassment for the Progressive Democrats?  Why did neither Deputy O'Malley nor Deputy Quill, who also spoke for the Progressive Democrats, have nothing to say to the Dáil yesterday about it?</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats are supposed to be advocates of open government, yet they effectively ignore the House on virtually all major issues and conduct their business with Fianna Fáil behind the closed doors of the party rooms.  The Progressive Democrats in fact have no clothes left.  The only bond holding this Coalition Government together is the wish to self-preservation, and even that is not likely to be strong enough to save it from coming apart at the seams in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Dáil who raised very legitimate questions yesterday about the suitability of Deputy McDaid for the position of Minister for Defence have <Col N="1616" /> been vilified by Fianna Fáil Deputies and have been criticised by some news media commentators, but what the Dáil was doing yesterday was the job for which Deputies are elected.  We are required to approve the nomination of Members to Cabinet.  Imagine the public and news media criticism there would have been had we failed to raise the Clarke case and had Deputy McDaid's nomination been nodded through and gone on to create a major source of embarrassment for the Government and the country.  We are constantly accused here of being a cosy club, a sham where there are no real differences and where issues are generally papered over.  Then when we raise issues of real concern about who forms a Government we are told that we are being childish, that we are being unparliamentary and that we have no right to raise matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I did not raise any question in relation to the integrity of Deputy McDaid yesterday. I questioned his suitability as a person to run the Ministry of Defence.  I stand over that and I think I have been vindicated in the events that have since taken place.  However, I do not agree with all that was said yesterday by some Deputies here on this side of the House in relation to Deputy McDaid.  I particularly regret the statement that there might be the possibility that sensitive information could get into the wrong hands if Deputy McDaid was in Government.  I do not accept that at all.  I do not accept any attacks on the integrity of Deputy McDaid as a person.  Nonetheless I do not accept that he would have been a suitable person to have filled the sensitive post of Minister for Defence in view of the matters I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Neither do I accept that the Taoiseach should come into this House in pained, injured dignity and talk about the way the standards of this House have been lowered.  It was the Taoiseach himself who at the very beginning of the confidence debate in this House, when this session began, launched a smear attack on my party, and on me, backed up by the Minister for Justice, largely based on <Col N="1617" /> Provo propaganda, in attempts to undermine the case we were making for clean Government in this country and proper ethics to be established in the relationships between business and politics.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is the author of his own misfortune in that regard.  I refuse to accept any lecture from him about how matters should be conducted in this House.  In that debate the Taoiseach came into this House and, off the cuff, implied that I had had a meeting with a person whom he described as the chief of staff of the Official IRA and that Deputy Rabbitte had done likewise.  The Taoiseach has never withdrawn that allegation, has never brought any information onto the floor of this House either to support or deny it.  I have invited him to take whatever information is available to him to the Garda, telling him that I would co-operate in any way I can with the Garda to clear up that matter.  I am still waiting for him either to come into the House or to furnish the Garda with whatever information he has at his disposal.</P>
    <P>What is more sinister is that the Government Press Secretary has gone around this House touting the name of a man outside this House, an innocent man, who has never had any connection whatsoever with paramilitary organisations as the chief of staff of the Official IRA.  It is that kind of sinister undermining of Irish politics for which the Taoiseach is responsible.  I have no doubt that history will condemn him as the appalling hamfisted, clay-footed Leader of this State over the past ten years.</P>

      <P>Again today we have witnessed, as we have in recent weeks and particularly since August last, repeated attempts by Fine Gael in particular, and the Labour Party, to destabilise Government in any way possible, to drive a wedge between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, to undermine the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have seen a new low standard from the benches opposite over the past couple of days.</P>
      <P>The Government are now in a very strong position.  We have a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> we have negotiated a new Programme for Government with the Progressive Democrats and are committed to a vigorous programme with our social partners.  The Taoiseach has gone for a substantial reshuffle and rejuvenation of his Government at this time. He has looked imaginatively at the second half of the term of his Government &mdash; the two and a half years remaining &mdash; and introduced changes designed to implement the Programme for Government drawn up in conjunction with our colleagues in Government, the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the overall position one will find the Government set for a vigorous approach to the second half of their term of office.  It is no wonder that Deputy John Bruton, in particular, feels he must do his utmost to undermine the Government, to cause dissension and confusion among the ranks in his almost mad quest for power at this stage.  At first, this might have appeared somewhat funny, or even irrelevant, but this mania of his has become almost dangerous.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> Yesterday's scurrilous attack by a number of Members on the Opposition benches, Fine Gael in particular, the attempted character assassination of Deputy McDaid, was the lowest level they reached in this campaign.  It was a very sad day to witness the way in which Members concerned, particularly Deputies John Bruton, Noonan and Taylor-Quinn scurrilously and scandalously attacked and made allegations about a very fine Deputy, Deputy McDaid.  Deputy McDaid is a very honourable, respected person, one who has had to stand up to the pressures of the Provos and the IRA, who has repeatedly come out and stated his position in relation to them and their heinous attacks, their abhorrent campaign of violence. In political terms Deputy McDaid is a young, articulate, professional person, a person who can, and I believe will in the future, make a significant contribution to this country through his membership of Dáil Éireann and through the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I am very happy that Deputy Spring has dissociated himself from many of the remarks made yesterday.  In fairness to Deputy De Rossa, I should say he attempted to do likewise at the end of his contribution, to withdraw from any imputation of a lack of integrity and from the specific allegations levelled against Deputy McDaid who is a person of great honour and integrity.  I am very glad they did so because, in so doing, they have restored the honour of this House to some extent; to some extent they have lessened the damage done to a very honourable Deputy yesterday and, to some extent, redeemed themselves and their parties in these very sad circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton is very anxious to get into Government at present, to get his hands on the power of Government, but I predict he will be sitting over there watching the position for quite some time to come.  In his recent speeches he has been anticipating circumstances in which he will be in Government and will have the opportunity to exercise his authority to the fullest possible extent.  I dread that day, having listened to Deputy John Bruton over the past couple of months.  I know that, from his behaviour and that of some of his colleagues on the other side of the House, we will all be found guilty by association, whether it be in business, as we witnessed in regard to many recent incidents, in relation to the exercise of civil liberties, or in personal relationships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I predict people will fear the day, if it ever arises, when Deputy Bruton is in Government.  That is what sprang to mind when I listened to the further harangue in which he engaged here this morning.  Hopefully such circumstances will not arise for a very long time and, possibly, not at all.  The Government are determined to continue the Programme for Government agreed with the Progressive Democrats, to put that programme into operation, to overcome many of the obstacles in the way of its implementation and get on with the job expeditiously and effectively.  A number of Ministers have moved to new portfolios, including myself.  I welcome the appointment of the two new Ministers <Col N="1621" /> and of the new Ministers of State, Deputies John O'Donoghue; Michael Kitt and Dermot Ahern.  I regret that Deputies Reynolds and Flynn and Deputies Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, Noel Treacy and Michael Smith are no longer directly involved with us, other than through the parliamentary party. Deputies Reynolds and Flynn particularly have made a very substantial contribution through their ministries.  This will be fully recognised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new portfolio which has been allocated to me.  I regard it as a very great privilege to be involved in one of the oldest Departments of State and one which covers such a wide band of the economy and so many people.  I have greatly enjoyed working in the Department of Social Welfare and with the staff there.  The civil servants in that Department are of the highest standard and will continue to do an excellent job.  It has been a privilege for me to work with them in the development of the work of the Department over the years.  I thank Deputies who have supported me in that work through suggestions and contributions in this House.</P>
      <P>I face into a new Department at a very difficult time.  Negotiations at EC level are of prime importance and will take a major part of the Department's attention in the current circumstances.  The whole question of intervention and its control has also come very much to light in recent times and will require a great deal of attention.  I am interested too in development. I will be particularly interested to see a development plan for the Department for the future.  I see the need to develop at two levels in parallel.  We must tackle major issues at EC level, reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy and the control issues which are involved in intervention, but at the same time it is vital that there be a development arm in the Department.  This I will be discussing with the officials in the first instance and I will be giving attention to it as I progress in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> I am also concerned about the small and not so small farmers who are having a particularly difficult time.  They will require special attention.  We have gone some way towards setting up pilot studies in the application of the family income supplement scheme to farmers and I will continue, in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, to develop those pilot studies.</P>
    <P>Education and research in all fields of agriculture are crucial.  I should like to see a Department driven by marketing, research and technology.  We have some of the finest technology in the world, particularly in agriculture.  It is important that this technology be related to marketing strategies and objectives to give a new drive to those sectors of agriculture which have the greatest potential in the current circumstances.  I also welcome the opportunity to participate in the LEADER programme which is creating such interest and into which businesses and communities have put so much time and effort.  It can be very fruitful in setting future directions in the broad area of integrated rural development.</P>
    <P>I regard the farming organisations as having a central role to play and I plan to communicate with them, to meet them and to join with them in developing agriculture to its utmost.  Contrary to the view held by some, there is considerable scope for the development of agriculture in its widest sense, recognising the vital contribution which the major elements of agriculture make to our economy and our people and the crucial need to protect those in the proposed reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy.  People in urban and rural areas do not realise sufficiently our dependence on agriculture and on agriculture-related industries, ranging from transport and storage to food processing, packaging and so on.</P>
    <P>I see an interesting, stimulating and exciting challenge for the future and I look forward to tackling the job in that Department.  I wish the other Ministers every success in their new portfolios.  I congratulate the new junior Ministers and wish them well in the responsibilities they are undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had in recent weeks and months a type and style of Government that has produced unprecedented insecurity and scandal.  The unprecedented events of yesterday in the proposed appointment of Deputy McDaid to the Department of Defence show a serious lack of judgment on the part of the Taoiseach.  It was the constitutional duty of the Fine Gael Party as the main Opposition party to bring to the attention of this House the concerns we had with that appointment.  We make no excuse for performing our constitutional duties yesterday in setting out those concerns.  I do not want to rake over the coals of the debate which took place yesterday.  Suffice it to say that it is my view, and that of the Fine Gael Party, that a Member of this House has no business associating with a member of the IRA and has no business being used by the Provisional IRA in campaigns against extradition.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made the extraordinary comment in the Dáil today that all Deputy McDaid was doing was acting as the champion of the innocence of an accused person, that he was seeking to help Mr. Clarke in making the case that he was innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted.  By implication this suggests that James Pius Clarke was not a member of the IRA.  James Pius Clarke was a member of the IRA and was not only convicted of attempted murder in Northern Ireland in 1979 but also convicted within this jurisdiction.  A car chase took place through County Donegal which resulted in his being sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in April 1985 when he was pursued by the Garda Síochána. In November 1985 James Pius Clarke was part of an IRA group who attempted a mass breakout from Portlaoise prison and was subsequently sentenced to three years imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>James Pius Clarke was not found by <Col N="1624" /> our Supreme Court to be innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted.  I want to quote from the <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly</i>, volume 10 of 1990, which states:</P>
    <P>The appellant was arrested on 26 March 1978, in Northern Ireland, and was charged with attempted murder and a number of other offences arising out of an armed raid carried out by a number of men on the home of a family called Harper in Castlederg, in County Tyrone on 2 February 1977.</P>
    <P>Whilst in the custody of the RUC on 27 March 1978, he made a statement, which he signed, admitting his participation in the raid, and identifying the type of weapon which he used and the part in the raid which he took, which consisted of firing at a car that arrived into the farmyard during the raid.  Some of the details contained in this statement were at his subsequent trial corroborated in part by forensic evidence, though such evidence did not afford proof of the appellant's participation in the raid.</P>
    <P>He was tried before His Honour Judge Russell at the Crown Court in Belfast, sitting without a jury, and he was represented at the trial by a solicitor and by junior and queen's counsel. From the judgment of Russell J. which was exhibited in the High Court, it is clear that no challenge was made to the admissibility of the appellant's statement, or to the method by which it had been obtained.  The appellant did not give any evidence nor tender any evidence on his behalf.  He was convicted of a number of offences and sentenced on 1 June 1979 to a number of different concurrent terms of imprisonment, the longest of which was eighteen years.</P>
    <P>I should state that, according to the law report of that time, he was sentenced on ten counts of attempted murder.  The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Although the appellant now denies guilt for the offences of which he was convicted, the only explanation given <Col N="1625" /> by him for his failure to give evidence either with regard to the admissibility of the statement or to the main issue of guilt or innocence, is that he did not think he would be believed.</P>
    <P>It was established by the respondent in the High Court that in Northern Ireland law the most ample rights of appeal exist from the findings of a Crown Court in which an accused is tried on a criminal charge by a judge sitting without a jury.</P>
    <P>They include a right of appeal without any leave to the Court of Appeal on any question of law and a right of appeal, with the leave of the court, on questions of fact or on mixed questions of fact and law.  The Court of Appeal has in any appeal before it wide-ranging powers in the interests of justice, at its discretion, to admit fresh evidence.</P>
    <P>James Pius Clarke did not seek to appeal his conviction.  The Supreme Court held in the judgment it delivered that that conviction stood.  The only reason James Pius Clarke was not extradited to the North was due to the fact that some of those who had previously escaped from the Maze Prison and been returned to that prison had been subjected to violence at the hands of prison warders. Because of the fear that he could be subjected to such violence he was not extradited.  The refusal to extradite James Pius Clarke was not a refusal based on establishing that he was an innocent man.  It was not a refusal based on saying that he had not participated in the raid for which he had been convicted.  It was not a refusal based on saying that he was not guilty of the counts of attempted murder for which he had been convicted. It is a bit much for the Taoiseach to come into this House today and say that all Deputy McDaid did was champion the innocence of an accused man.  James Pius Clarke not only stands accused but stands guilty of the offences for which he was convicted not just in Northern Ireland but also in this State.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat disingenuous for the Leader of the Labour Party to suggest that Members on this side of the House <Col N="1626" /> should not have raised that issue yesterday in the context of Deputy McDaid's unfortunate attempted appointment to the Department of Defence.  Deputy Spring more than anyone else, having been a member of a previous Government, knows the implications and the seriousness of that particular position.</P>

    <P>What took place in this House yesterday in the context of the debate in which the House was asked to confirm or deny confirmation of the appointment of a Member of this House as Minister for <Col N="1627" /> Defence was quite appropriate.  It is only fair to say that Deputy McDaid was right to withdraw his name from that appointment. By so doing he saved not just this House but this State from considerable international embarrassment.  Suffice to say that I do not think there is any need to address this issue further.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the general behaviour of the Government.  The picture painted of the Government &mdash; this picture is popularly painted by some Members of this House &mdash; depicts Fianna Fáil as the bad guys and the Progressive Democrats as the good guys, similar to the old style cowboy movies with the Progressive Democrats galloping over the horizon wearing their white hats putting manners on the Fianna Fáil Party. The Progressive Democrats are as much a part and cause of the current insecurity in Government as the Fianna Fáil Party. The Progressive Democrats seem to be fine in Government not in preventing messes but in attempting to tidy up messes after they have happened.</P>
    <P>In relation to the various scandals which have taken place, the main role of the Progressive Democrats seems to be to investigate what happened after the event rather than ensuring that the event does not take place in the first instance. As a party, they have a unique contribution to make in closing stable doors after the horses have bolted.  Deputy O'Malley's performance yesterday was a classic example of that.  Having been informed the night before of the new members to be appointed to the Government it was in or around 6 p.m. yesterday evening when he suddenly realised that there were problems and reversed the approach he had taken in this House some two hours earlier.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats seem to stand over the sort of shoddy political performance we get from the Government Press Secretary.  Yesterday the Taoiseach was very evasive with regard to the role of the Government Press Secretary, a political appointee whose basic role in life is to act as the political hitman for the Taoiseach, lashing out if <Col N="1628" /> not spreading unfounded rumours about members of the Opposition such as Deputy Spring and members of his Government.</P>
    <P>The style and standard of politics which the Government led by the Taoiseach have brought to this House is a style and standard of politics which this country can do without.  The attempt by the Progressive Democrats to distance themselves and apply a sort of political Teflon factor to their involvement in Government is no longer taken seriously by the vast majority of people.  It is in the interests of the country that the Government recognise that they should leave office.  The Fine Gael Party can well provide an alternative Government.  We may have lost 20 seats in the election in 1987 but there is no reason we cannot regain those seats in the election which I believe should take place in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Apart from the uncertainty, the insecurity and the scandals there are two very profound reasons why the Government should go. They have presided over an extraordinary jobs crisis with 260,000 people unemployed and a prediction that the unemployment rate may reach 325,000.  They are refusing to take a very basic initiative of establishing a jobs forum which is widely called for and which would allow the best brains in the country and Members of this House to come together to tackle the jobs crisis. So far as the Government are concerned it is a crisis to be ignored and they are not willing to face up to it.  Racked by scandals, insecurity and internal political division they are incapable of confronting the problem.</P>
    <P>In the context of Northern Ireland the Government sit back and watch the murder and mayhem take place.  I wish to join with other speakers, Deputy De Rossa in particular, who mentioned the atrocious murders committed in Northern Ireland last night.  They are horrifying because of the number of raids that took place and the number of people killed on one night but are typical of what has been happening in the North and indicate the incapacity of this Government to take the <Col N="1629" /> initiative; things are just drifting.  They have no suggestions, no policies.  They are not willing to take any initiatives.  We have got to tackle the jobs crisis.  We have got to put an end to the violence on this island and provide a framework to allow the two communities within Northern Ireland to come together and isolate the men of violence.  That cannot and will not happen while the Government are in office.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the reshuffle by the Taoiseach will in any way change the approach of this Government.  Indeed, this Government, in the light of the events of the last 24 hours, are now in terminal decline.  We are seeing the death throes of the 26th Dáil.  It is in the interests of this country that the electorate at this time be given an opportunity to elect an alternative Government.  Fine Gael can credibly and properly provide that alternative.  I do not believe the motion before the House should be supported.</P>

      <P>Within the eight minutes at my disposal I will concentrate on one dimension.  There has been, and always will be among Members of any House of Parliament a great resolve in procedures and rules to deal with the issue of misrepresentation of Members.  None of us like being misrepresented.  However, while it may be acceptable and democratic to deal with misrepresentation there has been no thought, no planning or promotion with regard to under representation. I am referring to lack of representation of the rights, the interests and the issues of women in this House. Women's representation was poor enough before this reshuffle but at least we had a Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who had responsibility for women's affairs.  She had to deal with women's affairs along with a very crowded portfolio.  I wish to pay tribute to her for the commitment she showed as chairwoman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and to women's issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House of the competence she displayed and her <Col N="1630" /> genuine commitment to our integration into Europe.  I pay tribute to her for her contribution during Ireland's EC Presidency. Her position was marginalised and, as usual, she was the woman behind the scenes responsible for organisation but was not brought to the front line to receive the bouquets.  This raises a fundamental point.  The Government, having abolished the section for women's affairs &mdash; one of their first decisions &mdash; have now abolished the post of Minister of State for Women's Affairs.  With the women of the country I contend that the least we should have, considering the under representation of women in this House, is a senior woman Minister. There has not been a hint as to who may or may not take up the responsibility for women's affairs after the reshuffle.</P>
    <P>I am not talking of minorities although what we do to the majority of women in Ireland is similar to what we do to minorities.  More than 50 per cent of our population are women.  They keep this country going mostly in an unpaid, voluntary and unvalued way.  We hear of commitments and lip service is paid to programmes for the rightful demands of women.  One of the latest is contained in the recommendations in the interim report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The Taoiseach took great pride in stating on many occasions that not alone did he set up the First Commission on the Status of Women but he also established the second commission. One of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, who reported early this year, was:</P>
    <P>As the boards of State-sponsored bodies are reconstituted or set up Government policy should guarantee a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the direct Government nominees.</P>
    <P>Not only have the Government reneged on that recommendation with regard to their nominees and made no effort to increase it but they have decreased it. The position of women in the Parliament and at decision-making level, is now <Col N="1631" /> worse than before the reshuffle, although the Taoiseach pledged to accept that recommendation and others when that report was presented to him.  It was a sham, it was cynical and it raised expectations that were dashed without even a thought.  Other speakers are dealing with other aspects of what the Taoiseach did and did not do.  The Taoiseach in the reshuffle did not honour national and international commitments to the United Nations, the Interparliamentary Union and to the women of this country.  I hope the women of the country will recognise what has been done and remember that at the next election.  In that election which is on the horizon &mdash; they should bear in mind how this Government treated them and the women in this House.  They demoted a woman and abolished her position ignoring a recommendation by an outside commission and international commitments.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should tell us who is responsible for women's affairs in the Government.  Who will monitor progress &mdash; slow and painful as it is &mdash; in Departments, and on State boards?  We need that information so that we can present reports from Ireland at international conferences. There are international meetings at European level.  There is a preparatory conference for the United Nations Conference of 1995 and it seems that Ireland is not even part of that.  We either have full commitment or we get out.  The Government should stop fooling the women with regard to any commitment. I hope the Commission will take on board what has happened here today and will wonder how relevant the recommendations will be.</P>

      <P>Yesterday was a very sad day in this House.  An honourable Member of the House was vilified and his character was assassinated mainly by the Fine Gael Party.  Deputy Shatter said this morning that the Opposition had a constitutional duty and that they had fulfilled that duty in the House yesterday.  They went well beyond filling it in the manner in which <Col N="1632" /> they approached the position of the proposed new member of Government.  It is fair enough to examine a proposed new member, but to come in here and make unfounded allegations and accusations was wrong.  Now that Deputy Bruton is here, I would ask him if he has control of his own party.  Deputy Bruton made quite a lot of play about controlling his own party yesterday.  Does he stand over what was said here last night by Deputy Madeleine Taylor-Quinn?</P>

      <P>I was just asking Deputy Bruton if he stands over every word said here last night by Deputies Taylor-Quinn and Michael Noonan and if he believes that that is the correct way in which to treat a fellow Member of this House?  The vilification and character assassination cannot be substantiated at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an honour to be a Member of this House.  There are certain privileges in the House.  It is an abuse of privilege to say <Col N="1633" /> things here which cannot be substantiated and which are known to be untrue.  Deputies should not come in here and say those things unless they are prepared to say them outside the House. A lot of things were said about Deputy McDaid yesterday which could not be said outside of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter misrepresented the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach was not here to defend himself.  The Deputy then misrepresented Deputy Spring who contradicted him and pointed out how he was misrepresenting what Deputy Spring had said.  Deputy Spring distanced himself from the behaviour of Fine Gael yesterday and that was appropriate because no one would want to associate himself with the manner in which the Fine Gael Party behaved yesterday.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring questioned the Taoiseach's judgment in appointing a Deputy from a Border county as Minister for Defence.  There are precedents for this, as Deputy McGahon knows.  Deputies Pádraig Faulkner and Paddy Donegan were both Ministers for Defence from Border constituencies.  When talking about the principles that should apply to Deputy McDaid we should acknowledge that the same principles should apply to every other Member of the House, including the Taoiseach.  I was disappointed this morning to hear Deputy Spring say that a different set of rules applied to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach is equally entitled to fair play.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton this morning referred to what he would do if he were in government. The Deputy talked about setting up a committee system.  Because the Deputy is not in government and not in a position to turn the House upside down, the first thing he should do is consider how best the House could be used in the interests of the people.  Since the Dáil resumed in October we have had nothing but hype, innuendo and unsubstantiated accusations against Members of the House.  That does not do justice to Members of the House or to the people whom we were elected to represent.  We are spending too much time with the Government defending themselves <Col N="1634" /> against totally unsubstantiated allegations of a personal nature.  I have often said that I welcomed constructive criticism and constructive debate.  Before the debate got as acrimonious as it did yesterday I said that one of my regrets during my time in the Department of Health was the lack of constructive debate in this House on health services.  We all need to look at the health services and to have an in-depth discussion on them.  That is not what we had over the last four years.  I would have welcomed that.  Certainly for the last six weeks there has been very little constructive debate from the Opposition side on policies.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid is a very honourable man from a neighbouring Ulster county. The way he was vilified in here yesterday was a disgrace.  I hope it is the last time we will see that from Members of the House.  We are all here to do the best we can in representing the interests of the nation.  It is important not to abuse the privileges of the House.  Privileges were abused yesterday in the manner in which the debate progressed.</P>
    <P>This morning, Deputy Bruton talked about Northern Ireland policy.  If what Deputy Taylor-Quinn had to say last night is an indication of the type of justice that we can expect from the Fine Gael Party it will frighten the life out of both Nationalists and Unionists in the North. They would not want any part of it.</P>
    <P>We have debated financial policy often enough in the House.  The Government can be proud of their management of the finances over the last four years.  I do not have to remind the House that in 1987 we were on the verge of financial ruin and that the Government which came in made the decision to take the necessary action to deal effectively with the financial chaos that had been left by the Fine Gael-Labour Government.  The Taoiseach, more than anybody else in this House, was responsible for the economic miracle that occurred over the last four years in which our borrowing requirement was brought down from £2,100 million in 1986 to less than £400 million last year.  That is an indication of the progress that was made.  It is fair <Col N="1635" /> enough for Members opposite to be critical of all kinds of things but they should recognise the achievements, the economic stability, that has been brought about over the last four years.  We have had reductions in income tax, reductions in bank interest rates and a reduction in inflation all in the same four-year period.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Bruton this morning speaking about the need to control spending.  He referred to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and to funding.  One thing the Opposition and the nation can be sure of is that the Fianna Fáil Government will provide the money for public services and that there will be control of spending.  That has been the pattern of government since 1987 and that will continue.  There will be no free spending as there was from 1982 to 1987 when Fine Gael and Labour were in government.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Bruton speak about control of parties. He certainly has no control over his own party where finances are concerned.  He himself says we must be prudent in our spending and not spend money here and there.  However, day after day other Fine Gael Deputies come here recommending the spending of anything from £1 million to £10 million.  As Minister for Health I saw them coming in, three different Deputies on three different nights, all spending money and free-wheeling.  Fine Gael should get their act together and decide whether they would be a Government that would spend millions of pounds that are not there or a Government that would be prudent in the level of spending they would engage in when, if ever they get into government.  I do not see any sign of that happening for the remainder of this decade.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I dealt with some of the important achievements during my time in the Department of Health.  I am now pleased to welcome the opportunity to serve in the Department of the Environment. It is a great honour for any Deputy to serve the people of Ireland as a Minister in government.  It is a great honour for me to now move from the <Col N="1636" /> Department of Health to serve in another Department that makes a major impact on the provision of services to the public. I would see the Environment as being closely aligned to health.  In fact, originally the Department of Health was part of the old Department of Local Government and public health.  The Department of Health is a comparatively young Department having been established only in 1947.</P>
    <P>When I was in medical practice I always saw myself as being involved at the delivery side in a very small area of health, a highly technical area of curing and prevention.  I had, however, an interest in a much wider concept of health and saw the environment and the administration and management of the Department of the Environment as making a major contribution to health in this nation.  It is fair to say that it was environmental services, particularly the provision of good clean water and sanitary services, that made the greatest contribution to health in this country as they did in other countries around the world. As a member of the medical profession I can say with authority that one achievement, the provision of sanitary services and clean water has been the one achievement that has best served the public health.</P>
    <P>I am therefore particularly pleased to be going to the Department of the Environment. I would like to pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Flynn, who was Minister in that Department for the tremendous work that he did over the four years and the new developments that he brought about.  I look forward to continuing the work he was involved in and the developments he commenced.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises the increased amount of funding provided for roads and particularly the improvement of our national primary roads.  We have had a five year programme of water and sewage improvement which has a big impact on the quality of water&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The urban renewal <Col N="1637" /> schemes, including the development of the docks, is there as a monument to the achievements of this Government.  There is the social housing plan which puts emphasis on people helping themselves. I look forward to seeing that plan implemented.  There is the new planning Act which restricts compensation and a new Bill to cut appeals time.</P>
      <P>The environment generally is very important and nations worldwide are very conscious and aware of its importance. Deputy Flynn, as Minister for the Environment, produced a comprehensive national programme which was published in 1990 and I look forward to the implementation of that programme.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the close links between the environment and health.  Good clean drinking water, proper sewerage facilities, control of air pollution, chemicals and toxic substances, leisure and recreational facilities, good housing and safe roads are all vital.  Deputies are aware that there are a number of Bills before the Dáil which we want to see implemented.  They include the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the Roads Bill, the Planning Bill, the Electoral Bill, the Control of Dogs Bill, the Housing Bill and the Road Traffic Bill.  We are now looking at the question of a new programme for the next five years as the current one is coming to a conclusion.  There is still work to be done.  We must eliminate the remaining water quality problems, clean up inland sewage pollution and deal with coastal areas and the lack of facilities.  We have to continue promotion and development of all the programmes.  The Environmental Protection Agency will be established early next year and there must be active participation in work on global environmental issues.</P>
      <P>Local government reform is another area that is on the agenda.  I have already referred to the social housing plan.  I want to see that fully achieved.  The new Housing Bill deals with the need to tackle management and maintenance of local authority housing estates and the tenants' involvement in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> I look forward to my term in the Department of the Environment, to working in the same way as I did in the Department of Health to ensure delivery at the very highest level of service to the public, and being in the Department of the Environment is a great opportunity for making a worthwhile contribution.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to congratulate the new Ministers in Cabinet the Minister of State Deputy Vincent Brady, and Deputy Noel Davern.  I have no doubt that they will make a very valuable contribution in Cabinet.  I also want to congratulate my fellow Ministers who have moved to new Departments.  Again I believe they will bring the same commitment to their new Departments as they brought to the Departments they are about to leave.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome Deputies Dermot Ahern, Michael Kitt and John O'Donoghue as Ministers of State. Everybody in this House recognises their ability and they will make a very valuable contribution to the work of government. There are important issues which we need to attend to.  The House should have no fear; the Government will attend to them.  They are committed to their work and dedicated to doing what needs to be done.  We have a good Government and our Leader has proven himself over the years.  I have already referred to his performance between 1987 to date.  We will continue to give good Government and it would be of help if the Opposition came into the House to discuss policy, to tell us what their alternative policies are, to make constructive contributions to debates and to stop making innuendoes and personal attacks week in, week out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating today the appointment of two members to the <Col N="1639" /> Government.  I would first like to congratulate Deputies Ahern, O'Donoghue and Kitt who have been nominated as Ministers of State.  I know Deputies Ahern and O'Donoghue very well as I have worked with them on the British-Irish parliamentary body and I found them to be intelligent, hard working and committed members of that body.  I am sure the same will apply to them when they begin work as Ministers of State.  I would also like to congratulate Deputy Kitt.  I have always found him to be courteous and a good Member of the House. I am sure he will be equally courteous and hard working in the Department he will eventually be allocated.  Likewise, I congratulate Deputies Brady and Davern whose nominations we are debating today.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that Deputy Davern would have made a good Minister for Defence and I will watch with interest his progress in one of the most testing Departments in the range of Cabinet portfolios, the Department of Education. I wish him well in what is an extremely difficult and demanding Department.  I hope he will do well.</P>
      <P>The other appointment announced yesterday was that of Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence and that is the one I would like to comment on today, in particular on the controversy which surrounded it during the past 24 hours.  I have no knowledge of Deputy McDaid. I have met him in the corridors of this House and I always found him to be a pleasant person.  I sometimes thought that he was unhappy in this House and wished to be somewhere else.  However, he appeared to get his opportunity yesterday to rise above that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When somebody is offered a position in the Cabinet it is absolutely right that his background is examined to make sure that he would not be an embarrassment to the Leader of the Government, the Cabinet and the country.  This is particularly true when we come to the sensitive posts of Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence who are members of the security committee.  Therefore, we <Col N="1640" /> should be doubly concerned that there is no blemish which would make them unsuitable for either of those portfolios.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid has said that he signed an affidavit on behalf of James Pius Clarke to the effect that he was in a certain place and could not have been present when certain things happened. He signed an affidavit on behalf of a person who is a proven member of the Provisional IRA, not just an ordinary foot soldier but a ranking officer.  To put it at its most charitable, it was one thing for Deputy McDaid to sign the affidavit if he thought that this person was in one place but he went far beyond any obligation he may have had to a constituent, having signed the affidavit, when he supported him with his presence outside the court and allowed himself to be photographed among a group of protesters which contained many members of the Provisional IRA.  At the least this showed naivety.  For this reason alone Deputy McDaid did the right thing in withdrawing his name last night.</P>
    <P>While blame must attach to him with regard to the company he keeps likewise blame attaches to the Government who put him in that position yesterday.  Primarily, it attaches to the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley.  Deputy O'Malley must have known about this appointment before it came before the House yesterday morning.  If any effort has been made to ascertain the background of either or both these men, through the press or other sources, they would have found out that it would be unwise and not in the interests of the country to make Deputy McDaid Minister for Defence.  If any proof is needed, it is the impression created by this appointment and the outcry among the British media, in particular among men of the calibre of Mr. Ivor Stanbrook, MP. This shows, given the sensitive security situation which pertains, that there cannot be on the security committee of any Irish Government nor in any sensitive security post a man against whom these charges can be levelled.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for Deputy McDaid in <Col N="1641" /> relation to the position in which he finds himself but I have no sympathy for the men who put him in that position, the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Malley.  They bear a serious responsibility to that man and this House.  This morning in the House Deputy Spring said he wanted to dissociate himself from some of the charges levelled against Deputy McDaid but the Fine Gael Party were right to discharge their responsibility in this regard and examine his background.  This is something Deputy O'Malley should have done.  This is hard to take from Deputy Spring given that he has frequently attacked other people in this House who were not in a position to defend themselves.  Deputy McDaid, however, as a Member of this House is in a position to defend himself.  If we had not brought these matters to the fore yesterday, imagine the outcry there would have been if Deputy McDaid had been confirmed as the Minister for Defence last night and these matters came out in the press today.  Where would the finger be pointed then?  The answer is at these benches because we han not done our duty.  Fine Gael did the right thing and Deputy Currie will reread into the record later on today precisely what Deputy Noonan and Deputy Taylor-Quinn said, not what is reported in the press or the charges laid against them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon said this morning that a man's character had been vilified from these benches yesterday but was he not present for the two-day confidence debate when every single backbencher of the Fianna Fáil Party led by the Minister for Justice &mdash; none of whom is present in the House; it is their job to keep the House and I would call a quorum except that I would use up my own time &mdash; made venomous and vituperative comments across the Floor of the House?  They then come into the House to accuse us of vilifying a Member who was a candidate for one of the most important and sensitive position in this country.  They should be ashamed of themselves, as should Deputy O'Malley and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> It is time the Government left office. Deputy O'Malley is being arrogant when he says there would be chaos if we had a general election.  That is rubbish.  What do we have now and what have we had for the past three months, apart from chaos?  Their idea that only the two parties opposite are capable of forming a Government should be tested in the public arena.  They seem to think the political play is interred in the Fianna Fáil Party or in a combination of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats. Let them test that at the hustings. Let them go before the public and let us have a general election.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are continually examining their consciences, they are embarrassed, they have to object to certain matters, and are concerned about what is happening in Government. If that is how they feel their performance in Government should be adjudicated on by the electorate.  In the meantime we want to see some Cabinet responsibility and not a performance similar to the one which took place earlier this week when the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, said that the Government were going to take a decision to fire three Ministers of State and that his party that were not going to participate in that decision.  I do not want hypocritical lectures from Deputy O'Malley or Deputy Molloy about what goes on in this House.  They accepted their seals of office from the President two and a half years ago on the basis that there would be collective responsibility.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, Deputy Noel Treacy and Deputy Smith will all be fired from their positions today by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy in he same way as they will be fired by the other 13 members of Government.</P>

      <P>It is quite interesting that I made that remark because I was not conscious of saying it.  I am repeating what Fianna Fáil Deputies said to me in the corridors of this House last night, that the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, has lost control of his party and Government. The tail is wagging the dog.  Over the last three weeks we have witnessed the way in which Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Flynn were got rid of, the proposed firing of three junior Ministers and the 14-hour meeting to decide whether the Taoiseach should lead the party.  Half the Deputies who voted for Deputy Haughey voted from ambition because they thought they might get one of the five vacant posts and the other half voted from fear because they did not know if they would regain their seats if they had to go before the electorate in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last three months the Progressive Democrats have been complaining about the series of scandals in which they feel members of the Government have been involved, yet they did not withdraw from Government and allow a <Col N="1644" /> general election to take place.  The people did not vote for this Government. I do not wish to make a big point of the fact that a coalition was formed after the election although the Progressive Democrats did not say that they would go into coalition with Fianna Fáil, nor did Fianna Fáil say that they would go into coalition with the Progressive Democrats.  Another of their core values has gone.  In fairness, people were relieved that a Government was formed and they have been reasonably satisfied with what has happened for the last two years. However, they are not satisfied with what has been happening for the last three months; they are not satisfied with the series of scandals which have rocked the Government in that time starting with Telecom, Celtic Helicopters, Greencore, the Kinsealy pipeline, the ESB windmill on Inishvickillane and a number of other things.  The people would like to pass judgment on these matters.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has broken my train of thought.  A series of scandals has rocked the Government for the last three months and the public generally see the Progressive Democrats as being part of the Government which are affected by these scandals.  We are told that the Progressive Democrats are a policy-driven party but they are much more policy-driven in relation to retaining their position in Government than they are in producing policies for the benefit of the country.  If they were sincere about their concerns for the future and for democracy &mdash; democracy has taken a terrible hammering in the last three months &mdash; they would bring about the downfall of the Government and bring about a general election.  I do not say that in a partisan fashion although I am sure that the Ministers, Deputies O'Malley and Molloy, will say that although Fine Gael are calling for an election they privately want to keep the Government in place. <Col N="1645" /> The result of the election is not important. It does not matter whether Fine Gael get 70 of 40 seats or whether the Progressive Democrats are wiped out, the fact is that democracy has been undermined and the only people who can restore faith in the institutions of the State in this House and the Government they choose to elect &mdash; no matter what its composition &mdash; is the electorate.  They should be given that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal briefly with some of the matters raised in yesterday's debate and again this morning.  I should like to deal first with what Deputy Barry described &mdash; I believe I quote him accurately &mdash; as &ldquo;the appointment by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce of Ministers in the Government&rdquo;. I want to make it quite clear that there are not joint Taoisigh; I am well aware of the constitutional position of the Taoiseach, and whatever the difficulties over the last two and a quarter years I have sought assiduously to respect that constitutional position.  I have done so at times at great cost to myself and my party because, in respecting the provisions of the Constitution, we have laid ourselves open to all kinds of criticism and abuse, principally from the Fine Gael Party, who are horribly jealous of the situation in which the Progressive Democrats have been in the last two and a quarter years. They criticise my party, whichever way they go; it is perfectly evident that, as far as they are concerned, we are never allowed to win if they can help it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer to a conversation I had with the Taoiseach on these matters.  In the normal way I would never make a reference in this House &mdash; or anywhere else &mdash; to a conversation I had with the Taoiseach about Government matters, particularly fundamental matters.  However, in the circumstances of all the various allegations being thrown about here I should make the minimum necessary reference to what happened.  At 6.15 p.m. on Tuesday of this week I went to see the Taoiseach to discuss two matters with him. The first related to one pertaining to my <Col N="1646" /> Department where a number of complications and difficulties had arisen.  I thought it appropriate to brief the Taoiseach in regard to them.  That took longer than I anticipated; it took about half an hour.</P>
    <P>At about 6.45 p.m. we changed the topic to the question of the appointment of Ministers and Ministers of State.  In no sense was I consulted and in no sense did I seek to be consulted, as I do not have a right under the Constitution or under law to consultation.  I believe I have a right to be informed, and I was informed of the two names, Deputy McDaid and Deputy Davern.  I made no comment on either of them except &mdash; and I say this in passing &mdash; to express surprise that the new Ministers had come from the backbenches rather than from among the Ministers of State, which is what I would have anticipated.  Apart from that I had no discussion whatever on the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I was not aware &mdash; and I think the vast majority of Members of this House were not aware &mdash; that Deputy McDaid had had a public association with a man called James Pius Clarke who is apparently a member of the Provisional IRA.  It is not a question that I forgot; I was never so aware.  I do not know Deputy McDaid very well.  He was very recently elected to this House and I met him only briefly on a small number of occasions.  All I knew about Deputy McDaid was that he was a doctor in Letterkenny, County Donegal, and that he was very recently elected to the Dáil.  In any brief meetings I had with him he certainly struck me as a decent, honest and honourable man, and I had no reason to question him.</P>
    <P>When I discovered in this House from Deputy Michael Noonan that there was evidence rather than just a vague allegation, as had been made earlier, of the association of Deputy McDaid with James Pius Clarke, I went up to my office and asked an official to get me the newspaper cuttings for the date in question &mdash; Wednesday, 14 March &mdash; in which there was considerable reportage of the case on the previous day and the demonstration <Col N="1647" /> outside the Four Courts.  I have read all of those reports &mdash; they are very extensive &mdash; and Deputy McDaid was not once mentioned in them.  Nor is he identified in any of the photographs, although with hindsight if you examine one of the photographs carefully you can see Deputy McDaid in it, but if you were not looking for him I do not think you would have noticed it at the time.  Therefore there is no question that I forgot about Deputy McDaid's associations with this man; I never knew about them.</P>
    <P>I am asked here apparently to act as a joint Taoiseach, to take joint responsibility for appointments which the Constitution says can only be made on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  I am also expected to act as a censor of everybody in this House who might be nominated or proposed to hold office either in the Cabinet or elsewhere.  I reject that task being thrust upon me; I reject that office being put on me.  I do not have it and I do not have that responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are debating now the nomination of Deputies Brady and Davern for appointment at 5 p.m. this evening.  I propose to vote for them and I commend their appointment to the House, but listening to the speeches this morning I am expected by some Members of this House, to have satisfied myself through the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or the head of the Special Branch about the propriety of the appointment of these two Deputies.  I say to the House now that I have not done that, I do not intend to do so and I will not do it.  I know both men for quite a long time, especially Deputy Davern who came into this House not long after I did, and I know of nothing in terms of a criminal record, subversive associations or anything else that renders them unfit.  If I am expected to make inquiries, as was specifically suggested to me today, through the Garda Síochána, to get a security clearance and to do so independently of the Taoiseach, because I am supposed to act as a joint Taoiseach in this country, how much further will these Deputies go in requiring me to act as the gratuitously appointed <Col N="1648" /> national censor?  Am I supposed to inquire, for example, into the sexual orientation of members of the Government lest they be a security risk if they are not of an orthodox kind?  How far am I supposed to go?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a little unreasonable and I reject this task being put on me.  I want to advise the House that I will be voting, and am asking the House to vote today without having got a security clearance on Deputies Brady and Davern, which I think frankly would be insulting and I have no intention of doing so.</P>
      <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that the first concrete news or evidence I had of the public association between the Deputy and the man in question was when Deputy Noonan provided evidence here yesterday afternoon.  Obviously I was not alone in that because Deputy Bruton did not once refer any more than I did, to Deputy McDaid in his speech either.  Deputy Spring referred to him but only in passing, to congratulate him on his proposed appointment and to wish him well.  He made no criticism of him, nor did most other speakers until suddenly Deputy De Rossa and Deputy O'Keeffe began to query his associations. I understand that Deputy McDaid denied any impropriety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made my speech &mdash; and I am criticised for not having criticised Deputy McDaid in it but I had no grounds to criticise him because I knew of no evidence on which I could do so &mdash; I returned to my office to work on departmental business, including parliamentary questions for today.  After hearing Deputy Bruton and Deputy Spring in the morning I worked on my speech for the afternoon. They gave me no grounds to criticise Deputy McDaid.  I did not listen to the Dáil monitor because I was working and nobody brought the original allegations to my attention because there was <Col N="1649" /> no evidence and there was really no need for it.</P>
    <P>Immediately after I left the Dáil Chamber I consulted officials in my Department as well as party officials and I got the relevant press cuttings.  As I have said, even though they are voluminous &mdash; I have them here &mdash; there is not one word in them about Deputy McDaid.  I got a barrister member of my party to check the Irish Law Times Report in which the Clarke and Finucane cases are reported officially, but there is no reference in that report to Deputy McDaid. I then had informal contact with some of my parliamentary party colleagues, including the Minister for Energy, and I had a meeting with the Taoiseach, where I said that having looked at what is now evidence rather than listened to allegations, I obviously had some concerns and I explained to the Taoiseach what they were.  He suggested that I might like to meet Deputy McDaid and I said I would because I did not want to put myself in the position of acting as a judge and jury over somebody whom I had not heard and particularly somebody whom I did not really know at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid came to my office shortly afterwards and a 15 minute conversation ensued between the Minister for Energy, Deputy McDaid and myself. It was not an interrogation; it was, as you can imagine, a sad scene where we discussed aspects of the matter with Deputy McDaid and pointed out to him that there were difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, Sir, that I am utterly satisfied, having had that conservation last evening with Deputy McDaid, that the man is totally honourable and honest in every way.  I sincerely believe he is in no way supportive of the Provisional IRA or any other violent organisation, but I believe &mdash; and I had to say this to him, and he began to realise it perhaps for the first time &mdash; that he had compromised himself, unfortunately.  Deputy Molloy, who is a former Minister for Defence, pointed out that if, for example a photograph appeared in the newspaper of some young man beside a convicted member <Col N="1650" /> of the Provisional IRA, and that young man were to go along and try to enlist in the Army as a private, the Army would have to turn him down.  In fact the Army would turn him down without question because they cannot take any kind of risk at all.  I think that made an impression on Deputy McDaid and I do not think he had realised or seen things in that way.  I was very moved at that meeting by his description of his four years as a casualty officer in Letterkenny General Hospital when he saw, perhaps more closely than any of us do, the results of the work of the IRA, their sympathisers and their political front.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely satisfied that Deputy McDaid is a most honourable man.  I think there is just one episode where due to inexperience, innocence, naivety, or whatever one would call it, he did something which unfortunately clearly disqualifies him from holding that particular office.  I had discussions with my colleagues, obviously we were terribly unhappy about the whole thing but shortly before 9 o'clock I heard that Deputy McDaid was going to ask the Taoiseach to withdraw his nomination.  I was in the House to hear Deputy McDaid.  He acted very honourably and I think he genuinely acted in the national interest.</P>
    <P>What I really deplore is the way he was pilloried yesterday.  It was legitimate for Members of this House to get up and draw attention to his public associations, but what was not legitimate was to describe him as a fellow traveller of the Provisional IRA and as someone who would leak information to Provos. That is not legitimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not that kind of a man.  I heard the venom with which he was attacked yesterday and I found it regrettable and deplorable because it was unfair.  It should be possible to get up and, as I believe I am doing now, make the point that through circumstances of innocence, naivety or goodwill towards <Col N="1651" /> an individual constituent he compromised himself in a certain respect, but beyond that one cannot go.  After the meeting I had last night with Deputy McDaid, I cannot and I do not believe anyone ever could accuse him of being dishonourable, disreputable or any such thing.  I think he was put in an awful position last night and I am accused of having put him there.</P>
      <P>I did not know that he had any association with this man, James Pius Clarke. It is not that I forgot, I never knew and even if I had read every line of those newspapers, his name was never mentioned and there is no association with him shown on the public record.  I understand that the first time he was so associated in any way was on a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, shown some time later.  I did not see that programme I am afraid and therefore it did not impinge on me in any way.</P>
      <P>The Army and the Garda are doing an extraordinarily important task for this country.  They have to maintain incredibly high standards, even for people who hold as low a rank as an ordinary private in the Army.  Therefore, this House has to be very conscious of who will be the political head of the Defence Forces.  Even if a man is as decent, honourable and upright as I know Deputy McDaid to be, there are circumstances in which decent, honourable men cannot take a particular office or offices.  Unfortunately through innocence I suppose on his part, Deputy McDaid found himself in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these things were happening in this House last night four people died in Belfast because the Provisional IRA decided to murder them on no better grounds than that they were apparently Protestants.  They tried to murder a lot more than four, they nearly murdered three children as well, and one of those children is very seriously injured.  We have to be absolutely adamant in our opposition to those people and there cannot be even the slightest potential sign of ambivalence in regard to them and that is why it was necessary for Deputy <Col N="1652" /> McDaid in the national interest to stand aside last night, even though I am convinced he is an innocent man in every way.</P>

It is not easy but I believe and I say it without any taint, I hope, of arrogance that I can identify what the national need is and what our national duty is, and even if we continue to be showered with criticism and if I continue to be attacked on the basis that I allegedly hold the office of Taoiseach, even though I have none of the powers of it, and I have to put up with that, I will do it for as long as I see that our duty lies in that respect.</P>
      <P>I ask people to reflect on the fact that the national interest is what counts and we should get on with that.  All of us in this House saw last night a splendid example of putting the national interest first when Deputy McDaid stood up and said what he had to say in the way in which he said it.  I salute him and I ask that his noble example might be followed a bit more widely in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I begin with a point addressed by Deputy O'Malley, on which there is a great deal of confusion emerging?  I can say with certainty, and with as much certainty as Deputy Spring, and he speaks for me, that I also accept Deputy Jim McDaid's statement and his condemnation of the IRA campaign of murder and terrorism.  It is also very important that I and every Deputy in this House assert a fundamental principle that I feel necessary to have asserted now, having listened to the debate this morning: that is that in respect of any citizen irrespective of their past, irrespective of anything they might have been accused of or even convicted of or have served in prison, no Deputy has forfeited her or his rights to speak for such a person should that person be abused before the law in the legal process.  If such a person came to my clinic I would be interested in the issue that she or he placed before me and in the principles of the case as stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How far can be taken the suggestion that a person sacrifices the right to seek representation or that an elected public representative forfeits the rights of representation on the basis of alleged guilt by association?  This has been one of the most fundamental and consistent assaults on the principle of civil and human rights internationally.  A person may at one <Col N="1654" /> time in his or her life be guilty of something. Consider, for example, the people who were involved in the last days of Richard Nixon who, I am led to believe, had miraculous conversions to Jesus while they were in prison.  It is a lurid example, but if somebody who has been convicted in the past appeared in a Deputy's clinic should that Deputy ask about that person's past, which might forfeit his or her right to representation on a particular issue?</P>
    <P>I remember when the issue of James Pius Clarke arose.  What Members of the House, and members of local authorities were approached on was a fundamental and simple issue: was the process perfect by which extradition would take place, was it a clear charge and did conditions exist in which he could acquire certainty in both the charge and the process?  We were not asked to judge anything else, and on that issue the courts decided.  I did not rise to speak in defence of any Deputy, but I accept the statement made to the House by Deputy McDaid and I welcome it.  I also believe that if indiscretion is that of which he was guilty, it is only that, and I absolutely abhor the suggestion that somebody on a scintilla of indiscretion would have alleged in his regard because he allowed himself to come between the camera focus of other people that he shares the values of those other people.  That is not only a nonsense, it is a dangerous slur on the character of a Deputy.  What took place in the House in the sense of building on that association the allegation that a person was a tacit Provo, a sympathiser or that because of this the person was somehow or other a security risk was &mdash; and this was done by someone whom I respect &mdash; a lurid, sensational, irresponsible and damaging extension beyond all evidence for the sake of petty opportunistic advantage.  It is sad when a person's career is affected in the way it has been in this instance.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party has spoken about the extraordinary judgments being made by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  Certainly I would have been more interested if he had nominated Deputy McDaid for the ministry of <Col N="1655" /> Health, where his views &mdash; which he might have developed in Cabinet &mdash; on the availability of contraceptives, on divorce and on changing the laws on criminalisation of acts of people of a certain sexual orientation would have been very valuable.  It would have been very interesting to know that such views were being floated in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>It would have been a better decision to nominate Deputy McDaid for some other portfolio.  However, with respect to Deputy Shatter who made this point, the Leader of the Labour Party spoke for me and for every member of the Labour Party when he said that we are in the House to provide opposition but that we do not substitute for that responsibility by the kind of behaviour witnessed here last evening.  I reiterate that because it is a very important fundamental principle. I am surprised from where that came last evening.  There is an issue of jurisprudence involved.  Does the recidivist have rights?  Equally, can one speak to somebody about a particular issue without taking on the generality of issues? What, then, if one goes on and extends all of that and hands from this privileged Chamber to Unionists and irresponsible right-wing backbenchers in Britain ammunition to damage the national interest?  Who, in the end, has helped the situation in Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>I am appalled, as everybody is, by the dreadful murders that took place last night.  I accept that the condemnations of that violence that came from the person nominated were genuine.  It is very important that we respect this issue of law.  I have heard of that.  I served on the McBride Commission on prisons.  I had prisoners come to me and say that after they had served time in prison they were still subjected to vigilance.  Those people attended my clinic.  By speaking to them receiving them and advising them of their rights, was I guilty?  What kind of society would it be that allowed government by innuendo or guilt by innuendo and association?</P>
    <P>What we are here to do today, however, is reflect on the appropriate <Col N="1656" /> composition of Cabinet.  There is a massive question mark over the judgment of Deputy Haughey and there is an even deeper question about practically every area of Cabinet responsibility.</P>
    <P>Only this week Deputy Haughey in the House made the shameful suggestion that a slowing up in the rate of emigration was responsible for the rise in unemployment figures.  On every occasion on which I have spoken on the economy I have warned that there could be economic growth without getting investment or job creation.  I have warned against ministerial speeches that stated that the impact of the Government's policies would be to create a climate for investment and that from that climate of lower interest rates, controlled inflation and so forth would inevitably come jobs.  That is described even today by the Taoiseach as economic stability.  It is the stability of drift, the stability of an economic disaster. It is something that says nothing about the investment crisis in the economy.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week we had a refusal to extend the studies that might have identified the implications of the expanded black economy and of the leaks in the economy of perhaps 12 per cent of gross domestic product.  Where is there anything of serious economic thinking in this country while 260,000 and more are unemployed?</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Health appealing for responsibility.  We make ourselves the laughing-stock of the world when, for example, trying to tackle something so humanly important as the AIDS problem, we are doing it in Ireland without the use of condoms.  Perhaps the Minister Deputy O'Hanlon, in a fit of sympathy, should talk to Deputy McDaid on that issue now.</P>
    <P>A new Minister for Education takes over.  All over the country people are asking what that Minister will do to improve access to education, to change the curriculum or to develop co-education. What will that Minister do for changing the balance of democracy within education and issues of control?  I have not heard Deputy Davern apply <Col N="1657" /> himself to the Church/State connection in education, on the relevant curriculum, on co-education or on sexism in schoolbooks, but I have a good idea of what his earthy views might be on those matters.</P>
    <P>In relation to foreign affairs this House reels towards Maastricht, which has about as much relevance to the public as mastitis, because of the way it has not been explained.  People say: &ldquo;Maastricht, what is it?&rdquo; Unique among the parliaments of Europe, there are no position papers, no profiles of the framework of issues to be decided, a debate coming too late and then there will be statements after the event.  In industry and commerce it is very important.  In all of the ministries there is a little sleight of hand going on now.  There is a certain kind of politics associated with the leadership of Fianna Fáil and Deputy Haughey, An Taoiseach.  They have been associated in this country with a culture of speculation rather than a culture of production.  They speak openly of that within the business world.  The fact is that the Taoiseach's nominees are irrelevant to this debate.  It is the man making the nominations who is relevant and it is time for the Taoiseach to go.  He could have gone with grace, even with a sense of élan at the end of the great hubris he felt during our Presidency of the EC; he decided not to do that.</P>
    <P>This is not merely an issue for Fianna Fáil.  The public are anxious to hear policies on the economy, on emigration, on poverty, health and education.  They are anxious to see us do our work preparing for the European Summit in Maastricht. They are anxious for us to have a foreign affairs committee.  Let us not say that these scandals should not be raised.  If there is impropriety on the part of those who wanted to get rich by speculating rather than by producing anything, least of all jobs, that should be raised here and raised every day if necessary.</P>

      <P>We damage politics, and there is talk in Europe of a democratic deficit.  The idea of scandals of the <Col N="1658" /> scale we have seen that could not be touched by parliamentary accountability would be a killer blow to democracy itself.  This is not a political crisis.  The impropriety lies with those who did it; most importantly, where it touches this Parliament, are those who provided a political culture where shortcuts could be taken.</P>
      <P>There are so many other issues to which I might refer but I want to share my time.  We have seen in the last Cabinet, as the Minister for the Environment left, a retreat from public housing, and cuts in the health service.  The public are now reeling, asking if we are stuck in some kind of mist from which there is no escape? The outgoing Cabinet presides uniquely over a kind of fatalism that there is nothing that can be done any more except to drift along and have these kind of wrangles in this House.</P>
      <P>Let us have an election soon.  Fine Gael called for one.  But let not any party of the Right think they can go to the public and lay down conditions saying, &ldquo;We will go in with others if we have this&rdquo;.  We on these benches, the left in this Dáil &mdash; and I ask the public to reflect very carefully on it &mdash; have the capacity now, in the immediate future to be a growing and responsible Opposition.  That will be our road.  We will not sink to destruction after the event as somebody who already knows he is leaving did last evening.  We will address the issues in our economy and society.  We will direct our opposition to the person who is presiding over the politics of drift and failure, the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, put the record straight.  It is an uninteresting record when it is true. Probably it is better that we have the true, uninteresting record rather than be subjected to the glamour of all the innuendoes of what might or might not have taken place between the Leader of the <Col N="1659" /> Progressive Democrats and the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>This morning the Leader of my party touched the sensitive nerve of the country, the sense of justice felt by the public, when they undertake a critical analysis of what their public representatives are doing.  This morning he touched that very sensitive nerve in being truthful in what he had to say, about what was said from the Fine Gael benches or by Deputy McDaid himself.</P>
      <P>For the record, I might quote what Deputy Spring said this morning because he was criticised by Deputies Shatter and Barry.  He had this to say:</P>
      <P>Remarks that described that Member, Deputy McDaid, as a fellow traveller and that implied that he would give away secrets to the Provos if he were appointed to Cabinet were unworthy of the people who made them.</P>
      <P>He also said:</P>
      <P>We all have to be very careful about the inferences we draw about the character and honour of the people we are criticising.  To draw attention to the involvement of Deputy McDaid in the James Pius Clarke case was legitimate and perhaps necessary; to question him closely and give him the opportunity to reply was desirable.</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Spring said this morning.  It was appropriate, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted it was appropriate, to raise that issue because, at worst, possibly it was an indiscretion.  But to raise all sorts of other innuendoes about the quality of Cabinet, the leaking of secrets to the Provos, can destabilise any democracy. That is the sensitive nerve Deputy Spring touched this morning.</P>
      <P>I am more concerned about the quality of the Ministers nominated.  I also welcome the fact that one of the Ministers represents my constituency.  I welcome the fact that it is the first time any Government have recognised South Tipperary as being deserving of a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> I have today called publicly on the Minister-elect, Deputy Noel Davern, to deliver on and rectify problems in our constituency, in the areas of unemployment, housing and education, the latter being his special responsibility.  I have called on him also to examine and address the crisis of health funding in our constituency; the crisis of staffing in hospitals in Clonmel, the town he represents, the crisis of staffing in hospitals in Cashel where he, his late father and brother originated.  These are the real political problems confronting the Minister-elect. I will be using my office as elected representative for the area to ensure that he performs and delivers in those areas, for example, that he delivers on the new school to Cashel.  These might be regarded as parochial-constituency problems but they are real political issues in the area.  I will expect the Minister elect to answer for them and he will have a forum within which he can do so.</P>
    <P>I will not allow this other debate to distract our attention from the real political problems confronting us nationwide. The accusations about standards, originated two weeks ago from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Social Welfare, when some things they attributed to colleagues on my left were not worthy of Government Ministers, things which they had to refute.</P>
    <P>There is no credit to be gained by any of us complaining about criticism. Deputy Spring was criticised by the Government Press Secretary; there was nothing in that criticism but he had to take it as an accusation.  Accusations will come and go but people's characters should never be assassinated by anybody on any side of the House whether in Government or Opposition.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be political but I want to pay tribute to the stand the Labour Party have been taking and particularly to the sentiments expressed by Deputy Michael D. Higgins in the past few moments. <Col N="1661" /> I admire many of those sentiments he expressed.  The stand taken and views expressed by the Labour Party on this issue are principled.  They have not taken the easy course always open to Oppositions &mdash; I am sure we did it in our own day in Opposition &mdash; that is, fall for the opportunity to jump on the bandwagon which might embarrass the Government of the day.  It is important to say that without any strings attached.</P>
      <P>The Dáil is being asked today to support the appointment to the Cabinet of Deputies Vincent Brady and Noel Davern Deputy Vincent Brady is a very suitable candidate for the post of Minister for Defence.  I have no reason to believe that he will not perform his duties with considerable distinction.  He has been a member of this House since 1977.  He has considerable experience as a member on the Committee on Public Accounts, serving his party in many capacities.  He has been an alderman of Dublin Corporation and a very effective Government Chief Whip.  Most importantly and appropriately at this time, Deputy Vincent Brady has been serving as Minister of State in the Department of Defence for a number of years.  His knowledge of the Army is admirable and he has their respect.  He also holds the Army in very high esteem.  Deputy Vincent Brady is a very suitable choice as Minister for Defence because of his substantial experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noel Davern is also a suitable choice as Minister for Education.  He is a popular Deputy who first came into this House some 22 years ago.  His family before him served the country.  I and other Deputies recall his brother Don, who died in office while serving the State as a junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture.  The family have served Ireland well and Deputy Davern as Minsiter for Education will carry on that tradition. I heard some people say in the corridors that Deputy Davern has no experience in education and they asked how he could be a good Minister in that Department.  I freely admit that I knew nothing about transport until two years <Col N="1662" /> ago when I became Minister for Transport.</P>

      <P>I do not subscribe to the notion that one must have experience in a particular area to be a good Minister.  I became a Cabinet Minister without previous experience of any kind of ministerial office.  Many of the people opposite will probably make good Ministers in their time, without previous ministerial experience.  Deputy Davern has the general political experience of 22 years or more in public life.  He spent five years in the European Parliament.  Given the Government's increasing involvement in the European scene, that is very valuable experience to bring to the Cabinet. I wish Deputy Davern and Deputy Brady every success in their new roles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday was a very sad day in this House.  I do not think anybody took any great pleasure in what happened.  I pay tribute to Deputy James McDaid and I abhor any stain on his character.  I know Deputy McDaid personally from our time together at UCG.  Deputy Rabitte and Deputy Michael Higgins will also recall him as a student since we were all at UCG around the same time, as was Deputy McDaid's wife, Marguerite.  I remember him as a very solid student <Col N="1663" /> who had the respect and admiration of his fellows.  I lost track of him over the years but I understand he went on to become a top class medical practitioner in his native Donegal.  He has been an excellent representative of Donegal North-East since 1989.  He has shown great courage and determination on a number of issues and has not been afraid to express his views at the appropriate time.  He has shown genuine concern about social issues and he has a social agenda.  He is concerned too about economic development not only in his native county of Donegal but in the whole country. It is really a pity that what should have been a day of happiness for an honourable man turned into a day on which he was politically assassinated without any trial, without any right of reply before such execution was carried out.  The people who carried out that execution can think it out for themselves. They should not be proud of their work.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of belief.  I believe Deputy McDaid when he says that at no time did he take part in any kind of demonstration against extradition.  If he says that as a Member of this House I believe him.  I believe him when he says that Donegal County Council, including the Fine Gael Party, Independents and The Workers' Party, passed a motion opposing that extradition and that the motion was also supported by a Fine Gael Deputy, a Member of this House.  That is where the serious charges came from last evening, by and large.  I also believe Deputy McDaid when he says that he is totally opposed to the IRA, as is everybody in this House, that he despises them for their murderous campaigns which have brought such heartbreak to thousands of our fellow Irishmen.  I was very touched when he made the point that as a medical practitioner he has seen at first hand in hospitals the result of that murderous campaign.  I believe him when he puts forward his clear account of the Clarke events which amount to no more than was reflected by Donegal County Council, with all the different parties involved, and by the Supreme Court.  Maybe I am <Col N="1664" /> being too simplistic; I do not think so.  I have thought about it carefully since the events of yesterday.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid was against the extradition of Mr. Clarke, as was the Supreme Court.  If Deputy McDaid is guilty of opposing that extradition and showing his opposition to it, so the Supreme Court is guilty also.  The Supreme Court is not guilty and therefore neither is Deputy James McDaid.  Maybe one should not boil it down to that simplistic analysis but having looked at it very carefully, this is what I must do.  Our Supreme Court were opposed to that extradition so was Deputy McDaid.</P>
    <P>It is legitimate for the Opposition &mdash; indeed it is their duty &mdash; to raise these kinds of questions, but they should have waited for Deputy McDaid's explanation, which has been accepted by a large number of people.  From reports already in my constituency and from around the country this morning I am convinced that the people believe Deputy McDaid.  I call on Deputy Paddy Harte and Deputy Dinny McGinley, two honourable men who share the county of Donegal with Deputy McDaid, to speak up and not to do the political thing of staying quiet.  They should speak up for Deputy McDaid.  Both of them know that he abhors violence and the IRA as much as they do.  They know a grave injustice has been done to him by members of their party.  They know the people of County Donegal and Deputy McDaid.  I ask both of them not to let the day pass without dissociating themselves from the outrageous &ldquo;fellow traveller&rdquo; charges which came particularly from Deputy Noonan.  If Deputy Harte and Deputy McGinley speak up now I believe the people of Donegal and the people of Ireland generally will thank them.  They know that Deputy McDaid is entirely innocent of the charges levelled against him by some members of their party.  I ask them to avail of the opportunity today to tell the country what they know about Deputy McDaid, that he is an honourable man.  Like me I am sure the people of County Donegal would like to hear them say this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> I have been a Member of this Chamber for ten years.  I have to confess that like all Members I am learning all the time. Sometimes I am not entirely consistent in what I do.  I may do things differently now from the way I would have done them nine or ten years ago.  I am developing my views all the time and I do not get locked into the history of previous utterances.</P>
    <P>I am privileged to have served as general secretary of my party, to have been a Member of Seanad Éireann and a Minister of State before I joined the Cabinet. The one lesson I have learned the hard way &mdash; we should all give a lot of thought to this &mdash; is the barrenness, futility, unfairness and sheer hopelessness of engaging in personality politics.  This country needs policies, not personalities. We should get back to debating policies and leave behind us some of the political cannibalism of personality assaults which have bedevilled this great Parliament for so many months.  Policies affect the lives of real people and are always needed while personalities are only transient, they come and go.  It is time we again started realising that that is what Parliament is about and stopped squabbling about who should have a State car for a transient period.  We should all consider what we do when we are honoured to hold office.  If we do not stop the haemorrhaging of confidence in our democratic institutions which is taking place by returning to policies and rejecting the personality approach I honestly believe that in years to come all Members of this House will regret it and wish they had pulled this democratic institution back from the brink it is on.</P>
    <P>We are facing very real and daunting challenges.  These are crying out for the undivided attention of the Government. We have to implement the Programme for Government which covers every Department of State and charts a clear road forward on economic, social and political matters.  We have to review the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which is a complex job.  The negotiations with our social partners call for skill and the undivided attention of <Col N="1666" /> the Government.  We also have to bring in a budget.  The Minister for Finance designate, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is ideally suited for the complex task which falls on his shoulders.  The experience he gained during the negotiations on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and other economic issues has equipped him well for this task.  He has also, in conjunction with the rest of the Cabinet, to complete the estimates which are urgently needed.  Every Department of State have plans on how to develop the economy.  I have a number of proposals in the broadcasting, transport and tourism areas which I desperately want to proceed with and leave aside some of the distractions of recent weeks.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk around this House for many weeks about resignations and the need for people to step aside.  Deputy McDaid stood aside yesterday evening amid much unwarranted personal abuse and assault.  Having thought about this issue coolly &mdash; this is not language which normally sits well with me; I try to avoid these personality issues if I can &mdash; I want to pose a question: &ldquo;Is it not Deputy Noonan and Deputy Taylor-Quinn who made these hotheaded outbursts yesterday who should consider resigning today?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As one who has never indulged in personality politics I will only comment briefly on the subject matter of the motion before us and yesterday's discussion in the House.  Like many Members on this side of the House, I only meet Deputy McDaid in the corridor.  I have always found him to be courteous.  I do not believe personal animosity should ever get the better of any of us in this House.  As the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications said, it is the duty of the Opposition parties to <Col N="1667" /> outline the reasons why they believe a person should not be appointed to a particular portfolio.  It is also our duty to point out any difficulties which exist.</P>
      <P>I accept from what the speakers opposite have said that Deputy McDaid would have made an excellent Minister in any portfolio.  However, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said unfortunately circumstances exist &mdash; I am not paraphrasing the Minister &mdash; which could become the focus of attention at a later stage of people outside this House, and perhaps outside the State, and, through no fault of his, Deputy McDaid's appointment to that portfolio could become a problem.</P>
      <P>I do not want to rehash what has been said this morning and yesterday.  Like the Minister Deputy Brennan I have been a Member of this House for ten years.  Unfortunately, personal politics has become the order of the day both inside and outside this House.  Once we go down this road it naturally follows that everybody falls a victim to it at some stage.  I am sure that like me many Members of this House have been both inside and outside the House.  This is probably not in the interests of this House or ensuring public confidence in our ability to do the job we were elected to do.  Having said that, I have to accept the explanation given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, on this issue: if attention is drawn at some time in the future to circumstances which were probably totally innocent they could well become a source of sensitivity and difficulty for the incumbent of that office.  I want to again emphasise that this may happen through no fault of his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of instability which has been raised here this morning and over the past few weeks.  I have to say &mdash; this is a political point and I make no apology for making it &mdash; that a great deal of the instability in this House has come from the benches opposite, most of which are now vacant.  This may be the fault of both parties in Government or one or other of the parties in <Col N="1668" /> Government.  I am not totally satisfied that there is 100 per cent agreement in either party all the time.  People who have witnessed events here over the past few weeks will understand what I am saying.</P>
    <P>If one asks himself the question, and it is peculiar when one reflects on it, how stable Governments have been in this country over the past 20 years one sees that since 1970 any Government comprised of Fianna Fáil or, as is the case now, of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats one way or the other ended up being unstable after a short period, probably after about two years.  Following the 1969 general election Ministers resigned, were fired and so on in 1970.  In 1977 there was a general election with a massive majority for Fianna Fáil but 18 months down the road there was a change of leadership, indecision and loss at the next general election in 1981. In 1982 they won the general election. After a short period there was indecision, Ministers resigned and they were out of office again.  In 1987 we had a minority Fianna Fáil Government, temporarily supported by this side of the House.  Two years down the road there was indecision, struggling with consciences.  This was followed by another general election.  In 1989 we had a new Government.  Two years down the road there are personality clashes, qualms of consciences and again they were wondering whether they would or would not, who would be leader, who would be Taoiseach, who had the right to be Taoiseach, and had the right to sack, who did not have the right to sack and so on.  It goes on and on.  We are back to instability again and we still have problems.  That problem needs to be addressed seriously in this House at present because the economy and the wellbeing of the people are controlled either directly or indirectly by the manner in which the Government is run.</P>
    <P>If the Government are seen to be stable and if the public and private institutions outside have confidence in that country and that Government the economy will prosper.  If they do not have confidence, and the reverse seems to be the case, as time goes by we will be facing disaster.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> What do the people outside think?  Naturally they think we should be seriously dealing with the problems they regard as most urgent at present.  It is no good that people on the Government side should say we are pointing the fickle finger at them at this time.  It is a fact of life that there are 265,000 people unemployed at present.  Thousands of students are coming on the labour force annually who are wondering whether they will ever get a job; thousands are emigrating, and there are thousands more whose jobs are in jeopardy or insecure in one way or another.  There are still thousands who are now unemployable by virtue of the fact that they have been unemployed for so long as to be no longer a realistic part of the workforce.  That is a serious problem.  How many minutes still remain to me?</P>

I thank also the Ministers who were constructive in their responses to the Opposition over the past couple of years.  This is something I have said before and I make no apology for repeating it.  There is nothing to beat an honest response from a Minister to a parliamentary question.  It is the one vital link about which Members of the Opposition have to keep themselves informed. Ministers are protected by being able to stand up in the House and answer questions honestly and truthfully in so far as they can having regard to the information available to them.  There is nothing to be gained from being coy, smart-alecky and so on.  I am not referring to the two Ministers in the House at present, or to many of the others, as they are both exemplary in the manner in which they address that issue.  However, there are one or two who were notorious for their side-stepping and fancy foot work when it came to answering questions.  It does <Col N="1670" /> not pay off, it does not help and it certainly is not good for accountability, stability or public confidence in the institutions of Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn to the remarks made this morning by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley.  His contribution was somewhat disingenuous, to put it mildly.  If what he says is true and if what he says today is how he felt last night why was the Government motion not amended last night?  If, in the opinion of Deputy O'Malley, Deputy McDaid is suitable to be a member of the Government &mdash; I am not casting any doubt on Deputy McDaid &mdash; why was he not switched to Education?  Why was the motion not amended?  That is what bothers me. He came in here today and said that Deputy McDaid is a wonderful man.  I do not know the Deputy and I think we are entitled to accept that he is a man of integrity but the problem is in the area which Deputy O'Malley pointed out though he did not make that clear last night.  He caused Deputy McDaid to withdraw because the Government simply could not carry the motion last night.  Much has been made here today about what Deputy Taylor-Quinn said. Deputy Taylor-Quinn spoke immediately before Deputy McDaid.  Deputy McDaid, as the Taoiseach said immediately after him, had already informed the Taoiseach of his intention to withdraw his nomination and he spoke from a prepared script which had been issued.  It is totally disingenuous to try to sew into the record the sort of thing Deputy O'Malley <Col N="1671" /> said here this morning, that they would attempt to rewrite history.  I find that completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Given the performance we have had the Government cannot go anywhere without not just getting the agreement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, but without getting it in duplicate and triplicate.  He gives it one day, takes it back the next.  Who is to know whether he might change his mind about these appointments next week?  One cannot govern like that.  This Dáil is doomed.  The sooner the Taoiseach takes that issue on board, goes to the park dissolves the House and gets a new mandate for a new Government &mdash; whoever happens to get it &mdash; the better it will be for us all.  We cannot constantly be held up to ransom by the Progressive Democrats.  I do not mean this in an offensive way to Fianna Fáil but the Progressive Democrats have shown themselves to be no more than a small Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; they are not as good at being Fianna Fáil as the actual Fianna Fáil party.  There is no purpose for the Progressive Democrats and it is totally disingenuous of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come in here penitent this morning, having caused the downfall last night.  If he felt as he did why did they not amend the motion and vote it through last night?  They could not vote it through because Deputy O'Malley would not allow them.</P>
    <P>I have a strong feeling which has grown over a period &mdash; and it is not something that relates to the current Government &mdash; that there is no need to account to the Dáil, that the Dáil is a rubber stamp, that the Dáil is taken for granted, that we can make speeches outside the House.  This is not something that happened during the term of the present Government, it is something which has been happening for a while.  The Dáil is constantly being denigrated and constantly set back and ignored.  Take for instance facilities for Members: there is no head office in town which operates in the way this head office operates.  The House showed last night that it is not a rubber stamp and cannot <Col N="1672" /> be taken for granted.  We should start from there and reform the whole process so that we do have a major role to play in the Dáil as Members of the Dáil whether in Government or out of Government.  Every Government since 1969 has changed.  If the current Government will not do this for altruistic reasons let them do it for selfish reasons because there should be involvement through proper parliamentary committees and proper facilities and resources for those committees and Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is literally in the Dark Ages when it comes to dealing with matters. This is an adversarial system where Government Members are on one side of the House and the Opposition Deputies are on the other side.  For instance, it should be possible &mdash; certainly where a Member is being added to the Government, whatever about an entirely new Government &mdash; to ratify that Member in Committee and to inquire into these matters in Committee.  Perhaps, if a committee had the opportunity to flesh out all the matters the Minister for Industry and Commerce wanted fleshed out, he might have had a different attitude to the situation last night.</P>
    <P>Why does everything have to be done through an adversarial system?  Why was this not examined in committee to find out whether a person is suitable for appointment as a Minister?  It is because nobody wants to take the Dáil seriously. One side must have it all or nothing.  That is wrong.  The Opposition must become more involved with Government Members of the House in making decisions.  It is time for the Government to put Dáil reform firmly back on the agenda.  A lot of progress was made in this area when Deputy Ahern was Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>Given what happened in Northern Ireland last night and what is happening there constantly we must make it absolutely clear that we can have no truck with the Provisional IRA or other people like that.  We take it for granted that the tension which is palpable in Belfast city will be contained there.  I had the opportunity <Col N="1673" /> a few years ago to be able to go up and down once a week to Queens University. I often crossed O'Connell Bridge at 8.45 a.m. to be at Queens University at 11 a.m. for a lecture.  It is a very short journey from here to Belfast.  Whether or not the troubles are contained there we have to make it clear that there can be no truck with the IRA or their associates, whether with regard to the concerned parents, the letting of the Mansion House or anything else.  We cannot strike a constitutional attitude to this.  The Provos are the enemies of all, not just of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, The Workers Party or the Labour Party.  We can have no truck with them.  It is wrong to sympathise today with Deputy McDaid because he tried to enhance his standing with his constituents by associating with these people in a congratulatory way.  Perhaps the Taoiseach proposes to appoint Deputy McDaid as a Minister of State and perhaps Deputy McDaid will have another day.</P>
    <P>When we ask ourselves why there is such lawlessness and such vandalism throughout the country, a country which holds itself up as a Christian country, we can point to the fact that the IRA and their fellow travellers showed the way in relation to robbing banks and subverting the law.  We have to row back from any truck with the IRA.  That must be the bottom line.  This debate, if it does nothing else, should make it clear that the IRA is the enemy of all.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy McDaid well in the future.  I hope he will put this episode behind him and that in time he will show that he would not be the wrong person to appoint as Minister for Defence.  Last night the House could not agree to his appointment.  Fine Gael have 53 Members who could not agree to his appointment, but neither could the other parties on this occasion.  Perhaps in the future all Members of the House will have an opportunity to show their total and absolute resistance to the IRA.  Perhaps the parents of the five week old child who is being treated today and the two children aged 12 and two who were in another room when the men were shot <Col N="1674" /> last night will be able to look to the South and say that there are people in the Republic who really care.  I care about it and I know that the House cares about it, but we must show it.  We should have no truck with the IRA and be seen to have no truck with them.  Let us put all the codology to one side.  If a Deputy has any truck with people like that it is up to us to take the down side if the glamour goes wrong.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to see how this Government can survive.  I have been in this House for almost 11 years and I doubt if anyone has seen the sort of shenanigans that have gone on over the last year.  It is difficult to imagine how the Government can cohesively address the problems of unemployment and emigration and the problems in the public finances.  These questions must be addressed if our young people are to have some opportunity in the 21st century.  Energy is being wasted through constant conflict and internal strife and this internecine dispute which is going on.  It is time to clear the air. Not one of us likes elections, but it is time to clear the air.  This simply cannot go on.  Deputy O'Malley and company should either rejoin Fianna Fáil or do the decent thing, but they cannot have their cake and eat it.  As things stand, not only do they want their cake but everybody else's as well.  Let us clear the air and stop looking for other people on which to put the blame.  There were enough votes on the Government side last night to illustrate a cohesive Government. They failed that test.  How can we take this Government at face value and imagine that they can address the serious issues which the country faces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak about the events of yesterday and about economic matters.  Listening to other speakers in the last two hours or so, I gather that people are generally reflecting on what happened throughout yesterday in a more purposeful way than the way in which the debate was conducted yesterday during the course of bitter exchanges.  I take on board the comments made by <Col N="1675" /> Deputies Durkan and Gay Mitchell.  I am almost 15 years here and I have rarely seen a day as divisive as yesterday.  I take tha point of Deputy Gay Mitchell that perhaps Dáil reform would be a help in that area.  In the words of Deputy McDaid last night, it was a very disappointing occasion when his proposed appointment was marred by totally unfounded allegations against him by some Members of the House.  I take Deputy Mitchell's point with regard to the Provisional IRA.  However, hard things were said yesterday about Deputy McDaid and they do not stand up.  The allegations were offensive to Deputy McDaid as an individual apart from his position as a proposed holder of the office of Minister for Defence.  It was wrong to accuse the man straightforwardly without innuendo as being a Provo fellow traveller.</P>
      <P>The second allegation that I found totally offensive was that if Deputy McDaid was Minister for Defence this would lead to an increase in the number of leaks from the Defence Forces to the Provisional IRA.  Both of those remarks added nothing to the debate but did a lot of damage to the name of the colleague of mine, a colleague of us all because he is a Member of the House.  In my 15 years here I have always tended to look to the roof or to the wall rather than listen to the mud slinging that is often part of an ill-tempered debate but which then dies down.  However, yesterday there was a concerted attempt against Deputy McDaid.  It must be left to the historians to analyse what went on here yesterday, but as far as I could see it seemed to be a case of vieing to see who could say the most vicious thing about the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because Deputy McDaid took part in the aftermath of a court case, because he knew the individual concerned, knew something about him and thought he was doing right on behalf of a constituent, he was attacked by the Opposition parties; but many people in this House have done the same in other cases.  If we are to be honest it would be hard for any of us here to stand up and say anything in this House <Col N="1676" /> if we were to go back and check all of the things we did.  Most Members of this House at one time or another speak to members of prison committees and get letters from constituents who are prisoners or from the parents of prisoners, sometimes Republican prisoners and other times people with ordinary criminal records.  These things have to be handled with care and people have to check what the position is.  Over the years I have heard members of the Oireachtas from all sides of the House making speeches against the security forces, the Garda, believing themselves to be right at the time.  Susequently, if they are found to be wrong they are normally gracious enough to admit that.</P>
    <P>I believe that Deputy McDaid probably made the right decision last night in view of what happened.  It is not an easy thing to do, when nominated for any position, to withdraw as he did.  His words will stand out among all the records in this House because they were unique.  He said last night that in view of attacks made on him and to avoid the slightest suspicion, however unwarranted, attaching to the Minister for Defence and in the broader national interest he was requesting the Taoiseach to withdraw his nomination as a member of the Government.  That was never done in this House before, and it was not an easy thing to do.  Whatever comments and remarks are made about Deputy James McDaid, that should be remembered to his credit.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gay Mitchell who was gracious enough to say that Deputy McDaid should be wished well in this House, and I think the matter should rest there.  Very harsh remarks which were unfounded were made by some members of the Opposition.  Their colleagues have now pulled back from them and it would be helpful if we saw a pulling back from them on all sides today before the end of the debate.  It will not change who the next Minister for Defence will be.  We have gone beyond that since last night. But pulling back will restore the integrity of a decent, honourable, hardworking, <Col N="1677" /> professional doctor and Deputy in this House.</P>
    <P>In the last few months there has been a big increase in the number of personalised attacks on the characters of Members of this House.  It cannot go unnoticed that yesterday, within hours of a relatively unknown backbencher's name being mentioned as Minister for Defence, extensive files were out.  One can only ask if there were other files had anyone else been picked.  That was remarkable and something I have never seen before in all my years in this House.</P>
    <P>I think the Opposition made some good points today.  They made some good points about employment, emigration, about public finances, about the Government working and about its credibility. They were all legitimate points made by the Opposition.  That is what we would be doing if things were the other way around.  It is what I did between 1982 and 1987 when I was on the benches occupied by Deputies Mitchell and Durcan. However, I do not think that the absolutely personal character assassinations that have been going on in this House in recent weeks do anything for the House. I would have much in common with Deputy Gay Mitchell.  I admire the work he does on committees in this House.  If we cannot debate policy and discuss our party differences in the third person then we are not much good to the electorate. If we carried the kind of friction and bitterness and absolute hate that was around this House last night out to the public at large we would not achieve much for the electorate, whether they are supporters of Government or of Opposition. The period from mid October until now has not been very long in Dáil terms. People argue that we had a long summer recess, but I have a feeling that the public may think that we did not have long enough if all we can do is to try to murder each other off by levelling abuse and counter abuse at each other.  I hope we can now stop that on all sides and do the job that I understood we were elected to do in 1977 and which has still to be done.</P>
    <P>Tackling unemployment remains the number one priority of this Government. <Col N="1678" /> The most effective role which the Government can play is in the creation of the optimum conditions for attracting and stimulating investment to enable employment to grow.  Self-sustaining, viable jobs are the only real answer to the twin problems of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Rising unemployment is not unique to Ireland: it is part of a global trend.  Over the last year unemployment has risen by over two million in the USA while countries as far apart as Australia, Canada, Finland and the UK have all witnessed similar percentage increases in unemployment to that recorded here.  It should be borne in mind that many of these countries are not experiencing the same growth in the labour force or the phenomenon of returning emigrants as Ireland.  It cannot be denied that the recent rise in unemployment has been largely caused by the global recession and the consequent cessation of emigration.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, the Irish economy has performed very well over the past four years and, despite the protracted worldwise recession, is continuing to do so.  All the evidence suggests that employment levels are holding steady and should, in fact, record a slight increase on last year.  The latest ESRI Medium-Term Review predicts an annual average growth of 3.7 per cent in GNP up to 1996.  Employment is expected to grow by 50,000 over the period &mdash; by 75,000 in non-agricultural sectors.</P>
    <P>The achievement of these goals required and continues to require the co-operation of all the major economic and social interests in society.  For that reason we must avoid the temptation to resort to short term <i>ad hoc</i> remedies which usually treat the symptom of unemployment instead of the disease which is lack of investment and the resulting lack of jobs. We would do well to remember that much larger and more powerful economies than our own, France for instance, have attempted to follow this path and have been forced to abandon it.  It is vital, therefore, that we hold our nerve and not allow ourselves to be panicked into rash <Col N="1679" /> action merely because it seems expedient in the short term.</P>
    <P>In its Spring Commentary the ESRI stated:</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to discover measures which could ameliorate the unemployment problem in the short term without exacerbating it in the longer term....  To increase the budget deficit further in an attempt to combat unemployment arising from international economic trends would be foolhardy and could jeopardise the economic strategy on which sustained employment growth depends</P>
    <P>The OECD, in its commentary, agrees:</P>
    <P>Persistence with the considerable policy efforts already embarked upon provides the best chance for the continuation of the impressive economic performance achieved over the past three years.</P>
    <P>In considering macho-policies I would remind the House that a key ingredient of economic growth and development &mdash; and one that cannot be measured in quantitative terms &mdash; is business confidence which, in turn, impacts on the economic behaviour of entrepreneurs.  The decision to invest or expand is largely influenced by the general perception of the prevailing stability and financial climate.</P>
    <P>Commentators too often prefer to see the negative side of economic indicators and, in an atmosphere of doom and gloom, people will react and respond accordingly.  This only exacerbates the economic situation.  Recently a leading Irish economist noted how, in recent years, the economy responds given the right conditions when business confidence begins to recover, and there is a general perception of economic stability and continued growth.  We should remind ourselves that, given the global situation, Ireland is performing well and is proving an attractive location for potential investors.  We must all be careful not to discourage investment by over-emphasising the negative aspects.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Government are <Col N="1680" /> fully aware of the situation.  We are convinced that any remedial action must accord with, and complement, the overall strategy and objectives encompassed by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, any other action would be counterproductive.  As part of their strategy to deal with rising unemployment the Government established the Task Force on employment and the Industrial Policy Review Group to identify and suggest remedies to obstructions to employment creation which might exist.</P>
    <P>Unemployment will also be a major issue in the White Paper on Manpower Policy which I have been working on for a number of months.  I would not say that this will resolve all the problems overnight but the measures contained in the final draft will be of help to Governments in the decade ahead in identifying where the problems lie and deciding how to overcome some of the obstacles.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the fundamentals of the economy remain sound, the Government are by no means complacent about the problems which exist, particularly that of unemployment. The number of redundancies notified to my Department last year was 13,292 which was the lowest annual total since 1979.  The total number of redundancies notified to the Department in the first nine months this year was 12,471 as compared with a figure of 10,620 for the corresponding period in 1990.  This increase of approximately 17 per cent is believed to have arisen through a combination of reasons, namely, global recession, continuing rationalisation, loss of markets and the temporary dislocation of business due to the Gulf crisis.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the monthly returns so far in 1991 shows that while the trend in the figures in the early part of the year was upwards, it is now evident that this increasing trend has levelled off somewhat in the more recent months.  It is expected that, based on the above returns, the total number of notified redundancies in 1991 could amount to 16,000 to 17,000.  Although this would be in excess of 1989 and 1990 totals of 13,395 <Col N="1681" /> and 13,292 respectively, it would compare favourably with the annual average figure of 22,400 for the ten year period 1981-1990, inclusive, and would be substantially beneath the figure of 31,290 for the peak year of 1984 in this period.</P>
    <P>Although the outlook for 1992 is still uncertain much depends on the recovery in other countries in particular the UK. It is not all gloom however, and the broad picture is for a somewhat better economic climate next year.</P>
    <P>The OECD project world output growth of almost 3 per cent in 1992 compared with 1 per cent this year; the EC Commission projects growth of 2.25 per cent for the EC as a whole; significantly from our viewpoint, the Commission projects growth of 2 per cent for the UK, following a decline of the same order this year.  Given the strong improvement in our economic fundamentals in the last few years, we are now in a very good position to take advantage of the world upswing in economic activity as soon as it gets under way.  The Single European market after 1992 will also bring a substantial increase in intra-EC trade from which we should benefit significantly.</P>
    <P>This Government have a lot to be proud of.  We have introduced a level of consensus between the social partners from which we should all benefit.  Given the comments made in the House this morning, I think everybody is now supportive of this mechanism, regardless of who is in Government.  We have overseen a level of inflation which is the envy of Europe and it continues to remain low. Our policies have ensured a balance of payments surplus of record proportions in recent years.  Our Exchequer borrowing requirement, at 2.5 per cent, is at a level which would have seemed impossible a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The fight against unemployment remains to be won.  We must bring to that task the same level of commitment and energy with which we have tackled the other considerable difficulties we faced and successfully overcame.  The House can be assured that the Government will <Col N="1682" /> spare no effort to bring about the conditions which will ensure that the problem of unemployment, which remains at a high level, will eventually be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate my abiding concern for reasoned and reasonable debate.  The issues of employment and the state of public finances are the real issues to be tackled in this House.  The Government ought not be diverted or deflected from the real job on hand.  The task is maintaining and advancing the progress, economic and otherwise, which has been the hallmark of this Government.</P>

      <P>Given the speech made earlier by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, it is apparent that the appointments of the two Ministers who are the subject of this motion will be confirmed this evening although I say that with some trepidation. Since that is the way it is likely to go I would like to offer my congratulations to Deputy Ahern on his appointment as the new Minister for Finance.  In terms of the talent available to the Taoiseach it is about the only sensible rational decision he has made in regard to the entire Cabinet. I am not saying that the skills Deputy Ahern brought to bear with such effect in the area of industrial relations are necessarily singularly suited to the Department of Finance but he has been, in my experience as spokesperson on labour and as a former trade union official, the best Minister for Labour that this State has seen in the years I have been following politics and industrial relations.  I would like to take this opportunity to wish him well as Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not he can bring both sides of the road with him on the economy is another issue.  I will say a few words about <Col N="1683" /> that later because I was not buoyed up too much by the section of his speech on the economy which I heard since I came into the House.  He trotted out phrases such as &ldquo;business confidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;upswing in world economic activity.&rdquo;  He said that our economic problems are due to the fact that we have more young people coming on to the labour market than is the case elsewhere in Europe and that emigrants are returning but it seems this is not going to mark any change from the failed economic policies which have got us into the situation we are in now.  Nonetheless, I offer the Minister my congratulations and they are sincere.</P>
    <P>Nobody, not even the person most acquiescent to the charms of the Government Press Secretary, has so far described the new Cabinet as a Cabinet of all the talents.  It is extraordinary that some of the people who have performed so weakly are still in place.</P>
    <P>When reference is made by many of the media commentators to all the talent on the backbenches I very often regret that I went astray in my early political career and did not join Fianna Fáil because it seems that any kind of outburst about the weather, a football match or whatever entitles one to be described as talented and available to serve in high office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 10, 40, 56 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the contributions which the Minister for the Environment and I made to a debate on motor insurance in this House on 2 and 3 July 1991 &mdash; Vol. 410 No. 2, columns 377-409 and Vol. 410 No. 3, columns 672-718 of the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of these contributions details of a comprehensive list of measures to improve the environment for motor insurance, including insurance for <Col N="1685" /> young drivers, identified by the Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance and subsequently endorsed by Government, were given.</P>
    <P>The measures announced but not yet implemented, including the introduction of the necessary legislation by the Ministers for Environment and Justice, are being given priority attention.  The Deputies will appreciate that questions about road traffic legislation and legislation in relation to the courts are properly addressed to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that, when implemented, the measures identified by the Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance will have a positive impact on motor insurance costs generally, including the cost of insurance for young drivers and for drivers of small commercial trucks. However, Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs in 1992 or later unless the general public, including motorists, play their part by increased awareness of the need for road safety.</P>
    <P>Indeed the report to which Deputy Howlin refers welcomes the measures identified by the Inter-Ministerial Group, presses for their implementation and refers also to the responsibility that motorists have in terms of road safety and the cost of injury compensation.</P>
    <P>An EC wide survey carried out by a French research company in 1990, based on a selection of family cars, found that Ireland had the highest third party motor insurance rates in the EC while Irish comprehensive rates were the third highest in the EC.  In both instances the survey indicated that the Irish rates were substantially in excess of the EC average.</P>
    <P>In any market the price of motor insurance is substantially determined by the cost of claims and research by my Department suggests that the average cost of motor insurance claims in Ireland is considerably higher than most of the other EC member states.</P>
    <P>I would point out that unless and until the claims experience, including the <Col N="1686" /> claims frequency and levels of compensation paid to victims of road accidents in Ireland matches that obtaining in other European countries there will be divergences between motor insurance premia in Ireland and those applying in other countries.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that there is no way that motor insurance premia will rise by 25 per cent this year. They will rise somewhat over the year but substantially below that figure because many of the companies have already reported an improved situation in so far as the courts and awards are concerned, in some respects at least but not, unfortunately, in all.  I have before me, and which has already been referred to by me, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Environment a substantive list of legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Consumer Association of Ireland's magazine <i>Choice</i> indicated that rises would be of the order of 7 per cent to 25 per cent this year?  Is he further aware that for a great number of people, particularly young people it is the difference between being able to go to work and not, especially in rural areas?  This issue was highlighted more often than any <Col N="1687" /> other in the local elections.  Will the Minister agree that it is time not to tinker with legislation &mdash; we tried that in the Courts Bill previously &mdash; but to take a bold initiative to try, as New Zealand has done, to transfer the cost of insurance to motor fuels or some other bold initiative which would allow the majority of people to afford the insurance of their motor vehicles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the magazine article to which the Deputy referred. However, what he is saying is very different from what he said a minute ago.  He now said that the increases will range from 7 per cent to 25 per cent, which is very different from saying that the increases will be 25 per cent.  Many of the increases will be 7 per cent, 8 per cent and 9 per cent.  In the case of some companies there may be increases of 25 per cent where they have not imposed an increase for several years, which is the case in respect of a number of companies.  I am well aware of the need to try to be as radical as possible in tackling this problem, because it is a very serious one.  I established an inter-ministerial group and I helped to get them to agree to quite an extensive list of legislation.  I had a genuine commitment from the Ministers and Departments concerned to implement those as quickly as possible.  I am not sure that transferring the cost of motor insurance to fuel would be helpful to a country which is, as we are, heavily dependent on tourism.  It would have considerable inflationary costs.  We have a pretty poor public transport service here and, as the Deputy pointed out, many people need a car to go to work where in similar circumstances in other countries they would not.  It would penalise unduly.  There are other ways of approaching it.  One I have looked at from time to time, but which I am afraid I am not likely in the short term to get the establishment to agree to, is the possibility of having awards made by bodies or fora other than the very expensive courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the National Prices Commission were disbanded in 1986 and detailed price control procedures generally were ceased.  This was done by the then Government to encourage price competition and to promote greater price awareness among consumers.  The emphasis of this Government is to further strengthen competition legislation and to that end a new Competition Act was brought into force by my order on 1 October 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans to reintroduce detailed <Col N="1689" /> price control in respect of alcoholic drink, as I believe that it discourages competition and indeed fuels an inflation mentality.</P>
    <P>In the absence of price control, there is no onus on drink manufacturers or publicans to notify me of any price adjustments. Consequently, I have no official information which might allow me to meaningfully comment on the appropriateness of any drink price increases. Notwithstanding that, some of the reported possible price increases seem to be quite excessive.  Publicans and others in the drink trade should bear in mind that by our historical standards we have an abnormally low rate of inflation in this country and wage increments are currently extremely low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a huge variation in the price of a pint of Guinness in country areas as compared with Dublin areas?  There is also a huge variation in prices in the Dublin market, ranging from £1.65 to £1.90 per pint?  I am informed that in some upmarket pubs, which I do not frequent very often, the price of a glass of Guiness is £1.10.  In view of the fact that the Minister has a free market mentality in trying to promote competition, is he aware of the powers under the Restrictive Practices (Intoxicating Liquor and Beverages) Act, 1965, which have been revoked?  Would the Minister consider reintroducing this order in view of the wide variation in prices in the Dublin market and the inherent insistence by licensed vintners and the trade generally to increase prices at times such as Christmas when there is high demand?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have obviously considered the question of reintroducing price control and I have taken into account the views of different organisations and people.  The two most relevant offices in this regard are the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Consumers Association of Ireland, both of whom recommend quite strongly against it.  I am aware that there <Col N="1690" /> is a huge variation in prices of intoxicating liquor throughout the country, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  I hope the Deputy is not suggesting that all prices should be the same at the upper end of the scale.  People should exercise choice more frequently than they do in terms of where they go.  I do not believe that the reintroduction of price control would be effective but what I could do &mdash; I have told publicans' organisations that I will do so if I see evidence of abuse &mdash; is reintroduce a standstill order along the lines of that made in 1988.  That would be bureaucratically a little difficult and it would create a great many problems for publicans.  Therefore they would be well advised to try to keep their prices competitive.</P>

      <P>All I can conclude is that the Minister has not much regard for the pint drinker, particularly the Guinness drinker.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, as the Minister has pointed out, has no powers in respect of collusion on prices but he has powers in respect of price display.  Would the Minister inquire as to the price of a pint in any licensed premises before he buys it?  The normal procedure is that the consumer would ask for a pint before asking the price and they would pay out whatever it cost.  In an ideal world people should shop around but people who are thirsty will not do that, particularly at Christmas time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister most sincerely for the indication he has given that he is prepared to widen the powers of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in view of the importance of the European Directives that will be enacted.  There is a need for the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to have general powers to intervene in urgent cases, but he has not got these powers at present.  I am thinking of the Scandinavian countries where when an urgent matter arises the Director of Consumer Affairs can act rather quickly to remove a product from the market.  Here the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has to get permission from the court to act in such cases.  An example would be the removal of certain toys from the market at Christmas time or certain products which might be harmful to the consumer.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade cannot deal urgently with these matters because of cumbersome procedures that he must go through.  Would the Minister undertake <Col N="1693" /> to change this position to give the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade wide-ranging powers in relation to urgent matters?</P>

I am not aware of any manner in which he is inhibited in dealing quickly and urgently with, for example, safety considerations.  In those cases he can move expeditiously.  If the Deputy has any particular enactment or regulation in mind that creates a problem he might write and let me know and I will consider it.  I will certainly take the general views which he has expressed into account in any future amendment of this type of legislation or regulations.</P>

May I ask the Minister if, arising from that report or from the inability of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to do anything about the matter, he has any further recommendations or proposals to deal with the matter as pressure is being exerted on a great number of small retailers who do not have the same credit facilities as the ESB?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> However, at present the Director can only make a price fixing order relating to food, and even this power is restricted. He has no power to request a manufacturer to withdraw an offending product from the market.  He can ask a retailer to withdraw the product but he cannot force the manufacturer to withdraw that product even if it is imported.  This is the difficulty facing him.  In the light of the restrictive powers of the Director of Consumer Affairs, particularly in relation to consumer matters, I ask the Minister to undertake an urgent review to give the Director of Consumer Affairs wide-ranging general powers which would allow him to deal immediately with urgent matters, particularly around this time of year.</P>

In so far as being able to force retailers, but not manufacturers, to take a product off the market, I am not sure what regulation the Deputy is referring to, but I presume it was thought sufficient to force the retailer to take the product off the market because if he takes it off the market the public cannot have access to it.  However, if there is any loophole, I will certainly look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the existing voluntary code is completely inadequate to cope with the saturation children-directed advertising which we experience around this time of year?  Does he accept that in a country where more than 250,000 people are unemployed and a great many people are on low incomes, this saturation advertising effectively turns the festive season into a season of misery for the many families struggling to make ends meet.</P>

      <P>I agree that the voluntary code is not much use and that is why I welcome the fact that my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications will very shortly publish and bring into effect a statutory code in so far as television advertising is concerned. I think most of the damage and heartache of the type to which the Deputy refers is caused by advertising on television rather than in any other medium.  I agree with him that it must be very distressing for a great many families with young children to see the form of advertising that goes on television, and I look forward to the statutory code curbing the worst excesses of that to a considerable extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9, 27, 54 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> The overriding objective of the Government is to promote a comprehensive series of measures that will effectively tackle unemployment, as spelt out in the Programme for Government.  These measures include firm management of the economy and of public spending, projobs tax reform and specific measures to promote growth in particular sectors of the economy such as agriculture, forestry, marine, tourism, modern industry and services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development and upgrading of our indigenous industrial base, I would point out that I initiated a comprehensive review of our whole industrial policy last summer.  The Government are committed to acting in a speedy and decisive manner in relation to the findings of this review.</P>
    <P>As regards the anticipated level of job creation this year, in so far as manufacturing industry and international services are concerned, the overall jobs target for the three year period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is 60,000.  It was pointed out in the programme that recession in the UK and US may retard developments. Because of this, it was pointed out that there may be fluctuations around the planned annual job target of 20,000. Final figures for job creation this year will not be available until the State Development agencies have completed their annual employment surveys some time in December.  However, latest indications show an outturn which, bearing in mind the international situation, will substantially meet the target for 1991.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the House should appreciate the difference between job creation and the current unemployment figures.  There are particular demographic factors, including the age structure of the Irish population, the natural increase in the labour force coupled with net migration flows, and participation rates that have combined in the past year to give an erroneous impression of the underlying state of the Irish economy. The Irish economy must generate proportionately more jobs annually than any <Col N="1700" /> other EC country just to hold unemployment at current levels.  This creates major difficulties in making inroads on reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>The preliminary labour force estimates to end-April 1991, show that employment in industry and services increased by 50,000 since 1987 and 29,000 since 1989.  This was clearly not enough to absorb growth in the labour force but it is essential now that we continue to maintain the policies that underpin development.  The creation of sustainable jobs is a long term process and one which cannot be fulfilled by short term stop gap policies.  The OECD has said in relation to Ireland: &ldquo;persistence with the considerable policy efforts already embarked upon provides the best chance for the continuation of the impressive economic performance achieved over the past three years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to persist with their policies, in consultation with the social partners, so as to create and maintain the conditions for sustained employment growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the erroneous impression to which the Minister has referred, the fact remains that we still have 260,000 people unemployed.  Deputy O'Malley is the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister primarily responsible.  I should like to ask him whether he was surprised at the revelation in the employment labour force survey that there were 5,000 fewer people at work last April.  Will he agree, in the light of the acknowledged failure of the indigenous sector of Irish industry, that the commitment in the Programme for Government sector is extremely vague and that the time has been reached when the House should be discussing specific measures to mount an asault on the unemployment problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware, as is every member of the Government and, I suppose, every Member of the House and every person in the country, of the very severe unemployment figures.  However, <Col N="1701" /> I sought to contrast that side of the equation with the employment creation side, which is relatively satisfactory.  I say &ldquo;relatively satisfactory&rdquo; in the sense that by comparison with any other European Community country our rate of job creation is exceptionally good.  The fact is, however, that we must achieve a rate of job creation way in excess of any other European country in order to even stand still.  Given the world's current economic climate and the undoubted recessions that exist in two of our major trading partners, 1991 has been a difficult year. There are, tentatively at any rate, rather better prospects for 1992.  We cannot be sure of that until some time in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a &ldquo;relatively satisfactory&rdquo; performance and said that our rate of job creation has been exceptionally good by comparison with our European partners, but surely the facts of the matter are, as exposed by the labour force survey figures, that 5,000 fewer people were at work &mdash; we are talking about people at work not the number of unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Last April there were 5,000 fewer people at work.  I am asking the Minister, in view of boasts by various Ministers about the number of people at work showing an improvement, whether it has shown a retrogressive step and that that is a cause for alarm and no cause for congratulating ourselves on a relatively satisfactory performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to put the matter in perspective.  The Deputy will know that the labour force survey showed up an abnormal decrease in agricultural employment in the past year.  Why that was I am not quite sure; it may have something to do with the Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  The decrease was about three times greater than usual and for that reason it has had an impact on the overall figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave the Deputy the figures for the <Col N="1702" /> increase in industrial employment, industrial jobs created and international traded services.  They are the matters in respect of which I hold overall responsibility. I cannot deal specifically with other aspects such as agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply made specific reference to control of public spending and efforts to promote growth in the economy as a vehicle to generate the necessary employment to reduce unemployment figures.  I suggest to the Minister that since the late eighties we have had high growth rates in the economy and control of public expenditure and together with that we have had unprecedented levels of emigration and increased unemployment.  Will the Minister comment on his assertion that those measures alone will generate the jobs necessary?  I also wish to refer to the point made by the Minister about the growth of indigenous industries being a solution to unemployment problems. The current Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals, it is estimated by independent analysts, will cost 16,000 PAYE jobs, not to mention the jobs lost in farming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that in recent years we have had almost no net emigration; in fact, we may well have had net immigration in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the possible net <Col N="1703" /> immigration, and the normal substantial increase in the labour force that happens every year anyway, we have to achieve even higher employment growth rates than we have succeeded in doing.  Obviously, overall economic policy is very important in that regard.  The control of public expenditure is very important and has contributed to economic improvement here in recent years.  What is also important, at this juncture when so much change is occurring, is to consider our fundamental industrial policies in a broader sense than just in terms of agencies and so on, which is the way that this country has tended to consider industrial policy.  I look forward to receiving what I am sure will be a refreshing and radical report at the end of this year from the review group of distinguished and capable people which I set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the fact that seems to be evident to everybody, that our industrial and investment policies seem to have failed to meet today's requirements?  Does he accept that such a high proportion of unemployment, with 265,000 people being unemployed and more coming on to the labour force, is completely unsustainable? Does he accept that at a time when East European countries are attracting vigorous investment from Japan and elsewhere we seem to be failing in our efforts to attract investment of the nature that will resolve our unemployment problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes the error made by many people in thinking that industrial investment to create industrial employment generates the only kind of employment that can be created.  In virtually every country industrial employment is a relatively small proportion of overall employment.  In developed countries employment in services generally takes up by far the highest proportion of the work force.  The proportion in services here is lower than that in many other comparable countries, and that is where the greatest pick-up will occur.  We <Col N="1704" /> should bear in mind the fact that our tourism industry has not grown at arything like the rate it should have since about 1970.  In particular that has been the cause of the loss or non-creation of a great many of service jobs which would have been created otherwise.  Manufacturing employment has a very important part to play but it is not, as is often maintained, the sole source of job creation nor can it ever be.</P>

Would the Minister agree that it was quite apparent that the former Minister for Finance, representing the Fianna Fáil Party, clearly stated that jobs would not be created by tax reform?  Furthermore, would he agree that a policy of overreliance on international investment at the expense of creating a native industry base will not solve our jobs problem?</P>

Would the Minister say whether, in the creation of the jobs about which he spoke, different regions of the <Col N="1706" /> country were specifically highlighted, that is, regions that have suffered through specific loss of jobs?  Were they taken into account in the creation of those jobs or were they brought about by way of a national policy on job creation which permits industrialists to decide wherever they want to establish plants?</P>

      <P>The IDA, as has always been their practice, identify particularly black spots throughout the country, whether they be counties or areas within counties, where they feel that special efforts are warranted.  They revise that practice from time to time as requirements dictate.  Unfortunately, the very fact that a place is a black spot in terms of industrial investment must mean that it is a black spot for a particular reason. Therefore, it is more difficult to overcome the problems there.  Appropriate agencies, in particular the IDA on a national basis, make every effort to alleviate the most serious aspects of the problems.</P>

Would the Minister for Industry and Commerce care to comment on the growth or otherwise of the black economy or on the numbers employed therein, saying whether he agrees that the pressures of taxation and the disincentives to establish businesses are some of the principal factors driving people with initiative into the black economy in the first instance?</P>

      <P>The most significant development of late concerning the GATT negotiations was the Summit last week between the EC and US at which both sides displayed a determination to bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion at the earliest realisable date and, if possible, by the end of his year.

      <P>Specifically, problems in relation to such important areas as agriculture, tariff cuts, subsidies, protection of intellectual property and liberalisation of services are still far from being resolved, though in relation to agriculture some progress appears to have been made and discussions are continuing on the basis of a new and more realistic approach to the subject by the US.</P>

For example, it will be important for us that the tariff negotiations will result in increasing real access to markets, including the US market, for our exporters and potential exporters.  Similarly, we must ensure that any new controls on subsidies do not outlaw EC regional aid or aid for research and development.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we will need to be especially alert to possible movements in the area of agriculture, about which I am very concerned that the impact of an eventual GATT agreement on farmers' incomes should be minimised and that the coherence of the fundamental principles and mechanics of the Common Agricultural Policy must be preserved.</P>
    <P>So far at all meetings of Community Ministers I have attended since our Presidency, both formal and informal, I have made our position abundantly clear.  I have repeatedly emphasised the need for concessions from the US to ensure a balanced agreement.  I have also made clear the need for realistic and politically realisable results in agriculture.  I have also insisted on the continued involvement of Community Agriculture Ministers as crucial to the process on the basis that it is they who will have to implement the GATT results in agriculture, it is they who will have a particular insight into what is realistically possible in this area and it is they who can best dovetail GATT concessions with the current issue of Common Agricultural Policy reform. As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I welcome the increased hope of a speedy and successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round.  Such an outcome is very important if world trade is to continue to develop.  It is easy to overlook or underestimate the importance of the multilateral trading system in guaranteeing continued access to markets abroad and the growth of EC prosperity.  For Ireland, as an open-trading economy, it is, I think, particularly important that clear and <Col N="1709" /> unequivocal rules are in place to govern international trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept or regard as unfair the public view that the question of farmers' incomes has dominated this issue?  Does he think that in seeking to minimise the impact on farmer incomes there could be an adverse impact on our facility as a country which depends on trading our services and products internationally? What is he doing to reconcile getting the best deal for our farmers with ensuring that there is no adverse impact on our industrial and other trading sectors?</P>

      <P>I am conscious of that all the time.  I said so in my reply.  I am simply pointing out that the lack of realism on the part of the United States is perhaps greater in regard to agriculture than in regard to certain other areas. I listed four areas in which very poor progress was made.  In each case the Community offer was realistic and relatively generous by comparison with that of others.  Those areas, apart from agriculture, are tariff cuts, subsidies, protection of intellectual property and liberalisation of services.  We are conscious that there must be a balanced package in the Uruguay Round.  We have constantly deplored the incessant concentration of the United States on agriculture, trying to ignore their obligations anywhere else.  As a result, a great deal of media attention has been focused on agriculture to the exclusion of other matters. That is a pity.</P>

Is early agreement likely on all aspects in this round of negotiations?</P>

      <P>I am not sure that what the Deputy has said is necessarily the view of the United States.  President Bush has repeatedly said he is very anxious to see an early conclusion to the Uruguay Round.  He realises how important international trade is for the US economy.  My feeling is that if there is not a successful conclusion of the round by the early months of 1992 it will not be possible to have a conclusion in the later part of the year; the US Presidential election campaign will have started and it is very difficult at a time like that to negotiate a complex international trading treaty because of the domestic pressures that will then arise.  I see a window of opportunity between now and February and I hope that the United States will join with the Community in trying to avail of that opportunity.  The impression that was given and the atmosphere generated at The Hague last weekend seemed positive, but I am advised that no specific deals were done or agreements reached. Let us hope that the positive atmosphere will be transformed into actual agreements at Geneva in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister assure the House that he and his European colleagues will be at one in their determination to eliminate hidden subsidies which the US has been known to use in the past in relation to agricultural and other products?  Is he fully aware of what happened in the US in relation to what they called the reform of agriculture?  It meant the depopulation of large areas of the rural mid-west and making many towns and villages derelict.  If that were to happen here, with our unemployment rate, we would face disaster.</P>

They are well aware of our view in the European Community that the type of policy they pursue in the United States with a very small number of very large farmers would be entirely inappropriate in the European <Col N="1711" /> Community and especially in a country like Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the State bodies under the aegis of my Department, the provisions governing actual or potential conflicts of interest of board members are set out either in the enabling legislation, or the relevant memoranda and articles of association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> In general, these bodies require that, where a board member has any direct or indirect material or financial interest in a company or concern with which the board proposes to make any contract or in any contract which the board proposes to make, the member shall disclose to the board the fact of the interest and the nature thereof.  The board member shall not take part in any deliberation or decision of the board relating to the matter and shall not vote on a decision relating to it.  Disclosures of this nature are recorded in the minutes of the board meeting.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific bodies mentioned in Deputy Bruton's question, the relevant legislative provisions governing disclosure of interests are as follows: IDA &mdash; Industrial Development Act, 1986, First Schedule, Paragraph 4 (3); An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; Export Promotion Act, 1959, section 9; and EOLAS &mdash; Science and Technology Act, 1987, section 16. Copies of these Acts are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The statutory requirements are supplemented by arrangements within the State bodies concerned.  In the case of the IDA for example, it is the practice for all members of the IDA Authority, board and all grant committees to declare to the secretary details of companies in which they are involved.  This information is recorded in the secretariat and is taken into account when project documents are being circulated to the committees. Members considered to have a conflict of interest do not receive documents, nor are they aware of or participate in discussions on those projects.</P>
    <P>The State bodies under my aegis are overseen and monitored through a combination of departmental involvement at board level and regular contact with the bodies in question.</P>
    <P>The conduct of employees in relation to actual or potential conflict of interest is a matter for the boards of the bodies in question.  I understand, however, that conditions of service and staff handbooks contain provisions designed to cater for <Col N="1713" /> any potential conflicts.  As these procedures fall within the day-to-day administration of the bodies concerned, they are not matters in which I have a direct function.</P>
    <P>I have recently written to the chairman of each State body operating under the aegis of my Department emphasising the Government's concern to ensure that the highest standards of integrity are followed throughout the public sector.  In addition, I am also in the course of meeting with the chairmen of each of these bodies during which the existing procedures and systems in place in the bodies to ensure the maintenance of the highest standards of conduct are being discussed.</P>
    <P>From the discussions I have had to date, I am satisfied that the procedures in place are adequate for the maintenance of the highest standards of integrity.</P>
    <P>I expect that the recently completed report by the Secretary of the Department of Finance concerning the principles which govern the relationship between Departments of State and State bodies under their aegis, together with subsidiary and associated companies, will be considered by Government shortly.</P>

      <P>The report in question was presented to the High Court by the court appointed inspectors.  The report, therefore, is within the jurisdiction of the court.  I understand that the court immediately considered the matter of an apparent leak based on a submission by the inspectors concerned and reached a determination which, <i>inter alia,</i> reemphasised the confidentiality of the interim report.  In these proceedings, Counsel on my behalf indicated that there was no breach of confidentiality by my Department.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the first interim report of the inspectors was, under the order of Mr. Justice Lynch, made available to the Minister only and no one else, can the Minister explain how the deputy business editor of the <i>Irish Press,</i> Miss Geraldine Harney, was the only journalist to receive that leaked report?

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very concerned from reading the article in the <i>Irish Press</i> that there was an apparent leak of some of the matters which may have been in the report.  I might add that most of the items which purported to have come from the report were in fact matters of public record in affidavits which were opened in court anyway.  Nonetheless, I was concerned because the journalist involved claimed to have seen a copy of the report or part of it.  I immediately asked the Secretary of my Department to institute an investigation in the Department to see if there was any possibility that the report or any part of it might have got out of the Department.  I am assured that the report was seen by only three senior officials within the Department.  I did not divulge the contents of the report to any person.  I am at a loss currently to know how this could have happened.</P>
      <P>While I am the only person to whom a copy of the report was formally given, other than the court, it is a fact that a large number of lawyers would have access to the report in the course of their duties. It is not correct to suggest that I am the only person who had a copy of the report. Nonetheless I am, of course, very deeply concerned and anxious to ensure, if at all possible, that we discover the source of the alleged leak.</P>

The Minister's record of publishing reports is not great if we are to go on the Fair Trade Commission's report.  I submit it is imperative that the full publication is made available to the House.  The taxpayer is entitled to know the conditions attached to this export credit insurance scheme in view of the widespread public concern on the issue and that it be published as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands the nature of the report.  The report was set up to advise me and my Department on what should be done in the future by the State in relation to export credit insurance and, in particular, whether we should stay in it or whether we should get out of it because of the heavy losses we had sustained.  It in no way deals with the previous exports of beef to the Middle East or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>That is an amazing answer from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister may recall that I raised this matter about 12 months ago in the House.  At that time he expressed concern and said that he would like to see the playing fields levelled in relation to the advantage the ESB network of shops had over private electrical traders. Does the Minister not accept that the ESB have an unfair advantage over the private electrical traders in the collection of the cost of items sold through a payment system which can be extended over a period of 12, 18 or 24 months?  Does he not accept that the finance which is obviously available to the ESB to carry <Col N="1721" /> the cost of the equipment sold should be available at the same rate of interest to private traders?</P>

      <P>I have given my views on this on a number of occasions and I am sure the Deputy is aware of them.  It is a policy matter for the Minister for Energy rather than primarily a competition matter for my Department.  I have been urging the Minister for Energy to make a decision in regard to it.  I understand, from a conversation I had with him on this topic yesterday, that he expects to be in a position to make a decision on it very quickly.  I understand that to be in a week or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is passing the buck here, as it is his resposibility. Is the Minister aware that the ESB have an unfair advantage so far as the person who delivers the item bought at an ESB shop is not the person who fits it up, yet the private network &mdash; the person who will deliver it &mdash; will generally fit it up?  There is a hidden cost here which is being taken up by the ESB consumer which is a further unfair advantage and should be looked into by the Minister if he is not already aware of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy overlooks the fact that I had the whole matter investigated a year ago by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Unfortunately, he did not come up with the answer the Deputy would like and which, perhaps, privately I might have liked; he came up with an answer which said it was a matter of public policy and would have to be dealt with by the Department and the Minister concerned.  I have sent the report to the Minister for Energy.  It is a matter of major significance, but I expect a decision in regard to it very shortly.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are a great many people involved in this, both on the private side, who, as I have often said, are being treated unfairly.  That is why I am surprised at the director's report &mdash; and of course many people in <Col N="1722" /> the ESB where the numbers employed are very large.</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress I talked about the hype and expectation engendered among our people by the kind of headlines we had been reading in recent days about the wide ranging changes we could expect under the new Government.  Whereas the motion before us concerns the appointment of two Cabinet Ministers, there have been a good number of changes as well.  I was offering the opinion in all honesty and modesty that not even the commentators most favourably disposed towards the Government would describe it as a Government of all the talents.  In that respect I was commenting specifically on the fact that a number of commentators have taken time out to help inform public opinion on the multi-talented backbenchers of Fianna Fáil.  I was offering the view that at night instead of counting sheep to get to sleep I often run my eye across the backbenches of Fianna Fáil and try to establish where is this multilayered talent that was on offer to the Taoiseach.  I have some difficulty in discovering the same extent of talent as did some of the media commentators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has shown a perverse desire to exclude such talent as is undoubtedly available to him. There are talented backbenchers in Fianna Fáil.  There are two in the House now, Deputy David Andrews and Deputy Brian Cowen, who in my humble opinion would be eminently suited for Cabinet office.  One could add to them Deputies like Noel Dempsey and one or two others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely trying to be helpful and am trying to make the point that talent is undoubtedly available to the Taoiseach but that, for some perverse reason, the Taoiseach has decided not to avail of it.  It is bad enough for a Taoiseach to find himself without the most able of the Ministers of State, people like Deputies Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and Michael Smith who have been banished to the wilderness.  But to pass over somebody of the credentials of Deputy Joe Walsh, for example, in a critical ministry like Agriculture, a ministry that was never more critical than at the present time in terms of the far reaching revision of the Common Agricultural Policy policy, and the interests of agriculture in the current GATT discussions, is incomprehensible. It seems to me that somebody of the calibre of Deputy Walsh, not to mention the geographic considerations which have been bruited about by the Cork papers this morning, was particularly suited to improve the capacity of what most commentators fairly agree has been a very mediocre Cabinet.  The Taoiseach is to be utterly condemned in regard to why that has not happened. When the ordinary person looks at the Cabinet he is not interested in personality squabbles but in whether or not the new Government can provide him with a job, with a hospital bed or can stop his young teenager from emigrating.  People want to know also if the Cabinet can produce more houses for the homeless or for those on the housing lists.  These are the questions the people are asking.  There is not any cause for joy in the Cabinet that has been put before the House today for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are any number of areas that one could choose to examine.  One of the Ministers being nominated is being asked to take over the ministry of Education. In the whole affair relating to Deputy McDaid there must not be anybody more grateful for the excessive time it has taken up in the House than Deputy Noel Davern because it has steered attention away from the right of the Opposition to scrutinise the credentials of Deputy <Col N="1758" /> Davern for the post of Education above all ministries.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to expect that somebody who is elevated to Cabinet status has a track record and has expressed his views and vision for the future of our society or for the future of the portfolio he expects to take over.  I can think of very little that equips Deputy Davern for this ministry, whether it is his extraordinary position on what ought to be done to desecrate the Rock of Cashel or his position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the travelling community. I cannot envisage such a man being able to pilot an Education Bill worthy of its name through this House, an Education Bill that has been looked forward to by all interests in education for some years now.  I cannot envisage such a man piloting through curriculum change which is so desperately needed if the onward progress and modernisation of Irish society is to continue.  I cannot envisage Deputy Davern, representing the views he does and is entitled to represent, tackling the gross inequity and scandal of the higher education grants scheme, a scheme that presents the obscenity of very wealthy members of the farming community, for example, finding it cheaper to buy townhouses for their children who have the benefit of education grants to attend one of our higher education institutions, compared with the situation of the bulk of my constituents who are PAYE workers if they are lucky, some of them on reasonable incomes, who have not a hope in hell of qualifying for a higher education grant under the present system.</P>
    <P>That is one of the most serious inequities in Irish society.  At the end of the day it is education, above all else, that transmits privilege in this society.  Education is the main weapon of social mobility and great tracts of our society are excluded from participating in the higher education system.  From what I know about Deputy Davern, and I know a reasonable amount about him, he is not the kind of man likely to introduce any equity into the disgraceful higher education grants scheme as it is operated at the moment. <Col N="1759" /> I do not think that Deputy Davern is the kind of man who is concerned with equality of access to education at all.  It is a shame that the introduction of free education by a Fianna Fáil Minister that did so much to contribute to the development of Irish society over the last couple of decades is now in reverse and that there does not seem to be the same passion or vision to create a more egalitarian society in the new look Fianna Fáil front bench.</P>
    <P>Having a look at Deputy Davern's background on the most underprivileged in our community, the travelling people, I cannot imagine that he will take any great step that will give those unfortunate people a leg up.  I seem to remember James Connolly at some stage making a reference to the fact that you can judge a society by how it treats its lowest grouping. By that yardstick, the manner in which this society has treated the travelling people, we do not have very much to be proud of or to boast about.  Deputy Davern's track record in the area leads me to believe that the culture of poverty and disease that is imposed on the children of the travelling community is likely to be the same when he leaves the ministry as when, if he is confirmed this evening, he goes into it.</P>
    <P>The prospect of Deputy Michael O'Kennedy taking over at the Department of Labour is something that, try as I have to envisage it, escapes me.  If there is any man temperamentally unsuited to the Department of Labour, it must surely be Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.  Deputy O'Kennedy always presents the image of the small boy who accompanied the others to rob the orchard but who, because of timidity or whatever other reason, did not proceed but got the blame.  That is not the kind of temperament that one needs in the present climate of industrial relations.  To send Deputy O'Kennedy into the present industrial relations climate is like sending a one-legged man with no whistle to referee a match.</P>
    <P>We have heard much from this Government about the importance of the <Col N="1760" /><i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and we have heard much praise, well merited, heaped on the head of the outgoing Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern.  We are told that this whole concept of consensus enshrined in the programme is a cornerstone of the economic policy of this Government.  I am afraid that Deputy O'Kennedy has none of the bedside manner of his predecessor in the Department of Labour.  I know already that many practitioners in the industrial relations business are alarmed at the prospect of Deputy O'Kennedy taking over that particular ministry.</P>
    <P>The question of housing was touched on very briefly by the new Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon.  At the end of Question Time today Deputy Bernard Allen tried again to raise a question, which I also have sought to raise in this House, concerning the rate of repossessions at the moment of people's homes because of the economic climate and the rate of evictions.  Deputy O'Hanlon came in and repeated, mantra-like, the Government's new commitment under the policy for social housing.  The Fianna Fáil backbenchers know as well as I that, whereas there are some good, new and imaginative things in the policy for social housing, it will make only a minimal impact on the extent of the housing crisis we have in this country now.  There has been a major retreat from public sector housing on the part of this Government. The local authority of which I am a member has 2,000 families on its waiting list alone.  I spent the time that I was out of this House today, which was not very much, trying to deal with the situation, for example, at Kilmahuddrick in Clondalkin where a young woman and her baby have been forced to pitch a tent for the last two nights at Clondalkin because she cannot get housing and there is no prospect of housing from the local authority. That is how bad the housing crisis is.  If all the new Minister for the Environment is going to offer to the homeless, to the young families on the housing list, to those living in overcrowded and unsuitable conditions is the prospect of implementation of the social housing <Col N="1761" /> policy, then all I can say is God help the homeless.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a direct swop with the Minister for Education who will now become the new Minster for Health. I want to welcome her appointment.  I want to express the hope that her appointment removes the suspected shadow of the Knights of Columbanus from the Custom House and that issues like family planning will find themselves dealt with on a serious basis by the new Minister for Health rather than the outrageous, backward, anachronistic, shameful treatment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Statements were made in this House yesterday which carried extremely serious implications and a potential for grave damage to the national interest.  It is my duty, not only as a member of the Government, but in my particular role as Minister for Justice, to set the record straight.  The cut and thrust of political debate is something with which everybody in this House is familiar.  We all expect the odd hard knock but we all know instinctively that there are certain limits.  Yesterday those limits were exceeded in a manner which in my view was quite unprecedented.  I think many people in our society who rightly take pride in this State, in the principles for which we stand and the institutions to which we give our allegiance, will be saddened to see what some Opposition Deputies set out to do here yesterday evening.  Those whom we represent will wonder whether we have forgotten that we are Members of a parliamentary body that rightly has worldwide respect.  They will wonder whether some among us have forgotten that they are successors to parliamentarians on all sides of the highest calibre and integrity. They will wonder why Deputies Noonan and Taylor-Quinn, in particular, sought to employ weapons dreaded and long since shunned at another time and in another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody here is fragile enough to suggest that the generalised questioning of party antecedents and the like which takes place in all parliamentary institutions from time to time is personally wounding.  But it is a different matter when one individualises and then proceeds to aim one's invective at those named.  I hope that today Deputy Noonan in particular has come to realise that when a former Minister for Justice <Col N="1763" /> stands up in this House and describes one of its Members as a Provo fellow traveller, using newspaper coverage as his shield he has almost certainly gone too far.  He is talking about an organisation which has been responsible for the murder of many of our citizens and the murder on a far greater scale of many of our neighbours in Northern Ireland, England and elsewhere and which threatens the very security of our State.  I sincerely urge him to reflect in the current climate on the implications of leaving on the record the implication that anybody here is a fellow traveller of the proponents of terror and destruction.  As a former Minister for Justice, he knows better than most that he has gone too far. I ask him to withdraw this very serious innuendo and I leave it to his conscience to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>Getting on to the wider issue of damage to the national interest, I want to comment in particular on the outrageous remarks made by Deputy Madeleine Taylor-Quinn.  The Deputy has not struck a blow for the security of this country; she has in fact struck out against civil liberties, against a free society and against the freedom of the individual which we in this country have come to cherish, thanks to the sacrifices made by our forebears in the earlier part of this century.  State security is a double-edged sword.  It should be wielded to protect the individual against threats both from within and without our society, but it must also be a guarantor of the freedom of the individual to go about his business, to express himself as he wishes in an open society and to speak to whomsoever he wishes without fear of defamation and indictment.  It was she who described the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, the proposed Minister for Defence and the Attorney General as a combination of people of irresponsible and untrust-worthy character who should not be entrusted with responsibility for the security of the State.  She went on to speculate that secret information of a security nature might be leaked to terrorist organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1764" /> Quite apart from the unwarranted character assassination involved and the gross abuse of the privilege afforded to statements made in this House, I must ask if the Deputy has any idea of the potential damage she causes to the national interest in making comments of this kind.  Are her party leader and her party colleagues happy to let statements stand on the record which &mdash; make no mistake about it &mdash; have the direct effect of stoking the prejudices on which terrorism feeds?  Is she not aware that lives are at stake, because prejudice has it that this society is ambivalent on the question of terrorism?  Has she no awareness of just how utterly wrong and dangerous it is to imply that members of the Government and their principal law officer, the Attorney General, might act in a way likely to aid the cause of terrorism?  Not once since I became Minister for Justice, or during the period of any of my predecessors, has there been the slightest suggestion that the proponents of terror enjoy either the support or sympathy of any of the officeholders whom the Deputy sought yesterday to malign.</P>
    <P>Let me put on the record once again this Government's commitment to do everything in our power to combat the violence of the Provisional IRA and other paramilitaries.  Nobody should be in any doubt about that commitment. Both by words and actions we have demonstrated time and again our opposition to the men of violence.  Since I became Minister for Justice in 1989 I have emphasised on numerous occasions this Government's commitment to ensure that every effort is made with all the means at our disposal to combat the violence of the Provisional IRA and other paramilitary organisations.  I repeat that commitment now in the light of further atrocities committed by the Provisionals last night in Belfast which resulted in the murders of four persons and serious injury of others, including a five week old baby.  As the Taoiseach made clear in the past, this commitment is willingly given because there is a duty on all of us, and it is one of the primary duties of Government, to do everything we can to protect <Col N="1765" /> our fellow Irishmen and women in the North from murder and mayhem.</P>
    <P>Despite the protests of the vast majority of the people of this island and their rejection at the ballot box the Provisional IRA have continued their campaign of violence for over 20 years. Because of this campaign of murder it is an essential ingredient in relations between both parts of this island that co-operation in all areas be effective, in particular in the area of security co-operation. I want to emphasise that excellent work is being done in this area.  I would draw the attention of the House to the comments made by the RUC Chief Constable on 20 October when he said that relations with the Garda were at an all time high and that there was probably the best relationship between both police forces that there had ever been.</P>
    <P>Since 5 September 1989 I have attended 16 meetings of the Inter-governmental Conference under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish Agreement where discussions have taken place between the British and Irish Governments on all aspects of co-operation.  I have carried out my duties in this area on behalf of the Government with responsibility and total respect for the privacy of the Conference procedures.  I am sure everybody here will understand my deep resentment over the inferences made in this House last night, particularly by Deputy Taylor-Quinn, which would suggest otherwise. As one of the Ministers who participates directly in the extremely sensitive work of the the Anglo-Irish Conference process it is vital that my credentials in the matter of State security be beyond doubt.  It is well beyond the bounds of acceptable parliamentary exchange, however heated the occasion may be, to imply that the credentials of those who are directly charged with the onerous responsibilities involved in State security are at issue when we all know that that charge is utterly without foundation. I trust that if she does nothing else here today the Deputy, or if she fails to do so, her party leader, will not allow her remarks to stand unchallenged on the record.</P>
    <P>Returning again to our commitment, I <Col N="1766" /> would point out that security co-operation has resulted in a considerable financial burden on this State since 1969. As well as the cost in human terms the violence has cost us dearly in the loss of jobs, investment and opportunities.  It is estimated that additional security costs in 1991 arising from the troubles in the North will be of the order of £118 million and since 1969 the Exchequer has incurred expenditure of approximately £2 billion as a consequence of the Northern situation.  This is an indication of the lost of opportunities which our society has had to endure as a result of the Provisional IRA campaign, as scarce resources were diverted away from areas of potential growth and investment and into the unproductive area of security.  It is also an indication of our commitment to ensure that the campaign of the paramilitaries is tackled head on and that all resources possible are made available to ensure that they will be defeated.</P>
    <P>Many of our people will have great difficulty in understanding some of the contributions from Deputies opposite on this Government's record on extradition. Can they really expect us to believe that they are sincere in what they say?  Have they forgotten that it was during the term of office of a Fianna Fáil Government, of which I was also a member, that the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, came into force?  Do they not remember that, while a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government introduced that legislation, they also chose to defer bringing it into operation?  It then fell to a Fianna Fáil Government to create the conditions under which it was possible for that legislation to come into force by enacting the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, with the additional safeguards that Act contained.  Both that Fianna Fáil Government and the present Government have never shirked their responsibilities in regard to the extradition process or the difficult decisions which at times have had to be taken.  Can anybody on the Opposition benches seriously doubt this without doing grave injustice to the facts?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> The events of the past day in this House have been characterised by the selfless action of Deputy James McDaid, who rather than contribute in any way, through no fault of his own, to any instability in the Government, chose to relinquish the opportunity to serve his country in Government.  The Members opposite have reserved their greatest bitterness for Deputy McDaid, a young man who has graced this House during the past two years with his honesty, integrity and foresightedness.  They sought to hurt him by ascribing to him views which he deems to be repugnant, hateful and against everything he holds dear.  As a medical practitioner, he respects life. Before entering this House, his professional life had been dedicated to preserving, nurturing and even saving lives. As a Deputy, he has sought to represent the community in this House and to participate in the efforts directed to the betterment of the lives of the people of Ireland.  How can this man be accused of being a fellow traveller?  How can this man be accused of betraying the confidence of his countrymen to the terrorist who seeks only to destroy, wound and kill?</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and commend to this House my colleague, Deputy Vincent Brady, who is to be the new Minister for Defence.  Deputy Brady has given many years of fine service to this nation and I am confident he will serve our people well as an excellent member of the Government.</P>
    <P>The record of this Government speaks for itself.  There is no place in this House for innuendo, smear, guilt by association. Let us all, for God's sake, agree on this. There is no place of refuge nor is there support or sympathy in any shape or form in any of our hearts or minds for terrorism. Let us, for God's sake, agree on this also.  Finally, let us agree that the message we send forward to those who suffer at the hands of terrorists and those whose days and nights are surrounded by fear of terrorist activitiy is not a message of ambivalence, as implied in the House <Col N="1768" /> yesterday evening, but a message of revulsion towards all acts of terror and a clear signal that the purpose of all our endeavours in discharging the duties of office with which we are entrusted is the attainment of peace, justice and reconciliation on our beloved island.</P>

      <P>This morning afforded me the opportunity to contemplate the seriousness of the outrageous behaviour of the Opposition which we witnessed here yesterday in the debate on the nomination of Deputy McDaid to a Cabinet position.  The political attack came from a poisonous coalition of Ceausescu's political children in The Workers' Party and Franco's mongrel foxes in the Fine Gael Party.  Anyone who has to listen to their political litany of character assassination based on assertion and innuendo can only have been appalled.  I see a former Taoiseach smiling.  It will rightly be regarded as a day of infamy in debates in Dáil Éireann and the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, would have known days of that nature.</P>
      <P>We were treated here yesterday to the spectacle of Deputy Noonan acting as a one-man political pogrom band.  He should have known, as a former Minister for Justice, that one must be prudent and careful in ensuring that temperate language is used and that the safety of any individual should not be put at risk.  The editorial in today's edition of the <i>Irish Press</i> sums up the central point I wish to make.  It states:</P>
      <P>The background of any new Minister and his past actions are a matter of legitimate concern for the Dáil.  Seeing that a constituent who has been charged with a crime and whom one sincerely believes to be innocent gets justice, however, is not just a legitimate concern of a TD but his duty. That is all that Dr. James McDaid did and for that his chararcter was subjected to assassination by Mr. De Rossa and Deputy Michael Noonan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> Their attacks not only smack of McCarthyism but pay scant heed to the possible danger in which their words could put a TD who lives so near the Border.</P>
    <P>For a former Minister for Justice to label a Deputy as a fellow traveller of the IRA is irresponsible in the extreme.  In the James Pius Clarke case Deputy McDaid acted honourably.  It is sad &mdash; but worse still &mdash; dangerous, coming from such a prominent member of the Fine Gael Party, to seek to politically assassinate a man who did no more than seek to protect the constitutional rights of a citizen and constituent.</P>
    <P>That action was all the more prudent when the highest court in the land decided to refuse to extradite Mr. Clarke. It should be a matter of pride that a Deputy would act in the way in which Deputy McDaid did.  Deputy Noonan, despite his protestations about the IRA, aped their most notable and foul method of political and character assassination shamelessly and with some degree of enthusiasm, even in front of the man's wife and children.  Last night in this Chamber we witnessed the ugly sound of tramping feet echoing the darkest days in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>U2 are supposed to be representative of a new, emerging, more tolerant generation dedicated to pluralism and fair play.  Perhaps the new album &mdash; Achtung Baby &mdash; which they are releasing this weekend could be dedicated to Fine Gael or The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>We also witnessed here yesterday Deputy Taylor-Quinn, some sort of self-appointed political Salome, looking for the head of an innocent man on a plate. We saw the second known launch of the MTQ missile; in its first manifestation it was a harmless and rather silly projectile which had as its target a comedy programme called &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo;.  The MTQ missile then sought to have the programme blown out of the water and called for its banning.  It was a puerile episode.  However, the mark 2 model of the MTQ missile yesterday was a more sinister and sophisticated secret weapon <Col N="1770" /> brought forward by the Fine Gael Party. This one was indiscriminate in its target, fuelled on the bile and inherited hatred of a bankrupt party, its purpose was to suggest that if Deputy McDaid was nominated to the position of Minister for Defence it was liable to compromise the security of the State.  The tenor and substance of such an outrageous charge leaves even the most hardened politician gasping.  Its implications were so serious it should immediately have been withdrawn. We still await its withdrawal.</P>
    <P>When the people are making up their minds where they stand in relation to this whole sordid affair they should compare the dignified withdrawal of Deputy McDaid yesterday evening with the headstrong refusal of Deputy Taylor-Quinn to apologise for her unfounded political smear.  It will be to the continuing discredit of Deputies Taylor-Quinn and Noonan as long as they refuse to withdraw their unwarranted claims articulated in the House yesterday.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that this week we would move on from the mire in this House which people witnessed in the past couple of weeks; it is expected of us.  I am making this contribution for the sole purpose of expressing my abhorrence of the tactics used here yesterday to do down a personal friend whom I know to be a decent and honourable man.  A decision will be taken this evening to reestablish the sort of political stability for which everyone is crying out.  I will look back on these traumatic days with deep regret.  The political responsibility for this débacle lies with the Opposition benches. The unforeseeable reaction to Deputy McDaid's nomination seems to have been influenced by comments from politicians outside the State whose observations are made from a position of ignorance.  It is a sad day when they find willing and enthusiastic allies in this House.  It reflects a mentality that our people despise and from which the Opposition parties cannot hide.</P>
    <P>Let us now move on to the real political business of running the country.</P>

      <P>I very much regret the sentiments expressed by Deputy Cowen who is, apparently, leaving the House. When the Minister for Justice suggested that we had become too involved in personal abuse, instead of directing his attention to this side of the House he might have given a warning to Deputy Cowen who must expect me to make some comments in reply to what he said. However, he has now left the House.  He does not seem to be concerned with the effects of his remarks.  I very much regret that one so young should have gone so deeply into the past.  He talked about the mire which the people had witnessed over the last few days and I agree with him but it is inexcusable for him to condemn other people and then to do the same thing himself.</P>
      <P>Like many Members on all sides, I would have liked to have had the opportunity of dealing with these new appointments as a whole, to suggest what they might do for the image and performance of the Government. Unfortunately, we have been distracted from the seriousness of one appointment in particular by the personal comments made.  I would have had many comments to make on the different appointments.  I see originality in some of them although I find difficulty in understanding others.  However, I will have to leave that to another day because of the importance of one appointment and the short time available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three weeks ago today the members of the Police and Security Committee of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Association, which included Members of both side of this House, including Deputy Cowen and myself, and a number of British MPs, were on a fact finding mission to Northern Ireland and Border areas, including those in the Republic.  We were unanimously impressed, particularly by what we saw and heard on this side of the Border.  We also had the opportunity to learn at first hand at a meeting in Enniskillen of the terror being experienced, particularly by Protestants living in Border areas as a result of the barbarism of the IRA.  I say &ldquo;unanimously&rdquo; because <Col N="1772" /> that applied not only to the Irish delegation but the British delegation also. The message which was repeated time after time was the necessity for the fullest confidence in the security forces and the fullest co-operation between the security forces North and South.  We heard that message in Belfast and in Enniskillen no matter who we talked to on whatever side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Last night in Belfast there was a further escalation towards what I described on other occasions as incipient civil war. Unfortunately, there will be more of the same because there are people on both sides in the North who see their future as dependent on the promotion of civil war. It is against this background that we should assess the nomination of Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence.  In doing so we should remember that in politics, particularly in anything to do with Northern politics, invariably the perception is more important than the reality.  When Deputy McDaid was asked by the media why he thought he was being appointed to this position he speculated that it was for the purpose of winning an extra seat in his constituency of Donegal North-East.  He speculated that on a radio programme at 1 o'clock yesterday and, apparently, later.  After 20 years and the deaths of more than 3,000 people, with the barbarities of Enniskillen, Le Mans and others, after millions of words of sympathy, regret and condemnation, the motivating factor for appointment of the first or second most sensitive position in the Government of this State is the petty party political consideration of a possible extra seat for Fianna Fáil in the next election.</P>
    <P>I have on previous occasions registered my disappointment at the extent to which partitionism is endemic in our body politic on this side of the Border.  Many Members in this House no longer think in terms of the island or the nation as a whole.  The immediate instinctive response relates to the Twenty-six County State.  I can find excuses for it, on occasions there is even justification for it, but not on this issue.  In view of the importance of the position of Minister <Col N="1773" /> for Defence for the safety and well-being of all the people on this island, I find it particularly hard to understand this partitionism, this concentration on constituencies and on petty political matters, particularly by some people who describe themselves as Republicans.  I fail to understand it.</P>
    <P>I have said that I regret very much the personal abuse in this debate &mdash; indeed it has been the case over the past number of weeks.  Much play has been made about remarks attributed to my colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan.  There has been much vituperation heaped on his head by many people, including the Minister for Justice who left the House during my speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan, in his contribution, questioned the judgment of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, in appointing Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence when it was clear that the publicity which had arisen from the involvement of Deputy McDaid in the extradition proceedings in the case of James Pius Clarke would reflect very poorly on the Government and the country and that this publicity would make the position of Deputy McDaid as Minister for Defence untenable.  Deputy Noonan did not say that Deputy McDaid was a fellow-traveller of the Provisional IRA.  What he said was that the publicity surrounding his appointment would depict him as such.  Lest there be any doubt about what Deputy Noonan said I will quote from the record:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach also has a duty to explain, in the face of all this publicity which I have drawn to the attention of the House and which I am sure the law officers of the State drew to the attention of the Taoiseach, the reason he would discount the publicity which has surrounded Deputy McDaid and proceed with his appointment.  This country is going to be shamed once <Col N="1774" /> again tonight when all the wrong signals will go out internationally.  I have no doubt that this will be the leading item on BBC, UTV and RTE and that the message will be that the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland is appointing a Provo fellow-traveller to be his Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>That is the message that Deputy Noonan predicted would go out, and how right he was, as those who watched the British media last night will know.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to the remarks made by the Minister for Justice in relation to my colleague, Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  I will take those remarks in the context of the necessity for securing co-operation between the security forces North and South and of the quotation of the Chief Constable of the RUC in relation to the great co-operation that exists at present. The remarks of the Minister merely add to the contention of Deputy Taylor-Quinn that there should be no excuse whatsoever for pointing the finger at the security forces on this part of the island or their political masters for suggesting the slightest equivocation in relation to the men of violence.  The Minister's remarks merely underline the contention of Deputy Taylor-Quinn.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record my view of Deputy McDaid.  I have had the advantage on a number of occasions of having conversations with him on Northern Ireland, as I have had with Deputies of all parties in this House.  I judge people as I find them, irrespective of party. I have found Deputy McDaid to be honest and sincere.  He has told me of his detestation of the IRA and their methods.  I admire what he did in this House last night and the dignified and principled way in which he did it.  I regret that his great day so quickly turned to disappointment and possibly despair for him and for members of his family, but I also have to say that I consider him to be naive and inexperienced and for these reasons, to have compromised himself to the extent that he did, he should not have been offered nor should he have accepted <Col N="1775" /> a position as sensitive as that of Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about the innocence of James Pius Clarke, and we heard it again from Deputy Cowen.  James Pius Clarke was a self-admitted member of the IRA.  He was convicted twice in this State in connection with IRA crimes and was convicted in Northern Ireland for attempted murder.  In the Maze Prison he was a member of the Provisional IRA group and he escaped as part of that group.  He would not have been allowed to escape unless he had been very closely involved in that group.  When free, he reinvolved himself in IRA activity, including a gun battle on the Donegal-Fermanagh border in which two IRA men and a member of the security forces were killed.  In Portlaoise Prison he was a self-admitted IRA member and was admitted to the IRA group in that prison. The fact is that Clarke was not only a member but a prominent member of the IRA and part of the leadership of the IRA in that part of our country.  I know from long experience &mdash; which Deputy McDaid did not have at that time, but I sincerely hope he has learned since &mdash; that there can be no ambivalence in relation to the use of violence to achieve political objectives.  I would not describe myself as a black or white politician, but this is one issue where there are only two sides; black or white, for or against.  One cannot be a spectator, particularly if one is a public representative.  When asked about his involvement with Clarke and known IRA supporters outside the Four Courts, Deputy McDaid is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> today as saying: &ldquo;I travelled down on Monday, and that happened to be Tuesday and I happened to be there purely as a spectator outside the court&rdquo;.  Let me say to Deputy McDaid that he just cannot happen to be there in the company of those who have murdered, destroyed and maimed and who seek to overthrow the democratic institutions on this island, North and South. Deputy McDaid was naive to believe otherwise and, unfortunately for him, he is now paying the penalty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> As I said, Deputy McDaid was inexperienced and nave.  These factors alone might be considered sufficient to debar him from a most sensitive high office but the appointment was offered to him by someone who is neither nave nor inexperienced; someone who because of personal experience is more qualified than anyone in this House or probably anyone in Government in the history of this State to know of the sensitivity of the position of Minister for Defence who, because of his own deep involvement in searching for a solution to the Northern Ireland problem, should be aware of the perception of this appointment in Northern Ireland, Britain and elsewhere.  I would like to say directly to the Taoiseach &mdash; perhaps he is watching on the monitor &mdash; and if not to the Tánaiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My time is running out, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  There have been many attacks on my Fine Gael colleagues for raising and concentrating on this matter. I, like them, have only one defence, we have done what we were elected to this House to do.  Our democratic institutions must be protected and must be protected with credibility.  Whatever may be said about this appointment, it certainly lacked credibility.  It lacked credibility even on those benches over there, despite the noises that some of them are making. If we had not focused on this matter, others outside this House, outside this State would have deserved the laceration we would have received from the abdication of our duty had we not raised it in the way that we have in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that, after the events of the last couple of days, on the national scene, this matter may seem to be something of an anticlimax but, for the people of Nass, affected by it, it is very much one of current and ongoing concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> I had the opportunity to raise other aspects of the matter here on 16 October last.  Of course, since then we have seen the full effects.  I should like to tell the Minister of State just what has been the extent of the problem.  A committee of concerned residents carried out a survey of the area of Naas affected by this contamination of the water supply. It was discovered that out of 3,242 people surveyed, 2,702 were affected, that is 83 per cent of them; in fact 88 per cent of the children surveyed were found to have been affected.  The symptoms varied from mild to very severe: some 17 per cent of the people affected had mild symptoms, 34 per cent moderate symptoms and 48 per cent very severe symptoms. The effects on children were even worse with some 52 per cent of them being severely affected.  Twenty-six people were hospitalised.  Symptoms from an incident which appears to have taken place in the last week of September continue to manifest themselves.  The House will see clearly that it has been a very worrying occurrence.</P>
    <P>On 16 October last I sought to find out what measures were in place to deal with an incident like this.  The then Minister for the Environment outlined to me what were the steps included in the emergency plan.  In all conscience I would have to say that all of those steps have been taken but they appear to me to have been taken too slowly and too late to deal with the problem that manifested itself.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, some weeks ago in this House I gave the opinon &mdash; and I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State on this &mdash; that, when an incident of this type occurs, the public authorities, from the very beginning, should adopt the view that the worst has happened and act accordingly.  As I said then, if one over-reacts at the beginning nobody will come to any harm, whereas if one under-reacts at the beginning people will suffer.  That has been the case here. That is why I support the call made at a meeting in the town of Naas on Friday evening of last week for a public inquiry <Col N="1782" /> into the incident.  I do not want a public inquiry to be held simply to apportion blame.  I want a public inquiry held to determine whether the guidelines for action that we have in such cases are adequate; whether there is any clear specification of how soon action has to be taken and who is responsible for taking such action.</P>
    <P>There were two previous incidents of serious water contamination in other parts of the country in previous years. Happily neither resulted in people being hospitalised.  Twenty-six people were hospitalised in Naas.  Therefore, it is a matter of very serious concern.</P>
    <P>We need a public inquiry held to determine the adequacy of the guidelines, to clearly allocate responsibility for taking action quickly and to decide whether there are any further steps needed in our planning process to prevent what seems to have been the reason for this difficulty, which was the location of a sewer in close proximity to a water supply source which was at the time, I admit, out of use. Nonetheless we need to inquire why and how it happened that a sewer was located so near to a water supply that might be used and, in this case, was brought into use last year to deal with the inadequate water supply to Naas.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister of State agree to establish a public inquiry with terms of reference broadly along the lines I have indicated, not, as I have said, to apportion blame but to determine the adequacy and clarity of the guidelines and to clearly allocate responsibility for early action if such an incident should recur?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for again raising this serious matter.  I share his concern about the gravity of this incident.  I agree fully that we must learn from it so that anything similar is avoided in future in any area of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that, at national level, the maintenance of drinking water quality has been a clear priority for Governments in recent years. <Col N="1783" /> In May 1986 my Department issued a major circular to local authorities entitled &ldquo;Guidelines for Emergency Planning to Protect Water Resources&rdquo;.  This provided a framework and a model for the development of action plans in response to instances of drinking water pollution.</P>
    <P>In 1988 formal regulations setting quality standards for drinking water were made for the first time.  These regulations clearly prescribe the duties of local authorities in relation to drinking water; in particular, they established a systematic sampling and monitoring regime for public and private water supplies.  In September 1989, in order to assist local authorities to fulfil their duties under the new regulations, my Department published a &ldquo;Handbook on Implementation for Sanitary Authorities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should say also that the Government are committed to making much fuller information available to the public on the general quality of water supplies.  The first ever comprehensive report on the quality of Irish drinking water has just been published.  I intend that further reports of this kind will be published annually from now on.</P>
    <P>The Government have also pledged substantial ongoing support for new and improved water supply systems.  The environment action programme indicated an expenditure programme of £300 million for this purpose during the nineties.  This level of investment has been maintained to date.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is particularly concerned with the need for an inquiry into the Naas situation.  I accept the need to assess the causes of, and the responses to, this grave incident.  With a view to this, my Department have already asked for a detailed report from the local authority.  A senior engineer from my Department has also gone to Naas to get a first-hand report on the circumstances involved.</P>
    <P>A preliminary report from the local authority was given to my Department at an early stage.  Now that the immediate health-threatening situation has been overcome, the local authority are, at my Department's request, undertaking a <Col N="1784" /> more detailed assessment of the incident. When this report is received in my Department, I assure the Deputy that we will evaluate it thoroughly and speedily. In particular I will be anxious to advise all local authorities of any necessary improvements of the emergency response regime.</P>
    <P>I believe that this approach best meets the urgent and immediate requirements of the situation.  I would not wish to delay the quick implementation of necessary improvements by seeking to establish a formal public inquiry at this stage.  I can assure the Deputy that when the final report is received we will take whatever action is needed in this important matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahearn gave notice of her intention to raise the serious cutbacks proposed by the South-Eastern Health Board for St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, due to inadequate funding by the Department of Health and the hardship which will result for patients and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The announcement that from 24 November the gynaecological ward in St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, is to close for one week in every four caused shock and consternation, not only among the staff of the hospital but in the entire area.  As a result, only emergencies will be catered for by St. Joseph's Hospital, which covers south Tipperary, west Waterford and north Tipperary south of Thurles.  In addition to this closure, two nursing posts will be lost in a hospital already operating on a minimum staff allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These cutbacks are as a result of a cash crisis in the South-Eastern Health Board <Col N="1785" /> and the growing chaos in the health service nationally.  The result of this decision will be that the current waiting lists for gynaecological services will be increased, there will be early discharges and a reduction in the quality of patient care caused by the reduction in nursing posts. The entire staff of St. Joseph's Hospital have indicated their grave concern, not for themselves but for the patients under their care.  They feel frustrated knowing that they will be unable to provide a proper and adequate service for patients owing to this decision.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister that the crisis in Clonmel is a direct result of inadequate funding allocated by this Government to the South-Eastern Health Board.  The entire blame for the closure of this ward one week in every four and the loss of two nursing posts rests with this Government.</P>
    <P>At present, St. Joseph's Hospital is approximately £250,000 over-spent.  This is through no fault of the hospital, as the budget given is too small and is based on a period when the hospital had a lesser workload.</P>
    <P>In recent years the number of patients and the amount of work has continued to increase, yet the budget to the hospital has continued to decrease.  The South-Eastern Health Board realise the difficulties, but they are cash starved and cannot help.</P>
    <P>This is happening at a time of year that tends to be the busiest in regard to medical cases, yet the hospital is expected to work in this period and in the future with fewer staff.  I warn the Minister that so great is the concern of the staff that they have informed the South-Eastern Health Board that they will not take responsibility for patients when the cutbacks are implemented from next Sunday.  Surely we can accept their bitterness when debts of £9 million could be written off at Knock Airport and there was no scarcity of money for Carysfort College.  Yet the lives of the patients at St. Joseph's Hospital are put at risk for an additional £250,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take immediate action to provide the additional finance <Col N="1786" /> to maintain the present allocation of staff in that hospital and allow the gynaecological ward to remain open on a full-time basis.  We cannot accept the implementation of a decision which will affect the lives of women in south Tipperary. The lives of our women and the welfare of our staff in St. Joseph's Hospital are surely worth more and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this decision taken by the South-Eastern Health Board does not have to be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I welcome this opportunity to explain the current position in relation to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel.</P>
      <P>The provision of services at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, is a matter in the first instance for the South-Eastern Health Board.  Each health board are responsible for determining the funding needs of the individual hospitals under their management and for the establishment of priorities within the approved allocation for the board's area.</P>
      <P>My Department are in regular contact with health agencies, including the South-Eastern Health Board, on financial, personnel and service matters.  In discussions the South-Eastern Health Board have indicated that they have been experiencing pressure on their cash resources.  However, my Department have taken all possible steps to meet the board's needs within the limits of their approved bank overdraft and cash profile based on approved spending limits, including adjustments of the allocation agreed to during 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must stress that, while every assistance possible will continue to be extended to the board, it is ultimately a matter for each agency to maintain spending within approved budgeting limits.  All agencies were notified in their letter of allocation for 1991 that expenditure must be contained within the limits of the approved allocation and that any expenditure excess arising in 1991 will be <Col N="1787" /> a charge against the 1992 allocation.  I understand that a number of corrective measures are being introduced by the board in order to deal with their financial situation.</P>
    <P>As regards St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, I understand that the board have closed six beds, from a total of 177 beds and that the number of posts at the hospital has been reduced by nine, out of a total staff complement of 221.  These limited restrictions were necessary because of the financial constraints under which the board, in common with all health agencies, have to operate.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise, in accordance with undertakings which have been given in relation to health services in 1991, that the non-capital allocation of the South-Eastern Health Board will be adjusted to take account of approved increases in expenditure, including pay, increases in the rates of allowances and certain services-related items.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health also met the chief executive of the South-Eastern Health Board to emphasise once again the vital importance of achieving agreed service targets within budgetary limits so as to ensure that the level of expenditure is geared to enable the health board to deliver the approved 1990 level of service in 1991.  There is no information available to me in the Department which suggests that lives are being put at risk in this hospital.  I am satisfied that this hospital is operating very efficiently, is taking its responsibilities very seriously and has considerably increased its throughput of service during 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important matter.  While this issue may not seem important on the surface it will cause much inconvenience to people involved in business.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications is present to reply to the <Col N="1788" /> debate because the new method of dialling will cause most inconvenience to people involved in business, tourism and manufacturing.</P>
      <P>There are other considerations involved.  First, I should like to establish whether Telecom Éireann sought permission from the Minister to agree to the dialling code.  When British Telecom first requested Telecom Éireann to change the dialling system did Telecom Éireann consult the Minister?  It is important that we establish this point.  This is far too important an issue for a unilateral decision to have been taken on it.</P>
      <P>In future Dublin will be treated as a foreign capital as far as telephone calls from Northern Ireland are concerned. Telecom Éireann should have consulted the Minister before they agreed to this proposal with British Telecom.  In the past people from the North used the code 0001 to get through to Dublin.  In future a person from Newry will have to use the British international access code, 021, Ireland's international code, 353 and the Dublin code to get through to a number in Dublin which may have seven digits. The implications of this for business and our tourism industry are serious.</P>
      <P>It was irresponsible of Telecom Éireann to agree to this proposal in order to facilitate British Telecom.  Telecom Éireann are going down the same road as British Telecom in terms of privatisation. While Telecom Éireann may have agreed to change the dialling code in order to facilitate British Telecom it will also be of benefit to them on the road to privatisation. This change has been introduced by the back door and Telecom Éireann should not have agreed to it. Essentially what we are doing is increasing the number of communication barriers between the North and South at a time when we should be reducing them: we are putting further obstacles in the way of greater communication between the two parts of this island.  This is not desirable in this day and age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can give me a reasonable explanation as to why Telecom Éireann took this rather strange <Col N="1789" /> decision to accede to the request of British Telecom.  I sincerely hope the Minister had an input into this decision as its implications for this country are quite serious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Lyons) Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Lyons)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this issue has been raised by my colleague from Cork.  I should point out, in response to the questions he raised, that the dialling code used by British Telecom subscribers to all Telecom Éireann numbers is a matter for British Telecom to decide, just as the codes here are decided by Telecom Éireann.  I do not have a function in this matter.</P>
      <P>The code previously used between the UK and Dublin and the Six Counties and Dublin was 0001.  British Telecom have now altered the code in each case to the full international number 010353 followed by the relevant Telecom Éireann number.  The new code system was introduced by British Telecom for technical reasons arising from the fact that Telecom Éireann had introduced seven digit numbers in the Dublin area.  Telecom Éireann's proposal to introduce the seven digit numbers was conveyed to British Telecom approximately two years ago.</P>
      <P>I should point out to the House and the Deputy that a country code is not a political statement.  The use of a country code is a convenient technical device to get access to a telecommunications network. Nevertheless I should point out to the Deputy that I am interested in his point of view and I do not disagree with what he said.  On that basis I agree to have this matter further discussed with both Telecom Éireann and British Telecom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter in order to ask the Minister to get Government agreement to underwrite a loan from the banks for Waterford Harbour Commissioners to the extent of £9.6 million to assist in the construction of a new <Col N="1790" /> container port at Bellview in Waterford Harbour.  The estimated cost of this project is £17.1 million.  The harbour commissioners have already got approval for a grant from Brussels to the extent of £7.5 million but need an additional £9.6 million to set about building this project.</P>
      <P>The people of Waterford are outraged that in the late seventies and early eighties the port of Cork got grants totalling £30 million directly from the Government for various developments in that port.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners are not seeking grant-aid directly from the Government, they are merely asking the Government to guarantee borrowings from the banks who are loathe to give the money without a Government guarantee.</P>
      <P>The construction of this new container port is necessary as Waterford port is the largest container traffic unit in the country. At present it handles 30 per cent of all container traffic.  In spite of this it is operating to a degree of 50 per cent over capacity; it is in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 364 days of the year.  It needs this additional facility to satisfy its customers.  A good deal of custom has to be turned away because of the inadequacy of the present facility. I am asking the Minister to encourage the Government to agree to underwrite &mdash; we are not looking for money &mdash; this loan so that work can begin on this badly needed project which is about three miles downstream from the main Waterford port.  It would not be an asset just for Waterford &mdash; but for the nation. It would also make access costs to this country much cheaper.  Therefore, it would be a major boon to industrialists as well as the port of Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I thank Deputy Deasy for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  In reply I wish to say to him that provision has been made in the National Development Plan and in the operational programme on peripherality for expenditure by Waterford Harbour Commissioners of £15 million between now and 1993 on the <Col N="1791" /> provision of major new Lo/Lo facilities at Belview and EC aid totalling £7.5 million has been approved in principle for the project.  The first tranche, based on expenditure to date, of EC grant aid, £458,000, towards the cost of the project was paid to Waterford Harbour Commissioners in November, 1990.  In addition and as an exceptional measure State grant assistance of £200,000 was paid to Waterford Harbour Commissioners in 1990 in respect of expenditure already incurred on the project. Commercial borrowings totalling £705,500 in respect of essential preliminary works have been drawn down by the Commissioners with my approval and that of the Minister for Finance.  The second tranche, £418,000, of EC grant aid was paid to the Commissioners on 9 October 1991.</P>
      <P>Actual construction works on the Belview harbour development plan have not commenced as yet as the financing arrangements and certain other necessary agreements remain to be finalised. In this regard difficulties have arisen and Waterford Harbour Commissioners have applied for a State guarantee for a significant level of borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should advise the Deputy that the established policy is that each harbour authority, including Waterford, should be operated as a commercial undertaking <Col N="1792" /> and should be financially self-supporting. Harbour authorities should conduct their affairs so as to ensure that revenues are not less than sufficient to remunerate capital and repay borrowings.  It is not the policy to State guarantee borrowings by harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>However, I want to say to Deputy Deasy that I had the opportunity some time ago of visiting the port and speaking with the chief executive and other officials there.  I have discussed the matter with my collegue, the Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine.  Because of the importance of the location of Waterford for British and EC trade I am anxious to ensure that the Belview harbour development plan proceeds.  The Waterford project is now being re-evaluated in the light of the request from Waterford Harbour Commissioners for a State guarantee.  I expect that the reevaluation will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to say I have sympathy with the Deputy's remarks and I will support the project in any way I can to ensure, if possible, that the wishes of the port authority in Waterford can be acceded to.</P>

      <P>Insurance intermediaries are required to effect bonds in the circumstances set out in section 47 of the Insurance Act, 1989, and in the form specified in the Insurance (Bonding of Intermediaries) Regulations, 1990. <Col N="1723" /> Section 47 of the Act, and the Regulations, came into effect on 1 October 1990.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Act, 1989 (section 48) requires insurance intermediaries to maintain separate, designated bank accounts for insurance moneys.  Moneys received from clients which are properly payable to insurers and moneys received from insurers which are properly payable to clients must be lodged to these accounts.  Life assurance moneys and non-life insurance moneys must be kept in separate accounts.</P>
      <P>In the first year of operation of the relevant provisions, 1 October 1990 to 30 September 1991, the insurance intermediary was obliged to effect a flat bond for £25,000 when the combined turnover of the designated life and non-life accounts exceeded £25,000.</P>
      <P>In subsequent years and since 1 October 1991, the bonding requirement has been more onerous.  Where the intermediary deals only with non-live business, and the turnover of the designated account in the previous year exceeds £25,000, he must effect a bond for £25,000.  Where the intermediary deals only with life business, and the turnover of the designated account in the previous year exceeds £25,000, he must effect a bond to the value of the greater of 25 per cent of the turnover or £25,000.  Where the intermediary deals with non-life and life business the bonding requirement will be satisfied when he effects a bond to the value of the greater of 25 per cent of life turnover or £25,000.</P>
      <P>The bonding requirements are being kept under review and, should it appear prudent to do so, I will have no hesitation in amending the Insurance (Bonding of Intermediaries) Regulations.  However, I have no grounds at present for believing that the current levels are not appropriate.</P>

      <P>The question of timber availability is a matter which falls within the area of responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Energy, who has informed me that Coillte Teo, is satisfied that there is sufficient timber available on this island to warrant the establishment of a pulp mill.</P>
      <P>The IDA and Coillte have been working closely to identify potential investors who might be interested in establishing a pulp mill in Ireland.  Discussions have been held with a number of companies already.  All discussions between the IDA and potential investors are, of course, confidential to the parties involved in accordance with normal IDA practice. An early decision is not expected, however in the light of the currently depressed state of the pulp and paper markets worldwide.</P>

      <Quest>if Eolas were directed to make available to a football club (details supplied) lands currently designated as the headquarters for the new National Metrology Centre, for use for recreational purposes, against the wishes of the employees of Eolas and without the formal consent of the board of Eolas and that as a consequence of Eolas's compliance with this direction work on the proposed National Metrology Centre could not take place for at least five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by Eolas that they are exploring ways of allowing the club in question the use, for a period not exceeding five years, of about 0.5 acres of unused Eolas land for recreational purposes.  This matter is one for negotiation between both parties and any <Col N="1725" /> agreement will require the approval of the Eolas board.  It should not affect the timescale for the National Metrology Centre proposed by Eolas.</P>

      <P>The details requested by the Deputy regarding applications for career breaks and job sharing, are set out in a tabular statement.</P>
      <P>Refusal of applications to participate in either scheme arose because the applications failed to satisfy the conditions governing the scheme, at the time when applications were made.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the job-sharing scheme from working halved hours to a different system is a matter for the Department of Finance.  That Department lay down, from time to time, the conditions governing both the career-break and job-sharing schemes.</P>

      <P>An intensive programme to promote the Shannon Estuary as a location for large-scale industry was undertaken by SFADCo, in conjunction with the IDA, in the second half of 1990. <Col N="1728" /> It was aimed at selected major companies of the type most likely to bring worthwhile economic benefit to the area, i.e. companies operating globally which could make use of the significant natural attributes and facilities of the deep-water estuary while satisfying the highest environmental standards.</P>
      <P>During 1990, new promotional brochures and other detailed marketing briefs on the estuary were prepared.  By the end of 1990, detailed site profiles had been prepared for a number of locations on the estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following extensive preliminary research on potential clients, detailed <Col N="1729" /> presentations were made by both the IDA and SFADCo to the more promising potentially interested companies in North America towards the end of 1990. This campaign was extended into 1991 and is being widened to include the Far East and other markets.  To date a total of 20 priority companies have been visited in the US and ten in the Far East.</P>
    <P>The initial response on the part of the companies approached was encouraging in that it confirmed that an estuary location was an attractive investment proposition for certain types of suitable major industries.  Indeed, the estuary is now an essential stop-over on all visits to Ireland by large-scale industrial itineraries and 15 of these have looked at the estuary in the past year.  However, the attraction of this kind of large-scale investment is a &ldquo;long haul&rdquo; effort, with lengthy lead-in ties before final investment decisions are made by promoters. It will be necessary therefore for both the IDA and Shannon Development to continue to promote the estuary in an intensive way over a long period to achieve results.</P>
    <P>I would have to point out, however, that location decisions are ultimately made by the project promoter and that the national and international climate for this type of investment is highly competitive at the moment.  These decisions are particularly influenced by communications and the availability of infrastructure and, in this respect, the estuary must be promoted against the inducements of highly developed sites in alternative locations.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless I would be confident that we will succeed in securing at least one major project for the estuary in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications at Question Time on 5 November 1991 informed the House of certain difficulties faced by the inquiry he had established on 14 September 1991, and the consequent recommendation in the report of that inquiry that an inspector be appointed under the Companies Act, 1990.  Arising from consultations I had with the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications I proceeded to appoint an inspector under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990 to investigate and report on the membership of Chestvale Properties Ltd. and Hoddle Investments Ltd. and otherwise with respect to these companies for the purposes of determining the true persons who are or have been financially interested in the success or failure, real or apparent, of these companies or able to control or materially to influence their policy.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, provides that the High Court may appoint inspectors, on my application, to investigate the affairs of a company if it is satisfied that any one of a number of events have arisen as specified in the section.  In this regard, I was satisfied that the known facts pertaining to this case did not extend to the circumstances set out in section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in the light of the foregoing and the fact that the main concern was to establish, in the public interest, the true ownership of these companies that I decided to proceed with an investigation under section 14.  The inspector has substantial powers under the 1990 Act.  He is in regular communications with my Department.  His work is proceeding well.  Should any difficulties arise for the <Col N="1731" /> inspector, these can be addressed.  On receipt of his report I will consider what further action might be required.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that company law is kept under review, and if I feel it needs to be changed, I will not hesitate to propose such change.</P>

      <P>When I announced the lifting of price control on petroleum products I said that &ldquo;the revocation of the maximum prices order together with the revocation of the restrictive practices order for motor spirits should lead to restructuring and greater efficiency within the industry&rdquo;.  This should manifest itself in savings arising from greater efficiency and other cost factors being passed on to the consumer.  It is less then seven weeks since these measures came into effect and I believe that more time is required to allow the industry to adapt to the new environment.  I believe that the full benefits of competition will be seen in the medium to long term.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs will be carrying out a countrywide survey of petrol prices over the coming weeks and the information collected from this exercise will be used to assess the situation.</P>

      <P>As the growth in exports is a major contributor to our economic performance, it is important to ensure that all means are taken to support and promote the activities of Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála is the Government agency with prime responsibility in this area and one of the functions of the board is the arranging of trade missions. Already this year I, or my Ministers of State, supported Irish export promotions or missions to the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, Portugal, the US, Hungary, Poland, USSR and Iran. In addition, we supported inward buyer missions from the following markets: UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Portugal and Spain.</P>
      <P>As regards forthcoming missions for the remainder of the year, I will shortly be leading a joint ABT/IDA business mission to South Africa.</P>
      <P>This year I also hosted my opposite numbers from the Trade Ministries of Japan and Korea in Dublin for discussions on trade and economic matters and these were occasions which I used to further the interests of Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>In so far as inward investment missions promoted by the IDA are concerned, I visited various countries in Europe, the US and the Far East.</P>
      <P>The 1992 schedule of ABT and IDA overseas promotional programmes and inward missions to promote trade and to encourage inward investment are being finalised by the agencies at present.  The key economic factors in overseas markets and their importance to Ireland obviously will be taken into account when these programmes are being finalised.  As a general rule, I incorporate into each mission abroad a mix of government-to-government meetings aimed at promoting Irish policies and multilateral issues such as GATT as well as direct support for export and inward investment activities aimed at developing bilateral ties.</P>

      <P>The IDA have carried out an assessment and have concluded that significant potential exists for employment creation in the hides and skins processing industry.  Of course the actual projects needed to achieve this are a matter in the first instance for individual promoters and their views in regard to the degree of processing involved and modern systems of tanning would largely determine the levels of employment involved.</P>
      <P>The IDA have informed me that they are actively pursuing promoters to establish additional processing capacity in this area.  However, they point out that realistically, due to seasonality and other factors, not all available hides and skins could be expected to be processed in this country.</P>
      <P>The promotion of specific industrial projects is a matter for which the IDA have day-to-day responsibility and I have no direct functions in such matters.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to official inquiries being carried out under the provisions of the Companies Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the High Court, on my application, appointed two inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, on 16 September 1991, to investigate the affairs of Siúicre Éireann cpt., and on 18 September 1991, the affairs of named related companies.  The inspectors presented an interim report to the court on 7 October.  Its contents by court direction are confidential.  The inspectors presented a second interim report to the court on 11 November 1991 which I understand the court today decided <Col N="1735" /> should not be published.  I also understand that the inspectors have been given a further period in which to proceed with their investigation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I appointed an inspector, under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990 on 12 September 1991, to investigate and report on the persons who have been financially interested in the success or failure of certain named companies.  The list of companies was extended to include Siúicre Éireann cpt. on 26 September 1991.</P>
    <P>The inspector presented an interim report to me on 22 October 1991 which was published immediately at my direction. On foot of that interim report, on 22 October 1991, I directed, under section 16 of the Companies Act, 1990, that a certain debenture of Siúicre Éireann cpt. be subject to the restrictions imposed by that section.  The interim report referred to possible non-com-pliance with certain aspects of the Companies Acts and, in that regard, I referred the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of possible action.</P>
    <P>I am not, at this stage, in a position to give an indication as to when the inspector will present his final report.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Companies that 113,387 private limited companies were on the register on 10 November 1991.  Of those 91,907 currently liable to submit annual <Col N="1736" /> returns, the latest data indicate that 67,337 have so done.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 15 on 26 February 1991 (columns 1457-9 of the Official Report), particularly to the references to the ongoing modernisation programme in the Companies Registration Office.  A computerised imaging system was introduced at the Companies Registration Office (CRO) from 4 May 1990 in respect of all new companies registered from that date.  The system has since been extended to include all documents received with effect from 11 March 1991.  A copy of the scanned image, similar to a photocopy of all documents received, including annual returns, is available on demand at the CRO.  I am informed that the number of such returns currently available is 38,616, as on 7 November 1991.  While the rate of registration and processing has indeed improved in 1991, the registration process has really become secondary to the scanning process.  Scanned documents are currently available to the public within ten days of receipt, whereas before the introduction of scanning, registration preceded the making available of documents to the public.</P>
      <P>Public access to company records at the CRO has been significantly improved with the introduction of the computerised imaging system.  The availability of scanned images on demand is a new service which will greatly improve the efficiency of the office.  Public access to CRO records will be further enhanced in the coming months with the introduction of remote access to scanned data by facsimile machines, thereby reducing the necessity to personally attend at the CRO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The appointment of the master of the Arklow Harbour Board dredger is a matter for Arklow Harbour Commissioners and I have no function in the matter.  I understand, however, that the master of the dredger is employed by Arklow Harbour Commissioners for approximately six months each year on a temporary and seasonal basis.</P>
      <P>The master of the dredger was recently nominated by me to the board of Arklow Harbour Commissioners.  Section 19 (1) (d) of the Harbours Act, 1946 provides that a person shall be disqualified from being appointed, elected or nominated or being a member of a harbour authority if he holds any paid office under the harbour authority.  Legal advice obtained by me states that the master of the dredger is an employee and not disqualified under section 19 (1) (d) from being a member of Arklow Harbour Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has drawn attention to a possible conflict of interest on the part of the master of the dredger by virtue of the fact that he is a commissioner as well as an employee.  In this regard I should advise the Deputy that I recently wrote to the chairmen of all the harbour boards, including Arklow, with a view to ensuring that the highest standards of personal integrity are followed by all board members and requesting them to review existing procedures and systems intended to ensure the desired standards of conduct.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many fishery protection officers, employed by the regional fisheries boards, are extremely anxious about their jobs; if he will outline the numbers employed in the regional fisheries boards' areas in 1985 and 1991; if his attention has further been drawn to the low morale of many people in the regional fisheries boards at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have to say that I am not aware of extreme anxiety on the part of protection staff in the regional fisheries boards in relation to their jobs, nor am I aware of any reason that should cause them to have such anxiety.</P>
      <P>The numbers employed in 1985 and 1991 were 380 and 288 respectively.  The Deputy should understand, however, that a total of 36 people left the employment of the various boards in the period in question under various schemes for early retirement/voluntary redundancy and their posts were not, therefore, eligible to be filled.</P>
      <P>I know that, as is the case in many State organisations in recent years, the combination of falling numbers and restrictions on budgets generally would not be regarded by all staff as the best environment for maintaining the high level of commitment and service shown by fishery board staff in the past.  I am, however, heartened by the positive attitude and dedication displayed by the boards' staff in undertaking their, at times, dangerous but necessary work in protecting and developing the inland fisheries resource.</P>

      <P>I have instructed my officials to raise the Deputy's report through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat with a view to establishing whether the case complained of was a departure from the principles agreed with the British Government and, if so, the circumstances which gave rise to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of major research programmes in which Irish companies may participate.  Essentially, these fall into two categories &mdash; national programmes operated under the science and technology development programme, and international programmes falling within the ambit of the EC framework programme for research and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of participation in these programmes is ultimately limited by the relatively low level of R &amp; D activity in Irish companies.  Out of a total of 7,706 firms surveyed by Eolas in 1988, only 872 or 11.3 per cent were undertaking R &amp; D. <Col N="1742" /> Out of this number, only 269, or 3.4 per cent of the total, had formal R &amp; D departments.</P>
    <P>The EC framework programme involves pre-competitive research undertaken by international consortia of firms and research institutions working in fields which are predominantly concerned with high technology.  Very few Irish firms have the necessary scale or technological and financial resources to participate in a programme of this nature.</P>
    <P>The national science and technology development programme commenced in 1987 and is funded from the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote.  The programme aims to increase research and development activity within firms through a broad range of measures. These measures address a number of the structural and infrastructural shortcomings which affect the low level of R &amp; D in Irish firms.  For example, the technology audits programme is designed to make firms aware of the areas in which their technology can improve their cost competitiveness.  The graduate placement schemes address skills shortages in companies by assisting firms in the employment of technologically qualified graduates.</P>
    <P>The higher education industry co-operation scheme aims to help companies utilise the research and development resources of the third level colleges by supporting joint college-industry R &amp; D projects.  Finally, programmes in advanced technology are being established to build up national competence in a number of key technologies, such as biotechnology, software and advanced manufacturing technology.  These programmes are undertaking contract research for industry as well as developing new products and technologies which will encourage the establishment of new companies.  The science and technology development programme thus represents a concerted effort to address the low levels of participation in research programmes referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Funds are made available to companies involved in research work via the research and development grants scheme.  The scheme is designed to stimulate companies to plan and undertake commercially oriented research and development as a normal ongoing part of their business.  The scheme provides for grants of up to 50 per cent of the direct costs to be incurred in research and development work, subject to a maximum of £250,000 for any one project.  The scheme is administered jointly by the IDA and Eolas and is funded from the Department of Industry and Commerce grant-in-aid to the IDA.</P>
      <P>Over the period 1 January 1970 to 31 December 1990, a total of £69,629,562 was paid to companies under this scheme. Of this amount, £5,519,396 was paid to companies in the period 1 January to 31 December 1990.

      <P>The psychologists work mainly in schools and referrals are usually made orally to them in the course of their work. My Department do not keep formal records of the number of such referrals.</P>
