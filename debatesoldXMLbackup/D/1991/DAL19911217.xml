      <P>I observe that the requests relate to the same subject matter.  I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call, therefore, on Deputy Gay Mitchell to state the matter of which he has given me notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to have the Dáil adjourned under Standing Order 30 to raise the following matter of urgent public business, to ask the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the current industrial relations situation in the public service following the unilateral decision <Col N="1666" /> of the Government to amend the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to raise the following matter of specific and important public interest requiring urgent consideration, that Dáil Éireann having adopted the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on 20 February 1991, mindful of the contributions to economic progress and price competitiveness which have been made by the trade unions in recent years, condemns the unilateral decision by the Government to breach the pay terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and demands that the original terms agreed by the Dáil be met in full by the Government in the interests of economic and social progress.</P>

May I say, for the benefit of the House, that the subject matter raised is not likely to develop significantly before the Dáil will in practice have an opportunity of discussing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is the prerogative of the Taoiseach to set the business for the day but it is a matter for the House to decide when items should begin or finish and at what stages certain Bills may be taken.  Indeed, if one reads through the rest of the Order Paper one will see that various proposals are made for the completion of various matters. I am seeking to oppose the proposal that Item.  No. 8 be taken not later than 3.45 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to facilitate the Deputy in having the matter decided by the House but I am convinced that with respect to Item No. 8 to be taken not later than 3.45 p.m., that is the prerogative of the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I will try to explain. I cannot understand how we can oppose Item Nos. 1, 2, 3 and so on which set time limits and the times for debates to begin and end, and not be able to oppose the taking of Item No. 8 at 3.45 p.m.  It is a normal procedure, where we are given the option to agree or not to agree to the way debates are taken.  Item No. 8 has been proposed to be taken at 3.45 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias de Rossa Proinsias de Rossa">

      <P>What it is doing is setting a time limit on the Committee Stage of the B &amp; I Line Bill on which debate must be adjourned at 3.45 p.m. or before Questions.  It is also dealt with at a later stage in this order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I have allowed Deputy De Rossa quite considerable time.  The Chair is quite clear in the procedure in this matter.  I am now going to put the question, &ldquo;That Business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the proposal to interrupt Business because of the completely unsatisfactory arrangements for dealing with Business today, particularly with regard to the Bill proposing to sell off the B &amp; I at less than its worth, and <Col N="1670" /> not on the basis of the proper disclosure on Second Stage by the Minister of the material facts of this case.  Fine Gael object to the attempt to push this Bill through under a time limit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Chair has ruled me out of order on the points I sought to make in relation to Item Nos. 8 and 15, I support Deputy Bruton's opposition to Item No. 1 on the Order Paper, for two reasons.  First, it sets in motion the guillotine procedure for the B &amp; I Line Bill which it is proposed to complete by 1.30 p.m. tomorrow.  The time allowed is totally inadequate in terms of the number of amendments which must be dealt with by this House on the B &amp; I Line Bill, which run close to 20 amendments.  I also object the way in which the Pensions Bill is being dealt with and the very short time being allocated to that item as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the text of the agreement:</P>
      <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I Group of Unions acknowledge the view of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications that the acquisition is in the best long term interests of B &amp; I, its employees and customers and also acknowledge his views that it will lead to the creation of an enlarged Irish-owned shipping enterprise with the resources to develop and provide an enhanced level of services to Irish tourism and export trade.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications accepts the legitimate concerns of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to the future development and ownership of the B &amp; I company and the development of Ireland's access transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To address these concerns, the Minister hereby affirms that the Government: (1) fully accepts the importance of shipping for Ireland from a strategic point of view; (2) will seek to have at all times sufficient ships on the Irish <Col N="1682" /> Register which could be utilised in times of emergency to service our strategic trading routes; (3) will continue to pursue vigorously with the European Commission Ireland's case for the funding of improvements in access transport services.</P>
    <P>The Minister also affirms that ICG have indicated to him their intention to maintain the company in Irish ownership and have confirmed that their plans for B &amp; I over the next five years include: the retention of all existing B &amp; I shiping routes; the provision of extra capacity on the <i>m.v. Leinster;</i> the sourcing of an improved vessel to replace the <i>m.v. Munster</i> on the Rosslare/Pembroke route; an upgrade of facilities throughout B &amp; I; the replacement of B &amp; I's container ships; the provision of long term sustainable employment in B &amp; I and share ownership for B &amp; I employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister undertakes to obtain from ICG an undertaking that they, ICG, will fully abide by the current trust deeds and rules of the B &amp; I pension funds as disclosed to ICG during the due diligence exercise.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges that the ICTU and the B &amp; I group of unions strongly feel that he, on behalf of the Government, has a pivotal role to play in ensuring these pledges by ICG are fulfilled.  Accordingly, they have sought a specific undertaking from the Minister that he will perform this role.</P>
    <P>The Minister undertakes to introduce an amendment to the B &amp; I Line Bill, 1991, on the rights of employees as agreed with the ICTU and B &amp; I group of unions as per attached.</P>
    <P>Subject to ratification by its members, the ICTU and the B &amp; I group of unions have confirmed that they are prepared to positively cooperate with the sale of B &amp; I to ICG on the basis of this agreement.</P>
    <P>Signed on behalf of Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications; signed on behalf of ICTU; signed on behalf of the Core Group of the B &amp; I group of unions.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Officer of the Irish <Col N="1683" /> Congress of Trade Unions also obtained the consent to this agreement of the General Secretary of the Seamens Union of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the agreement covers many of the amendments before the House, I wonder whether Deputies who have tabled amendments would consider yielding to the agreement and, in particular, to my amendment No. 15, which gives effect to the Government's commitments in the agreement with the trade union movement. I thank the House for giving me this opportunity to record the agreement with the trade unions.</P>

      <P>The Minister is asking that we withdraw our substantive amendments arising from the statement he has read to the House.  On behalf of my party, I wish to indicate that we are not prepared to withdraw our amendments. They have to be discussed in full because the Minister's statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement the Minister read into the record of the House is the usual kind of industrial relations trade union agreement that arises as a result of a threat, such as the threat of the B &amp; I group of unions to take industrial action.  In so far as it assuages some of those points, it is <Col N="1684" /> welcome.  However, the fact remains that there are substantive strategic and public interest questions raised by the Bill and the amendments on the Order Paper.  In addition, many of the paragraphs of the agreement, as I have read it, are exceptionally vague.  They talk about the Minister's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy Rabbitte, I gave you some latitude, but, strictly speaking, you will have ample opportunity to various amendments, other than the Minister's amendment, to give vent to your views on the matter.  I call on Deputy Yates.</P>

      <P>Briefly, I should like to say I am not agreeable to the Minister's proposal that we yield our amendments but I feel it appropriate that in the suggested groupings circulated by the Chair's office amendment No. 15 be grouped for discussion purposes with what is proposed.  It is not satisfactory that Members do not have a copy of the agreement.  We are not satisfied that it goes as far as legal amendments to the Bill would go in securing the strategic and other interests the Minister has referred to.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a brief comment.  Clearly, the Minister in <Col N="1685" /> issuing a statement is attempting to scuttle the serious opposition of parties of this side of the House to the methodology used in giving away a public enterprise such as the B &amp; I.  Opposition parties will not accept the suggestion that we withdraw any of our amendments.  What essentially happened is that the Minister held a gun to the heads of the workers in B &amp; I.  The Agreement was a <i>fait accompli,</i> the Government decided to dispose of B &amp; I to ICG&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;(1)  The Minister for Finance shall not sell or otherwise dispose of all or any shares in the Company, other than with the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the Minister wishes to sell or otherwise dispose of any such shares, he shall lay an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas specifying:</P>
    <P>(a)  the person or persons to whom he wishes to sell or dispose of any such shares,</P>
    <P>(b)  the price proposed,</P>
    <P>(c)  any terms or conditions attached to the sale or disposal,</P>
    <P>and no sale or disposal shall take place until such time as both Houses of the Oireachtas have passed a motion approving the order.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is logical and sensible and adheres to the best of parliamentary procedures one might expect from a House of Parliament.  What is lacking <i>vis-á-vis</i> this Bill are proper parliamentary procedures.  For example, we must protect the State investment in the B &amp; I in that the State represents the taxpayers. Therefore, if the Government want to dispose of all or any of its interest or shares in a public company like the B &amp; I, the House should have the right to debate and decide the issue; that is of fundamental importance.  It is widely acknowledged in all circles, not just The Workers' Party circles, but financial editors, corporate finance spokespersons, financial journalists and others, that the proposal outlined by the Government for the disposal of the B &amp; I to ICG constitutes anything from a Christmas present to the ICG or, in the eyes of some journalists, that the State is getting a poor deal from the sale, while others have acclaimed the deal to be a bad one on behalf of taxpayers, that in fact it means that the company will go for a song. Those statements emanate from highly <Col N="1687" /> responsible, articulate, deeply involved corporate financiers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have no particular axe to grind one way or another but who are merely taking a bird's eye view of what is happening.  It is important that the House accept this amendment, in that it would oblige the Government, in negotiating a deal for the disposal of public assets, to have the matter fully debated in the House so that, in turn, we can ascertain whether taxpayers will receive a fair rate of return or a good deal.  As legislators that is our duty.</P>
      <P>We also want to ascertain &mdash; in accordance with subparagraph (2) (b) of our amendment &mdash; the price proposed.  If this amendment is accepted it would be my hope that we could examine the whole question of price and what influences it. We hear much about the B &amp; I company have been a loss-maker.  If this amendment were accepted we could debate in great detail whether the company is a loss-maker or is capable of making profits. We would also have to examine the Government proposals to ascertain what has influenced the price recommended. Could the Minister inform the House today whether the price recommended has been influenced in any way by newspaper reports that the Minister, his family and friends benefited at some stage from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate we are having reinforces the reasoning behind The Workers' Party's amendment.  Huge issues need to be debated before a public asset, like the B &amp; I Line is disposed of. Before one can decide on the price one has to look at the company's trading performance, the company's assets and the terms and conditions attaching to the sale or disposal.  The terms of the proposed disposal, which have been agreed by Cabinet, seem to indicate that indemnities and warranties could affect the State in the future and we have not been given information about them.  I am arguing that this House should be given the right to debate a huge range of issues before the Minister is allowed to dispose of any or all of the shares of this company to a private company.  What would have happened if, for example, the company were successful in the case taken to the High Court to cover themselves for £17 million?  This issue was not brought to the attention of the House and we had to <Col N="1692" /> figure out from newspaper reports who was claiming what against whom.  At the end of the day it is important that taxpayers know the terms and conditions attaching to the sale or disposal.  In this case, the £17 million surplus in the pension fund is a key issue, and we will not be given the opportunity to debate it.  If our amendment was accepted this would be an integral part of the debate.</P>
      <P>The media have quite rightly identified that the company were sold very cheaply, some go so far as to say they were amazed the Minister was so keen to dispose of B &amp; I so rapidly given the company's turnaround since 1987.  It is anticipated that the company will make a profit of £4 million next year and they made a profit of £2.5 million last year.  The Minister has given a commitment to clear the crucifying debt which was dragging down the company and when they are no longer burdened by that debt we will be dealing with a very lucrative and profitable company. It is right to ask whether ICG are getting a bargain.  Does that sale represent a Christmas box from the Minister? Were the taxpayers adequately protected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment will also give us the opportunity to discuss the future viability of the company in the central corridor when EC Structural Funds money becomes available.  It will seem strange to the man and woman in the street that the Government decided to sell this company to ICG for £8.5 million after their debts were cleared and after they made £4 million clear profit in one year and that they will get assistance from EC Structural Funds.  In fact in four or five years the public may be asking why we gave away such a lucrative company who had the potential for making huge profits, for £8.5 million.  We must look at the question of future employment in the company. When one decides to sell off a company one looks not only at the price but at the terms and conditions of the sale.  We are entitled to question the implications of this sale for jobs.  Clearly, a decision has been taken by Government to sacrifice more men and women to the <Col N="1693" /> dole queues this Christmas by accepting so speedily the ICG offer in preference to the staff/management buy-out offer.</P>
    <P>There seems to be sound parliamentary reasons for accepting our amendment and I ask Members to give it their full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To have less than five hours to debate Committee, Report and Fifth Stages of this Bill is wholly inadequate. In effect, there will be no Report Stage and I believe more than half the amendments will not be reached.  For such an important matter, involving such large sums of public money, this is wholly unsatisfactory.  Amendment No. 5 in my name is identical to The Workers' Party's amendment.  It seeks that the Dáil gives its consent to the final deal in relation to the sale of B &amp; I Line to ICG.  At the outset let me make it clear that we will be voting in favour of amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>The Dáil is being asked to sign a blank cheque today, to underwrite a deal about which we do not know the small print. That is unacceptable to the taxpayers and it is undemocratic.  Essentially we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  In amendment No. 1 The Workers' Party propose a new subsection.  It states that &ldquo;any terms or conditions attaching to the sale or disposal&rdquo; should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  My understanding is that the £8.5 million price tag is a maximum price which may be reduced in certain circumstances if certain liabilities or warranties apply to Irish Ferries.  It is quite extraordinary that Members of this House could be briefed late last Wednesday evening to the effect that there were very substantial claims against B &amp; I Line assets to which the Minister made no reference whatsoever on Second Stage, despite five Fine Gael speakers specifically requesting him to outline the situation in relation to liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there is a pending claim before the High Court by Ro Ro Ferries Limited, Moorefield Limited and Nolan Transport Limited and that there was a claim for an interlocutory injunction before the High Court yesterday that <Col N="1694" /> assets to the extent of £70 million could not be discharged by B &amp; I Line.  I understand this was struck out by agreement on the basis that the share purchase agreement did not transfer the assets but the shares.  It also transpired in relation to that case that there are no financial proceeds payable currently for unsecured creditors.  Will the Minister clarify that? Section 4 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may, on such terms and conditions as he considers appropriate, indemnify the Company against liabilities incurred by it before the sale or other disposal by him of any shares of the Company ....</P>
    <P>The Minister may give an indemnity but also, he may not and the question is, where does this leave those claims: will the taxpayers be lumped with it, or will it be Irish Ferries, perhaps who will be lumped with it or will unsecured creditors be told to get lost?  A vital matter is the terms and conditions that will finally apply to the sale.</P>
    <P>Since the matter is <i>sub judice,</i> I cannot say what the effect of any of these claims will be.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the possibility of a claim in relation to Pembroke Port should Irish Ferries wish to relocate in Fishguard or breach any current agreement in relation to port and dock arrangements in Pembroke.  That claim could be in excess of £1 million. There may be other claims of which we are not aware.  We must ensure that after the Minister has concluded the deal the Minister for Finance will not bring in a Supplementary Estimate for several millions to pick up the tab for any liabilities awarded by the High Court against the B &amp; I Line assets.  That would be wholly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We are asking that the final elements in the small print be sanctioned by this House.  That is democratic, fair and reasonable.  Yesterday's hearing was struck out on the basis of leave being granted to the plaintiff to re-enter a claim at a later date.  All those issues remain as uncertain as ever.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting amendment No. 1 or <Col N="1695" /> amendment No. 5.  This would not preclude any aspect in his final deliberations with Irish Ferries but it would give the House an opportunity to debate the matter.  It would be completely unacceptable if, following further negotiations, we were to hear after the haze of festivities that the actual sale price was £4.5 million instead of £8.5 million.  The Dáil would be powerless and would not be consulted.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his statement earlier to an agreement he has signed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I group.</P>

      <P>The Deputy correctly referred to the limitations on time.  I suggest that the best employment of time is by adherence to specific amendments.  The Minister was given permission to make a statement and the Deputy was given permission to comment on it, but I would not see in the amendments we are discussing any matters relating to the statement.  The statement might be more correctly discussed under other amendments.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, while I do not wish to have any dispute with the Chair, if he reads the statement he will see that those who proposed the grouping to exclude reference to this were quite wrong.  Such subsection (2) in amendment No. 1 states that where the Minister wishes to sell or otherwise disponse of any such shares, he shall lay an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas specifying, amongst other things, any terms or conditions attached to the sale or disposal.  We are told in the Minister's statement that he and ICG have agreed a number of things.  They shall, for instance, seek to have at all times sufficient ships on the Irish register which could be utilised in times of emergency to service our strategic and trading routes.  Is that a condition of sale?  I am quite entitled to argue that it should be a condition of sale.  That is absolutely <Col N="1696" /> valid.  I do not wish to argue with the Chair.</P>

      <P>The Chair repeats that there are other sections to which it might be more directly related. The Chair is concerned about the best utilisation of time in the contributions made.  Standing Orders are calculated to get the best out of Committee Stages. The Chair wishes to remind the House of that.  The House can accept or reject that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  My argument is that we should seek before the deal is concluded that the Dáil would give consent in respect of a number of matters. We should know the exact terms of the small print in relation to the price, the exact details of liabilities and who would be responsible.  We should know what the Minister has negotiated with Irish Ferries.  The Dáil should have an opportunity to know exactly the position in relation to any conditions attaching to the sale concerning EC grant aid, to which the Minister referred specifically in his statement.  We should have information about a possible &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; deal on corporation tax losses to be caried forward and we should know if that is a condition of the sale.  We should also know about any agreements on industrial relations issues which are part of the deal.</P>
      <P>The shareholders of ICG were insisting on the final deal in clear, written contractual form.  Why should the Members of this House be given any lesser rights than those shareholders?  Irish Ferries will say that all this is subject to the approval of their shareholders.  We are saying that this House, which represents the public and which nationalised B &amp; I in the first instance in 1965, should be given the same right of <i>imprimatur.</i>  I ask the Minister to accept this because he has been outmanoeuvred at every hand's turn in his private negotiations with ICG. His hand would be strengthened if he could say that the deal would have to be approved by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that and I am not arguing with the Chair on this issue.  The Chair must also take into consideration the fact that this statement was made to the House at the beginning of the debate.  It is very important that we should look at this aspect.  The amendment lays down certain conditions for the disposal of B &amp; I and it would appear <Col N="1698" /> that there is a conflict with the statement read by the Minister.  The Minister affirmed that ICG have indicated to him their intention to maintain the company in Irish ownership.  Intention is not a guarantee.  I would have grave reservations about intentions to retain the company in Irish ownership.  I, and other Members, have experience of intentions which never materialised.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to find out from the Minister what is in the fine print of this deal. This House has a direct connection with the proposed sale of the B &amp; I Line as it is taxpayers' money which is being utilised to hand over a semi-State company to a private enterprise.  It is surprising that ICTU have apparently given their approval to this proposal.  When did ICTU change their policy in regard to such matters?  I take issue with ICTU's position in regard to this proposal in view of the fact that the B &amp; I Line have been turned around from a loss-making to a profit-making company and that they have a rosy future.  Perhaps the B &amp; I Line should have taken over ICG.  Such a move would have been far more beneficial for this country.  The proposed sale of the B &amp; I Line to the ICG will be to the benefit of a private company at the taxpayers' expense.</P>
      <P>The amendment states that an order specifying any terms or conditions attached to the sale or disposal of the company shall be laid before this House. That is a very reasonable proposal, taking into consideration the millions of pounds of taxpayers' money put into the B &amp; I Line.  I can see no reason for not disclosing that information.  The amendment also proposes that the Minister for Finance shall not sell or otherwise dispose of all or any shares in the company other than with the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This House has direct responsibility for such matters in view of the moneys we have sanctioned over the years for the promotion of this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I was somewhat surprised at the Minister's statement this morning as he left many questions unanswered.  The <Col N="1699" /> Minister said he had put down an amendment to the Bill on the rights of employees as agreed by ICTU.  We like to tease out such issues as the debate develops.  I accept that there are time limitations on us but having listened attentively to him, I have to say that the Minister's reply to the Second Stage debate was very calculating, cold and clinical.  I know that is his job and perhaps that is the way he operates but, as I said, we must have some input from the point of view of the employees.  The Minister indicated that he has reached agreement with ICTU in regard to certain conditions for employees.  It is the responsibility of this House and not the trade union movement or anyone else to look after the interests of taxpayers and workers.  This is what we were elected to do.</P>
    <P>There is nothing positive or concrete for employers in the agreement in front of me.  This is what worries me.  As I said earlier, I have had plenty of experience of companies who got involved in mergers, takeovers, etc. and in some instances it was the workers who suffered at the end of the day.  I support the amendment which will provide a safeguard to ensure that we will have some control over the disposal of this very important and valuable State asset.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is attempting to achieve.  His statement may not be exactly relevant to paragraph (c) of the amendment but I see a certain relevance to it.  Many people have conveyed their concern to me about the proposed sale of the B &amp; I Line to ICG and the terms of the Bill brought before the House by the Minister.  I am heartened to have heard the Minister's statement today on amendment No. 15 which deals with the rights of employees. This amendment contains many commendable proposals.  While I understand Deputy O'Sullivan's misgivings about the amendment, the Minister is making a very definite attempt to seek as strong a set of assurances as possible in relation to the rights of employees and pensioners who are concerned about the future of their pension fund.  I welcome the Minister's statement which I found very encouraging.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with amendments to section 2 which seeks to amend section 2 of the 1971 Act by increasing from 106 million to 142 million the number of ordinary shares which may be purchased by the Minister for Finance.  In effect, this will enable the Government to invest £35 million in the B &amp; I prior to the completion of the sale so that it can be used for the repayment of the company's debts.  I should point out that the management-staff buy-out consortium's offer also sought the write-off of £35 million in debt by the Government.  The debt of £35 million is broken down as follows: a bank debt, £29.8 million; a loan in respect of <Col N="1701" /> the <i>m.v. Munster,</i> £2.5 million, and amounts due to Milford Haven Conservancy Board, £2.7 million.  The bank debt figure is an estimate because the precise date of completion of the sale is not known and the amounts due on individual loans can vary as a result of foreign exchange movements.  The loan in respect of the <i>m.v. Munster</i> relates to the cost of refurbishment and other modifications which had to be undertaken by the B &amp; I.  The amount of £2.7 million due to the Milford Haven Conservancy Board is the sum to be provided for in the B &amp; I's accounts as at 31 December 1991.  This sum is in respect of facilities provided to the B &amp; I at Pembroke under the terms of an agreement with the Milford authority.  That is the intention of section 2 to which these amendments have been tabled.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy for the idea behind this amendment &mdash; I cannot accept it in its present format &mdash; in that it seeks to ensure full disclosure of all relevant matters.  Paragraph (a) proposes that the Minister shall disclose the person or persons to whom he wishes to sell or dispose of any such shares.  That information has been given to the House and fully discussed here.  Paragraph (b) proposes that the Minister shall disclose the price proposed.  Such details were given by me in my Second Stage speech and I will be happy to elaborate on it here today.  Paragraph (c) refers to any terms or conditions attached to the sale or disposal of the company.  A fairly full reference has already been made to those.</P>
    <P>I know the question of indemnity is of concern to Deputy Yates in particular, but my hands are tied in that my advice from the Attorney General's office is that under no circumstances should I discuss the case or the amount of the claim because to do so could give some advantage to the third party involved.  I am advised strongly by the Attorney General's office to content myself to pointing out that this case is <i>sub judice.</i>  However, in fairness to the Deputy, I can say that if any such liability were ever to fall to the Exchequer it would have to be voted on by the Oireachtas and it would have <Col N="1702" /> to be brought to the Floor of this House. The Deputy will gain some comfort from knowing that the matter would have to be brought before this House.  Having thought about and listened to the advice of the Attorney General, however, I am happy to state that, so far as I am concerned, we have an exceptionally strong case and I am satisfied that that is the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confine myself to this case.  As I said on Second Stage, we went through a very definite process in taking the decision to dispose of the company.  We called in SKC Corporate Finance last year and they looked at four options: maintaining the <i>status quo,</i> developing the company with additional capital from the Exchequer, liquidating the company or selling it. Having completed the assessment, SKC Corporate Finance recommended rejection of three of them and opted for the sale of the company.  Following that there was a trawl of the international shipping market and, as the House knows, we have had two rounds of public tender for the company.  I really do not know any other way of getting the best price for the company apart from putting it up for public tender, which is what I have done on two occasions.  People are suggesting that the company is worth more, I would gladly have taken more at any time. However, the price I got is the best available in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One or two union sources suggested I might have been able to get more if I had done it some other way, but it can be seen from the management/staff buy-out proposals that they valued at a lower price than Irish Ferries did.  I restate that I know of no other way of getting more value for a company than having two rounds of public tenders.  I must also point out that it was not just my decision; I behaved extremely professionally in this matter.  I appointed an assessment committee comprising representatives of my <Col N="1703" /> Department and the Department of Finance at very senior level and SKC Corporate Finance.  They unanimously recommended that we should accept this offer as the best available for the taxpayers and shareholders.  I got the best price available in the market after two rounds of public tender offers.  If there had been any other offers I would have welcomed them at any time in the past 12 months.  Top value has been secured for this company because of the process I went through, the involvement of SKC Corporate Finance over 12 months, two public rounds of tender and the assessment committee to which I referred.  It was only after that process I agreed to proceed with the sale as outlined to the House.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage Deputy Rabbitte asked me a whole list of questions.  I should like to oblige him with the answers and I have drafted a reply to every question he raised but I do not know when I will be able to fit in the answers.  I will convey the answers in writing if he wishes but I would prefer to answer his questions in the House if I can seize my opportunity.</P>

      <P>In retrospect, we should not have agreed to the Minister reading out a statement of agreement with the trade unions which, effectively, has nothing to do with the issue before the House.  Deputy Liam Fitzgerald went out of his way to welcome it and I welcome it so far as it appears to protect the pension rights of existing workers.  However, as Deputy Yates pointed out, it has nothing to do with the question of principle before us and questions raised in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> The Bill before the House does nothing more than make B &amp; I commercially more attractive to sell, and indeed the Minister has just agreed with that; a sum of £35 million State equity was provided to prepare for the sale.</P>
    <P>Fundamental questions are raised in this amendment, the most fundamental concerns the question of the terms and conditions attached to the sale or disposal. The Minister, for example, in replying said that the question of the price is clear, that everybody knows the price and to whom we are selling.  He asked what the fuss is about.  However, as Deputy Yates pointed out, that is not the case; we do not know the extent of the indemnities that might mature and the company will have to be indemnified by the State post sale.</P>
    <P>In any event, I do not accept the major deceit which the Minister is trying to inflict on the House, which is that he did everything right, engaged in a trawl of the shipping market and got the best price. Nobody agrees with that.  The Minister is wrong to say that he believed union sources are saying he could have got a better price.  The Minister knows that it is not only union sources who are saying that.  As Deputy Byrne said in introducing the amendment, every financial commentator has said that a lousy deal has been done for the taxpayer, that the Minister is selling it for a song and, as Deputy Yates said, we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer the Minister to a statement in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by Brendan McGrath.  He wrote a major condemnatory article of the performance of the Minister in this respect. He said:</P>
    <P>To invest £36 million to wipe B &amp; I's balance sheet clear was a wise move by the Government, but many senior corporate finance figures in Dublin believe that the most logical step after cleaning the balance sheet was to let B &amp; I trade profitably with no debt burden and groom the shipping line for a sale to the private sector in two or three years' time when B &amp; I would <Col N="1705" /> have had a solid trading record.  At present, the Exchequer will reap the grand total of minus £27.5 million through the sale of B &amp; I to Irish Continental Group &mdash; a paltry return from a company that in two or three years might be sold at anything up to 10 times its pre-tax profits at that time.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister say to that?  It is not from a trade union source.  When the Minister said that he engaged in a trawl of the shipping markets throughout the world he knows very well &mdash; and the Government already have experience in this regard &mdash; that they prepared the Irish Sugar Company to be floated on the market; the same applies to Irish Life. He knows that you do not take a company with a balance sheet like the B &amp; I and sell it at this time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not answered the question &mdash; and I do not know whether he has a reply drafted &mdash; why we should sell it now.  Brendan McGrath estimates that it could get a factor of ten of pre-tax profits.  Any financial consultant would tell you it would certainly attract a factor of eight of pre-tax profits which are estimated, under the existing situation, to achieve more than £4 million next year. Why the indecent haste in selling a company which has been in State ownership since 1965?  Why do we suddenly, before Christmas, with minimal debate in a situation where the Taoiseach said we would not be bringing forward the legislation before Christmas, introduce and railroad it through the House at a time which is least propitious for the taxpayer in terms of getting value for money?</P>
    <P>Until the Minister answers that question we are perfectly entitled to argue this amendment for full disclosure to this House, because it is a lousy deal for the taxpayer.  I suspect the Minister knows it is, and I am trying to find out why it was made.  There is no point in saying that the MSBO valued the company at less. They put together the best package they could, came up with as much money as possible and were treated in a very shabby way by the Minister.  The Minister is aware also discussions were taking <Col N="1706" /> place with another institutional investor who was willing to put up the remaining tranche of money that would have made it equal to the bid by ICG.  Most important, the Minister has not answered to this House why the board of B &amp; I &mdash; leaving aside the trade unions, I have a great deal of sympathy with what Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan said earlier &mdash; say the Minister has concluded a lousy deal.  It is they who are saying this is the least propitious time to sell off the B &amp; I.  I am not making any ideological argument here, I am merely saying it is the least propitious time to sell off this company and that the board of the company have put that view to the Minister.  Contrary to the impression which he sought to give the House &mdash; he referred to the fact that he met them on five occasions &mdash; the board of the company will testify, and I stand over it, that he never consulted them about his proposal to sell this company in this manner to ICG.  He excluded them entirely and at the last meeting he had with them on the morning we debated Second Stage on 10 December, there was a flaring row between the board and himself because of the manner in which he handled it.  On Second Stage I put on the record the questions the board put to the Minister at that meeting.  It is not my view, the view of The Labour Party or even the view of the Fine Gael Party but rather the view of the board that the Minister did a bad deal, and he has not answered that question either.</P>
    <P>It appears, we have protected the position of workers in the B &amp; I in respect of pension entitlements and like Deputy Fitzgerald I welcome that.  This is one of the major questions we have to resolve. Deputy Yates has commented that he would like to have time during the debate on this amendment to address the critical question of a golden share or some mechanism that would give the State some strategic control in shipping terms over the future destiny of this country.  The Minister came in and read out this agreement with the unions.  Deputy O'Sullivan has confessed to being bewildered as to what this means in terms of the traditional ICTU position on it and I have <Col N="1707" /> great sympathy with that view.  The point is that the trade unions did what trade unions should do.  Assisted by the debate that took place in this House and the universal criticism of the manner in which the Minister handled the matter, they declared the intention to take industrial action, and then at the negotiating table they got the best deal possible.</P>
    <P>However it is a minimalist deal.  It provides for certain assurances in respect of terms and conditions of employment but it does not do more than that.  Elsewhere the document is vague and aspirational. Deputy Yates referred to paragraph 2 of the first page of the agreement where it says that the Minister will seek to have at all times sufficient ships on the Irish register which could be utilised in times of emergency to service our strategic trading routes.  The Minister will seek to do it: is that a condition of sale?  The amendment refers to the conditions of sale.  Is it going to be a condition of sale that we will have this assurance from the new ICG that the Minister will continue to pursue vigorously with the European Commission, Ireland's case for the funding of improvements in access transport services.  I am sure he will but it is a pity he did not pursue it more vigorously when the B &amp; I were in State ownership. It is a pity that ICG, having got a Christmas parcel all wrapped up in a red ribbon, should now have the Minister's commitment to get additional Structural Funds for them.  I wish them the best of luck and since this is the only shipping company we have left I hope they are very successful but I would not adduce it as an explanation of what a splendid deal this is for the company.  Then there is the statement that the ICG &ldquo;have indicated their intention&rdquo; to the Minister?  What precisely does that mean?  In relation to paragraph (c) of our amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not even a fig leaf and I would like to know whether the Minister will tell us whether these are conditions of sale.  They are manifestly <Col N="1708" /> not since they are not included in the list of amendments before us.  The only amendment deals with terms and conditions of employment of workers and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>No regard has been taken of the fact that one proposal as compared to the other would have provided 100 additional jobs.  I would have thought in the crisis we are in that that was a factor to which the Minister ought to have given a higher priority.  I am not making any allegations but I am thoroughly bemused at the indecent haste and the manner in which a very bad deal was done on behalf of the taxpayer by a Minister who claims to have a certain professional competence in this area.  I am assured by all sources, with whom I have spoken, including the board of the company, that this is not something which was thought up by the civil servants in his Department but a personal political mission undertaken by the Minister on behalf of ICG &mdash; and the ICG only &mdash; with such a very bad return for the taxpayer. I am ashamed of it and I do not think the industrial relations agreement, concluded with the group of unions, is here or there in that regard.  I have tabled an amendment, so too has Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan and the Fine Gael Party, to ensure that the employees' pension rights are protected.  I am delighted that is the case because nothing else there is worth the paper it is written on.  ICG will tell the Minister at a future date where to go if he seeks to give effect to any of the aspirations.</P>

      <P>We are debating amendments to section 2 of this Bill which, as Deputy Rabbitte said deals with the restructuring of the finances of the B &amp; I so that what amounts to a gift can be given to Irish Ferries to take over the running of B &amp; I.  Even though the section and the amendments to it seek to wipe out these debts, in fact they are not being wiped out because there will be no debts, they are being transferred to the taxpayer.  It will be the taxpayers' responsibility from now on and not B &amp; I's responsibility.  I do not object to the belated restructuring of the affairs of <Col N="1709" /> B &amp; I and I do not disagree with the Minister when he says that of the four options presented to him by Stokes, Kennedy Crowley the one to sell off the company was perhaps the wisest.  However, I am in full agreement with Deputy Rabbitte on the hasty decision not to consider further the management/staff offer for B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>The Minister said ten minutes ago that the amount offered by the management/ staff was less than what he has now received from Irish Ferries.  All sorts of combinations are possible when one set of shareholders is being replaced by another set.  There can be deferred payments and other arrangements.  If the Minister was serious in his professed wish to see the management/staff take over this company, I am certain, satisfactory arrangements could be entered into following discussion whereby payments could be made over different periods or in different ways.  I am sorry the Minister has introduced this legislation hastily to put through this deal which is puzzling everybody.  I read a very impressive article in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> by Brendan McGrath who made a number of very forceful points in this regard.  All the Opposition speakers in this House have expressed puzzlement at the haste with which this legislation is being put through, especially in view of the Taoiseach's undertaking here some months ago that there would be no legislation at this time.  I understand that a number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers are equally puzzled by it.  Deputy Rabbitte believes that the civil servants in the Minister's Department are puzzled as well.  Who is the father of this Bill?  Where did it come from?  The only person missing from that list is the Minister and, therefore, he must be the source of it.  He must also be the source of the speed with which he wants to put it through the House.  The House is entitled to an explanation from him in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment we are talking about the conditions of sale.  There is one other condition of sale which should be there and the Minister has responsibility in this regard.  It should be a condition of <Col N="1710" /> sale that what amounts to a gift to Irish Ferries should not introduce unfair competition in the transportation of passengers and goods to and from this country.  The elimination of those debts is a grant to Irish Ferries.  They objected to a small grant of £500,000 to the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company and they took it so far as to bring their objections to Europe.  They are now getting what amounts to a £35 million grant themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope the Cork-Swansea Company do not adopt the attitude which Irish Ferries adopted and go to Europe claiming unfair competition because we need more boats bringing more people into this country. That was a petty mean act on the part of Irish Ferries and I am glad it failed.  The Cork-Swansea Company is now profitable having wiped out their previous losses and in future they will be paying corporation profits tax at a rate of 42 per cent.  As Deputy Yates said, the debts of B &amp; I transferred to Irish Ferries will mean that Irish Ferries who objected to a small company getting a grant of £500,000 will be able to set off the losses of B &amp; I against their future profits. Surely the House would agree it would be most unjust if that were to happen.</P>
    <P>When Irish Ferries were asked to take over the running of Cork-Swansea Ferries some years ago they would only do so on the basis that they would get a £500,000 grant, a £500,000 loan and another £1 million State guarantee.  If that was the type of management we were going to introduce to Cork Swansea Ferries, which needed that type of undertaking from the Government, then the board of Cork Swansea Ferries have done an extremely good job by merely having a grant and a guaranteed loan of £500,000 for the last number of years and are now in profit.  One has to admire the business acumen of Irish Ferries who have hammered out this deal with the Minister with regard to B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that apart from transport the Minister also has responsibility for tourism.  In this regard he must ensure there is a level playing pitch between Irish Ferries and the Cork <Col N="1711" /> Swansea Ferries in shipping people to Ireland.  Irish Ferries will now have a dominant position in bringing people to this country.  I hope the Minister will bring it home to the board of the new company that he or his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will if necessary bring the new company before the competition authority if they abuse the dominant position which is being given to them, with inadequate debate in a very hasty manner, in this Bill.</P>

      <P>We are constantly hearing about the value of this company and that Irish Ferries are getting it at a bargain at £8.5 million.  There were only two offers for the company, the management and Irish Ferries.  The management offered £2 million down, and £3 million to go, guaranteed by the £6 million pension fund.  The £8.5 million being offered by Irish Ferries is way above that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne asked me on Second Stage if I would indicate that I was totally against the pension funds being used.  I agreed with his point and I am delighted that the pension fund has been protected. It was a dangerous proposition in the original offer to suggest that the £6 million pension fund was to be used.  Stokes Kennedy Crowley recommended to the Minister that he should accept this offer. The Minister read out a statement signed by all the people involved, the trade unions and so on stating that they were happy that it was in the best interests of the B &amp; I, its employees and the customers that this Bill should go through. Deputies here are saying they know better than Stokes Kennedy Crowley about the value of the company, that they know better than the trade unions about the best interests of their members.  Who are we to listen to?  We are supposed to debate the facts as we see them.</P>

I said I hoped that when this Bill came through they would come together and sort themselves out. They have done better.  They have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am delighted they have praised the Minister.  That is a bonus.  I am interested in what is in the best interests of B &amp; I, Ireland and the employees.  I hope this new company will be successful.  Despite what newspaper gurus say, who knows what the company is worth?  Shipping is a very difficult business. If businessmen believed there would be huge profits they would have been in making offers to the Minister. Businessmen want to make money and if they see a quick buck to be made they will be in like a flash with offers.  There were no great offers and everybody knew that B &amp; I would have to be sold.  If the management had put a good package together I would have called on the Minister to accept it.  The offer made was not in the best interests of the company.</P>
      <P>I read the article in the newspaper to which Deputy Byrne referred and I thought his comment was petty.  It is only in the past few days and weeks that people are saying that B &amp; I is a good bargain.  Nobody made an offer for it or said it was a very profitable business.  The new company will have a difficult time.  I hope they will succeed.  I was delighted with the Minister's statement earlier because it gave us an idea of exactly what had been agreed between the trade unions and the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember going to the stock sales when I was very young.  The seller would sit in a box beside the auctioneer, and although the auctioneer had <Col N="1713" /> tried to sell the stock, if the price was ridiculously low, the auctioneer would turn to the seller and tell him to either take it or leave it, in other words, the seller had either to bring the stock home or accept a bad price.  The unions were put in a similar position yesterday in relation to this agreement &mdash; they either had to accept it or have a straightforward confrontation.  At a time when they were never less secure that was the Christmas message from the Minister: get lost or accept any deal no matter what humiliation is involved.</P>
      <P>In relation to the future of the B &amp; I Line and the commitments given, now that I have had time to analyse what the Minister said, it does not hold up.  The Minister acknowledged that the ICTU and the B &amp; I group of unions strongly feel that he, on behalf of the Government has a pivotal role to play in ensuring these pledges by the ICG are fulfilled &mdash; these pledges include the retention of all existing shipping routes, the provision of extra capacity and so on &mdash; and accordingly, they have sought a specific undertaking from him that he will perform this role. The Minister went on to say that he will introduce amendments not in relation to those points, as Deputy Rabbitte said, but on the rights of employees in regard to their pay and conditions and pension fund.  We are dealing with pledges, pivotal roles, indications, intentions and undertakings, but they are not worth the paper they are written on.  They are not even suitable as a firelighter.  The fact is that there is no commitment or obligation on what was a State guarantee to retain shipping services.  This agreement is welcome so far as it protects the pay and conditions of the employees, but I would like the Minister to clarify whether it gives legal effect to what the Greencore workers were given in relation to pay and conditions and SI 306 of 1980 introduced by the then Minister, former Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to price, the Minister pressed the replay button on this video show and pointed out that he had two open tenders and had trawled the high <Col N="1714" /> seas to see if there was anyone who would take the B &amp; I Line.  This is not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ways one can privatise a company &mdash; by public flotation, public or private tender or private negotiation.  This was not done by public tender but by private negotiation.  It was a negotiated sale; if anything, it was a private tender.  I cannot understand why someone in Stokes Kennedy Crowley did not ask the Minister why, given the advice of the chairman of the board and the views of financial commentators and analysts, that the price is too low, he did not say that this could be a crucial turning point in terms of the trading and operating surplus and the financial position of the B &amp; I Line?  Given that for 1991 we are talking about a trading and operating surplus of £2.4 million or £2.5 million and the projection is for an extra £4 million next year, why not sit tight and tell ICG, the staff-management buy out consortium P&amp;O or whoever else might be interested, that all bets are off because we are not happy with the result of negotiations or the price that we will look at it again next year?  The company were shifting towards an improved balance sheet and this would lead to an improved price.  When deciding a price account has to be taken of the ratio of profits to capitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if we were to leave that aside, the Minister was in a strong position to say to ICG that, whatever way we look at it, if they were to acquire the assets of the B &amp; I Line &mdash; mobile and property and shipping routes in the event of the B &amp; I going out of existence it would cost them over £20 million.  In those circumstances I cannot understand how the Minister can continue to justify this maximum price of £8.5 million.  No public tenders were sought.  This time last year Stokes Kennedy Crowley made inquiries to find out who might be interested in the event of the B &amp; I Line being put up for sale.  When the Minister invited the SMBO in September, he did not invite <Col N="1715" /> anyone else to make an offer.  They had to meet a specific deadline and a number of other conditions.</P>
    <P>When it came to the liabilities, the old smokescreen was put up &mdash; that we must genuflect to the Attorney General's advice, although last week when Deputy Rabbitte produced material which emanated from that source it was promptly ignored.  As the House is aware, under Standing Orders, legislation takes precedence over any issue which is <i>sub judice.</i>  Of course, the B &amp; I have a defence but the Minister still has not said whether there are any other claims or explained why he did not acknowledge the existence of these claims.</P>
    <P>We are taking together four amendments in my name &mdash; I have already referred to amendment No. 5 under which the Dáil would have to give its consent to the deal.  I would now like to refer to amendment No. 6, given that I will not have another opportunity to deal with it.  That amendment reads:</P>
    <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Minister for finance shall, notwithstanding any disposal of his shares in the Company, retain a special share in the Company to which shall be attached the following rights exercisable by the Minister with the consent of the Government:</P>
    <P>(a)  no sale or disposal of shares in the Company, and</P>
    <P>(b)  no sale or disposal of strategic shipping services (as may be determined by the Minister from time to time), shall take place unless the terms thereof have been approved by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister did not reply to that amendment, neither did he refer to it in the flimsy document he put before us today. In my Second Stage speech I pointed out what this deal means for the ICG but I made a mistake in saying that the share price would increase from 12p to 24p. What I should have said was that the <Col N="1716" /> earnings per share are projected to rise from 12p to 24p.  What is there to stop the ICG being sold in the morning?  What if someone wanted to buy ICG?  There is no measure or mechanism accepting the importance of shipping from a strategic point of view or the Irish Shipping Register. No reference has been made to resale in the short, medium or long term future. We are trying to ensure that the Government would have to approve any resale and this would be tied in with the retention of shipping services.</P>
    <P>If the Minister asked Irish Ferries what their position is in relation to the shipping services on the southern corridor <i>vis-à-vis</i> Rosslare-Pembroke, they would tell him they are not projecting any profits on their proposal to replace the <i>mv Munster</i> on that line for three years.  What would happen if some whiz kid in NCB gets a brain wave and suggests that they get rid of their services on the southern corridor because they could make more money by concentrating traffic on the central corridor, by doing a deal with the Stena Line by giving them the exclusive option on the southern corridor and maximising profits and increasing fares in the process?  That would be a very attractive option for ICL.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is playing a pivotal role and is looking at the pledges, undertakings and so on, but he has no control under the monopolies and mergers law and will not be able to stop ICG from acting in any particular way when it comes to the retention of shipping services. Similarly, if losses are sustained by European Container Services &mdash; ECS &mdash; in relation to the freight/cargo services between Dublin and Antwerp, Le Havre and Rotterdam, and they decide to abandon any of those medium haul routes, where would Irish industry be, given that they already have problems with capacity, the lo-lo terminal at Dublin Port has been scrapped by Sealink, and they have let the Holyhead Port run down, while the British Government have failed to develop western ports on the Irish Sea?</P>
    <P>Where will Irish industry be?  It will be out with the washing.  There is an <Col N="1717" /> abandonment of strategic factors here and this can only be overcome by the retention of a golden share.  Whatever may be said about Margaret Thatcher, in all privatisations in Britain she ensured that where a strategic national interest was involved a golden share was retained so that there would be some control over developments.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that in 1965 when the B &amp; I Line were set up there was an underlying strategic interest in their acquisition.  In my amendment No. 6, I propose that the State retain 20 per cent of the company. Certainly a sufficient number of shares should be retained.  I know that Deputies have other amendments down to the effect that the Minister, by order, would have control.  This is the last opportunity for the House to exercise control in relation to shipping matters for an island country that is depending on such services.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to any of these issues.  How would he define his role in this regard?  ICG are not in a position to give undertakings and, therefore, the only alternative is to make legal provision to protect the workers.  I ask the Minister to reflect on his position in this regard and to realise the weakness in what he has proposed because, except in so far as some narrow industrial relations aspects are involved, there is no legal protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to push our amendment to a vote before 2.30 p.m. The Minister has not answered the case made by The Workers' Party, Labour and Fine Gael which clearly supports the position as outlined by financial commentators and financiers.  One would not sell a house with dry rot, particularly if there was only one potential buyer and if the dry rot is a £30 million inherited debt as in the case of B &amp; I.  The logical position that should have been taken on behalf of the taxpayers was to agree to write off the debt and allow B &amp; I to continue trading profitably, as they have been doing.  They would have played a <Col N="1718" /> role on behalf of the State and the taxpayer in bringing tourists from the Continent and Great Britain and would have been a profitable and buoyant company.</P>
      <P>Nobody seems to understand the logic of the position taken by the Minister in disposing of B &amp; I at this time.  What are the prospects of European funding of B &amp; I after the company have been sold to ICG?  As financial correspondents have asked, why, having written off the £30 million debt, did the Minister not decide to hold on to the company for another two or three years and then make a decision on the matter based on market conditions?</P>
      <P>If that was done B &amp; I could trade profitably and the united workforce and management could be proud of their efforts on behalf of the company.  Instead the Minister has alienated the vast majority of the workforce and management in pursuit of his sweetheart deal with ICG.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his statement today spoke about the agreement made between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I group of unions and said he had covered adequately many of the questions posed here.  His statement was to the affect that indications have been made to him or that he is going to try to get an undertaking from ICG. The Minister said he acknowledged the rights of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I group of unions who strongly feel that he, on behalf of the Government, has a pivotal role to play in this matter.  The Minister talked about extracting pledges, indications or markets from ICG.  This is a handshake and a slap-on-the-back type of agreement but it has no legislative base.  The Minister can list as many things as he likes but that is of little use.  He said that ICG have indicated they will allow for the replacement of B &amp; I's container ships and the provisional long term sustainable employment of B &amp; I workers.  The Minister could have come in with 50 pages of indications from ICG or 50 undertakings to sustain the shipping line between Ireland, Britain and the Continent, but without the legislative base as <Col N="1719" /> proposed in our amendment they would be of little value.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 refers to &ldquo;any terms or conditions attached to the sale or disposal&rdquo;. If the Minister does not accept this amendment his statement is not worth the paper it is written on.  It does not guarantee job security for the workforce at B &amp; I, nor does it guarantee that ICG will adhere to all the terms as indicated.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes that the Minister for Finance shall not sell or otherwise dispose of all or any shares in the company other than to employees of the company or a venture in which employees of the company hold the controlling interest.  Tremendous efforts have been made by the B &amp; I workers on behalf of the company and that has been recorded in this House and acknowledged by Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the history of B &amp; I, particularly the five year agreement negotiated in 1987 under which the workers made many sacrifices.  Since then the company have come from the doldrums to earning a trading profit of £4 million.  This improved performance was obtained on the basis of the input by the workforce and management of B &amp; I.  It is an incredible snub to the workforce and an indictment of the Minister's sensitivity and his political determination that he would allow privatisation of this company without agreeing beforehand certain conditions for the B &amp; I workers.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that many sacrifices were made on behalf of B &amp; I including the laying off of 600 workers in 1988.  As a result of the five year agreement men and women voluntarily took a 5 per cent decrease in wages and they signed an agreement that there would be no industrial disputes during that period.  They worked very hard on behalf of the company &mdash; some families have been working there for years, long before 1956 when they became known as the B &amp; I Line. Those people have been treated very shabbily and I would like to record that <Col N="1720" /> yet again.  I will be pressing our amendment.</P>

One has to put aside the views of those who have been put on the spot in order to try to arrive at an objective view.  Deputy Rabbitte among others referred to the views expressed in newspaper articles.  I do not wish to trivialise the journalistic judgement that a multiplier by a factor of ten should be applied to pre-tax profits to determine the price.  We could all pull figures out of the air.  I know a number of people in the shipping business and they repeatedly talk to me about the peak and trough pattern of the business.  The shipping business is all about peaks and troughs, it is up and down from month to month and year to year.  Anyone could pull a <Col N="1721" /> formula out of the clouds, and I suspect that the journalist, whom Deputy Rabbitte referred to, did that, or alternatively was helped to do that by people who held a particular viewpoint?</P>

      <P>Sir, assertions have been made and I have to take on these assertions.  I am asking the Deputies opposite who made those assertions to clarify and elaborate and tell us which professionals have told them what the formula should be.  Quite frankly if there is a tendering system, as there is in this case, why did it not bring forward more prospective buyers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will clarify the matter if I am wrong in that regard.  Where were all the other interested parties in Ireland and abroad who could not come forward and make these generous offers applying the formula of a multiplier of ten on pre-tax profits?  Since those assertions have been put so strongly, where are the potential purchases and are they still around?  Have <Col N="1722" /> they spoke to the Deputy in person and told him they would be prepared to offer £20 million, £30 million, £40 million or even £50 million for the company, because they think it is worth that?  I have not heard anything about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates has made <Col N="1723" /> most of the points one should make on behalf of this side of the House.  Most of the Second Stage speeches were hard on the Minister and rightly so.  The Minister has made a bad deal and has forgotten the staff, the people who worked very hard to turn the company around.  It was pressure from outside this House, the media and the staff, that forced the Minister to present this document this morning.</P>
      <P>This document affords no protection to the workers.  I am worried about the employees and as both Deputies Liam Fitzgerald and Stafford know, B &amp; I Line staff come from the north-side in the main.  During Second Stage I spoke about the tradition of people from Howth, Baldoyle and Sutton working for the company, and they have put a great deal of time and effort into saving the company over the years so that it is now in profit.  They are being let down by this document because it affords them no protection whatsoever.  Deputy Fitzgerald knows the people I am talking about.  Deputy Fitzgerald knows the people in Howth, and Deputy Stafford knows the people on the north side.  It was they who brought about this pressure and the Minister reacted to this pressure by producing a document which he hoped would get him through the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This document is not good enough because it does not provide any protection for the staff.  The Minister states that the Government have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the pledges given by ICG are fulfilled, but what does that mean?  This document is useless to the staff.  We know that when ICG will take over the company there will be staff duplication and the B &amp; I administrative staff, will suffer and will lose their jobs when the 200 or 300 staff are made redundant. The northsiders will lose their jobs and will be put on the dole.  Irish Continental Group will not have staff duplication and when decisions have to be made it will be the B &amp; I accountant or administrative staff who will lose out.  As I said on Second Stage, the only way to <Col N="1724" /> protect the staff is by way of a golden share.  This has not been addressed and the Minister should look at it again.  In Aer Lingus, for example, the State have a share in the company and in that way the employees are protected; it also keeps the company in Irish hands, and rightly so.  That is the way things should be.  We ensure also that we have control over our ports because shipping is vital to a country that exports goods.  The only way to ensure that we do this is by bringing in a golden share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that both the Second and Committee Stage debates have been so short and, indeed, that Question Time is so short. The amendments before us are crucial to maintaining ownership of a shipping fleet by Irish shareholders.  When the heartbreaking decision had to be taken in relation to Irish Shipping Limited &mdash; a decision which has been vindicated by time but which was then the subject of much ill-based criticism by the present Minister &mdash; we were able to salvage Irish Continental Limited, now known as the Irish Continental Group.  The dream or hope was that this would eventually emerge as a new shipping fleet for Ireland.  The Government of which I was a member extended the 10 per cent tax rate and business expansion scheme to shipping but unfortunately within months the new Fianna Fáil Government effectively strangled the business expansion scheme as far as shipping was concerned because they tightly limited the amount of investment in shipping by Irish taxpayers. The most crucial issue from this country's point of view arising from the Bill is whether a shipping company will remain in Irish ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuity of service is vital, not only in relation to ferry services to Britain and the Continent but also because we have to look ahead to the possibility of resurrecting a deep-sea shipping fleet and giving employment to the many hundreds of people who have the skills necessary for such facility but who are unemployed as a result of the recession and of the unfortunate but necessary decision made <Col N="1725" /> in relation to Irish Shipping.  The effect of the Bill, unfortunately, will be to put more people in the shipping sector out of work.  The only way to save those jobs and to create more jobs is for an extension in the forthcoming budget of the business expansion scheme to shipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> The measures by the Government I referred to on 28 November 1991 to reduce the level of unemployment were formulated in the context of current discussions with the social partners on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  These were detailed in the appendices to the Government statement which issued after the meeting between myself and Members of the Government and representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 13 December 1991.</P>
    <P>The proposals in question include training and employment schemes, covering 25,000 persons on the live register, which would be financed by contributions from the European Social Fund and from contributions from employers.  These proposals were also discussed at a meeting which the Minister of Labour and I had with the employer organisations on 25 November 1991.  The commercial banks have also agreed in discussions with the Government to two new initiatives by them to create employment. The first involves the provision of £15 million in funds to provide loans for the creation or development of small and medium businesses with employment potential and the other their participation in a new commercial task force on tourism to identify new commercial measures to enable the tourist industry achieve its full potential in the international tourist market.  All the measures outlined involve no costs to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Other matters discussed at the meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions included the budgetary outlook for 1992, tax matters &mdash; with particular emphasis on measures to collect tax arrears and deal with tax evasion and avoidance &mdash; and public service pay.</P>
    <P>Copies of the statements which issued after the meetings with the employer organisations and the ICTU have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to ask the Taoiseach what is the cost of the employment scheme and what is the cost of the training scheme.  The Taoiseach has indicated that there is no cost to the Exchequer, but can he say in what <Col N="1729" /> way the schemes will be funded and also how many are involved in the scheme? He indicated that 25,000 people will be taken off the live register.  Is that number additional to the number already promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in regard to the possible creation of 40,000 jobs over the period of the programme, or is it part of that promise?</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be much better from the point of view of creating sustainable jobs that money available &mdash; whether from the private sector, the public sector or Europe &mdash; be used in a more particular way by specifying industries that would be targeted for development, rather than following a blunderbuss approach and simply scattering money on make work schemes that will not be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think that anyone could possibly find fault with this new scheme.  First I should like to say that the scheme does not involve any cost to the Exchequer.  The scheme is estimated to involve about £100 million in all.  Twenty-five thousand people will be taken off the live register &mdash; 15,000 for employment and training and 10,000 for training.  The cost will be met from European funds to the extent of 75 per <Col N="1730" /> cent and from the employers concerned to the extent of 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>This is a scheme in addition to what is already proposed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> it is a new scheme.  As I said, the idea is that 25,000 people will be taken directly off the live register.  The people to be employed under the scheme must be on the live register and they must be taken into employment by business and commercial firms, who will be responsible for them.</P>
      <P>The scheme could not be more directly targeted.  Employers have indicated their support for the scheme.  The proposal is based on individual firms and companies taking on additional employees.  There will be no question of displacing existing employees.</P>

      <P>In any event, the position is, as explained by me and by the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions that the state of the public finances leaves us with no alternative but to decide on the proposals we put to the trade union movement.  Had the Government not taken any action along those lines there would have been an extra £350 million provided for public service pay in 1992, that is an increase of 10 per cent on what is provided in 1991.  Those figures just could not be accommodated.  It was necessary for the Government to decide as we did and to put the arrangement to the trade unions for acceptance.</P>
      <P>I might add that the proposal, the arrangement, having regard to the circumstances, is very balanced and, in the view of the Government, reasonable.  I would direct the attention of the Deputy particularly to the fact that it makes special provision for the lower paid in the public service.</P>

      <P>On Questions Nos. 1 and 4, in relation to the employment scheme proposed, what levels of pay will employers participating in the scheme be obliged to pay?  Will they be obliged to pay more than the sum provided by the European Social Fund?  Can the Taoiseach indicate what will be the level of subvention by the ESF per person participating in the scheme?  Furthermore can he indicate what will happen when the particular fund ceases, when the money allocated for this scheme expires? Will a further scheme be implemented or in what way will this add to the general productivity in this State in terms of industry?  My final question relates to Question No. 4 and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i> can the Taoiseach explain why a commitment has been given in relation to the special pay awards, that they would be paid in full in 1993 with full retrospection while, at the same time, those people entitled to the 3 per cent, the low paid, are being limited to a £5 increase with no guarantee that the balance to which they may be entitled will be received in 1993 or that they will get retrospection?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is confusing two entirely separate matters here. One is the question of the new scheme to take 25,000 people off the live register at no cost to the Exchequer.  In reply to the Deputy's question on that matter, the employers will pay the normal rate for the job.  There will be a subsidy given to them of £54 a week from the Social Fund. The scheme will last for 12 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter what is the job, it will be paid at the normal rate.  The subsidy will be £54, and £18 of what the employer pays will be regarded as a contribution to training but 25,000 people will be taken off the live register and employed for a period of 12 months. There is a stipulation in the scheme that employers must retain them for a further six months.  I cannot see how anybody can fault this scheme.  It is a specific initiative to take people off the live register which we all agree is at an unacceptable level.  It will be a tremendous achievement if we can get 25,000 people off that live register into normal employment at no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other matter, there is a question tabled to the Minister for Finance about the public service pay arrangement.  I suggest that we leave that so that Deputies can ask whatever questions they wish on that particular question.</P>

      <P>In putting my final supplementary question perhaps I should remind the Taoiseach that he has come before this House on many occasions, claimed credit for his relationship with <Col N="1735" /> the trade union movement and the negotiations he conducted with the social partners. May I now put it to him that his action in recent days &mdash; the unilateral action taken by the Government &mdash; will damage any relationship built up with the social partners?  At this late stage, would the Government not reconsider &mdash; if they have to renegotiate &mdash; negotiations and try to bring about consensus in relation to pay?</P>

      <P>The experience built up over the course of the two programmes has been very valuable.  I have said on a number of occasions that we would like to avail now of the goodwill created between the social partners on those occasions.  The Government have not taken this decision lightly.  It is not a decision of which we are particularly fond but, unfortunately, the public finances leave us no alternative.  Could Deputies see the Government undertaking a burden of £340 million extra in 1992, an increase of over 10 per cent in public service pay, when growth in 1992 will not reach the levels we expected, when the cost of living is anticipated to be somewhere around 3.5 per cent?

May I specifically invite him to respond now in the House to the prospect of wholesale industrial action throughout our public services?  Finally, may I ask him again to clarify what he means by inducing 25,000 persons into what he calls normal employment if it is going to be subvented at the rate of £54 per week?  What does he roughly envisage-having regard to a 75 per cent &mdash; 25 per cent breakdown &mdash; will be the normal wage?</P>

The figure will not be 75 per cent in every case, but we anticipate the overall proportion of finance for the scheme will be 75 per cent.  With regard to goodwill, I believe there is an enormous amount of goodwill existing between this Government, the trade union movement and the social partners.  We regret we have had to put this arrangement to the trade unions and we hope that in time when they consider it they will find it acceptable. There is no other way the Government can approach the budget for 1992.</P>

One is an employment scheme involving 15,000 people and another is a training scheme involving 10,000 people.  In regard to the employment scheme, the employers will pay the normal rate for the job, whatever it is, and the subsidy from the Social Fund will be £54.  The employer will be expected to take the person off the live register and employ him or her for a period of 12 months which will be subsidised and for a further six months which will not be subsidised.  The training scheme will cover 10,000 people who will be taken off the live register.  They will be trained for 12 months and given a certificate at the end of that period.  The training will be approved by FáS or CERT.  The training allowance will be £65 a week on average.  Of that sum the Social Fund will pay £48.75 &mdash; the 75 per cent to which I referred &mdash; and the employer will pay £16.25, or 25 per cent.</P>

The unfortunate position is that we are not reaching those rates of growth and we have had to go back to the drawing board.

      <P>I knew nothing about this matter and I believe the Deputy will accept that.  In regard to a letter which <Col N="1742" /> my artistic adviser wrote to the Arts council &mdash; I think that is what Deputy Quinn is referring to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Taoiseach's reply and I am assured he was not aware of the transactions which took place in the Arts Council.  Is the Taoiseach not now aware that as a result of somebody acting in his name, perhaps without his knowledge, 200 copies of this book were shredded because they did not cast a favourable light on the artistic adviser, and not on the Taoiseach?  Is he not therefore concerned that policy is conveyed by way of intimidation between Merrion Street and Merrion Square?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be fair about this.  There is absolutely no question of anything in the nature of intimidation.  I doubt if in the history of the Arts Council have relations between the Arts Council and the Government ever been better.  I am sure the Arts Council will acknowledge that fact.  I am sure I can assure the Deputy and the House that the artistic adviser was not aware of the decision to shred this book.  That is not for me to say but I think I can give the Deputy that assurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he agrees that when a transaction of conversations takes place between his artistic adviser and the Director of the Arts Council which ultimately leads to <Col N="1743" /> the shredding fo 200 books and the resignation in protest at that act of vandalism by one of the officers of the Arts Council that something is seriously wrong and that he has an obligation to investigate the exchanges which took place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no obligation to investigate.  I have been very scrupulous in giving this Arts Council total independence. Deputies know that I have reiterated that principle time and again in this House when I have been under pressure to do this, that or the other in the arts area.  I have indicated that I have left all these matters entirely to the Arts Council and I am quite certain they would acknowledge that that is the position.  I do not think there is anything on my part to be investigated.  I can also assure the Deputy that relationships between my artistic adviser and the Director of the Arts Council are excellent.  I have seen this at first hand on occasions.  There is absolutely no animosity or anything of that kind at any level between my office and the Arts Council.  I feel very aggrieved at this matter because it is one thing in which I have taken particular pride.  I believe I appointed a first class Arts Council who are doing a magnificent job.  The relationship between that Arts Council and my Department at every level is excellent.  I am deeply distressed that there should be any hint of anything of this kind, particularly in one newspaper.</P>

      <P>In respect of an earlier answer by the Taoiseach which may have been inadvertent, would the Taoiseach not agree that it has been a long standing tradition in this House that Ministers, including the Taoiseach, are answerable for the activities of their servants and do not seek to reduce any answerability in <Col N="1744" /> that regard by any claim of lack of personal knowledge?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the Ministers and Secretaries Act is framed on the basis that Ministers are responsible to this House for actions taken regardless of their personal knowledge?</P>

      <P>I have given Deputy Quinn the information he requested.  I have pointed out that a particular letter written by my artistic adviser was written with the specific proviso that it was written in a private capacity.  I really think this is making a mountain out of a molehill in so far as my Department are concerned. I do not attribute any particular motives to anybody in regard to the shredding of the book but I maintain very adamantly in the House that they are an excellent Arts Council, they are doing a magnificent job and their relationship with my Department is excellent.  I have always been at great pains in this House and elsewhere to maintain the absolute independence and integrity fo the Arts Council in their work.</P>

      <P>Teagasc was established in September 1988 through the amalgamation of AFT and ACOT.  Exchequer funding for AFT, ACOT and Teagasc for each of the years 1987 to 1991, inclusive, together with the percentage change each year are included in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The 1992 grant-in-aid will be given in the Estimates which are being published this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures represent the annual grant-in-aid.  Teagasc are also in receipt of funds from other sources including <Col N="1749" /> substantial and increasing allocations from the European Social Fund.  Teagasc's income from other sources in 1991 amounted to about £23 million including about £8.5 million from the ESF.</P>
    <P>For years up to and including 1991 the grant-in-aid was paid as a contribution towards the total costs of the organisation and no separate amount was designated for any particular purpose.  For the year 1992 a separate grant-in-aid will be designated as a contribution for superannuation purposes.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate for my Department was presented to the House last week.  There are no plans for any further Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The combined staff numbers in AFT and ACOT in 1981 were 2,650.  The corresponding numbers for 1987 to 1991, inclusive, were 2,367, 1,800, 1,575, 1,576 and 1,578, respectively.</P>

      <P>We should be honest in the House regarding this issue.  The Minister's answer constitutes a whole series of evasions.  Of course there is a serious crisis in Teagasc and the fact that a decision has not been made by the board of Teagasc does not get away from that. Will the Minister allow Teagasc &mdash; and the services provided by them &mdash; to be decimated because of the lack of funding by the State?  Will he allow 300 or 400 researchers, advisers and complementary workers to be laid off and a whole series of research institutes and agricultural colleges to be closed because of the lack of State funding?</P>

      <P>I have answered the questions which I was asked and did not try to evade them.  The reality is that these are matters, in the first instance, for the <Col N="1750" /> board.  I have also covered the question of the board's funding and the increased funding which they receive from outside. I assure the Deputies who put down questions in relation to the work and programme of Teagasc that I see them having a central role in the development of agriculture and I intend to ensure that they maintain that role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said on Friday that he was interested in increasing investment, research and development and marketing in agriculture.  There is a low level of research in agriculture &mdash; something in the region of .7 per cent of gross national product compared to about 2 per cent in other EC countries. Is the Minister saying he is not aware of all the proposals put to the Teagasc board today and last week which will mean at least 21 offices being closed and a reduction of 360 employees in at least ten different research and development areas?  Since this action was taken before he was appointed Minister &mdash; and in view of his interest in this area &mdash; will he look again at the proposal and increase the subvention to Teagasc so that they can get resources from the EC to make up the difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Teagasc have a corporate plan of which I am sure the Deputies are aware.  Under it they plan to be 50 per cent self-financing by 1993; by 1991 the grant was 58 per cent and, therefore, Deputies will see that they are close to realising their corporate plan under which they will be able to avail of further funds from the EC.  They also plan to raise funds by other means.  I regard research, education and technology as essential to the development of agriculture and as essential partners in the market-driven approach which you cannot have without the necessary technology. Teagasc have become more cost <Col N="1751" /> effective, efficient and commercially oriented in their operations.  I will judge proposals put to me but none has yet been made.</P>

      <P>Management will consider the proposals and look at the possibilities. That is the function of the board and management of Teagasc.  From what I understand, they are looking at a variety of possibilities in that regard.  As I said, no proposals in that regard have been made to me and when they are submitted I will certainly deal with them.  There have been rumours about matters which will be considered.  However, I have begun to visit the various centres and I will continue to do that.</P>

      <P>This will be my last supplementary question.  We are all trying to be helpful but the Minister is not telling us the true story.  We must face up to the fact that there is a massive shortfall in the funding necessary to keep Teagasc going. We know that it runs into several millions. The Book of Estimates will be published today.  The Minister knows the exact figure; we do not but we think it is in the region of £2.3 million.  Let us not have this charade about there not being a problem, that the board of Teagasc have yet to decide.  We know what will happen: a whole series of institutes will be closed.  If the Government are not willing to put up the necessary money &mdash; the shortfall of approximately £2.3 million &mdash; will he endeavour to get it from the EC through the Social Fund or from the structural Funds?  If those avenues fail to yield the necessary amount of money, will be suggest to Teagasc that they should take the practical step of <Col N="1752" /> selling their headquarters in Sandymount Avenue, the market value of which is in the region of £3 million, and centre their operations in Kinsealy Research Centre? That would be the practical solution to the problem instead of making 300 or 400 scientists, researchers and advisers redundant.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the tactics used by both the Irish Sugar Company and Greencore to prevent the importation of sugar into this country from other EC States.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a common organisation of the market in sugar and accordingly free trade takes place between EC member states.  In fact, 6,631 tonnes of sugar were imported into Ireland from other member states in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offer for sale document, relating to the flotation of Greencore on the Stock Exchange earlier this year, refers to an investigation currently being carried out by the Competition Directorate of the EC Commission in relation to a number of sugar producers within the EC, including Irish Sugar.  EC officials visited Irish Sugar in September 1990 and again in February 1991.  My Department was not <Col N="1754" /> involved in the investigation but I understand that no communication has been received by the company to date about the outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy there is such a thing as free trade so far as the sugar industry is concerned in this country. As late as last Sunday, there was reference to that fact in one of the Sunday newspapers which indicated that the prospectus published by Irish Sugar when it was being privatised to Greencore was flawed and that there were some serious breaches of EC regulations and, particularly, regulations in regard to competition. The Minister in the reply which he has just given to the House referred to the importation into Ireland of 6,600 tonnes of sugar in 1990.  Is he aware that in 1987 the importation figure was well in excess of 18,000 tonnes and that malpractice may have been involved in stopping that type of importation?  While we would all wish that the amount of sugar being imported would not be considerable and would not affect jobs in the sugar industry such practices would be entirely illegal and we could be open to serious reprimand from the EC Commission if the allegations which have been made by a former senior executive of Irish Sugar are valid.  Does the Minister agree with these views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in that regard is that any allegations are thoroughly investigated.  The Competition Directorate of the EC Commission have carried out investigations over the past number of years into possible breaches of Community competition rules by a number of sugar producers throughout the EC.  These have resulted in fines of various levels being imposed on sugar manufacturers in other member states who were found to have infringed these rules.  I am quite certain if they find any irregularities in relation to Ireland they will take similar action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister sure there was no breach of these rules and that no penalty was incurred by Irish Sugar prior <Col N="1755" /> to privatisation?  Is he also aware that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications was advised prior to the privatisation by a former senior executive of Irish Sugar that the prospectus which had been published was flawed and that there were a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies in that prospectus?</P>

      <P>In so far as the Vote for my Department is concerned, there is no expenditure on each of the areas mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regard education-training and research, the budget of Teagasc in 1991 is approximately £56 million, of which about £33 million comes from State funds.  Of the £56 million, approximately 30 per cent is spent on education and training and some 50 per cent on research.  In addition, my Department will have spent directly some £1.9 million on research and testing in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternative enterprises are dealt with under the operational programme for rural development for which a total <Col N="1756" /> amount of about £40 million will be committed by the State up to the end of 1993. Diversification of the rural economy, a heading which covers alternative enterprises, is expected to account for about 30 per cent of the total funds &mdash; national and EC &mdash; available for this heading for the period mentioned.</P>
    <P>As regards marketing, my Department have provided £1.5 million this year to CBF which carries out marketing development and promotion in the meat sector.  In addition, a sum of £800,000 was provided for An Bord Glas, which is charged with the task of improving the marketing of horticultural produce.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the activities referred to by the Deputy, I intend to use every available opportunity to seek further Community funds for such purposes.

    <P>Deputies will also be aware that under <Col N="1758" /> Leader, the EC initiative on rural development, 17 groups have been selected for funding of their business plans, involving investment of £70 million over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the new national structure for promoting rural development early in 1992 will be a further significant step in stabilising the rural population.</P>
    <P>In addition a pilot scheme of grant aid for investments in organic farming enterprises was introduced with the objective of providing aid towards the cost of facilities for the commercial production, storage and marketing of organic produce.  The response to these various measures has been very encouraging.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that the answer he has given here is utterly inconsistent with what is happening on the ground in reference to the proposals by Teagasc to close every research station in the country?  Would he also not accept that with the speed with which technology is changing and with the need to assimilate and apply new technologies to our agricultural industry, there is a need for a strong network of reaserch and development stations throughout the country?  Would the Minister not further accept that if the flight from the land is to be halted there must be diversification into horticulture, urban and rural forestry and agri-tourism and that by getting rid of the research stations carrying out the development work to allow farmers to move into this area, there will not be any chance for these kinds of projects?  How on earth is what the Minister says consistent?</P>

      <P>Promotion of the diversification of the rural economy has been assigned to Teagasc.  This has been achieved through the deployment of the equivalent of 26 full-time staff in activities such as farm visits, group meetings, seminars, demonstrations, press articles and local radio features.  A sum of £2.6 million is available for this part of the sub-programme.  The areas which have <Col N="1759" /> been targeted under the various programmes which I have outlined are areas which have been identified with real and possible potential for development.  We see Teagasc as having a pivotal role in the development of those areas and we are confident that they will fulfil that role.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his full reply, but would he not agree that the future of agriculture here will be based on organic agriculture generally and that there is a tremendous market in Europe and in Ireland for organic products? Will the Minister say what steps he is taking to get more Structural Funds, perhaps taken from Common Agricultural Policy, put into this area to accelerate this switch towards organic farming and growing?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that we have a special organic unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food. The organic unit was set up in the Department in 1990 with a budget of £350,000 to develop all aspects of organic farming. The funds were used mainly to help UCD to establish an organic farming module into its degree course, Teagasc, to establish an R and D programme at Johnstown Castle and a training demonstration unit at Kildalton College, CBF, to carry out a market survey at home and abroad on organic meat, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association to develop their organisational structures, SFADCo to develop organic farming in its area and to produce a video in conjunction with Teagasc on the concepts underlying organic farming produce, and the production of an information leaflet.  In 1991 the unit again had a budget of £350,000 which was used to continue support for the efforts of UCD, SFADCo and Teagasc.  One hundred and fifty thousand pounds from this year's allocation was used to fund a pilot scheme for organic production.  There were 75 applicants, of whom 37 were offered grant assistance. Thirty two applicants completed their investments attracting grants of £84,000 which are now being paid.  Under the other <Col N="1760" /> grants, schemes such as commercial horticulture, organic products, provided they comply with the conditions and the various regulations relating to the scheme, are eligible to apply.  On that basis it cannot be said that either the Minister or the Department are not doing their part for organic farming in this country.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> The work of inspecting the areas which have applied on appeal for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas will begin this week with pilot surveys of over 30 townlands in Leinster and Munster in advance of the main inspections which are scheduled to commence next month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of the fact that many of these areas should not have been left out originally, is it not somewhat absurd that farmers see this year slip by?  Do they also face the possibility that even next year they will not be covered for subsidies which they need so badly now that farming is almost on its knees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeals panel asked the Department to arrange a pilot survey covering a small area in advance of carrying out the main survey.  The Department chose two areas, one in north-west Cork and the other in south-west Laois.  The inspections, which will be carried out by officers of the Department, are due to commence today, 17 December, with the main inspections scheduled to commence next month.  I should advise the House that the area covered by the appeals is estimated at three million acres involving approximately 40,000 individual farmers in 10,000 townlands.  At the request of Deputies and others, the closing date for the receipt of applications was extended to 31 December.  As can be seen, a considerable amount of work remains to be done but the pilot survey, the purpose of which is to set the criteria to be used, is under way.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in relation to: expenses of Members of this House and of the Seanad; a scheme of severance payments for TDs and Senators; and changes in the pension regime for ministerial and parliamentary office holders, and a system of severance pay for these office holders.</P>
      <P>As regards the expenses of Members, this is an area which has given rise to a lot of misunderstanding among the general public.  As the House is aware the remuneration of TDs and Senators &mdash; which is described in legislation as an allowance &mdash; comprises both a salary element and an element in respect of expenses.  This annual allowance is treated for tax purposes as salary notwithstanding that TDs and Senators are expected to meet a large proportion of their working expenses out of it.  In recognition of this, the Revenue Commissioners treat fixed amounts of the annual allowance as being referable to expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by a typical TD or Senator and therefore not subject to tax.</P>
      <P>The review body considered this arrangement in detail and concluded that it was unsatisfactory in a number of respects.  The following extract from their report No. 30, paragraph 9.8, gives a good indication of their general conclusions. I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way in which the remuneration of TDs and Senators is structured (a <Col N="1910" /> single allowance with a fixed component being treated by the Revenue Commissioners as recoupment of expenses and thereby exempt from tax) gives rise to controversy and confusion. The impression is created that politicians receive particularly favourable income tax treatment; in fact the arrangements are less favourable than those applicable to most employees (who expect their reasonable expenses to be met in full by their employer and not merely treated as tax-deductible). In addition there is a natural tendency to regard the full amount of a TD's or Senator's allowance as remuneration whereas only part of it (the so-called salary element) represents remuneration and the balance represents expenses which must be met out of the allowance ...</P>
    <P>I think we would all agree with the review body's conclusions in these respects.  Few of us have avoided being at the receiving end of critical comments related to the type of perceptions they refer to.</P>
    <P>The review body also make the point that it is inappropriate that under the present arrangement the Revenue Commissioners should be placed in the position of being required to determine what is a reasonable allowance for expenses for TDs and Senators.  They regard the present arrangements which attempt to accommodate the unique circumstances applying to Members of the Oireachtas within taxation provisions designed to deal with the circumstances of employees generally, as unsatisfactory.  They have gone on to conclude that the present arrangements should be replaced by a straightforward system of remuneration for TDs and Senators which distinguishes clearly between salary and provision for expenses.</P>
    <P>They considered that the ideal arrangement would be one where both TDs and Senators would be paid clearly identifiable salaries and would be reimbursed by the State for all expenses reasonably and properly incurred in the exercise of their functions &mdash; this happens at present in the case of some expenses, such as <Col N="1911" /> travel and subsistence.  They felt, however, that it would be administratively very difficult to operate a system of claim and recoupment in this way in relation to all expenses.</P>
    <P>The review body concluded that the best approach would be to fix a uniform sum to meet a reasonable amount of the expenses which are necessarily incurred by TDs and Senators in carrying out their duties and which are not otherwise reimbursed; to pay this sum as a separate allowance distinct from their normal parliamentary allowance; and to provide for this allowance to be regarded as recoupment of expenses and, therefore, nontaxable and non-pensionable.</P>
    <P>The review body recommended in November 1987 that the allowance for expenses should be £3,500 per annum in the case of a TD and £1,750 per annum in the case of a Senator.  They also recommended a mechanism by which the rate of the allowance would be increased from time to time.  Application of that mechanism would bring the allowance to over £4,000 in the case of a TD and £2,000 in the case of a Senator.  Rather than provide for specific amounts at a time when the review body are once again examining this whole issue as part of their review of top level salaries, I think it better to make provision for the determination by way of ministerial regulation of the initial amounts of the allowance and of the method of future revision of the allowances.  This approach will allow for more flexibility in implementing whatever recommendations emerge from the current review body study.</P>
    <P>The review body also recommended that on payment of this expenses allowance the parliamentary allowances should represent salary only and that claims for deductions for tax purposes in respect of expenses against those salaries should no longer be allowed.  This is being provided for.</P>
    <P>As regards office holders, the review body felt that their expenses were lower in some areas and higher in others than those of ordinary Members and concluded that the best and fairest approach <Col N="1912" /> would be for office holders to receive the expenses allowance applicable to the House of which they are Members but not to receive any additional expense allowance.  As in the case of ordinary Members it was recommended that salaries should be fully taxable and that no claims for deductions in respect of expenses should be allowed, with one exception.  The exception relates to the deduction referred to as the &ldquo;dual abode allowance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The dual abode tax allowance may be claimed by members of the Government and Ministers of State who represent constituencies outside Dublin and who are obliged by virtue of their duties as office holder and as TD to maintain a residence both in Dublin and in their constituency. The allowance may be claimed in respect of the expenditure incurred in maintaining one or other residence subject to a maximum allowance of £7,728.  The review body recommended that claims for deduction in respect of expenses under the dual abode heading should continue to be allowed by the Revenue Commissioners because the numbers involved were small and the benefit varied depending on expenses actually incurred.  This is being provided for and, in addition, I am proposing that the allowance should also be available to Senators who fulfil the necessary conditions and to the Attorney General on fulfilling similar conditions provided the Attorney General is a Member of the Oireachtas and has, therefore, two roles to discharge.</P>
    <P>In summary, one of the main purposes of this Bill is to implement these recommendations of the review body relating to the restructuring of Members' remuneration.  It provides that in addition to salary Members will receive an allowance to cover the expenses incurred by them which are not otherwise reimbursed; in that context it removes the ability of Members to claim deductions in respect of expenses incurred as part of their parliamentary duties under the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Accordingly, on the introduction of the allowance for expenses the present tax deductions of <Col N="1913" /> £6,901 per annum in the case of a TD and £3,810 per annum in the case of a Senator will cease as will the deductions available to office holders other than the dual abode allowance.  The parliamentary allowance will be designated as salary and will be taxed in the same way as the salary of any other member of the community.  The effect of paying the new allowances and removing the present tax deductions will vary depending on individual circumstances.  In general, however, TDs would gain somewhat while there would be a loss for office holders &mdash; the position of Senators would also be somewhat improved.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the system recommended by the review body is a much more satisfactory and equitable way of dealing with the remuneration and expenses of parliamentarians than the present system.  It should also help to remove the confusion among the general public about the remuneration of TDs and Senators and the mistaken impression that they receive special tax concessions.</P>
    <P>In report No. 30, the review body also examined the position of TDs and Senators who, on leaving office, very often find themselves in severe financial difficulties.  These problems can be exacerbated by the fact that, unlike most of the workforce, Members of the Oireachtas, whose security of employment is tenuous to say the least, are not covered by the Social Welfare Acts, the Redundancy Payments Acts or the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.  The review body, while noting that the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme is structured so as to take some account of the hazards and uncertainties of political life, concluded that the introduction of a scheme of severance payments for outgoing Members would be justified.</P>
    <P>The review body accordingly recommended in report No. 30 that Members of the Oireachtas who have at least two years unbroken service, and who are defeated at a general election should, in <Col N="1914" /> effect, continue to be paid their parliamentary salaries for a period of up to three months from polling day.  They also recommended that the pensions scheme be amended to ensure that any pension to which a defeated Member might be entitled does not commence until payments under the new severance scheme have ceased.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of this Bill provides for a scheme of severance payments for Deputies and Senators along the lines recommended by the review body. However, since the Bill was published and circulated to Deputies last week, mention has been made of the length of the severance payment period, which is limited to three months at maximum, as compared with the severance scheme for Ministerial and parliamentary office holders, under which payments can be made for up to two years.  I have to say to the House that as far as the Government are concerned, there can be no question of improving on the severance payments arrangements for Deputies and Senators as outlined in section 5 without a further input from the review body.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the matter with my Cabinet colleagues, and we consider that the best way of addressing the expressed concerns of Members would be for the Government to formally request the review body to undertake a special examination of the appropriate cesser-of-office benefits for outgoing Members of the Oireachtas.  This examination would encompass the provisions of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pensions scheme as well as the question of limited term severance payments, and the review body would be asked to report on the outcome of its deliberations at an early date.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that the approach set out above is acceptable to Members generally, I would intend &mdash; on Committee Stage &mdash; to propose an amendment to the Bill, the effect of which would be to replace the text of section 5 of the Bill as initiated with a more flexible provision, of an enabling nature.  This amendment, if approved, would enable the Government to consider and &mdash; by <Col N="1915" /> way of regulations &mdash; take appropriate action on the finding of the review body when these become available, without the necessary of bringing further primary legislation before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is possible that on foot of the special reference, the review body will make recommendations affecting the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pensions scheme.  further legislation would not be required to give effect to such recommendations &mdash; as Members are aware, the terms of the pensions scheme can be changed by means of an amending scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives effect to review body recommendations on changes in the existing arrangements governing pensions for ministerial and parliamentary office holders.  These recommendations are contained in report No. 31 of the review body, which was drawn up following a request in November 1987 from the then Minister for Finance that the review body should examine and report on the allowances and pension entitlements of members of the Government, Ministers of State, the Attorney General, the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Minister's request followed the passing of a motion in this House on 28 October 1987 supporting a review body examination of the ministerial pensions issue, which had attracted a good deal of public comment at that time &mdash; much of it ill-informed, in my personal opinion. The review body concluded that those features of the existing ministerial pension system which were most criticised, viz. the absence of a minimum age limit for payment of pension, and the fact that pensions were payable when the recipients had left ministerial office but continued to serve in the Dáil or Seanad, arose because the existing system tried simultaneously to address two separate needs of office holders.  These are the &ldquo;long term&rdquo; need for some degree of financial security in retirement, and the &ldquo;short term&rdquo; need to redress the more <Col N="1916" /> immediate financial problems which can arise when office holders, who have cut themselves off more or less completely from their previous careers, lose office, usually at quite short notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach adopted by the review body was that the pension provisions for office holders should focus more on their long term needs, and that their short term financial problems should be dealt with through the introduction of a scheme of severance payments, extending over a period of two years at maximum.  That being said, the review body were fully cognisant that, overall their recommendations would represent a disimprovement on existing arrangements and that, over time, the new terms would involve a saving to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this approach, the review body recommended that a new pension regime be introduced for office holders, the principal features of which are as follows: (a) a new scale of service related pension rates to apply, with a minimum rate of 25 per cent of salary for an office holder with three years' service, rising at the rate of 5 per cent of salary for for each additional year to a maximum of 60 per cent of salary for an office holder with ten years' service or more &mdash; the current pension maxima are 45 per cent of salary for a member of the Government, the Attorney General or the Ceann Comhairle, and 51 per cent of salary for other office holders; (b) pensions not be payable in the normal course before age 55, except in cases of permanent ill-health, persons aged 50 and over to be allowed to apply for immediate pension, but at an actuarially reduced rate; and (c) pension to be abated by 50 per cent so long as the recipient remains a Member of the Dáil, the Seanad or the European Parliament &mdash; except in the case of a former Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with this new pension regime, the review body recommended the introduction of a scheme where a <Col N="1917" /> former office holder would receive a proportion of the salary appropriate to his former office for a period equal to his last unbroken period of service, subject to a maximum of two years.  The proportion of salary payable would be 75 per cent of salary for the first six months, 50 per cent for the next 12 months and 25 per cent for the final six months.  These severance payments would cease if the recipient returned to office, and would not be paid at the same time as pension, but a recipient could opt to have the severance payment discontinued at any time to allow his (or her) pension payments to commence. The review body recommended that separate severance arrangements should apply in the case of a former Taoiseach, because of the special position of that office in the national life.</P>
    <P>The review body further recommended that a person who leaves office to take up a position to which he/she is appointed by or on the nomination of the Government &mdash; for example, a Minister becoming an EC Commissioner &mdash; should not benefit under the severance payments scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, the review body recognised that, while the changes recommended in relation to pension entitlements &mdash; in particular the minimum age limit for the commencement of pension and the 50 per cent abatement while the recipient remains a parliamentarian &mdash; are logical and reasonable in the context of the overall new package, it would be wrong to impose these changes unilaterally on those current and former office holders who have secured pension entitlements by virtue of service already given under the existing arrangements.  They, therefore, recommended that (a) a specific future date &mdash; referred to in the report as &ldquo;the operative date&rdquo;&mdash; would be fixed for the commencement of the new pension regime and the new severance payments scheme for office holders; (b) any person who has less than three years' qualifying service on the operative date would be automatically subject to the new pension regime in full; (c) office holders or former office holders &mdash; who have three more years' qualifying service <Col N="1918" /> on the operative date would have a choice &mdash; they could either opt for the new pension regime in full or have a &ldquo;split entitlement&rdquo; arrangement, with service up to the operative date being dealt with under the old system, and all later service being subject to the new regime; and (d) the new severance payments scheme would not apply to any person to whom the new pension regime did not apply in full.</P>
    <P>The review body had suggested that the operative date for the pension changes recommended in report No. 31 should be the day on which a new Government was formed after the first general election following publication of that report.  However, that recommendation has been overtaken by events and the Bill provides that the operative date will be the day on which a Government are formed after the next general election.  The provisions of the Bill are otherwise in line with the various recommendations in report No. 31, subject to some minor variations of a technical nature aimed at ensuring that the new system will operate as fairly and equitably as possible.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the Bill &mdash; in line with the review body report &mdash; will extend spouses' and children's pension entitlements, formerly applicable to male office holders only, to benefit the spouses and children of female office holders.  I am sure the House will agree that this amendment, which has already been applied to the TDs' and Senators' pension scheme, is long overdue, but happily the need for this change has not yet arisen.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill contains five other provisions which are not directly related to review body recommendations.  The first two are enabling provisions, which will facilitate certain changes which I propose to incorporate in the Acts governing Members' free travel and telephone facilities.  The third and fifth will rectify minor defects in the existing statutory provisions governing ministerial salaries and pensions, which came to light while this Bill was being prepared.  The fourth provision will amend the Act governing the pay and pensions of members of the <Col N="1919" /> European Parliament, to enable the pension scheme for those members to be brought into line with the corresponding scheme for Members of this House and the Seanad.  I can explain these provisions as necessary on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Bill will give effect to the considered and objective recommendations of an entirely independent review body on the remuneration structure of TDs and Senators, and the pension and severance entitlements of office holders.  I hope that its passage will put an end to the misconceived, inaccurate and unjustified criticism of parliamentarians' conditions of employment which has been voiced in the mass media and elsewhere over the years.  Those provisions are still of major concern to Members of this House because we cannot &mdash; and it would be wrong &mdash; unilaterally change any of the conditions because we are linked in a very fundamental way to those covered by the Gleeson review body.  In my capacity as Minister for Finance, I will ensure that these matters are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and reported back to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party's spokesman on Finance.  I find myself in the invidious position of having to look at this Bill as I would look at any other legislation that comes before the House and ask what is fair, reasonable and in the public interest and is also fair and reasonable to the people it affects.  I am in some ways critical of the content of the Bill and I shall try to put on record my reservations about it.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Bill addresses the Gleeson recommendations it is worthy of support. Gleeson did a job of work but that job of work is not without fault.  We should not be a judge in our own cause, but it is very difficult not to give legislation presented before the House critical examination without stating what I and several Members consider to the Bill's shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> Members of the Oireachtas are not among the poorest members of the community, nor are they among the wealthiest, but they are among the most vulnerable.  There are those in society who are asked to live on very small amounts of money; they live in poverty and under very difficult circumstances. What Members have to try to do in relation to our own entitlements is to strike the balance between what is fair and reasonable for Members of Parliament as against, for instance, other public servants.</P>
    <P>I have for some time been critical of the finding of the Gleeson report.  I find it difficult to say this in the absence of Mr. Gleeson, but it is fair and reasonable to say that I find it difficult to understand why a district justice, for example, should be recommended a salary of £36,000 in the same report that recommends a salary of £26,000 for TDs.  A district justice is on the lowest rung of the judicial ladder. A district justice is entitled to be fairly well paid and I am not criticising that in any way but I find it very difficult to understand how the Gleeson Commission came up with their findings.  In the report to which the Minister referred the commission made one finding for members of the Judiciary and an entirely different finding for Members of the Oireachtas.  Lest somebody will say that members of the Judiciary do not enjoy favourable tax-free allowances, it should be pointed out that they do receive favourable tax-free allowances, and that continues for members of the Judiciary and many other taxpayers.</P>
    <P>If one considers length of service and insecurity of employment and compare the role of a legislator to that of a member of the Judiciary one will decide that parliamentarians have done very badly under the Gleeson recommendations.  I am not criticising any member ot the Judiciary or the Judiciary; I am criticising the findings of the report in relation to the Judiciary as against the Legislature. For example, a judge has permanent, secure employment and comparatively short hours.  Judges are paid much less than those who practise at the Bar but <Col N="1921" /> one of those who practised at the Bar decided that TDs are not worth the same rate as the person on the lowest rung of the Judiciary.  I find that position very difficult to accept.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of the senior Committee of this House and am aware that the chairman is paid half the amount paid to every witness who appears before that Committee.  Every witness who appears before the Committee is in permanent, secure employment in the public service. I ask anybody reporting these proceedings whether any fair, independent person examining the position would say that TDs and Senators have done well out of the measure.  In all fairness, I have to say that the permanent civil service and public servants have done much better than the elected public service and yet the elected public servants are those who are most vulnerable.  I find that position unacceptable.  I am not speaking for Members alone but also for their spouses and their families.  Families of some Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have been left in difficult circumstances and are in a difficult position.  As a person who made a living out of preparing accounts and giving tax advice &mdash; indeed I lectured on taxation in Rathmines &mdash; I have to say that TDs are not the only people to receive part of their salary tax free.  The figure, a half of their salary, was negotiated properly and above board with the chairman and members of the Revenue Commissioners.  That amount was set and was frozen.  It should at present stand at about £13,500 but it is frozen at the figure of about £6,000 mentioned in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the allowance being calculated as the entitlement to replace that figure is not based on half of our salaries but on the frozen figure introduced at that time.  I ask any fair and rasonable person, any trade unionist; any member of the National Union of Journalists; any member of the trade union representing higher civil servants; <Col N="1922" /> to ask themselves whether that is reasonable and fair.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, 1991, certainly makes amendments for Ministers and office holders but it does not do much for Members of the House. The legislation is prepared by civil servants &mdash; civil servants who would not write up their own terms of reference in this way &mdash; is brought before Cabinet, decided on by Cabinet, introduced in the House and, without any major amendment, is passed by the House.  That is not the fairest way to deal with such legislation.  If those of us who have been elected to the House five times lost our seat in the morning we would receive a puny income and would lose everything. I ask those who have drafted the Bill to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>Some people expect us to apologise for drawing a salary.  Many of those who criticise the benefits received by Members &mdash; some of them are Members of the House &mdash; would in another life negotiating for people outside the House not stand for the conditions that are being applied to ordinary Members of the House as distinct from the allowances provided for Ministers and parliamentary office holders.</P>
      <P>The question of responsibility pay is not addressed.  Unless one is the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach or the Leas-Chathaoirleach, there is no provision for anyone with a particular responsibility.  There is no provision for service pay.  Members who have served for 25 years in the House receive the same salary under the Bill as a Member who has served one or two years.  There is no allowance for length of service.  Some Members of the House do not seek ministerial Office &mdash; they want to be career parliamentarians.  I have to admit that I am not one of them. In the case of Members who wish to serve as parliamentarians, to spend their time in the House contributing from the back-benches there is no provision for service pay.  That is unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House might reflect on this.  Honestly, instead of having to discuss our affairs publicly in this way, in a forum in which we are all a little too windy to compare ourselves in a fair way to any official in the public service, it should be possible to have a fair and independent outside association to represent the interests of TDs and negotiate with Government. For instance, could the Association of Higher Civil Servants not become the Higher Association of Public Servants and include a section for TDs so that we would not have to negotiate our own entitlements?  If that were to happen we would very quickly find that the anomalies and insecurities faced by Members of the House would be addressed.  In this forum we possibly cannot do what we should be doing because of the fear of setting a trend for other areas.</P>
      <P>Some Members will for their own political gain denigrate any possible advantage or anything that would seem to be to the benefit of Members of the House. The reality is that it is becoming ever more difficult to attract people into politics because of the lifestyle, the hours of work, the instability, the pressures and, I have to say, the pay and conditions.  I would ask the Minister to consider inserting a condition in this Bill that anybody who criticises its provisions do not have to accept its benefits, that its benefits should apply only to Members who apply for them.  The Minister should insert that condition and ascertain whether there are any Members who do not apply for its benefits.  That is my recommendation to the Minister, and would be in the case of any other Bill of this nature that would be introduced in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We operate this Parliament on a shoestring. We need only examine how the Estimate for this House is made up, for example the hiring of outside consultants to advise parliamentary committees in respect of which I think the figure last <Col N="1924" /> year was £75,000.  Of course the Department of Finance voted themselves £800,000 &mdash; which we rubber-stamped &mdash; to get outside people to advise them. Constantly within every area of expenditure Parliament is being run on a shoestring. As I have said on numerous occasions, this is the worst resourced head office in town.  Only when Members of this House decide that, as Members of Parliament, they will insist on the proper facilities with which to undertake their task, including proper telephone and fax facilities here and, if necessary, in our constituencies, with the proper back-up facilities, will we be able to undertake that task properly.  In addition, we should have offices where we can meet people instead of having to take them to the bar or restaurant, which is a constant cost to Members.  Until we are prepared to do so, ensuring that Parliament is properly resourced, nobody will take us seriously and the remainder of the public service will run riot without the proper supervision of Parliament.  I do not believe that is right or acceptable.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the changes that need to be implemented here in relation to payments to Members of Parliament, remuneration packages for Members of Parliament, office holders, we need to examine the whole question of Dáil reform which is long overdue.  We should assert our right to participate in the legislative process.  For instance, this Bill should be considered by a special committee of the House.  It should have been drafted by people assisting Members of the House.  Members should have before them examples of how other parliaments operate.  We should have all of the alternatives available to us so that we can reach a reasonable, balanced decision, and that by a committee of the House. We should insist on parliamentary reform.  How long will we allow this charade continue in this Parliament and the way it operates?  All of those things need to be addressed.  I will throw in, at the same time, the whole question of funding of parties and constituency operations <i>vis-à-vis</i> elections of TDs.</P>
    <P>I intend to table certain amendments <Col N="1925" /> on Committee Stage.  First I suggest that the question of telephone calls from TDs constituencies should be comprised of telephone and telefax facilities, not just calls.  In this day and age there should be available to us in our constituencies fax machines.  One might well ask also why the telephone rental is not included in the provisions of this Bill?  Is there something wrong with that; is the apparatus different from the actual service itself?  I do think that rental charge should be included.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there should be provision made for proper severance pay.  I note that the Minister has said he has sent that aspect back for consideration to the Gleeson Commission.  I contend that severance pay should be payable, as it would to others in the private sector.  I would ask the House to consider an amendment allowing for persons with service in other parliaments, who do not at present benefit from that service, have that reckonable for service here.  I am thinking of Members who might have served in Northern Ireland and who might not at present derive any benefit from such service. That is something we might consider, particularly since that service will have been given for the peaceable continuity of life in both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will support this Bill.  I will be introducing one or two technical amendments along the way.  The Minister is right to address some of the other problems which arise.  Many Members who enter this House make great sacrifices in so doing.  While we are not complaining about those sacrifices we have made it would be wrong of me, as the father of four children, the only breadwinner in my household, not to say I am concerned or worried about the provisions for my spouse and children in the event of my untimely death.  I know there are some people who would like to bring that event about sooner than is likely to happen but, in such event I would like to believe there would be proper provision for my wife and children, just as I would believe there should be in the case of any servant I would engage myself, or there would be for any servant the State would engage, <Col N="1926" /> proper provision having being made to protect their dependants so that they would not be vulnerable and thrown to the wolves just because their spouse happened to spend his or her life contributing to the State by way of seeking to serve in Parliament.  I do not believe there is any greater service one can render beyond that in perhaps certain vocations, religious or medical where people can directly serve their fellow man &mdash; either in the elected public service or in the mainstream, permanent public service.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues needing to be addressed have not been addressed in this Bill, but, so far as the provisions go and meet the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission, albeit with the shortcomings I have pointed out, I will be supporting its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I might begin by commenting briefly on Deputy Gay Mitchell's contribution and I find myself in agreement with a lot of what he said.  It is time we had a discussion like this on the Floor of the House.  Events in recent months have thrown up a clear lack in the way we manage the affairs of this country. Clearly this House has very little power in the management of the laws we enact, the following-up of issues that are important in debate here.  Clearly we do not have teeth in many of the committees that are supposed to be the most important committees of State.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the issue of resourcing the Oireachtas would be put, not on the back burner, but on the front of a Government agenda, if there has been any outcome from all the recent spate of scandals it would be that we need an Oireachtas capable of management, calling people to account and, most of all, minding the resources of this State and advancing the interests of ordinary citizens. Clearly that is something we do not do well at present.  I am in agreement with many of Deputy Gay Mitchell's comments in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can start by valuing ourselves as Members of the Oireachtas because, God knows, there are many outside this House whose esteem for Members of this <Col N="1927" /> House is very low.  Unfortunately we ourselves contribute in no small way to the lack of esteem the profession of politician now enjoys in this country.</P>
    <P>We do need to have basic facilities.  It is an irony that anybody in this House who is a front bench spokesperson, often receives deputations from interest or lobby groups resourced to the hilt, who have the most up-to-date research to contribute to legislation passing through this House, whereas we Members have no such back-up or support.  Any examination of the basic offices and equipment we share, equipment from telephones to fax machines, clearly demonstrates that we do not resource our democracy.  It is because of that lack of resources that our democratic institutions have failed patently in recent months to properly manage the affairs of our country.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that at least this debate would begin the process of addressing some of the many anomalous issues of equity, the first of which has long been a bone of contention outside. Many of the issues addressed in this Bill are contentious for the public through lack of understanding of the real position. For example, Deputy Gay Mitchell mentioned that it is a common belief that half of TDs' salaries are tax-free, the same belief that says that we all have free drink and food in Leinster House bars and restaurants. That is common belief because we do not tell the truth about it, that no such facilities exist in this House, that the price of food or drink in this House is as dear as in any other downtown enterprise in central Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial allowance of half our salary tax-free that existed many years ago was negotiated with the Revenue Commissioners as a fair allowance for constituency expenses which were not recouped by the State.  By arbitrary decision of the Minister for Finance some years ago that allowance was fixed at a point in time.  Every increase since then negotiated through national agreements <Col N="1928" /> further eroded the value of that tax-free allowance.  An arbitrary stop was put on by a Minister for Finance.  Unfortunately the Gleeson Committee fixed the allowance as at that time and simply transferred it from an allowance to a cash sum, without regard to what the expense was supposed to cover.</P>
      <P>I welcome the notion of asking the Gleeson Committee to work out what the tax allowance was initially meant to do. It was to cover genuine expenses which are not recoupable.  My constituency is large, although by no means the largest. It is 40 miles in length and about 20 miles wide.  Serving the constituents who sent me to this House involves a fair amount of travelling within the constituency.  As a front bench spokesman for my party I also have responsibilities which take me around the country.  No expenses are recoupable for that.  Gleeson should have regard for these figures before plucking a firm amount from the air and legislating for it.</P>
      <P>There is a great misconception among the general public who believe that we have allowances which are not available to ordinary PAYE workers.  For that reason I strongly welcome the proposed changes which will treat Members of the Oireachtas like every other citizen.  It is right that all our salary should be treated in the same way as the salary of other citizens.  If nothing else, it might bring a degree of urgency to the reform of the PAYE tax burden.  If it sharpened the focus on that, it would be a welcome development.  Restoring confidence in this House must involve blowing away the myths in the minds of some people about the privileges which Members enjoy.  I welcome the change from a tax-free allowance to a directly calculated sum for genuine expenses.  I hope there will be some degree of calculation by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration as to the real expenses which are an essential part of the work of Deputies and Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue addressed in the Bill is severance payments.  I am glad we are talking about severance payments rather than termination allowances.  There is a <Col N="1929" /> certain permanence about the latter term which strikes me as chilling.  Many of us are regularly subject to termination. There is no other occupation where, despite very hard work, a person can be dismissed at the whim of the people every four years or every six months, if circumstances so dictate.  Members have been coming in and out of this House like yoyos in the past decade.  That is unique. There is no other job where a person may not expect to be kept on if he does his work well.  On cessation of employment a person is protected by redundancy provisions and other mechanisms.  We must have regard for the unique circumstances of Members of this House.  I welcome the notion of a severance payment to cushion to some degree the trauma of losing one's seat.  For those with families who are totally dependent on an income from this House it is doubly traumatic.  There is a public trauma of losing one's seat and the private trauma of waking up the next day without an income.  It is quite horrendous and would make the occupation unacceptable to many people from whose services the State could benefit.  It is time we addressed that issue.  The turnover in membership of this House has been quite spectacular during the past 20 years.  The certainty of coming into this House for 15, 20 or 30 years which was a feature of political life up to the sixties is not a feature of public life now.  I am not sure that many of us would have the stamina for that length of service.  Certainly the public do not seem to have an appetite for tolerating people spending that length of time in this House.  We must adjust to that reality.</P>
    <P>The contentious issue of ministerial pensions has aroused public indignation. It is a bone of contention that anybody could qualify for a pension in three years. It is also unacceptable to the public that somebody could be paid a pension following three years' service as a Minister while continuing to be a Member of this House, without holding office.  This payment was not intended to be a pension in any traditional way.  It was to be a monetary compensation for people who took up public office and thereby severed <Col N="1930" /> their connection with any other occupation or income they may have enjoyed therefrom.  When they ceased to have the benefit of a ministerial allowance, they were intended to have some allowance which would cushion their drop in salary to that of a mere backbencher.  That was not accepted by the general public.  The term &ldquo;pension&rdquo; was wrong and the notion of paying people on the double because they had held office for a number of years was unacceptable.  I welcome the change whereby allowances would only be paid at the age of 55.  That brings us into line with the trend in changing retirement ages.  There is quite a generous cushioning for Ministers losing office, but the same generosity is not forthcoming for mere Members in respect of severance payments.  I hope the Minister's referral of this matter to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration will bring about some changes in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of spouses and children's pension entitlement.  This recognises the reality that many officeholders will be female and clearly all officeholders should be treated in like fashion.  That amendment is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is a change in telephone regulations. The general public would not be aware how Dickensian are the regulations governing the use of telephones in this House.  It is unbelievable.  Some of us have looked at the regulations and taken on the officials in the Department of Finance, who are not proscribed in the same way as we are under existing regulations.  I welcome the modification as a first step in providing resources to politicians.  I resent the notion that as a Member and as Labour Party spokesman for the environment I cannot ring Brussels if I want information on EC Directives which impact on my area of responsibility.  I resent that any civil servant or Minister should seek to circumscribe my right to make contact with my constituents.  The use of the telephone has changed beyond all recognition since the initial regulations were drawn up.  As I said, most plumbers, carpenters, etc. now have mobile phones.  Yet we are still <Col N="1931" /> in the position where, in accordance with the regulations which govern the phones in this House, we can make three minute phone calls to our constituents.  I hope very considerable improvements will be made in relation to this issue and that recognition will be given to the fact that many Deputies run constituency offices.</P>
    <P>A very interesting comparison was drawn by the consultants to a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in regard to two aspects of the treatment of parliamentarians in this and other countries.  The first related to salaries and allowances and the second &mdash; which is more interesting from my perspective at least &mdash; related to the facilities available to parliamentarians. We came out very badly in this comparison. It is time we gave democratic institutions the teeth they need to function efficiently.  I hope that the Minister will take the first step in that direction in this Bill so that we can work efficiently, legislate effectively and serve the needs of all the people.  We have not been great in our own defence in recent times and the institutions of this House have suffered, the committees of this House have suffered and the democratic accountability of the servants of this House has suffered.  I hope we can begin the process of having a more vibrant, accountable and transparent democracy on foot of the proposed changes in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether one agrees or disagrees with its proposals, this is an important Bill.  Therefore, it is very surprising that the Government, with the consent of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, have decided to rush the Bill through the Dáil, allowing just five and a quarter hours for the debate on all five Stages.  This is inadequate and will mean, for instance, that many of the nine amendments we have tabled for Committee Stage will not be debated by the House.  This Bill will affect the vital interests of Members of the Oireachtas and especially office holders &mdash; Government Ministers, the Attorney General, <Col N="1932" /> the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  There is, therefore, a particular obligation on the House to ensure that the Bill and all its implications are fully discussed and considered and that the public are aware of what is involved.  That will not be the case because of the way in which this debate is being guillotined.</P>
      <P>This Bill is based on reports Nos. 30 and 31 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector which were published in June 1988.  Nothing was done with the reports for three and half years yet six days after a Bill was produced the Dáil was asked to take all Stages in one day in the final week before the Christmas recess.  Is it any wonder that the public are cynical and disillusioned about the manner in which we conduct our affairs in this House?</P>
      <P>There is a particular need for sensitivity by the Dáil at present given the decision of the Government to unilaterally breach the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> by pleading inability to pay special pay awards already agreed on and the decision to restrict the payment of the general pay increase of 3 per cent due in January. Against this background it is particularly surprising that the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill offers no information as to the cost implications of the legislation.  The inclusion of a statement of the financial implications in the explanatory memorandum is now virtually standard procedure in all Bills circulated by the Government.  The explanatory memorandum for the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, circulated today, contains such a statement and its omission from the explanatory memorandum on this Bill is particularly odd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to suggest that the Bill will save the Exchequer any money in the immediate future.  Indeed, it may well cost the taxpayers additional money.  This House and the public are entitled to this information and I call on the Minister or the Minister of State in replying to the debate to clearly set out the exact position in this regard.  The Minister for Finance in his speech did not in any way <Col N="1933" /> address what I believe to be an essential and important aspect of the legislation which should be considered by the House when debating its merits, that is, does the Bill represent on balance a saving to the taxpayer or will it prove to be an expensive piece of legislation for the House?  I fully accept in relation to pension entitlements that it is often very difficult to work out the precise costs but there must surely be some estimate available to the Department which should be made available to us.  Are we being asked to pass a Bill in respect of which there is no estimate of cost implications?</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party were the first party in this House to raise the issue of the payment of ministerial pensions to sitting Members of the Oireachtas.  For ten years we have pressed for reform of the system of ministerial pensions and, in particular, for the ending of the procedures whereby Ministers qualified for substantial pensions after just three years in office and continued to draw them while also in receipt of salaries as Members of the Oireachtas.  Despite the perception created by the media that it was the Progressive Democrats who first raised the matter, I have on file a series of press statements and parliamentary questions on these matters from the Workers' Party going back to 1982 and 1983.  It was a series of questions from The Workers' Party which first drew attention to the level of ministerial pensions paid to sitting Members of the Oireachtas.  The Private Members' Bill on the issue introduced by the Progressive Democrats in 1987 certainly helped to advance the debate on the matter.  However, the Bill falls far short of what Deputy O'Malley and his colleagues sought to do in that measure.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong not to acknowledge that the Bill before us represents a step forward.  The regularisation of the position of TDs regarding income tax payments is welcome.  There is no reason TDs should not be treated for income tax purposes on the same basis as other workers.  The principle of a severance payment for TDs who lose their seats is also a good one, although the deal proposed for them is far inferior to the <Col N="1934" /> arrangements being made for Ministers who lose office.  The introduction of a contribution towards the cost of telephone calls made by TDs from outside of Leinster House is also welcome.  This addresses a long-standing anomaly whereby rural Deputies, unlike their Dublin colleagues are not in a position to use their Leinster House offices on non-sitting days or during the recess and incur huge telephone bills.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill falls far short of what is required in a number of important areas.  The matter which has caused most anger among the public has been the practice of paying ministerial pensions to sitting Members of the Oireachtas.  As at April of this year some 33 former office holders, who are now sitting Members of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament or members of the Judiciary, drew between them pensions with a total annual cost to taxpayers of almost £250,000.  In one case a former Minister who is still a Member of this House has been drawing a pension, which now amounts to £14,000, for over 21 years. These payments will remain unchanged after this legislation is passed.  In addition, any member of the present Government who loses ministerial office following the next general election, is removed from office or resigns in the meantime will also benefit from the existing generous pension regime.  Nothing will be altered for them under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that the public want to see an end to the payment of ministerial pensions to sitting Members of the Oireachtas and we have tabled an amendment which proposes that pensions paid to current Members should now cease until they reach the age of 55.  The pension would then recommence, with the application of the abatement provisions in this Bill.  I know that the Gleeson report rejected this idea and I have no doubt that the Minister will argue that people are used to receiving this money, that they have made commitments on the basis that they will continue to receive it and that it would be wrong, therefore, to end the payments. <Col N="1935" /> The Gleeson report will by and large be the reference by which we will address issues in regard to pay, pensions and conditions in this House in the future. However, like all other reports commissioned by the Government from independent bodies we will not be fully bound by it.  When one considers the disregard shown by the Government to the reports which emanate from the Law Reform Commission on a regular basis it must be difficult for any Minister to come in here and argue, as the Minister for Finance has done this evening, that we should implement the proposals in the Bill because the Gleeson report recommends it.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to honouring commitments simply because they are there, neither legal nor moral arguments were obstacles to the Government when, in the mid-eighties, they introduced the EC Directive on Social Welfare Equalisation in such a manner as to substantially cut the entitlements of certain social welfare recipients.  These issues were not any problem when the Government introduced the Social Welfare Bill, 1991, which substantially cut the incomes of unmarried couples who were cohabiting.</P>
    <P>The Estimates, being published today will provide for cutbacks in Government expenditure of perhaps £400 million. People will lose services and facilities. Why then should the position of former Ministers be sacrosanct?  Why should the Government have any hesitation in accepting an amendment on Committee Stage tabled by The Workers' Party to cease the payment of all pensions to Members who are currently entitled to them until such time as they cease to be Members or attain the age of 55 years?</P>
    <P>It is only when Ministers who are members of the Government elected after the next general election go out of office that the reforms will come into place.  There is a perception that the legislation in regard to ministerial pensions will become operable as soon as the Bill is enacted.  However, when one looks more closely at the Bill one will see that <Col N="1936" /> the provisions with regard to ministerial pensions could come into operation as far ahead as 1998 or 1999, depending on progress.</P>
    <P>In addition, former Ministers who then qualified will still enjoy a pension regime far more generous than anything found in the public service or the private sector. While the payment of pensions will be deferred to the age of 55 and will then be stopped if the person concerned is a Member of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament, the fact remains that a former Minister will still qualify for a pension of 25 per cent of salary after just three years' service, a scheme which does not exist in the public or private sectors.  In addition, the maximum rate of ministerial pension is being increased from 45 per cent to 60 per cent of salary; most other workers have to put in a lifetime in a job to qualify for a 60 per cent pension.  Former Ministers will now get a 60 per cent pension after just ten years' service.</P>
    <P>In addition, certain new perks are being introduced for Ministers and Ministers of State.  The introduction of a new special tax allowance for office holders who maintain two places of residence must be resisted.  Many people outside Dublin &mdash; especially civil servants &mdash; have to come to the capital to find work and have to maintain a residence here but they do not get any such generous tax allowance, nor is it suggested that they should.  In any Government Department one will find hundreds, if not thousands, of civil servants who consider that their homes are in the country, who travel to and from the city every week and who must maintain a flat or other residence in Dublin for work reasons only.  Why should they not have a nice arrangement like the one being written into the legislation for Ministers and other office holders?</P>
    <P>The principle of a severance payment for TDs who lose their seats is a good one and we have no problem with the principle of a similar arrangement for Ministers who lose office.  However, what a difference is proposed between the arrangements for TDs and Ministers; a <Col N="1937" /> TD will receive a severance payment of just three months' salary provided in the meantime that he or she is not re-elected. A Minister, on the other hand, will receive 75 per cent of salary for the first six months, 50 per cent for the next 12 months and 25 per cent for the next six months.  The ministerial severance payment will be the equivalent of 12 months' salary spread over two years.</P>
    <P>The arrangement for TDs will be the same, irrespective of whether they have served two or 22 years in the Dáil, which seems very unfair, especially as there is no incremental salary for TDs.  It is regrettable that the Gleeson Commission rejected in such a peremptory fashion the argument for an incremental salary for TDs.  Virtually all public servants are on incremental salary scales; a public servant who serves this House knows that in ten years he or she will be earning substantially more.  A TD will be on the same basic salary ten years on or for however long he or she remains in the House.  However, in regard to the severance payments, it should be asked why TDs and Ministers should be treated so differently from other workers.  Surely the best arrangement would be for TDs and Ministers who lose their positions to be treated in exactly the same way as other workers who lose their jobs and qualify for redundancy payments under the appropriate legislation.  We will be addressing this matter by way of amendment and I hope time will be available to debate the merits of such a proposal on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>While this Bill is being debated the Estimates for 1992 are being published and we are told they will provide for cutbacks in Government expenditure of around £400 million.  There will be cutbacks in a wide range of public services; people will suffer.  Against this background the continuation of such a privileged regime for former Government Ministers is simply not justified.  People are fed up hearing Government Ministers lecturing the public about belt-tightening while not being prepared to tighten their own belts.</P>
    <P>We have always believed that TDs <Col N="1938" /> should be paid adequately for the job they perform.  Ministers are also TDs and it is appropriate that they should receive an enhanced salary reflecting the responsibility of their office.  The principle of the introduction of a salary for Members of Parliament was essential for the evolution of fully representative democracy.  Decent salaries are necessary to ensure that membership of the Dáil does not become the sole preserve of businessmen, the self-employed, farmers, auctioneers and so on, many of whom can participate in the Dáil without being dependent on Dáil salaries.</P>
    <P>In the same way we accept that many Ministers carry a huge workload and additional responsibilities, it is reasonable that they should be paid a sum over and above their basic TD's salary.  It is also reasonable that provision should be made for an adequate pension for later life.  On the other hand, it should be pointed out and noted that there are many perks and privileges attached to the office of Minister.  The salary is generous by any standards, about four times the average male industrial wage.  A State car and driver are provided for Ministers and an allowance to cover this is allocated to Ministers of State.  In some cases up to six civil servants are provided at taxpayers expense to look after the Minister's constituents. Many, although not all, have outside professional or business interests to which they can revert when leaving office.  Therefore, we should not make too much of the poor mouth about the plight of &ldquo;impoverished&rdquo; Ministers; nor should we forget that, despite the difficulties of the job, there is no shortage of candidates for either the Dáil or ministerial office.</P>
    <P>In regard to the pensions controversy, there is indeed an argument for abolishing the separate scheme of ministerial pensions and replacing it by an integrated income-related pension scheme for all Oireachtas Members.  This would be paid to all Deputies at the same age and under the same conditions.  However, because of their substantially higher earnings while holding office, former Ministers <Col N="1939" /> would draw a substantially higher pension but, for all other purposes and on all other bases, the scheme would be equally applicable to all Members of the Oireachtas, regardless of whether they were office holders.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents some progress but it is a missed opportunity to end what most people consider a scandal in regard to payment of ministerial pensions to sitting Members of the Oireachtas.  We have not been provided with full information about its cost implications and the manner in which it is being rushed through the Dáil is shameful.  The Workers' Party will not oppose Second Stage but we will be tabling nine amendments on Committee Stage.  How we vote on the Final Stages will be determined by the way in which the Minister responds to our amendments.</P>

      <P>I am glad I have been in the House for most of Deputy McCartan's contribution because the next time I am looking for a solicitor I will certainly contact the firm of solicitors of which he was once a partner because I know their fees will be reasonable and will be very cheap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure the service will be very good but I doubt whether the fees will be cheap.  When I read of lawyers and other people in the legal profession commanding so much in fees per day and I look around Leinster House and see the miserable allowances and the conditions which Deputies in this House have to put up with, I ask myself a few serious questions.  It is not easy for a Deputy to come into the House and speak about salaries and allowances of Oireachtas Members.  I am sure many Deputies on all sides of the House would prefer if this matter was not brought into the public arena.  What we have heard in the past few minutes is what I would generally classify as pub talk, because <Col N="1940" /> that is what it was.  A great way to get a debate going in the pub, when the lads are standing up beside the bar is when somebody says: &ldquo;Deputy so-and-so has a great lifestyle, he has a fortune, he has a salary, is paid expenses and so on,&rdquo; when the Deputy is probably trying to keep the bank manager from tearing down the door of the house.  That is the kind of talk that takes place regarding both ministerial allowances and pensions and TD's salaries and pensions and it is encouraged by certain parties in this House and, worse still, it is encouraged by members of the media.  Members of the media are so busy today that not one of them can sit in the gallery to listen to this debate. I am quite certain &mdash; as has happened every year since I became a Member of this House &mdash; between the time the Dáil goes into recess and before we resume there will be an article about the salaries of Dáil Deputies, their expenses, the number of days the Dáil sits per annum and so on.  We have an article on those lines year in year out and I am sure it will be no different on this occasion.  That type of article comes from people in the media who work about nine days per fortnight and enjoy considerably better salaries, expenses and overnight allowances than any Deputy in this House could every hope to have, irrespective of whether it is recommended in a Gleeson or a Devlin report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is supposed to be about ministerial pensions and since I have never been in that privileged position, it should not really concern me but there are sections in the Bill which impinge upon the terms and conditions of ordinary TDs and it is those matters I hope to address. The standing in which we are held by the community and the public at large is caused by ourselves; the salaries and allowances which we pay ourselves are not solely responsible, there are many other issues also.  The story I am about to relate has been attributed to the late John Kelly.  He remembers a TD coming to him who said: &ldquo;I have a terrible life down in the country, I cannot get out on a Sunday or go to a football match or anything else as people come at all hours <Col N="1941" /> of the day&rdquo;.  He said he had been trying to get out last Sunday and a constituent came along and he had to deal with his problem over lunch.  He said he had a terrible dose of the flu and the TD asked him whether he would think of going to the doctor.  The man said he could not disturb the doctor on a Sunday.  Yet, he had no difficulty in disturbing the TD.</P>
    <P>When we come to talk about our own terms and conditions the lot of a TD is totally different from that which exists in any other democracy that I know of. There is no specific provision in the Constitution to say we should be doing the work which most of us spend our time doing.  Every time there has been a Gleeson report &mdash; or, prior to that, Devlin commissions &mdash; the problem encountered is that the expenses which TDs incur in the job they do is not specifically provided for in the Constitution.  The name Teachta Dála as mentioned in the Constitution could be known as messenger of the people.  I do not think it was ever envisaged that the messenger of the people would be so laid down with messages that when he gets to Dáil Éireann he can hardly find his way to the Chamber. That is the position as it exists in Irish politics and we have to recognise it and pay ourselves accordingly.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on his accession to that office.  This is the first Bill he has introduced to this House as Minister for Finance.  The former Minister and the Cabinet who drew up this Bill have done a great job for ex-office holders.  As a pal of mine in the country said, if a man is not able to look after his own business I do not want him to look after mine either.  So far as the changes in this Bill affect ex-Ministers, and people who will be ex-Ministers, they have done a very good job for themselves.  I should like to ensure that Deputies whose terms, conditions and pensions may not be as good, that they would have something <i>pari passu</i> with the changes being made here for office holders.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for generous severance allowances for ex-Ministers. It cannot be compared with what <Col N="1942" /> Deputies and Senators will receive when they leave this House.  I note from the Minister's speech that the change to section 5 &mdash; which deals with severance payments &mdash; will be done by order. In his contribution he said that the Government have decided that there cannot be any improvement to what is set out in the Bill at present.  We may be a long time waiting in this House before another Minister will have the courage to come back with another Bill or to make some amendments to existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The two most progressive Ministers regarding TDs pay and conditions were the Taoiseach and the former Minister for the Public Service, John Boland. Although John Boland is no longer a Member of the House he is remembered by TDs on all sides for the changes he made to the pension regulations.  I am sure every civil servant in the Department of the Public Service at the time told him he could not do this, that or the other but he did it.  He improved certain aspects of pensions and I congratulate him on doing that.</P>
    <P>I would remind all TDs that since I became a Member of this House various Governments &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; have postponed increases to Oireachtas Members and we were pilloried by the people when we postponed them and we were pilloried by the people when we succeeded in getting them eventually but we got no thanks.  One will not get thanks from any person in Irish life by downgrading oneself.  Oireachtas Members should be paid properly and should have facilities which are equivalent to those provided in the private and public sectors.  It was only in the past year that we got decent equipment, such as computers and FAX machines.  It is not too long ago since there was one secretary for seven Oireachtas Members in Leinster House, some time ago there was one secretary to four Oireachtas Members and now each Deputy has a secretary.</P>
    <P>In regard to the telephone allowance which is mentioned in the Bill, that matter was discussed ten years ago when I was on the Committee on Procedure <Col N="1943" /> and Privileges.  I am delighted the Minister has brought in a section which enables some form of telephone allowance to be paid to Oireachtas Members.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan took issue with the income tax regulations as pertains to the dual-abode allowance as if this was a new allowance for Ministers.  The dual abode allowance for serving Cabinet Ministers has been part of the income tax regulations for some considerable time.  It is not a new allowance, so there will be no extra cost.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the Bill. Severance allowances proposed for TDs will now be implemented by order of the Minister, but I doubt that we will ever see one in the lifetime of this Dáil.  Deputies should be prepared to stand up for their rights, to say that we should be paid properly and should have proper conditions and allowances.  They should not apologise to the public for asking for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily welcome the Bill.  It should not be rushed through the House in one day.  Too much legislation is being rushed through the House.  When the Progressive Democrats, now partners in Government, instigated this proposal nothing happened. We are now coming to a crucial time for electoral fortunes and the gun has been put to the heads of the major party in Government.  If this is not passed before Christmas the junior partner may pull the plug.  There is not any good reason why this could not have been taken in the first week in February.  It has been around long enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially the major party in Government were not in favour of this kind of legislation, nor was I.  Every other year there is a witch-hunt with an attack on some benefit public representatives have. The 50 per cent tax break for expenses which has been attacked was agreed with the Revenue Commissioners as a fair and reasonable allowance.  It was cut down a number of years ago and was never upgraded to meet legitimate expenses. Gleeson considered the allowance on the <Col N="1944" /> basis of what was there, but he should have gone back further.</P>
    <P>When we come under pressure from the public we seem to wilt.  We are not prepared to stand up for what we believe to be right and effective.  &ldquo;Ministerial pensions&rdquo; may have been the wrong words to use, but there are good reasons for the pensions.  When a Minister loses his post and ends up on the Opposition benches he suffers a considerable salary reduction.  Most of those who serve in ministries come back as Front Bench Opposition spokespersons without any resources.  The basis of good democracy is the strength of the Opposition.  Front Bench Members should be paid allowances as should chairmen of committees because of the volume of work involved. It is ridiculous to eliminate an allowance just because somebody else might not have it.  For a Minister to end up on the Opposition Front Bench without any resources is not good for democracy or for the functioning of this House.  We should not be penny-pinching.  We cannot get good democracy and good government on the cheap.  We should remember that.</P>
    <P>To put the figures in perspective, one could go into the law courts, nod one's head and charge a fee of £1,000 with no problem.  I was Government Chief Whip in a minority Government and Deputies can imagine what that was like.  I was also a junior Minister in the Department of the Environment.  For those additional jobs, I got into my hand £100 per week despite all the talk we hear of the great salaries.  I am now in receipt of a ministerial pension.  That is reported in the papers about three or four times a year, so there is not any secret about it.  What I get into my hand by way of ministerial pension is £50 a week.</P>
    <P>Some people try to ferret out something else that they can try to take from us.  Perhaps The Workers' Party will think of something because we are now going to get what will be an inadequate allowance.  In three years time people will say that we should not have the telephone allowance and we will all get weak at the knees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> I am disappointed with the Minister. What annoys me about the House recently is that when we have any problem we set up a commission.  To set the electoral boundaries we had to have a commission because we were not fit to do it.  We could not be trusted with planning and we set up a board which we reconstituted a number of times but there are now smells coming from it.  That never happened when Ministers were in charge, because they were accountable to this House.  That is what democracy is about. Such matters should not be passed on to commissions.  I remind the Minister that under the Acts he could have dealt with pensions; he has that discretion.  As Deputy McCreevy said, former Deputy John Boland when Minister dealt with many matters for Deputies.  He made many fair and reasonable changes without introducing legislation in the House. He did not pass problems over to a commission so that they could take the blame. It is our job to make decisions, not to hide behind the coat-tails of any commission. We should not be afraid but, unfortunately, we are.</P>
    <P>A person joins a pension scheme knowing that the scheme is constructed in such a way that he will in all probability realise the pension.  In relation to the figure of 27 years, as Deputy Howlin said, this probably would have been all right in the thirties, forties and fifties but it is certainly not all right today.  We should examine the record and note the changes in personnel following elections, during the past ten years in particular, and the fall-out.  The businesses of a number of people have gone to the wall but nobody talks about this.  They talk instead about the other side and do not face up to the hard reality.  When someone walks out the gate after losing their seat &mdash; this happened to me but only for a short period of time &mdash; no one wants to know them; they are as dead as mutton.  It is time that we looked seriously at this matter because the scheme is in need of review.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House some facts and figures in relation to my own party.  If one needs 27 years service to qualify for <Col N="1946" /> a pension one would have had to begun service in 1965.  Of the Fine Gael Members elected in 1965 none remains; only one remains of those elected in 1961; five remain of those elected in 1969 and only one remains of those elected in 1973 when there was a large influx of new Fine Gael Deputies.  If we talk about the need to have a pension scheme we must talk about a figure which Members can hope to arrive at at some stage.</P>
    <P>I understand that this matter is to be referred to the Gleeson Commission. Now that the gentleman is to be engaged &mdash; and, I might add, not for £50 or £100 a week, and the best of luck to him, if those are his fees &mdash; I have no complaint to make but I would like this matter to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is giving himself the power to introduce regulations.  This is all right provided that when the time comes he will have the bottle to introduce them.  It is obvious the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet would not have decided to refer this matter to the Gleeson Commission unless they thought a reasonable case could be made &mdash; at least I hope they would not refer matters if a case could not be made &mdash; but I would like the Minister to give us a clear indication that any changes made on foot of the report of the Gleeson Commission will be put into operation once the Bill is passed. This is only fair and reasonable and I hope this will be accepted.</P>
    <P>In relation to ministerial pensions, like the State cars, if they go, they go.  As Deputy McCartan said, there will be no saving for the Exchequer immediately but there will be a saving.  As in the case of redundancies, there will be no change immediately but there will be down the road because in the future pension payments will not be made to former Ministers until they attain a certain age, if that is seen to be fair, or unless they happen to suffer from ill health.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, I am concerned that there is a lack of commitment to the House.  The junior partner in Government always talk about the need for Dáil reform and I have no doubt that <Col N="1947" /> they are the people responsible for the decision that the Bill should go through the House in one day.  We do not want that type of reform.  The Leader of that party, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, guillotined the debate on the Companies Bill when that most important legislation passed through the House. Indeed he guillotined the debate on another Bill in the House last week.  There is a need for serious Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>What we need are back-up services. If we are to remove remuneration from those who have served on the other side of the House we must provide them with back-up services and the tools that they require to ensure a good and effective Opposition.  Deputies should also have far better access to research facilities, which is the case in all other parliaments. We operate on a shoestring: we have an office and a secretary to trundle out constituency gunge which goes in and out on a weekly basis.  I am not going to talk about our electoral system, with its multi-seat constituencies but that is the result it has produced.  In my constituency recently four or five Deputies, along with two or three officials from the corporation, went to look at a railing which had fallen down.  Was that not very enlightening?  That is the result of having four- and five-seat constituencies.  If neither I nor my colleague went out we would have been pilloried.  If we are to talk about the need for change and the need to be effective in the House let us have a real debate but the one thing we cannot do is run parliament on a shoestring or on the cheap.</P>
    <P>People are not attracted to membership of the House by the conditions offered and the insecurity attached. Deputy McCartan said that many people want to be Deputies.  There would probably a queue outside the door but are they the people we want?  We want people who are committed and dedicated and who are not in politics for the glory but to make changes which are necessary in society.  By denigrating ourselves and seeking to run parliament on the cheap, <Col N="1948" /> we will not get the parliament that induces the enthusiasm needed.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this long awaited Bill into the House is a particularly proud moment, and a landmark achievement for the Progressive Democrats' Party. Reform of the system of ministerial pension has for the Progressive Democrats since our establishment which, coincidentally, was just six years ago this coming weekend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the founding principles of the Progressive Democrats is to restore public trust, confidence and credibility in our political institutions, and in our political practitioners.  To that end we are extremely conscious that a major anomaly and impediment to achieving such public trust was the system of payment of ministerial pensions to former office holders.  This was on the basis that Deputies of this House, who had served as Ministers for at least three years, or as Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers of State for at least eight years, would qualify for and receive a pension notwithstanding the fact that they would still be Members of the Oireachtas; also that they could have an income from <Col N="1949" /> other, private sources, and could be people of relatively young age, and certainly not of an age generally regarded as being in the &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; category.  We know, for instance, that in recent times Members of this House in their thirties have received ministerial pensions arising from their service in Government.</P>
      <P>The blunt question which the Progressive Democrats have sought to square up to is how we can develop and sustain the trust and confidance of the general public in politicians and in our political institutions and, at the same time, demand sacrifices of them in the interest of trying to get this country to live within its means, while tolerating such anomalies as the ministerial pensions system.  That was the driving force behind this particular policy initiative of the Progressive Democrats.  Indeed, our very first Private Members' time legislative initiative, taken in October 1987 &mdash; eight months after the party contested their first general election &mdash; proposed the abolition of the ministerial pension system.  To demonstrate the Progressive Democrats commitment and earnestness on this matter my party colleague and I voluntarily surrendered our then ministerial pensions, which were roughly in the order of £8,000 per annum for each of us, as an earnest of our determination to lead by example on this important matter.  In passing I should note that the former President, Dr. Hillery, also surrendered his ministerial pension and he too demonstrated the kind of stand on this matter which is needed in these tough economic times.</P>
      <P>This Ministerial Pensions Bill ranks alongside many other legislative initiatives taken by the Progressive Democrats when in Opposition, which have subsequently been passed into law since our accession to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation before us today has a particular importance in so far as it relates to how we in this House organise some of our own affairs.  Looking back on the original debate on this issue in October 1987, what is notable is that the case for such a reform initiative has <Col N="1950" /> actually been strengthened in the intervening period.  When we in the Progressive Democrats introduced our original Bill, we did so against the particular background of falling confidence in politicians and politics generally. Throughout that debate we argued two key points: that politicians must be seen to remove any apparent privileges which set them apart from the public they are supposed to serve, and which also foster public cynicism.  We also argued that politicians had to be able to show that they were prepared to share in the suffering caused by economic hardship and difficult political decisions.  My then Dáil colleague, Anne Colley, summed up our arguments when she stated in this House: &ldquo;Politics is, in a way, on trial &mdash; if Members here want to carry the citizens of this country with them in the measures needed to bring about economic prosperity, we must reform this House to make it more efficient, effective and value-for-money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Today, more than ever, politics here is on trial.  Public cynicism with politicians and the political process has reached new levels in the wake of the revelation of recent business scandals and the parallel perception that a small coterie of people, including politicians, comprise some kind of privileged golden circle that is immune from the everyday constraints of fiscal accountability which the great majority of people must accept.</P>
    <P>Many of these criticisms are totally unjustified.  Certainly the vast majority of people I have met in political life over nearly three decades are straightforward, honest and caring individuals whose primary desire is to help people.  That too, is why the Progressive Democrats are so determined that the various investtigations currently under way relating to business scandals must be rigorously pursued, and that any proven wrongdoing must be effectively punished.  Resolving anomalies in how the Oireachtas remunerates people who have given service to this State as Government Ministers is another example of the issues that must be tackled.  That is the issue, which <Col N="1951" /> this Bill, in compliance with the Programme for Government, now deals with.</P>
    <P>Besides pension anomalies there are many other matters, such as the way we order, or fail to order, our affairs here in this House, that must also be urgently tackled.  As long as politicians fail to conduct their affairs, and judge their own performance, by the criteria they apply to the general public, and the conduct of business outside this House, they will suffer public criticism.  This demands change on many fronts; reforming many antiquated Oireachtas procedures; increasing the transparency of the whole political process so the public can know and understand exactly what is happening; introducing a register of interests of all Oireachtas Members, and generally making Dáil proceedings businesslike, efficient, and relevant to the general public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad, therefore, that the revised Programme for Government, agreed last October, commits the government to tackling all these issues of Dáil procedure, and I believe that when reform measures are brought forward soon, they will result in a more effective and accountable national Parliament.</P>
      <P>I believe that this Bill, which embodies the recommendations of the so-called Gleeson Committee or the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector to give it its correct title, is a fair and balanced set of proposals.  Our original Bill in 1987 sought a total end to the payment of such pensions to serving Deputies, Senators, MEPs, judges and even the President.  In proposing this we recognised the difficulties and even hardship which this might cause to affected individuals.  Ideally we would still favour such a radical move to demonstrate clearly that all of us as politicians are prepared to reform ourselves and to share in the difficulties facing the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> We accept, however, the recommendations made by the Gleeson Committee on this matter.  In the original debate on this issue in 1987 there were many criticisms that the total abolition of ministerial pensions was too severe and would cause unnecessary difficulties for people leaving office and trying to adjust to a new salary level for themselves and their families.  I do not believe that anybody could criticise the proposals before us today on those grounds.  These proposals, in my view, tackle the injustices of the existing system while taking into account the legitimate entitlements and needs of former office holders and public representatives.  The provisions also introduce a greater degree of transparency to the general salaries and benefits of Oireachtas Members other than Ministers, the absence of which until now has been a further inappropriate anomoly.</P>
    <P>This Bill is no magic cure-all to tackle public cynicism or improve the perception of Members of this House. Indeed, if that were our only reason for action it would be wrong.  This Bill is an important step forward.  I hope that it heralds a new openness and honesty among the Members of the Oireachtas and a greater willingness on our behalf to break down the false and unjustifiable privileges which have been built up around this House and which have so damaged public faith in it.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in the debate on this matter four years ago I spoke of my belief that there was no moral justification for continuing payment of Ministers pensions to ex-Ministers who continue to serve as Dáil Deputies at a time when 250,000 people faced permanent unemployment, when thousands of people were forced to emigrate annually and when many people in the public service had lost their jobs.  I asked how could we in this House ask that difficult decisions affecting the ordinary people of this country be taken if we who administer those decisions are not prepared to apply any cutbacks that affect ourselves.  It was for that reason that my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, and myself took the decision <Col N="1953" /> to relinquish the pension to which we were entitled at that time.  It is for that same reason that I commend this revised system to the House today and urge that by its acceptance, we demonstrate our willingness to share in the economic difficulties that face everyone in this country at present.  I wish to share the rest of my time with Deputy Power.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As has been said by a number of speakers already, there is always great public interest in the salaries and allowances of TDs and Ministers. There is a perception throughout the country that TDs are very well paid wealthy individuals, who are in politics for what they can get out of it.  From my short experience in the House the opposite is the truth, some Deputies are struggling and finding it very difficult to exist.  When one looks at a TD's salary in isolation one may consider it good but when one considers the expenses a Deputy has to incur in his day to day work one realises that very little is left out of the monthly cheque.  We have the opportunity today to tell the country what it is like to be a TD but we are in a difficult position in that we have to legislate on our salary and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested previously that we should have a register of Members' interests.  I have no doubt that the public would be surprised to learn of the overdrafts some Deputies have to have. Indeed, I can let them have details of mine anytime.  A number of Deputies had good businesses before they came to the Dáil but when they lost their seat or had to retire, there was very little to go <Col N="1954" /> home to, as the business was gone.  It has been proven time and again that it is an almost impossible task to try to run a business while at the same time carry out the duties of a Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan says we should be treated the same as all other workers. While that sounds fine, when one looks at the statistics one can see that it is not fair to treat Deputies in the same way as all other workers because we have what is possibly the most insecure job one could have.  The election results bear this out. Almost 25 per cent of all Deputies failed to retain their seat at the last general election.  That is a staggering number.  It places people in a very difficult position. I am sure the results of the next election will not be any different, and as the electorate are becoming more volatile, I guess that we will see that a figure greater than 25 per cent will fail to return to this House.  In the early eighties we had three general elections within an 18 month period.  This placed financial hardship on Deputies and I know that some people are still paying for the cost of those elections, even those who were lucky enough to be re-elected.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a good system for rewarding our elected representatives. As someone once said, if you pay peanuts you can expect to get only monkeys.  We do have a Foxe, a Rabbitte and a Stagg in the House but we have no monkeys as of yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the proposed severance allowances for Ministers. When a Minister loses office he will get 75 per cent of his salary for the first six months, reducing to 50 per cent for the following 12 months and to 25 per cent for the following six months.  He will, therefore, be rewarded in some shape or form for up to two years after losing ministerial office.  We all accept that the present ministerial pension scheme is ridiculous. It is unacceptable and indefensible. I am delighted to see that some action has been taken to remedy this, but <Col N="1955" /> personally I think the proposed severance allowances for Ministers cannot be justified.  We are all elected as Members, when one becomes a Minister a car and two drivers are put at one's disposal as well as all sorts of backup facilities.  I appreciate the workload of Ministers and the good work they try to do but the terms of the proposed severance allowances are completely wrong. We should be taking productive measures and not simply measures to please the public &mdash; getting rid of the existing pension scheme and replacing it with these new provisions.  I welcome the fact that pensions will not be payable until a Deputy reaches the age of 55.  The situation up to now was ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Section 11 enables the facilities provided for Members of Dáil Éireann to be extended to cover contributions towards the cost of telephone calls &mdash; arising from their duties as public representatives &mdash; made from their homes or constituency offices.  This has to be welcomed.  It is essential that Deputies living outside the capital have their constituency offices in their constituencies.  As the telephone is used to a large extent to communicate, the telephone bill is a heavy burden and it is a welcome fact that this has finally been recognised.  A great many Deputies will breathe a sigh of relief at that change.</P>
      <P>Again may I appeal to the Minister to have the ministerial severance allowance proposal examined further.  As I have said previously, I think Ministers are well looked after while in office and there is therefore no call for a severance allowance of the magnitude proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>As one of the newer Deputies I have listened to the wisdom <Col N="1956" /> of people who have served a long time in this House.  They can talk from their experience of the harsh realities of political life, however, I will try to give the benefit of my experience of the role of a Deputy and how I see the way the State recompenses a Deputy for his work.  We should explode the myth straightaway that Deputies are rich people.  Many of us &mdash; as Deputy Gay Mitchell said &mdash; are the sole breadwinners in the home and our entire income is dependent on political life.  Some Deputies may be fortunate to have another income but any rural Deputy is aware that not alone does he contribute but that his wife and family contribute by answering the telephone and attending to the needs of constituents. Indeed the life of a rural politician is very different from that of an urban politician, especially in a place like Dublin.  A rural politician must be accessible at all times, it behoves him to be accessible because if he is not, the people will quickly tire of him.</P>
      <P>The demands made on a TD are not only national demands.  There is a belief in the country that when TDs go to Dublin they work at a nice leisurely pace. Indeed, when people watch television and see only a few Members in the Chamber they wonder where the other Deputies are.  Most Deputies are not only preparing speeches to participate in Dáil debates but are also working on behalf of their constituents.  Not many people know that when a Deputy is in Dublin he or she is available from 9.30 a.m. until 11 p.m. or midnight.  When a Deputy returns to his or her rural constituency, he or she is expected to attend a never-ending list of meetings and has to be available and accessible to the public.  We are all proud to be available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read in the papers at times of people professing that we are elected to be statesmen and legislators and we should not have to devote as much time as we do to the needs of our constituents. It is by meeting people at constituency level and debating specific issues, as well as answering personal queries, that we can be more effective in the national Assembly.  Every Deputy is genuinely <Col N="1957" /> involved in looking after the needs of his or her constituents.  Whether we like it or not, the Deputy's role of advising and representing constituents will continue for as long as the present system prevails because many people do not have the means to find out their true rights, they rely on a certain amount of advice.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate this afternoon I was amused at the moral righteousness displayed by the Progressive Democrats. I listened to their able, eloquent spokesman, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, a short time ago.  The Bill serves him extremely well.  The House has had to put up with an amount of sanctimonious humbug from the Progressive Democrats.  It is about time they copped on and realised that they are not deluding the public with such carry-on any more.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan, who is extremely well-off and is hardly dependent on politics for his bread and butter, displayed a great element of begrudgery in his contribution. Again, I considered him to be playing party politics in the attitude he took.  He can possibly afford to do so in that by all accounts he is a very wealthy man.</P>
    <P>This matter has been debated for a long time and the Gleeson report was heralded over the years as one that contained a magic formula aimed at improving the lot of Oireachtas representatives. It is questionable, however, if the Bill improves the lot of Members.  Those who gain will be those within the golden circle of the Oireachtas, the Ministers and Ministers of State, as they will be given severance payments and other allowances.</P>
    <P>In many cases Oireachtas Members make a tremendous sacrifice to get into the House.  It is not that they mind making the sacrifice but many of them are unfortunate enough to lose their seat in the following election and have to seek an alternative career.  It is unfortunate that section 5 does not seriously examine the question of compensation for Members in the way as Ministers and Ministers of State are to be compensated. It is because of a lack of foresight and <Col N="1958" /> knowledge that the issue was not examined. I am sure that those who drafted the legislation were aware that the majority of Members are backbenchers and will remain as backbenchers.  We do not mind being backbenchers and we get on with our business but it is to be regretted that those who prepared the Bill did not see fit to establish a proper system for backbenchers.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to discover that Fianna Fáil Members had extreme reservations about the legislation and set up their own committee to carry out research on this issue.  I share their feelings. It is fine to resubmit the Bill to a review committee for recommendations but I wonder how long it will take for that committee to report.  The Minister is taking the issue no further.  It should have been addressed in the Bill.  The Bill should have been decisive and examined all aspects.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the removal of the special tax concession for Members and makes an alternative recompense in finance.  A newspaper article recently indicated that the media are back to their favourite hobby, saying that TDs are receiving a big rise.  Deputies are not getting a big rise, all that is happening is that we are about to receive recompense for an allowance given in the past.  It is time the media got off our backs.  The media feel we should not look for our proper rights as Oireachtas representatives, yet every other section of the community looks for its rights.  Why should we not look for our rights?  We all know of the great efforts by most Members to serve their constituents. Given the amount of time that went into the preparation of the Bill, it is unfortunate that that feature was not addressed.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Energy said the Bill was fair and equitable and that the Progressive Democrats were delighted with it I am sure he was expressing a personal view.  I doubt if he was expressing the views of all Members.  However, the Bill is a step in the right direction. On behalf of the many Members who <Col N="1959" /> incur great expense in the use of telephones in our constituencies I welcome the enabling measures aimed at remedying that anomaly.  Considering the amount of time that was spent on researching the Bill, it should have been better.  However, I suppose we have to be happy with the effort that was made and welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me to share his time.  My motivation in deciding to speak on the Bill was much the same as that of Deputy Finucane, to explode some of the myths that exist in relation to TDs.  One of my colleagues referred earlier to pub talk, which late at night, views all Deputies as millionaires.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the majority of politicians of all political hues and shades in the House are honourable in the conduct of their affairs.  It is unfair to lump all politicians in the same boat because of the inappropriate and offensive actions of a few.</P>
      <P>I have not read the Gleeson report but I do not consider it to be an inhibiting factor in the debate.  The perspective I should like to bring to the debate is that of a rural Deputy and the financial position of such a Deputy.</P>
      <P>I echo the sentiment expressed by my colleague Deputy Finucane in relation to news media inaccuracy.  Yesterday I read in one of my local evening papers a report that half of a Deputy's salary was tax free &mdash; a completely inaccurate statement.  On occasions I wish I had the workload and the salary of some of those who set themselves up as the guardians and watchdogs of the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will leave me marginally better off due to the telephone allowance.  While waiting for the debate I checked my most recent telephone bill which amounted to more than £200 a month.  That bill was for my home office, and I receive no allowance for that telephone. Although there is no such provision in the Bill, I have heard talk of putting restrictions on the telephone facilities in the House.  Facilities for <Col N="1960" /> Deputies are archaic and until Deputies on all sides stand united and protest about them we cannot expect to progress our case any further.  It is regrettable that some Deputies and some parties are seeking to make political gain out of the Bill.  As a single person, out of a salary of £28,000 I receive approximately £16,000 net.  Out of that one must run a rural constituency, without any mileage allowance for travel and with telephone calls being made at one's own expense. While that salary may appear attractive I can honestly say, with my hand on my heart, I would be better off had I pursued a career in teaching or engaged in farming, both of which options were open to me.  My salary would be smaller but overall I would be better off financially. Many people cannot grasp the difference between one's salary and one's net financial position which is not accurately reflected therein.  Perhaps that is a reality people do not want to face up to.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect is that, at no stage in this House must we create, either by way of legislation or inaction, a cosy club atmosphere which would preclude many people out there, with a lot to offer, from entering politics as a profession because of its attendant rumuneration and conditions.  I think it was Deputy Power who referred to the fact that, in the last general election, a quarter of outgoing Deputies seeking re-election failed to be returned.  That is an indication of the job security attached to membership of this House.  There must be coupled with that insecurity the cost of engaging in elections, of being re-elected which means it is fast acting as a disincentive to very many people with an awful lot to offer coming forward for election.  Indeed, I am annoyed at the context within which this debate is taking place.  Three Independent Senators produced a Bill in the Seanad seeking a Register of Members interests.  There are many other desirable features which could form part and parcel of an overall reform of these Houses which, in terms of public confidence therein, would do <Col N="1961" /> much to restore flagging morale in the democratic system as it obtains.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy referred to that item a few minutes ago.  Yet some weeks ago his party and the Fianna Fáil Party rejected such a proposal in Private Members' time.  Some credence can be given to the level of apathy and cynicism on the part of the public to Members of this House, when we fail to devise a transparent system highlighting the real position of all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I might make another point in relation to the contribution of the Minister for Energy.  It is my understanding that under the provisions of the Bill, as drafted, the Minister for Energy will be in a position to claim the ministerial pension he has foregone in recent years; that when he reaches age 55 &mdash; if he has not reached it already &mdash; he will be in a position to claim that pension in addition to severance pay.  I want to put the Minister for Energy and his colleagues on notice that we on this side of the House will act as guardians of his high moral ground to ensure that he does not sneak in the back-door to claim that pension about which he made so much political noise and capital by virtue of the fact that he has foregone it in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, the Bill before us is an attempt by the Minister to address a perceived scandal.  I use the words &ldquo;perceived scandal&rdquo; deliberately, that of people drawing pensions while remaining Members of the House.  This so-called scandal was highlighted in the mid-eighties by the media in general and people outside the House.  At that time one Member of the House was highlighted on account of his age, the fact that he was receiving a ministerial pension at a very young age while still remaining a Member of the House.  That campaign was targeted to the extent that that individual lost his seat in the following election. Indeed, it is ironic that the loss of that seat at the time underlined the need for some form of compensation for Members of this House who serve as officeholders or Ministers.  That individual &mdash; and I am sure he is not alone <Col N="1962" />&mdash; was Minister one day and unemployed the next day.  As some Deputies have said, there are those who will adopt the high moral ground contending, &ldquo;Well, tough luck.  He is gone; he is out of the political arena&rdquo;.  I do not happen to be of that point of view.</P>
      <P>That person became the victim of a campaign vigorously pursued by people generally outside the House to change a system which was and is totally misunderstood. At that time there was a sustained media attack, fuelled by some people within the political system.  Unfortunately politicians lay very low while that campaign was being engaged in and was most vigorously pursued.  In that respect we can only fault ourselves and pose the question why did politicians adopt that attitude?  Why did they lie low?  Why did they allow themselves be cowed?  I believe it was because there was a mistaken belief on the part of politicians that perhaps the problem would evaporate or that the system obtaining was not defensible.  Perhaps politicians arrived at that conclusion or perhaps it resulted from the generally low esteem in which politicians hold their profession.  Perhaps we do not value sufficiently highly the role of the politician.  Certainly we do not appear to value it sufficiently highly to defend what is defensible and justifiable. Politicians, and certainly in that case, allowed the media and publichouse philosophers to cow them into silence.  Perhaps some politicians felt that the time was ripe, that it was the popular view to put forward this so-called scandal.  We were given an example of the reasoning behind that view by an earlier speaker, when we heard again the high moral ground being adopted.  When the Minister contributed in the House earlier the reason he advanced was that perhaps there was a public demand for such, that we had to address it because of public demand, because the public were scandalised. I contend the public were scandalised because the media misrepresented the position and politicians of various hues went along with the tide at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there was a well orchestrated <Col N="1963" /> demand for a change in the system.  Some politicians and political parties thought it would be very popular to jump on the bandwagon and attempt to implement changes in the system as it had obtained. I make no apology for describing this as a campaign; it was not a debate.  A debate might have provided reasoned arguments from both sides but there was none.  As usual, the campaign engaged in produced a lot more heat than light, when politicians and the body politic in general suffered as a result.  It was easy to go along with the popular view, with the crowd, the parish pump philosophers and so on.  Regrettably, politicians, and one party in particular, did.</P>

      <P>The only scandal involved in the current arrangement of payments to Ministers and to office holders is the fact that they are referred to as pensions.  The misuse of that term has scandalised the public.  They are scandalised that a man who may be only 30 years old can get a pension while still a serving Member of the House.  The <Col N="1964" /> normal perception is that a person should be aged 65 or 66 before getting a pension. When this campaign started it should have been pointed out that these payments should not be regarded as pensions in the normal sense.  It was convenient for some to use this terminology to deride and ridicule politicians and politics generally. Unfortunately, they have had their way.</P>
      <P>The Shanley Committee recognised in 1937 the need for special provisions for holders of ministerial office.  The two basic reasons they put forward hold good today, although Mr. Gleeson does not agree.  The first reason was that a Minister has to cut himself adrift from his profession or occupation while holding ministerial office.  Following a lengthy tenure of office he would have difficulty in returning to that profession.  He would have no assurance for the future if some financial arrangement were not made. That might discourage people from becoming Ministers.  The second basic reason put forward was the desirability of retaining former Ministers in political life, particularly people on the Government side before an election and subsequently on the Opposition front bench. We need to encourage such people to remain in the House and to continue contributing from their skill and experience. I fear the effect of this Bill might be that we will lose some people who have valuable experience.  The reasons outlined by Shanley still hold good.  Payments to office holders meet those concerns but they should probably not be called pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenor of my remarks might appear to indicate that I agree that pensions should be paid to people still serving as Members of the Oireachtas, but that is not what I am saying.  I feel strongly that any man or woman who was a Minister should be paid handsomely for his or her ability and experience and the payment should not be in the form of a pension but in the form of some kind of increment.  It would be a fair way of rewarding former Ministers and encouraging them to retain membership of this House having lost ministerial office.  The Bill addresses the <Col N="1965" /> problem of the pension by providing for payment after the age of 55.  It is a normal part of anybody's life that he or she should be rewarded with a pension.  The point about office holders not being willing to serve in the House after losing ministerial office is not addressed adequately in the Bill.  An attempt is made but the issue could be addressed much more effectively.</P>
    <P>The introduction of some form of incremental payment would be appropriate, not just for Ministers but for Members.  I am aware of the Gleeson Committee's approach to the whole idea of increments and the fact that it was ruled out.  I do not accept that approach. The question of increments is addressed very briefly and specious arguments are put forward as to why it should not be considered.  It is said that there might be objections on constitutional grounds but there is no detailed reference to these constitutional grounds and no reference to who might make the challenge.  It is almost a throwaway remark that we could have a constitutional difficulty if we allowed the payment of increments. Another reason put forward was that there could be grounds other than length of service.  People could argue that service in local government should be considered or that the number of votes in the previous election should be taken into account when deciding increments.  I do not accept that.  A scheme should be introduced whereby increments are awarded purely on the basis of Oireachtas service.  There is no need to entertain arguments about votes or local government service.</P>
    <P>These arguments put forward by Gleeson cannot be substantiated, nor can the argument that the theory behind incremental scales is that the maximum of the scale is the full rate for the job which one moves towards as one gains experience and becomes a better performer. It is said that this does not apply to politicians.  Why not?  I think I am a better politician now than when I entered this House five years ago.  I have gained experience and have possibly more to offer.  I could not accept the argument <Col N="1966" /> that experience gained does not make a difference.  The longer one is here and the more experience is gained the better the Deputy as a public representative. Gleeson mentions that in many cases in the public service increments are based on performance.  That is nonsense.  I come from a teaching background and I have never heard of any teacher being told that he or she would not get an increment because performance was not up to scratch.  It is a ludicrous argument.</P>
    <P>The other argument put forward by Gleeson is that it is not done elsewhere. If the committee would do a survey of facilities available in other parliaments and introduce those facilities here, I would accept that argument but I cannot accept it at present.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason for a TD not being paid an extra amount for each year's experience.  I do not believe I should receive the same level of payment as somebody who has 20 or 30 years experience as a TD.  I would have no objection to people getting increments on that basis.  Neither would I have any objection to giving extra increments to a Minister, including a service increment, for the experience he has attained during his ministerial career.  That would address the problem satisfactorily.  It would also address the two problems identified by Shanley many years ago and which have not been fully addressed in this Bill.  Some Deputies have argued that TDs and Senators should be treated the same as other workers.  I am sure that like me, most Deputies would love if the Unfair Dismissals Act could be applied in our case.  I look forward to the day when this can be done.</P>
    <P>I want to make a number of general points.  Reference has been made to allowances for chairmen of committees. I think the Taoiseach has referred in the House to this issue.  However, it has not been addressed in the Bill.  I should like provision to be made for the payment of allowances to the chairmen of committees by way of enabling legislation or amendment as quickly as possible.  Chairmen &mdash; I think one of them is present in the House &mdash; put a lot of work into the <Col N="1967" /> committees of the House.  By the same token, I also think committees should be given much more power.  The payment of an allowance would not just be of benefit to the chairmen.  It would also be of benefit to the committees and the effective running of this House.  We have rightly agreed to pay allowances to the chairmen of local authorities and we should do the same in regard to the chairmen of the committees of this House.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the criticisms made of TDs.  Much of this criticism emanates from the media.  I am glad to see that one member of the press is present.  TDs are frequently criticised for never being in the Chamber.  Reference is made to this on the back pages of Sunday newspapers and so on.  We have a very big press gallery and TDs should at times refer to the number of journalists sitting in the press gallery.  I know what the journalists who are not in the press gallery are doing and they should be fair enough to point out what TDs are doing when they are not in this Chamber.</P>

In addition, I would be entitled to three months holidays during the summer which I would not be criticised for.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution has, of necessity, also to be brief.  I speak as someone who was a Minister, has been a Member of this House for 15 years and been involved in politics for 22 years. This has meant a disruption of my career at a cost to me.  I say that because when I ceased to be a Minister my salary would have been halved if I had not got an allowance which I regard as a service allowance but which unfortunately is called a pension, something it should never have been called.  I am substantially worse off by a long shot than I was as a Minister.  I make that point not as a special plea for myself but merely to point out the difficulty we will have in attracting into politics top rank people who earn a lot more than Members of this House. Nobody can be expected to give up a job which pays a significantly higher salary than we receive to become a Member of this House and sacrifice the welfare and well-being of their family in so doing. This means that many top people who could give great service to this country, help to ensure that better economic decisions are taken and give the benefit of their additional and better management skills are not attracted into politics.  Not only is the remuneration for TDs much less than most professionals can attract in jobs outside this House but the working hours and conditions here are also much less attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to put up with comments about our long holidays from journalists who know that recesses are not holidays. They are recesses of this Chamber but <Col N="1969" /> they are not holidays.  The letters, phone calls and invitations to meet different groups in our constituencies still flow during our holidays.  Those of us who have Front Bench responsibilities and the chairmen of committees have to carry out research and do their work.  We also have to make visits around the country to keep in touch with events.  Even though I agree that the recesses tend to be on the long side they are not holidays; they are periods for research and preparation.</P>
    <P>When the Dáil is in session we have to sit very long hours.  We also have to attend to our constituency work during this time.  These conditions of employment are known to people outside the House.  My sole purpose in contributing to this debate is not to make a special plea for TDs, Ministers or ex-Ministers, but to point out that it is going to be very difficult to attract top rank people into politics not just because of the pay and conditions but also because of the ill-informed and unbalanced presentation which frequently occurs in the media. This country needs to attract top rank people into Parliament.  It is in that context that we need to look at the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>As we saw recently in the Greencore case, the chief executive of that company was paid £150,000, the going rate in private industry.  That is the level of salary paid to the chief executive of a company whose turnover would be a fraction of the estimate for the smallest Department of State.  I know from my experience as a Minister the difficulty of attracting into the semi-State sector good, top class chief executives for a salary equivalent to that of the Taoiseach's salary.  I have been very disappointed at the attacks made on the payment of allowances to former Ministers provided for in the Bill.  In particular, I disagree with what was said by the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy. The action taken by him and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, only served to fuel the mistaken belief that <Col N="1970" /> there should not be some additional compensation for ministerial and Dáil service. Increments are paid to all those who work in the public service, except Members of the Oireachtas.  Increments were paid to the workers in Guinness, a company for which I worked.  Some of my colleagues in different offices in Guinness got more pay than I did because of their service but I knew that as my service increased and as I gained experience I would get additional emoluments to match my performance.  That is a common feature in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I was a shop steward for the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland, now SIPTU, and in reorganisations or changes very often a person on a particular salary would be moved to a job of lesser responsibility but never on lower pay. That would be standard trade union procedure in any renegotiation.  However, former Ministers are expected not only to live without their car, driver, telephone and newspapers which are rightly provided, they are also expected to live on half pay plus a small service allowance which is now being abolished by this Bill. It is a mistake.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions for Members of parliament completely put off many people who could serve the State and save it perhaps tens of millions of pounds in any one year by bringing their experience to public affairs.  The last speaker said that the Unfair Dismissals Act did not apply to us; nor does the Act apply to office premises.  We have to work in smaller offices than any civil servant would be permitted to work in under law and the same applies to factories.  We have smaller offices for ourselves and our secretaries than any factory or office in this city.  Our terms and conditions of employment repel the sort of people we should be seeking to attract into public life to produce the economic results which would give hope to so many thousands of our unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate on the salaries of TDs or Ministers arouses interest, which is good because we do not have anything to be ashamed of in <Col N="1971" /> debating our situation in public although it would not happen in relation to any other employment.  It is a pity that the debate is confined and that the Bill is being rushed through so quickly as a longer debate would have been more satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to my constituency colleague, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, whose contribution was a political broadcast on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  He claimed that they wrote and delivered the Bill; I thought it was introduced as a result of the Gleeson Committee report. I will give him credit for looking after the Progressive Democrats in the Bill. However, he forgot to add that the Bill is not abolishing pensions for present or past Ministers, it only refers to future Ministers who, I presume, will be on this side of the House.  However, I am a backbencher and I should speak about the effect the Bill will have on people in my position.  If a TD who has served five years &mdash; which is similar to my position &mdash; loses a seat he or she will get three months salary.  Nothing else is provided for in the Bill even though there is a provision for the Minister to re-examine it and he has enabling powers to remove section 5 subject to the Gleeson Committee's agreement.  It is a question of &ldquo;live horse and you'll get grass.&rdquo;  I understand that Fianna Fáil backbenchers criticised that aspect of the Bill and they were promised the matter would be examined. However, I am not too confident in that regard.</P>
      <P>Before I came into this House about two and a half years ago I was a livestock auctioneer and had my own business.  I worked in five livestock marts and I spent 25 years in the business.  When I was elected to the Dáil some of the people in the marts gave me little presents, a bicycle lamp in one case and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did.  I also received a portable television from Gort mart. <Col N="1972" /> Naturally, as soon as I took up duty here, the marts employed someone in my place and of course I did not receive any redundancy payment.  If I lost my seat in the next election my job would not be there. It took me ten years to build up my business.  When I started my wages were £9.10.9d.  I remember it well.  I gave my landlady £4 per week.  Naturally, as time went on, my income rose to a level similar to that which I now enjoy.</P>
      <P>I could lose my seat for many reasons, perhaps more of County Galway would be included in County Mayo for electoral purposes, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon, or an independent commission might carve up constituencies.  I could lose my seat for all sorts of reasons and I would be out of a job.  I spent ten years trying to get into the Dáil and I am not sorry to be here.  I stood in 13 elections in my 17 years political career; I won eight elections and lost five.  The five I lost were in relation to Oireachtas elections.  The road to the Dáil was hard and, as I said, I am not sorry to be here but I should like the Minister and the Gleeson Committee to know the position in relation to backbenchers. I am sorry I cannot contribute further as I am sharing my time with Deputy Farrelly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a couple of points in the short time at my disposal.  In 1961 my late father was elected to this House at a salary of £1,000. He had to buy a fairly good car because he had to do a lot more driving; the new car cost £350.  Today our salary is in the region of £28,000 but even quite a modest car costs about £15,000, half the annual salary.  That puts into perspective the way we have looked after ourselves.  We never seem to stand up and be counted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill only go part of the way in dealing with the problems.  Is there anybody in any Department of State with ten, 20 or 30 years service who is receiving the same salary as the person starting tomorrow will receive?  This is the only institution of State where regardless of years of service we receive the same salary as the person who may be <Col N="1973" /> elected after the next election.  I do not believe we are doing ourselves any real service in the proposals we are being asked to pass today.  I am surprised that Gleeson did not accept a proposal to introduce increments into the system for Members.  I wonder whether Mr. Gleeson would accept the same salary today as he received ten years ago?  I am sure he would not.  I would like to think this is only the beginning of trying to do something positive to bring ourselves into line and to protect our wives and families in the event of anything happening to us and especially those who depend solely on this job and on the electorate.</P>
    <P>As Members of this House I propose &mdash; and the Minister should take it on board &mdash; that we consider, through the Committee on Procedure and Priviliges, the appointment of a public relations officer on behalf of the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What have we to hide?  The publicity we receive is of the worst type because nobody looks behind the scenes of this Chamber to what work Members of this House have to do not alone in this House but in their constituencies. As a member of the Front Bench for the past nine or ten months I have been visiting different constituencies throughout the country collecting further information and trying to bring forward proposals for different policy changes.  The appointment I propose would go a long way towards solving some of the problems we encounter every time we speak about ourselves and the allowances we receive.</P>
    <P>We have no allowance for telephone expenses.  We are the only organisation in the State who use telephones in our constituencies to provide a service and where that expense will not be allowed against income tax.  Many years ago when I became a Member of this House I asked that that allowance be provided but it was not provided.  This Bill provides for an allowance and I hope it will be a realistic one.  The monthly cost of running a telephone in a constituency is somewhere in the region of £350.  The bill I receive on a two-monthly basis is practically the same every two months. <Col N="1974" /> I wonder whether that is the case with everybody else.</P>
    <P>An allowance should be agreed forthwith for the chairmen of committees of this House.  Further committees are required to reform this House and to make it workable in order that people would not be complaining about the perceived long holidays &mdash; which we do not have in real terms.  The committees could work throughout the summer and at other times when we have holidays. Deputy Gay Mitchell is one of those chairmen who does an excellent job on behalf of the taxpayers.  He is an example of the type of person who should be involved in committees to give us an opportunity to get more experience.  He said earlier today that every person who comes before him receives a salary far in excess of that received by any Member of this House.  It is our own fault that we are in this position in 1991.  I would ask that favourable consideration be given to the appointment of a public relations officer so that the general public and the members of the press who are not always here when certain debates are taking place would be informed of the type of work we do as public representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what we say in this House today, the media will hammer us.  Most times the political correspondents adopt a reasonable attitude towards us but occasionally the small journalist, who tries to be the big guy, writes snide remarks about us.  Regardless of what we say here today, we are all here because we enjoy what we do.  I hope to be here for a few years more but I would be here in any case even if I was not paid a penny.  Many of us have a vocation and we are committed to what we do because it has all to do with helping people.  Having said that, we are penalised because we have this sense of idealism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the cynical attitude of some of the civil servants who drafted this Bill, and I refer in particular to the three months severence pay whereby you get your pension three months after you have got your severence <Col N="1975" /> pay.  Perhaps the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong but there was no mention of a three month tax-free lump sum.  Many public servants begrudge advising Ministers on what TDs receive.  It is about time these gentlemen knew that we in this House have a certain say in some of the things which would be of interest to them, and perhaps we will begin to consider this.  It is about time they ceased to keep down our salaries.  I am sick and tired of the mealymouthed attitude.  I understand we are supposed to be paid at the same rate as a higher executive officer in the Civil Service. Those higher executive officers do not normally work 60 or 70 hours a week; if so, they get overtime, whereas we do not. We do what we do because we enjoy it but we are penalised.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that chairmen of this House should receive an extra allowance, and I agree with that.  One of the finest chairmen of any committee of this House is Deputy Gay Mitchell.  He is an Opposition Deputy and a member of my constituency.  Why should he and his family be penalised as mine have been over the years, because they are idealistic, because they work hard and because they have something to offer?  Why are people like him and others not encouraged to enter public life?  When these people enter into public life they take a vow of poverty.  I am sure that will evoke a big horse laugh among some sectors, but it is interesting to note that former trade union officials who became politicians have told me they were far better off as trade union officials &mdash; I am not talking about senior trade union officials but those at the lower level.</P>
    <P>I will be in this House 27 years next April and I receive the same salary as the person who is elected now.  There is no such thing as incremental increases and that is bad.  I would have expected to receive the same treatment as a member of the Garda Síochána who gets one months's salary per year up to a maximum of 18 years service.  That is what we should be asking for when the Minister begins to regulate the provisions <Col N="1976" /> and I make no apology for it.  The people of Ireland are not begrudgers; there are individuals who are begrudgers and they will always be reported in the newspapers, and a few of the very highly paid presenters on radio and television progammes are also begrudgers.</P>

Since entering political life and meeting Members from all sides of the House, I have found a commitment and idealism which has nothing to do with money.  I say to anybody contemplating entering political life that there is no gold at the end, at the beginning or in the middle of the political rainbow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said that TDs had <Col N="1977" /> fared badly under Gleeson, compared with judges and higher civil servants. Members of the House should not and cannot be allowed to determine their own pay and conditions, not because they would not do it fairly, but because the appropriate approach is to refer these matters to an independent body for adjudication.  This has been accepted as the correct procedure for many years. To do otherwise would leave us open to being accused of being judges in our own cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>It is not possible for Members of the House to determine what their remuneration should be.  In order that we be seen to be fair an independent body should make that decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell also suggested that Mr. Gleeson simply converted the old tax deduction, frozen since 1983, to a cash sum.  The review body made their finding on expenses based on factual information given by Members.  Deputies may have been disappointed at the outcome but the methodology as outlined by the review body appears, on the face of it, to be correct.  In any event, expenses are being reviewed again and that should be noted by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Dempsey and Mitchell said that there should be incremental increases and that the longer serving Deputies should be paid more.  I do not agree.  Under the Constitution all Deputies entering the House are equal. Deputies are not in a private company, they are elected to do a public job.  In many cases the electorate, in removing one Deputy to elect another, far from expecting the new Deputy to be worse believe, more often than not, that the new Deputy will, if anything, do the job better.  In those circumstances one could not make the argument that longevity should mean an increase in salary. Incremental scales for Deputies was considered by the review body in detail in report No. 30 but they recommended against the principle.  If one accepts the <Col N="1978" /> concept of independent adjudication one must accept the final outcome even if we do not agree with all of the arguments put forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin was very concerned about the severance arrangements for TDs and Senators as indeed were other Deputies.  While the three months mentioned by Deputies formed part of the original proposals, it will be the basis of an amendment from the Government side tonight in order that the matter can be subjected to a special comprehensive examination by the review body.  I do not accept that a three months severance period for TDs is adequate in the peculiar circumstances in which a Deputy might find himself or herself on leaving office.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan wished to know the cost of the proposed measure.  It is not possible to make an accurate assessment of pension costs and savings because there are so many imponderable factors involved, including options to be exercised by individuals.  It would not be appropriate to make what I can only describe as a guesstimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which could turn out to be totally inaccurate.  Deputy McCartan would be the first to come into the House and say that I was totally inaccurate, if I were to simply produce a pension figure.  I cannot do that.  When Deputy McCartan says people are cynical he might do well to remember that when people are cynical that cynicism has sometimes been given birth to by the attitude of TDs.  That is worth saying.</P>
      <P>Deputies McCreevy and Finucane were concerned about the three months severance period.  This will be thoroughly examined by the review body.  Some Deputies suggested that we would never see the report in the House.  I assure the House that we will, I hope within three or four months.  Rather than it having to be debated in the House again, a regulation should be placed before the House in order to adopt whatever measure is proposed and agreed.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Brien suggested changes in the pension scheme for TDs but this Bill does not address that question.  This Bill was intended to address Ministers' pensions.  The examination of TDs' pensions is a separate matter and is not part of the proposals in the Bill.  The Bill does not affect TDs' pensions and only concerns telephone allowances, severance and the special allowance for TDs.  Deputy O'Brien and others, jocosely referred to Mr. Gleeson and attacked him.  It is unfair to make personal attacks, even jocosely, on Mr. Gleeson who is not in a position to answer back.  In relation to any attacks on Mr. Gleeson I must say that the Government have on several occasions expressed their gratitude to him for his public service.</P>

      <P>We have to be fair to him.  Deputy Dempsey spoke about public ignorance and myths with regard to ministerial pensions.  Indeed, there are myths about the size of ministerial pensions, and about Ministers' and TDs' salaries. It is important to note that the independent review body in report No. 31 did a good job in explaining the historical background and in dispelling many of the myths and misinformation. I hope that is noted by the media in order that any misconceptions in relation to remuneration, allowances or expenses will be cleared up once and for all.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Taoiseach to provide full and candid information in relation to the purchase of Carysfort College by UCD, a transaction which secured a <Col N="1980" /> profit of £1.5 million for a private individual at the expense of the taxpayer; in particular, Dáil Éireann condemns the Taoiseach for:</P>
    <P>failing to ensure an &ldquo;arm's length&rdquo; and independent position in relation to his part in the transaction, particularly having regard to his relationship with the vendor;</P>
    <P>holding secret meetings with key persons involved in the transactions;</P>
    <P>failing to ensure that the transaction was accompanied by proper independent valuations;</P>
    <P>failing to follow proper procedures in relation to the provisions of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971;</P>
    <P>failing to ensure that proper Cabinet procedures were followed in respect of the transaction;</P>
    <P>failing to ensure that the reservations of the Department of Finance were properly addressed in Cabinet;</P>
    <P>agreeing in an <i>ultra vires</i> manner to an on-going commitment of public funds to the detriment of students attending colleges in the HEA sector;</P>
    <P>demands that the Taoiseach clarify the contradictions inherent in his position, and finally make a frank statement on his role and influence in the transaction.</P>
    <P>I should say at this stage that we accept the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <P>This motion will be voted on tomorrow night.  Tomorrow, ironically, is the first anniversary of the Supplementary Estimate which enabled UCD to hand Mr. Pino Harris a large profit on Carysfort just a few months after he had bought it. In that debate a year ago the Minister for Education misled the Dáil.  Throughout the year which has ensued that deception has continued.  In the face of emerging facts day after day the Government, and <Col N="1981" /> especially the Taoiseach, have relied on tortured semantics to deny any involvement in that infamous and improper transaction.</P>
    <P>In Waterford last Friday night the Taoiseach expressed a sensitivity to criticism for taking short-cuts.  Again last night, this time in Galway, he referred to a campaign of vilification being waged against him.  Let me say this about those two remarks of the Taoiseach: first, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with short-cuts provided they are legal, open and above board.  The end, however, never justifies the means.  This is the kernel of the Carysfort scandal.  Second, if the Taoiseach really believes that he is going to deflect the Opposition from doing their necessary work of challenging and probing, of refusing to be deflected from legitimate criticism, of demanding answers to questions by his personalised abuse he has another think coming.  We will continue to demand answers until we get them.  We will continue to lay political charges where and when appropriate.  We will continue to accuse until we are satisfied that the elected Government of the State are accountable and responsible for their actions.</P>
    <P>The people are entitled to and have demanded an absolute assurance that things will be done in the proper manner in Ireland.  If a speculator makes a profit &mdash; there is nothing wrong with that &mdash; it must be a profit made because he took a business risk and not because he had the right connections to guarantee him that everything would be all right.</P>
    <P>Right across the House there was and is unanimity on the desirability of a worthwhile educational use for Carysfort College.  There will be many who will question whether or not the investment made in Carysfort is of real worth, especially in the face of all the priorities which face us in terms of educational needs but in common with everyone else I welcome as I welcomed last December the decision to keep Carysfort alive.  I do not welcome and I was alone in the House last December in refusing to welcome the scandalous way in which it was done. Here I must part company with a senior <Col N="1982" /> trade union official who, in a discussion on radio last Saturday, said there was no scandal in Carysfort.  He was fundamentally and totally wrong.  Not only was the manner of the acquisition scandalous but it was the most serious of all the scandals we have had to deal with so far because of the direct links between the commercial transaction and politics at the highest level.</P>
    <P>As will become clear later in this speech I am satisfied that, to the best of my knowledge, on 11 October last Mr. Laurence Crowley, who was detailed to undertake negotiations on behalf of UCD, or someone acting on his behalf, made a firm offer to Mr. Harris's estate agent of £7 million to buy Carysfort for the Graduate Business School.  This was the day after the first of Mr. Crowley's secret meetings with the Taoiseach on the matter.  The offer was rejected.</P>
    <P>The principle of whether or not Carysfort should be kept in education is not the issue that we are here tonight to debate.  The issue is whether or not the Taoiseach is in serious dereliction of the trust placed in him by the electorate as the prime custodian of the public purse and if he contrived and assisted in a transaction which resulted in a very considerable financial killing for someone whom he described in the House last week as not being a political friend of his.</P>
    <P>On this issue the traditions of the House say that we must accept his word. If the Taoiseach is prepared to tell the House that he does not know Mr. Pino Harris the traditions of this House say that we must accept his word.  If the Taoiseach is prepared to tell the House that Mr. Harris never supplied trucks for Fianna Fáil election campaigns then, again, the traditions of this House say that we must accept his word.  If the Taoiseach is prepared to tell the House that Mr. Harris never participated in the organisation of Fianna Fáil election campaigns then the traditions of this House say that we must accept his word.  If the Taoiseach is prepared to tell the House that Mr. Harris never contributed, financially or otherwise, to the Fianna Fáil Party either at national level, local level <Col N="1983" /> or directly to individuals then the traditions of this House say that we must accept his word.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Taoiseach to do this, to tell the House in absolutely unequivocal terms whether he knows Mr. Pino Harris, whether Mr. Harris supplied trucks for Fianna Fáil election campaigns, whether Mr. Harris ever participated in the organisation of Fianna Fáil election campaigns and whether he ever contributed, financially or otherwise, to Fianna Fáil either at national level, local level or directly to individuals.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach's answer to all these questions is no then, as I have said, the traditions of this House say that we must accept his word.  If the answer is yes to any or all of these questions the Taoiseach has a heavy duty and responsibility to this House to make a full and frank statement in that regard.  If he chooses not to do this then we in this House must draw our own conclusions but, more importantly, the electorate who have all but lost faith in the political-business system must also draw their own conclusions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's involvement in the transaction is one of the fundamental elements.  All of the rules of Government, written and unwritten, say clearly that his obligation in respect of any transaction in which he has an interest, however remote, is to maintain an arm's length position.  The degree to which he broke those rules must be clear.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from the UCD governing body minutes of 19 December 1990, the day after the Supplementary Estimate of £9.7 million was approved by the Dáil and before the Taoiseach's telephone call to Dr. Masterson on 21 December.  The President of UCD told the governing body:</P>
    <P>When the Carysfort property became available its purchase as a site for the Graduate School of Business and other post graduate activities was considered but found to be beyond the resources of the College.  Discussions ensued with the Minister for Education <Col N="1984" /> and the Taoiseach who were keen to promote the College's Plans for Graduate Business Studies and to retain the Carysfort property in the Higher Education Sector particularly in view of the increasing demand for higher education.  The result of the discussions was that the College is now enabled to purchase the Carysfort property and has some resources to adapt and equip it.</P>
    <P>Significantly, the minutes made no reference to the State subvention towards the running costs but they state that the president's updating statement was welcomed by the governing body and he was authorised to complete the negotiation as outlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education stated on 28 September last that she was unaware that truck dealer, Pino Harris, was the man who sold Carysfort College to UCD last December.  She said:</P>
    <P>Who the vendor was or was not was not of any interest to me.  UCD were coming to me with a proposal which they were doing through the Estate Agent.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind that Mr. Harris's estate agent, Mr. Fintan Gunne, wrote to the chairman of the Smurfit business school, Mr. Laurence Crowley, on 12 July 1990 in relation to the possible sale of Carysfort and the fact that the Taoiseach had two separate secret meetings with Mr. Crowley on 11 October and 3 December 1990 in relation to the proposed purchase of Carysfort College, is it reasonable to assume that the Taoiseach was unaware of the identity of the vendor or if, indeed, he did not know the identity of the vendor even prior to the approach in July by Mr. Harris's estate agent?  Let us not forget that by the Taoiseach's own assertion, Mr. Harris is not his political friend.  Perhaps he was told the name of the vendor but it meant nothing to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to a Dáil question which I <Col N="1985" /> put down on 12 February 1991, the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, stated:</P>
    <P>Any decision to purchase Carysfort and the allocation of funds for the purpose are matters solely for Government. Naturally, I kept the Government fully informed of developments regarding Carysfort at all stages leading eventually to the decision to provide funds to UCD towards the purchase of Carysfort.</P>
    <P>What a pity the Taoiseach did not choose to follow the same course.  Not alone did he not inform the Government of the meetings he had with the chairman of the Smurfit business school, by her own admission, he did not inform the Minister for Education.  Were his actions a vote of no confidence in Deputy O'Rourke's ability or is there a more sinister explanation?</P>
    <P>Another matter which is far from clear is when exactly the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education became aware of the telephone call to Dr. Masterson on 21 December 1990 and of the pledge the Taoiseach made to provide an annual subvention of about £1 million for the running costs of the Smurfit business school.  The Taoiseach said that he was not involved in the transaction, which presumably means he was not directly involved in the negotiation of the sale price.  In response to that it must be said that although the conductor does not play in the orchestra he certainly directs the music.  Indeed, the Taoiseach, as conductor of the Carysfort transaction, concealed the fact from the various units of the Orchestra that he was separately conducting the others.</P>
    <P>One question that should not be lost sight of is when exactly did this Carysfort season start and when were the various players encouraged or manoeuvred into place?  For instance, did it start in the spring or early summer of 1990 and was the first player the eventual vendor? Were there other players at that time who departed the scene during the summer? There are many elements which need to be clarified if this House and the people <Col N="1986" /> are to know that which they have a right to know; what really happened?</P>
    <P>In October 1989 Davmac Developments bought the college and 90 acres from the Sisters of Mercy for approximately £19 million.  This deal was to be concluded by October 1990, 12 months later.  In February 1990 Davmac announced that the building and 20 acres were for sale.  It has been reported that a professional valuation at this stage put the value of the property at about £3 million.  The property was offered to the Department of Education by Davmac on 28 February 1990 for £8.25 million but the Department were not interested.  It was not until May 1990 that Mr. Harris emerged as the new owner, and reports suggest that he acquired the property for £6.5 million.  That seems an extremely high price bearing in mind the apparent lack of interest in it and Mr. Harris's renowned ability as a brilliant dealer.</P>
    <P>It would appear, on the basis of some reports, that Mr. Harris concluded the purchase with Davmac on 26 July 1990. However, it has also been reported that the sale was concluded with the Sisters of Mercy and not with Davmac.  We know that on the next day, 27 July 1990, the Sisters of Mercy paid £1.75 million on foot of an agreed settlement covering past State investment in the buildings. If the deal was concluded between Mr. Harris and the Sisters of Mercy this raises a series of important questions.  Who were Davmac?  Did they ever pay more than a deposit?  Was the contract they entered into with the nuns ever honoured? Did Davmac agree voluntarily or for some inducement to stand aside from the contract?  Was it true, as has been alleged by some sources, that the Sisters were under pressure to raise money because of the financial position of the Mater Hospital, including the loss making Mater Private?</P>
    <P>In September this year the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, said that she understood that Carysfort had been sold for £8 million in May 1990 and was sold at a loss to Mr. Harris for £6.5 million shortly afterwards.  If this is true it raises further serious question, not the <Col N="1987" /> least of which is the tax status of the whole series of transactions, bearing in mind the profits and losses involved in such figures.  In any event it has now emerged that the maximum price paid by Mr. Harris was £6.25 million.  Clearly the events that occurred in the period immediately prior to the purchase in the mysterious month of May 1990 raise unanswered questions which are beyond the direct jurisdiction of the Oireachtas but which must still be answered.</P>
    <P>There was speculation that Mr. Harris was involved in negotiations with an education interest who believed that Carysfort could be turned into a multipurpose educational institution.  The alleged intention was that leases would be given to organisations to run language courses, management training and third level courses for Irish and overseas students and for other activities.  The facilities such as library, restaurant and other facilities would be shared. However, there is little if any evidence that Mr. Harris ever intended embarking on such an adventure.  Information available to me suggests that a written proposal regarding a private third level institution was sent to Gunnes, estate agents for Mr. Harris, after he had signed the contract to buy the property.  Notwithstanding this proposal, Mr. Harris had the property back on the open market by early July, more than a fortnight before he completed buying it and well in advance of the totally unexpected Gulf crisis which dramatically changed the economic outlook for the worse.  The question must be asked: what was the real strategy of the brilliant dealer from Phibsboro' who is not a political friend of the Taoiseach?</P>
    <P>The President of UCD in his statement of 8 October 1991 made the following observations in relation to the UCD Graduate Business School:</P>
    <P>By April-May 1990, as detailed costings emerged, it became clear that the cost of the proposed new building was going to be a serious problem. Measures were being considered to try <Col N="1988" /> to make substantial cuts to the plan to stay within the £5 million budget.  In the scaled down version many key facilities envisaged in the schools development plans could not be provided.</P>
    <P>However, the minutes of the building committee of UCD of Tuesday, 19 June 1990 state in relation to the Graduate Business School:</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan reported that design work is in progress.  Construction is expected to commence in February 1991 with completion scheduled for September 1992.  Accommodation for the MBS, DBS and CEEPA courses is being prepared for occupation in September 1990.</P>
    <P>On 26 June the report and recommendation of the building committee were approved by the governing body. There is no reference in the governing body or building committee documentation prior to the summer break that the cost over-run was in any way considered a reason for relocating the school and the buildings committee did not meet again until 16 October and the governing body did not meet again until a week later on 23 October.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, stated in answer to parliamentary questions on 3 December 1991 that.</P>
    <P>As the President of UCD noted in his recent statement, the situation changed in 1990 when problems arose regarding the development of the business school in the Roebuck Castle site. The possibility thus presented itself for the first time that the Government's policy on expanding third level places and UCD's development plans for its business schools could coincide.</P>
    <P>On 6 March 1990, the building committee of UCD were informed by the President that the architect's sketch plans for the new buildings had been approved by the project planning group and the major sponsor.  He said the requirements of the brief, including the executive education <Col N="1989" /> centre, can be met within the turnkey budget of £5,000,000.  The bursar informed the 13 March meeting of the governing body of UCD that:</P>
    <P>The borrowing element of £2 million would be a charge on the school and, hopefully, would be reduced through fund-raising efforts by the school. Every financial possibility would be examined.</P>
    <P>It appears that neither the building committee nor the governing body met in April.</P>
    <P>We are back again to the mysterious month of May.  At the building committee meeting on 8 May it was reported:</P>
    <P>Progress is being made with the design work.  Cost of implementing the overall plan on the basis of the brief is estimated at £7,100,000.  It is intended, as a first stage, to build as much as possible of the accommodation in the brief without exceeding the £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>The question arises: how widely was it known that there was a cost over-run and how long before 8 May was that information in circulation.  It was surely known by the project planning group and by the major sponsor.  Was it known to the Department of Education, the Taoiseach and Mr. Pino Harris?</P>
    <P>The Department of Education had received an offer for sale on behalf of the new owners &mdash; Davmac &mdash; on 28 February 1990 of the Carysfort premises and 20 acres of land for £8.25 million and, indeed, the matter of Carysfort College was the subject of an Adjournment Debate on 17 May 1990.  The Government were well aware that the college was on the market and, indeed, a detailed study was made by officers of the Department of Education.  Obviously, the Minister for Education had no knowledge of Mr. Harris's interest or involvement in the Carysfort College purchase in May 1990.  I challenge the Taoiseach in this House to state if the situation was the same in his case.</P>
    <P>In early July, Mr. Harris was certainly trying to dispose of Carysfort College and <Col N="1990" /> 20 acres.  Mr. Harris's estate agent wrote to Mr. Laurence Crowley, executive chairman of the Smurfit Business School on 12 July 1991, with regard to a possible purchase of Carysfort College.  Things started to happen from there.  The first visit to Carysfort by the UCD building officer and the Dean of Commerce and representatives of the academic staff took place in late July.  They were impressed with the property.  The entire Faculty of Commerce visited Carysfort College on 1 August.  It appears that the faculty as a whole wished to retain an integrated undergraduate facility on the campus at Belfield.  Therefore, the only possible element of the faculty that could be moved was the graduate business school, as a stand-alone entity.</P>
    <P>Early in September, the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, contacted UCD by telephone to discuss Carysfort, resulting in a meeting between the Minister for Education and the acting president of the college, Professor John Kelly, on 11 September.  It has yet to be established what exactly gave rise to that approach at that time.</P>
    <P>There was a special meeting of the Commerce Faculty on 16 September 1990 with the President and, again, the view emerged that if Carysfort was acquired, only the graduate business school should move there and not the whole faculty.</P>
    <P>On 26 September, there was a meeting between the Minister, the UCD Registrar, the college secretary, the Dean of the Commerce Faculty and Mr. Laurence Crowley, executive chairman of the business school.</P>
    <P>On 3 October, there was a further meeting between the Minister for Education, the registrar and Professor John Kelly.  The following day, 4 October, the college approached B.P. Gunne Limited, estate agents, of Ballsbridge, indicating an interest in purchasing the college.  Mr. Laurence Crowley, executive chairman of the Smurfit Business School, was detailed to undertake negotiations on behalf of UCD.  The Taoiseach had the first secret meeting with Mr. Laurence Crowley on 11 October and the following day the college made an offer to the value <Col N="1991" /> of £7 million.  The offer was rejected and there was no contact between the college and the estate agent for about six weeks.</P>
    <P>On 16 October, the possibility of UCD buying Carysfort on the Government's suggestion was put to the buildings committee for the first time.  This was reported to the Governing Body on 23 October and approval was given for the continuation of discussions.</P>
    <P>On 25 November Mr. Crowley met Mr. Gunne and a purchase price of £8 million was agreed, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education. Very serious questions must be asked about the rigours of the college's negotiations in relation to agreeing the price of £8 million.  There was no independent professional valuation and, whereas the &ldquo;competent college experts&rdquo; found that if the same area as Carysfort were to be provided on campus, it would cost in excess of £20 million.  This does not take market forces into consideration.  Carysfort College is restricted to an educational use and there was no other known prospective buyer.  The fact that the agreed price in November, when the property market was in decline, was £1.5 million dearer than the July pice, demonstrates very weak powers of negotiation on the part of the college.  The question must also be asked, was Mr. Harris advised to hold out for £8 million and that the State would pay?  If he had been so advised, who had advised him?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education met with the registrar, the Secretary and the Dean of the commerce faculty on 27 November and a formal written proposal was made by the secretary of UCD on 29 November 1990 to the Minister.</P>
    <P>On 3 December the Taoiseach had his second secret meeting with Mr. Crowley. A Cabinet decision was made the following day, 4 December, and the Department of Finance were consulted for the first time on that day.  The Taoiseach used a divide and conquer strategy to iron out the various disharmony which arose along the way, so that the whole orchestra played in unison, if not altogether <Col N="1992" /> happily, on the night &mdash; or should I say on the day?</P>
    <P>There is one Member of the House who has a very vital role to play in terms of full and frank disclosure in relation to the whole sad episode and that is the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  He owes it to the House, to democracy and to his country to make available all information and documentation in his possession.  If he feels bound by Cabinet confidentiality he should make the information available to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The deafening silence until very recent days of the Progressive Democrats in relation to the Carysfort College scandal is to be condemned.  They have been sitting on their hands, while the Taoiseach has been repairing the mould that they promised to break in 1986.</P>
    <P>It is particularly regrettable, and it tells a great deal about this Government, that a Progressive Democrat spokesman, who is not even a Member of this House let alone a member of the Cabinet, could announce last Saturday week on the national airwaves that there was no Cabinet memorandum in relation to this transaction. So much for Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
    <P>But what, at the end of the day, was the price of this transaction orchestrated by the Taoiseach?  UCD were manipulated, the Smurfit Business School were manipulated, the Department of Education were manipulated, the Department of Finance were overruled, the Higher Education Authority were illegally sidelined and a totally <i>ultra vires</i> commitment was given by the Taoiseach to the President of UCD.</P>
    <P>Ironically, in the Estimates published this afternoon, enough money has been provided to enable ongoing funding for Carysfort, despite the reservations of the Progressive Democrats.  This funding is being paid for through the use of a range of cheeseparing cutbacks in other vulnerable areas throughout the Education Estimate.  For example, child care assistance in national schools for the handicapped will be cut while youth services and sporting organisations will help to <Col N="1993" /> pay the bill for Carysfort as well.  But, finally, it was the taxpayer who paid to the tune of £9.7 million, and one individual was enriched at the taxpayers' expense.</P>
    <P>In October the president of UCD denied that his decision was based on pressure.  I hesitate to quote the dictionary to the president of a university, but the dictionary definition of pressure is &ldquo;a compelling influence or force.&rdquo; In our political system, the Government, as paymaster, are an extremely compelling influence or force.  To quote a member of Dr. Masterson's own staff: &ldquo;You might blame Haughey for giving it to us &mdash; but you can not blame us for taking it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do more than blame the Taoiseach, we condemn the Taoiseach.  We believe he stands condemned for all his actions in relation to Carysfort.  We demand a full and frank disclosure to this House.  It would be the first we ever got since this controversy began.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I want to say a word about the Government amendment &mdash; or perhaps it would be more accurate to describe it as the Pat Cox amendment. It is clearly, and unequivocally, a copout; a device aimed at helping the Progressive Democrats to win yet another struggle with their collective consciences.</P>
    <P>Will Mr. Harris give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts?  Will the Taoiseach, or the Minister for Education or Mr. Crowley give evidence to that committee?  Will the committee be in a position to untangle the chain of transactions involved and identify the different selling and purchase prices?  Can they summon the Revenue Commissioners to find out the tax paid on profits?  Will they ever be able to identify the ultimate beneficiary or beneficiaries?  Unless they can do all these things &mdash; and the Progressive Democrats know they cannot &mdash; the report of the committee will ultimately be of limited value.  The leader of the Progressive Democrats has spent the past couple of days defending the rights of inspectors appointed by him to investigate other scandals and demanding results from those inspectors.  Why is he content with this hollow and meaningless <Col N="1994" /> amendment?  Why is he not insisting on a similar style of examination of Carysfort as he is supervising in relation to Telecom and Greencore?  We all know the answer &mdash; the Progressive Democrats do not want the truth in relation to Carysfort, because they are afraid of the truth and where it will lead.</P>
    <P>I recently recalled in this House the one-man show with which the late Micheál MacLiammoir toured the country some years ago called &ldquo;I should be talking to my friends&rdquo;.  I suggested then that if and when the Taoiseach ever retires that he could take a similar show on tour.  The title I suggested for him was &ldquo;I must be doing favours for my friends&rdquo;. I would now like to suggest a small amendment to the title: &ldquo;I must be doing favours for my non-friends&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that the acquisition by UCD of the Carysfort College premises and 20 acres for development as its Graduate School of Business has the following advantages:</P>
      <P>&mdash;  the development of such a business school is essential for educational purposes and the efficient management of Irish business in the future,</P>
      <P>&mdash;  the development at Carysfort will provide places for 600-900 graduate students and will release accommodation at Belfield,</P>
      <P>&mdash;  the decision by UCD represents a welcome response to the widespread concern, that Carysfort and its lands should continue to be used for educational purposes;</P>
      <P>decides that further consideration of this matter by Dáil Éireann must await the outcome of the examination being made by the Committee of Public Accounts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1995" /> I have been interested in Carysfort as an educational institution since 1986.</P>
    <P>In that year the Fine Gael-Labour Government decided abruptly to close it down as a teacher training college without consultation or notice.</P>
    <P>Since that time, I and Fianna Fáil have maintained our interest in ensuring that the valuable and important, specially designed, buildings at Carysfort would be retained for educational purposes, particularly as £2.5 million of State funds had been expended in developing the educational facilities there.</P>
    <P>A memorandum on Carysfort was first brought to Government by the former Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, in July 1987.  While primarily concerned with the position of the former staff of Carysfort, a matter which was decided in the context of the 1988 budget, the Minister stated that &ldquo;the intent of her memorandum is to secure, if possible, the use to the State of the premises and facilities of the college for the purpose of providing for the growing demand for places in third level education&rdquo;, especially in the light of the serious constraints on capital resources which had led to the cancellation of a number of projects in the third level building programme.  The Minister also drew attention to the report of the working party presided over by the chairman of the Higher Education Authority, set up by the previous Government, which reported on 26 February 1987.  The principal thrust of their report was towards the continued use of the Carysfort premises and facilities for the operation of appropriate courses under the aegis of University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>In July 1988 a second memorandum on Carysfort was brought to Government by the former Minister for Education, who wanted to draw the Government's attention to a proposal by the City of Dublin vocational education committee for the use of Carysfort as a national college of music and drama.  The Government, however, decided that the Minister should make a further submission to the Government concerning the property and should bring forward wider and more comprehensive <Col N="1996" /> proposals, including use for UCD purposes. This has fitted in with the Government's policy of linking training colleges, no longer required for their original purpose to universities in the vicinity so that courses can be carried on there.  This has happened with Mary Immaculate College and Thomond College, now linked to the University of Limerick, and as is proposed for St. Patrick's Training College in Dublin in linkage with Dublin City University.</P>
    <P>The difficulties encountered by the Minister for Education with regard to the acquisition of Carysfort on acceptable terms and the identification of a valuable priority use which would justify the acquisition of the property have been outlined to the Dáil on many occasions.</P>
    <P>In July 1990 UCD was approached by the then proprietor, and the property was visited by the appropriate authorities and staff within UCD.  According to the UCD President they &ldquo;were very impressed by both the quality of the buildings and the potential they offered&rdquo;.  The merits of Carysfort as a possible Graduate School of Business were clearly recognised, notwithstanding its separation from the Belfield Campus.  However, in view of the asking price of over £10 million it was not considered practical to pursue the idea. Against that background the Minister took the initiative in September to approach UCD to discuss the use of Carysfort in the context of the Government's programme for increased undergraduate student intake.  At that time UCD's plans to use Roebuck as a business school had run into difficulties, because of the escalating cost of the project, because sufficient private finance was not forthcoming and because many key facilities could not be provided within the budgeted cost.  I would like to state, as a misunderstanding has arisen on this point, that while UCD had hoped to raise £5.5 million for a business school at Roebuck, it had not been able to raise anything like this amount, less than £2 million in fact.  It was made very clear to me from UCD when pressed on this point at the meetings that I held with them, that they could not contribute more than <Col N="1997" /> £2 million to the purchase price of Carysfort.</P>
    <P>There is also the point, as the President of UCD has acknowledged, that Carysfort offered incomparably better facilities. As an illustration of this point the facility on Roebuck would have cost £1,500 per square metre, whereas Carysfort was being acquired for £300 per square metre.  Roebuck, when complete, would have provided less than a fifth of the space available at Carysfort at a cost of £7.18 million.  When Carysfort is operating at full capacity, it will have created an additional 2,200 university places, taking into account the fact that Roebuck is now available for undergraduate courses.</P>
    <P>Thus, there was a perfect convergence of purpose between UCD which required a premises for their new graduates business school and the Government, who had a longstanding policy with regard to keeping Carysfort in educational use. Both UCD and the Government also shared the objective of seeking to expand the number of third-level places.  In fact I held two meetings with the Heads of Universities in 1988 and 1989 on this subject, and in the 1990 budget we made provision to increase the third-level intake by 3,600.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> discussions during 1990 this was subsumed into the promise of 8,800 additional third-level places, which included funding to UCD for the acquisition of Carysfort.</P>
    <P>I had two meetings with Laurence Crowley in his capacity as Chairman of the Business Graduate School, one on 11 October and a second on 3 December 1991.  There had already been several informal and explanatory meetings between the Minister and representatives of UCD, including Mr. Crowley, before my first meeting on 11 October.</P>
    <P>There was no secrecy about those meetings.  They took place in my office and were arranged by my private office in the normal way.  It is quite absurd to suggest that there could be anything untoward about two official meetings with one of the most upright and highly respected persons in Irish business and <Col N="1998" /> professional life.  Of course, it is never very difficult, if someone is unscrupulous enough, to come along two years later and take any normal meeting out of context and attribute some totally misleading significance to it retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I arranged these meetings because I wished to discuss with the chairman the different aspects of the establishment of the graduate school in Carysfort, my support for the project, its importance from the point of view of improving Irish business management and the provision of additional places in third-level education in accordance with the commitments being negotiated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I also wished to discuss with the chairman the financial position of the graduate school and the prospects of raising funds from the private sector to enable the school to expand and develop.  On one occasion I offered a letter of support in connection with a possible fund raising mission to North America.  The procurement of private funding for capital development in third-level education is a well established feature of Government policy since 1987, as a means of maximising the number of third level places.</P>
    <P>Some of the views that were expressed to me by Mr. Crowley are contained in a speech he made to the Irish Association of Pension Funds in Trinity College on 2 October 1990.  He stated that graduate business education was critically important to business and industry.  He said resources will have to be invested in knowledge generation if we are to have any hope of survival as a nation, and that investment in education is essential for successful managerial performance.</P>
    <P>I regarded those meetings with him as normal and routine and similar to many other such meetings that I have held on countless occasions with the individuals concerned in advancing important projects for the public good in many different areas.</P>
    <P>I also want to reiterate the point that it was UCD, not the Government, who took the decision to purchase Carysfort, <Col N="1999" /> and it was UCD who put the formal written proposals to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, took it upon himself to intervene during Question Time last Wednesday and purport to give us the benefit of his advice on Government procedures and practices.  It would have been better for him and his own reputation if he had kept quiet, because the record clearly shows that what he said on that occasion was untrue and that on a number of occasions, decisions were taken by Governments over which he presided not just without specific memoranda being submitted but also in chaotic circumstances.</P>
    <P>A case in point is the UCD School of Engineering building in Belfield.  Dr. FitzGerald wrote to Dr. John Kelly of UCD on 25 May 1983, saying that the Government had decided that a general review of the third level capital requirements of that Department over the next four or five years should be undertaken and that no final decisions could be taken on the Engineering School before then. In a further letter of 19 July he said he understood that progress was such that the matter could be considered by Government shortly.  In the event a memorandum, meant to facilitate a decision on the UCD Engineering School, was withdrawn in October 1983 and was resubmitted only in 1985 by which stage the school was already under way.  Direct approaches were made to his Government in May 1984 rather than to the Higher Education Authority by the Registrar of UCD and by Professor Dooge, a former Fine Gael Minister and close associate of Deputy FitzGerald, with regard to that project.  On 7 June 1984 the Secretary of the Higher Education Authority wrote to the Department of Education to protest that they had no previous information or advice with regard to the project, nor had they considered the proposals put forward.  The Higher Education Authority were informed in 1985, without further consultation, that the construction of the Engineering School was to go ahead on <Col N="2000" /> the basis of the proposal put to the Minister in May 1984.</P>
    <P>Despite the earlier decision that the UCD Engineering School and all other third level projects, such as five Regional Technical Colleges, a dental school at TCD and a College of Art and Design, should form part of the capital review submitted to Government for approval in May-June 1985, the largest and most expensive of these projects, the UCD School of Engineering, the final cost of which exceeded £20 million, was not submitted to Government and there was no memorandum to Government.</P>
    <P>In a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 December 1991, Deputy FitzGerald sought to confuse the situation, by pretending the decision was taken a year later by reference to the Public Capital Programme of 1986, which was brought before Government.  But, the passage he quotes from the Public Capital Programme clearly indicates that the project was already well underway.  The fact is the proposal was already sanctioned months earlier, having been dealt with separately, without any memorandum to Government and without any reference to Government, involving the expenditure of over £20 million on a single third-level project, commencing in 1985, without the specific approval of the Government.  On the general question of my support for the Carysfort project I must draw attention to the fact that Deputy FitzGerald, as Taoiseach, had confirmed that he was &ldquo;extremely interested, extremely involved&rdquo; in the UCD Engineering School project.  By contrast the question of the use of Carysfort College as a business school was brought before this Government together with the possibility of a contribution by the State which the Ministers for Finance and Education were given authority to settle between them.</P>
    <P>In the provision of assistance to UCD to enable it to purchase the Carysfort institution for the establishment of the Graduate School of Business this Government followed perfectly acceptable and well-established procedures.  On <Col N="2001" /> 4 December 1990 following a presentation by the Minister for Education an informal decision was taken by the Government in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Education and Finance are to consider the question of the use of the college as a school of business management, with the possibility of a contribution by the State of which an initial payment might be made in 1990 &mdash; and be covered in a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a number of points about the procedure.  First, as paragraph 2 of the Government Procedure instructions states: &ldquo;Certain matters may, however, for reasons of urgency or confidentiality, have to be raised orally at Government.&rdquo;  What in this case was being raised at Government was approval for the use of Carysfort by UCD and the provision of a financial contribution for this purpose.  No Government approval is actually required for the introduction of Supplementary Estimates as such, which are and always have been sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Government legitimately delegated to the Ministers for Education and Finance the authority to settle all the details between them.  It will be noted that the decision referred to the use of Carysfort by UCD, not just its acquisition. A letter from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Education on 18 December 1990 approved a Supplementary Estimate on the basis that £9.7 million was the final Exchequer contribution to the capital costs.  He also stipulated that there would be no Exchequer subvention to the running costs.  The Minister for Education replied to this letter on 21 December 1990, stating that the President of UCD had confirmed that it would not be possible for UCD to operate Carysfort without an Exchequer Subvention from 1992, particularly in the early years, but there was a clear understanding that they would be generating extra income, with the ultimate objective of being completely self-financing. That to my knowledge was clearly the position, and it was necessary <Col N="2002" /> for me to telephone Dr. Masterson to assure him of my confidence that incremental running expenditure would be regarded as an appropriate charge.  In parallel with my phone call, the Department of Education conveyed a message in similar terms at official level to the UCD authorities on the same day, pointing out that there would be no additional funding in 1991, and that the amount of the subvention in future years should be the subject of negotiations between the college authorities, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education. Formal sanction was subsequently conveyed by the Minister for Finance in a letter of 31 January 1991 to the Minister for Education, agreeing that some assistance towards running costs might be given, provided it would not give rise to an excess of expenditure over and above that already allocated to Higher Education Authority institutions in 1991.  This is the situation that applies also in the case of the two training colleges, Thomond and Mary Immaculate in Limerick.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of the Higher Education Authority, they formally sought a draft for £9.7 million on 20 December.  On 21 December the Department of Education confirmed that a payable order had been made available to the Higher Education Authority, with the condition that it will be necessary to assure, before any money is paid to UCD, that the negotiations for the acquisition of Carysfort are sufficiently advanced to justify the disbursement of public funds.  The chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, Mr. John Hayden, stated on 24 September 1991, as quoted the following day in the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> that the money paid for Carysfort represented very good value for money, even though the Higher Education Authority had not been directly consulted, although it was in line with the views of the working group under the chairman of the Higher Education Authority that reported in February 1987.  He noted that there has been precedents for this.</P>
    <P>It will thus be seen that the subsequent <Col N="2003" /> arrangements made between the Ministers for Education and Finance about the use of Carysfort by UCD were fully in conformity with the authority delegated to them by the Government, and that all correct procedures were followed, before the moneys were disbursed.</P>
    <P>I am proud to have been able to contribute to keeping Carysfort College and its traditions within the third-level sector in accordance with the wish expressed at one time on all sides of this House.  I am equally proud of my part in helping to provide UCD and the nation with what will be a superb business college in the most economical way possible.</P>
    <P>Institutions of higher education are one of the best reflections on whether a country is seriously committed to excellence in every branch of its national life. America is very proud for instance of its Harvard business school.  It is a great pity that the Opposition parties are so blinded by political prejudice that they cannot share our wish for Ireland to have something of similar value and importance. Today, few things are more vital for our success than top managers.  Our young people deserve the best, and in enabling UCD to use Carysfort we have provided them with the best.</P>
    <P>The business college at Carysfort is already admired, and in a few years' time people will be amazed at this absurd controversy.</P>
    <P>There are a whole series of clichés in vogue about Carysfort.  Despite the enormous amount of information that has been made available at this stage, &ldquo;unanswered questions&rdquo;, &ldquo;an issue that will not go away&rdquo; are phrases used to try to keep the pot on the boil a little while longer.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have been particularly dishonest in completely misrepresenting what I said here in reply to an interjection during the course of the confidence motion on 16 October 1991.</P>
    <P>What I said is recorded in the Official Report, at column 41.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: I regard the purchase <Col N="2004" /> of Carysfort by UCD, to provide a premises for a graduate business school as an entirely praiseworthy and progressive step.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCartan: What about the price?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: The transaction was carried out in a perfectly straightforward manner and I was not involved in it.</P>
    <P>The words are perfectly clear.  I was stating quite truthfully that I was not involved in the transaction.  I had absolutely no involvement in the negotiations over the sale of the property which were conducted from the first approach by representatives of the vendor in July 1990 to conclusion of the sale in December by the college authorities.</P>
    <P>The actual purchase was carried out by the UCD authorities without any participation of any kind whatsoever by me. A question was put down to me for answer today by Deputy Gilmore in the following terms:</P>
    <P>To ask the Taoiseach if he met with or had any discussions with (a) Gunnes Estate Agents, (b) Drucker Fanning Estate Agents, (c) Davmac Developments Ltd., (d) JHA Ltd. and (e) Mr. &ldquo;Pino&rdquo; Harris or with representatives of these companies or persons concerning the sale of Carysfort College; if such discussions took place before 12 July 1990; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The question was quite properly ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>I am glad, however, to avail of the opportunity of this debate to answer it and to state categorically that I had no contact or any discussion with any of those companies or persons concerning the sale of Carysfort College at any time.</P>
    <P>As Deputies of this House we are in a privileged position.  We are perfectly free to say here anything we wish, secure in the knowledge that we cannot be pursued by anyone in regard to our statements.  It <Col N="2005" /> is a very important freedom.  It is fundamental to our parliamentary democracy, but we should always recall that it carries a corresponding responsibility because we are in effect the judges of our own behaviour.  This places a heavy and serious obligation on us to be careful about what we say and in particular about what we allege.  It is a gross misuse of our parliamentary privileges for any Deputy to use the protection of this House to make false and unfounded allegations.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Deputies of the Labour Party who have put their names to the motion which we are debating this evening in Private Members' Time have been guilty of a gross abuse of privilege because of certain statements which are contained in their motion.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of the House to the following which is included in the wording of the motion:</P>
    <P>... Dáil Éireann condemns the Taoiseach for: failing to ensure an arm's length and independent position in relation to his part in the transaction, particularly having regard to his relationship with the vendor; holding secret meetings with key persons involved in the transactions;</P>
    <P>Those are quite appalling statements. They are blatantly and recklessly untrue. They demean the people who make them.</P>
    <P>The records clearly show that I had no part in the transaction.  I was at arm's length and had an independent position in relation to the transaction, because I did not participate and was in no way involved in it.  I wish to state equally strongly and categorically that I have not and never had any relationship with the vendor.</P>
    <P>I state equally categorically that I did not hold secret meetings with key persons involved in the transactions.  These statements are untrue and reflect on the credibility of the Deputies who signed their name to this motion.</P>
    <P>I had no interest of any kind in Carysfort except in the public interest to promote a very worthwhile project.  I saw the graduate school as an important educational project of great national benefit <Col N="2006" /> that I wished to see come on stream.  My involvement was solely for that purpose.</P>
    <P>A primary purpose for being in Government is to achieve progress; to put new institutions, services, structures and improvements in place for the benefit of the people.  These things will not take place unless there is constant effort by the Government to make them happen.  That has always been my approach.  I spare no effort to get projects moving.  It would, of course, be much more tranquil to avoid controversy and do nothing.  I totally reject being criticised for holding meetings, making phone calls, pressing for action, expediting projects through the machinery of Government in order to get things done. Does anybody here suggest that we are so well off, so well developed economically, socially and culturally in this country that in Government and elsewhere we can all sit back and hope that progress will happen of its own accord; that there is no urgency; no need for Government to keep trying to force the pace?</P>
    <P>What are the Opposition about over Carysfort?  Do they want to damage a valuable project that will benefit countless young Irish men and women for many decades to come?  This project represents great value for money to the State; it was accomplished in conformity with proper Government and parliamentary procedures.  The Department of Education in their evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts have gone so far as to say that it represented outstanding value.  Are the Opposition so blinded by political prejudice that they care more about pursuing a personalised political vendetta than they do about a third level education project of great benefit to the young people of this nation? Let me here emphasise that Fine Gael and The Workers' Party enthusiastically supported the Government's decision in the Dáil 12 months ago, when the Supplementary Estimate was before the House and was approved.  There is no rational justification for their U-turn, except naked political opportunism.</P>
    <P>For some time now, we have been <Col N="2007" /> going through a black period in politics. The time of the Dáil has been taken up day after day, week after week, with unscrupulous and unfounded allegations of all kinds against myself and other members of the Government.  The normal business of the Dáil has been constantly interrupted by an unceasing campaign of vilification, accusations, and innuendoes.  I believe the Opposition have been acting very irresponsibly and without any care or consideration for the best interests of the country at this difficult time.  The nation today faces many serious difficulties and challenges.  A broad range of issues require urgent attention.  There are difficult decisions which have to be made.  The Opposition have themselves turned away from these affairs and sought to distract us from them in order to concentrate all their energies in attacking the Government, undermining our position and creating a sense of political instability and insecurity. They are in my view doing a serious disservice to the Irish people by the manner in which they have dragged political debate down to a unprecedentedly low personal level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring has been the principal instigator of this malevolent period.  Vilification and character assassination are his stock-in-trade.  He knows no other policy.  Not for him constructive debate, reasoned argument.  He puts forward no policy alternatives, no new ideas for progress, no worthy concept.  I wonder what cause Deputy Spring and his collaborators think they are serving by all this.  They are certainly not acting in the best interest of a general public who at this stage have other concerns and preoccupations. They are deeply mistaken if they think they are serving their own political fortunes.  There is increasing evidence to the contrary.</P>
    <P>This motion is motivated by malice.  It is based on falsehoods and it should be rejected out of hand by Dáil Éireann.</P>

The Labour Party motion calls on the Taoiseach to clarify exactly his involvement in this issue and condemns him for failing to clarify thus far on the record of the House exactly how and why he was involved. Instead of clarifying the position what we have had from the Taoiseach tonight is a regurgitation of all the discredited arguments we have had before in this House at Question Time and in previous debates.  The Taoiseach has not answered any of the salient questions which have been repeatedly asked both inside and outside this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to his involvement in this affair.  The Taoiseach has failed to address the issue.  One has only to look at his script tonight to see this.  He said that when Carysfort is operating at full capacity it will have created an additional 2,200 university places.  However, the second clause of the Government amendment, crafted by Pat Cox, says that the development at Carysfort will provide places for 600-900 graduate students.  That is consistency for you.</P>

Meanwhile there are 260,000 people out of work, the national finances have gone off the rails and the so-called priceless jewel, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> is but another figment of the Taoiseach's imagination.  What differentiates Carysfort from all the other scandals &mdash; as I warned the Minister for Education at Question Time, this is one of the hottest political potatoes around &mdash; is that there is no intermediary, no middle man to take the rap, at least in the short term, such as a firm of stockbrokers, holding companies, or semi-State executives.  In the Carysfort saga there is no human flak jacket to provide the shield.  The trail leads right to the front door of Kinsealy. <Col N="2011" /> The Taoiseach has been caught cold on this issue and, as they say in football parlance, he has been caught in possession.</P>

      <P>Is there a hidden agenda, about which we have not been told, which lured and tempted her into this £10 million Bonnie and Clyde act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contempt shown by the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, for the public intelligence on this issue seems to be based once again on the assumption that we are a nation of morons.  The former Minister has constantly maintained that UCD launched the initiative, and the Taoiseach said so here again tonight.  She repeated it <i>ad nauseam</i> in the Dáil, on radio, television and in the newspapers. Lo and behold, the President of UCD, <Col N="2012" /> Dr. Masterson, arrived home from the United States on Tuesday, 8 October and in the most diplomatic language possible flatly contradicted the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.  He said that the decisive move, despite all the denials by the Minister, was by way of a telephone call from the Minister in September 1990.  Yet the Taoiseach maintained tonight that Dr. Masterson and UCD made the initial move, again flatly denying the reputable evidence offered by Dr. Masterson to the Committee of Public Accounts and effectively accusing Dr. Masterson of telling untruths.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told the Dáil on 16 October quite clearly that he was not involved and he has tried to explain it away again tonight.  It reminded me of the &ldquo;no such meeting&rdquo; in relation to Greencore and their chairman.  Not alone was the Taoiseach involved but he had three meetings, one with the President of University College, Dublin, and two secret meetings with the chairman of the Smurfit Graduate Business School, Mr. Laurence Crowley.  The latter two meetings were secret.  According to the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 8 December 1991, she did not know about them.  Not satisfied that he had given enough by way of £10 million of taxpayers' money, the Taoiseach then proceeded &mdash; as he confirmed tonight &mdash; to return a telephone call to Dr. Masterson and assured him that not alone would the Government buy it for them but they would also run it.  It is typical of the recklessness which characterised the Gregory and Talbot deals in the early eighties.</P>

      <P>The former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, was told by the Valuation Office that their valuation for the college and 20 acres of land on 29 August 1989 was £3.8 million. Yet, according to the Taoiseach, she never brought this to his attention.  The <Col N="2013" /> Taoiseach would like us to believe that he thought he was getting a great bargain when his friend Pino generously offered it to the State for the knock-down price of £8 million.  Then the Taoiseach, in his rush to avail of the bargain before anyone else might jump the queue, forgot to tell his Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Progressive Democrat members, about the great bargain and gift to the nation.</P>
      <P>One of the facts of Irish life is that civil servants and public officials are, with rare exceptions, scrupulous in the exercise of their functions, particularly where spending of public moneys is concerned.  The rules, regulations and guidelines were laid down clearly and specifically.  There is a set agenda of procedures which must be followed.  If any public servant, a county manager, the chief executive officer of a vocational education committee or a town clerk at the humblest urban district council did what the Taoiseach and the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, did in relation to Carysfort, he or she would be booted unceremoniously from office.  There would also, of course, be the question of surcharge in respect of the misappropriation of public funds.  Not alone was a rule or regulation breached in the Carysfort deal but every single time-honoured procedure and safeguard was laid aside, not by the officials or servants of the State, but by the political masters whose hands guided this project from start to finish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that University College, Dublin, have a policy of campus consolidation which was one of the primary reasons for the university moving to their 300-acre Belfield site; they have adequate space to develop and expand and to keep their entire operation on campus.  UCD are an enterprising university well capable of attracting private investment.  The Smurfit Graduate Business School was to be one such project; plans were drawn up, models were done to scale and a financial package amounting to £5 million of private investment was put in place &mdash; we had a breakdown of that &mdash; for a purpose-built school on campus capable of training top flight executives for a vigorous, <Col N="2014" /> competitive single stage in the world marketplace. Not a penny of taxpayers' money was involved.  Difficulties arose in regard to the cost but nothing insurmountable and before any financial rearrangement could be looked at or before any further private funding was even sought, enter the fairy godmother, the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  As the saying goes, it was in the family, no problem.</P>
    <P>Initially UCD were very reluctant to move.  They were extremely reticent about breaking their campus consolidation policy and throwing away the plans for their on-site Roebuck project. It is quite obvious that there was a process of enticement: an irrestible offer consisting of £10 million of taxpayers' money was put on the table with underwritten running costs.  Nobody can blame UCD for succumbing to that temptation.</P>

      <P>Anybody dealing with Government Departments &mdash; and the Department of Education in particular &mdash; knows how difficult it is at the best of times to get money for projects.  The most modest primary school project would be regarded as extremely lucky if it was undertaken within three years of the initial application date.  Every stage must be meticulously gone through as my colleage, Deputy Kenny, will confirm from his experience as Minister of State at the Department of Education.  There is no such thing as skipping any rung of the procedural ladder, and yet from September 1990 to December 1990, in a mere four months, the £10 million Carysfort deal was signed, sealed and delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the sequence of events and the consequences.  On 11 September 1990 the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, met the Registrar of UCD and there were no civil servants present.  Two weeks later, on 26 September 1990, the Minister met Mr. Laurence Crowley, the Dean, Professor Kelly, the registrar and the secretary of the university and again there were no <Col N="2015" /> civil servants present.  A week later, the Minister met the registrar, the secretary and Professor Kelly and again there were no civil servants present.</P>
    <P>Eight days later, on 11 October 1990, the Taoiseach met Mr. Laurence Crowley in the Taoiseach's office to discuss the deal and again there were no civil servants present.  The former Minister for Education, according to herself, was not aware of this meeting.  Surely it is fundamental that if the Taoiseach is discussing any aspect of a major third level project he should at least have the courtesy to apprise the Minister for Education of what he is doing.  This did not happen, according to Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
    <P>On 16 October 1990, five days later, the former Minister for Education, had another meeting with the registrar and the secretary of UCD and Mr. Laurence Crowley; again there were no civil servants present.  On 25 November 1990 a price was agreed, £8 million, and Mr. Pino Harris was laughing all the way to the bank having made a neat profit of at least £1.5 million for holding a property for a mere seven months.  On 27 November 1990 the former Minister for Education met the registrar, the secretary and the Dean of University College, Dublin, presumably on this occasion for champagne, and again there were no civil servants present.  Six days later, on 3 December 1990, the Taoiseach had a second meeting &mdash; he talked about arm's length involvement &mdash; with Mr. Laurence Crowley but the former Minister for Education, according to herself, did not know about it until she read it in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 8 December 1991. Again, there were no civil servants present.</P>
    <P>The following day, 4 December 1990, the proposal was passed by Cabinet without a memorandum from the Department of Finance.  There were seven meetings involving hands-on management by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education negotiating, directing and orchestrating the entire deal.  The fact that no civil servant was present at any of the seven meetings means that it <Col N="2016" /> was not being handled by civil servants. There was no official involvement, it was being handled from A to Z by the Taoiseach and the former Minister.  There is another logical explanation.  The £3.8 million valuation was ignored.  No independent valuation was sought and I will tell you why.  It was feared that if an independent valuation was sought it would confirm the Valuation Office's estimate to £3.8 million thereby making it all the more difficult, if not impossible, to advance the £8 million desired by Mr. Harris.</P>
    <P>The advice of the Department of Finance was ignored.  I want to lay it clearly on the line that the Taoiseach had a personal briefing from the Department of Finance in respect of this matter.  No memorandum was prepared for Cabinet as must happen where financial costs are involved.  The reason that requirement was dispensed with was because the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Education were afraid questions would be asked by the Progressive Democrats Ministers in particular and, therefore, that the deal would be scuttled.  A special Estimate was rushed through this House on 18 December 1990, as Deputy O'Shea said. Vital information in relation to the Valuation Office's estimate, the reluctance of the Department of Finance and other key information were all withheld from the House and the House voted against the Estimate irrespective of what the Taoiseach said about supporting the project.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, has made some public play of the fact that I stated here and outside this House, that she acted illegally.  The former Minister for Education has made considerable play of the fact that I have described her actions in relation to the sidelining of the Higher Education Authority and the total usurping of their role as being illegal.  I stand over what I said.  The Higher Education Authority were set up by an Act of this House and the Seanad in 1971.  They are the statutory agency for supervising and monitoring all third-level education. <Col N="2017" /> They were completely ignored and by-passed. In my opinion the former Minister acted illegally in doing so.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Higher Education Authority, established under the Act shall be responsible for assisting in and co-ordinating State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment.  Were the Higher Education Authority consulted, let alone given their co-ordinating role?  Were the Higher Education Authority allowed prepare any proposals in this regard where a major item of public expenditure was involved? Section 3 of that Act was blatantly breached.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Higher Education Authority Act states that the Higher Education Authority:</P>
    <P>... shall advise the Minister on the need or otherwise for the establishment of new institutions of higher education, on the nature and form of those institutions and on the legislative measures required in relation to their establishment or in relation to any existing institution of higher education.</P>
    <P>That is clear and specific.  It states that the Higher Education Authority shall advise the Minister on the need for new institutions of higher education.  Yet when the new graduate business school was in the process of establishment not alone was the statutory obligation of the Minister to be advised by the Higher Education Authority not complied with but there was absolutely no consultation and no dialogue with the Higher Education Authority.  The Higher Education Authority wrote to the Minister, as has been confirmed by the chairman, Mr. Gabriel Corr to the Committee of Public Accounts, complaining of the fact that they were dumb spectators on the sideline. It is quite clear that the former Minister acted illegally by not consulting the Higher Education Authority, by not seeking their advice, and by not being advised by them.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is dredging the sewers again.  Section 8 (1) of the same Act states:</P>
      <P>Any request by an institution of higher education for State subvention shall be submitted by the institution to an túdarás (in this case the Higher Education Authority) in such manner as an túdarás may require.</P>
      <P>Here we had University College, Dublin going ahead with a £9.7 million subvented investment and yet no submission or request was made by them to the Higher Education Authority as specified by this Act.  Furthermore, the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, being fully aware of the facts again decided to conspire with UCD in order to by-pass and sideline the Higher Education Authority, thereby flouting, once again, one of the key requirements of the Act.</P>
      <P>Finally, section 10 (1) of the same Act states that the Higher Education Authority:</P>
      <P>... shall assess amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research or for any part thereof, either in relation to current or future periods.</P>
      <P>Here we have a State financial provision being made for capital expenditure and yet the Higher Education Authority, who have been vested with the power and obligation &mdash; the Act states they &ldquo;shall assess amounts of State financial provision&rdquo;&mdash; are totally precluded from any involvement whatever in carrying out such assessment and they got the proverbial back of the hand from the former Minister when they tried to protest at being prohibited and obstructed from carrying out their statutory functions. Indeed, the former Minister did not even have the courtesy to reply to Mr. Cox's letter.  It was a <i>fait accompli</i> when the Higher Education Authority got involved.</P>

      <Col N="2019" /> When I give a definition of &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;, I am implying that the person I accuse is acting contrary to the law.  The law, as I perceive it, is legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  If any Act of this Parliament is violated then I regard the perpetrator of such a breach as acting illegally.  It is clear that the statutory, supervisory, monitoring and regulatory role of the Higher Education Authority was totally flouted as a result of the direct intervention by the former Minister for Education. It is clear that the former Minister for Education, acting on the Taoiseach's instructions, conducted direct negotiations with University College Dublin, over and above the heads of the Higher Education Authority.  Apart from the gross insult offered to the Higher Education Authority there is the deliberate undermining of their statutory position. By her actions, in the case of the Carysfort project, the Minister acted in a highly irregular manner.</P>

      <P>The Government knew full well that in pursuit of their statutory obligation the Higher Education Authority would advise that the £9.7 million was badly needed and could be better spent elsewhere.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The net position is that the Valuation Office put an estimate of £3.8 million on the college and the property on 29 August 1989.  Just over four weeks later, on 2 October 1989, the Department of Education and the Minister were written to by the solicitors, acting on behalf of the vendors &mdash; the Sisters of Mercy &mdash; and made it crystal clear that the asking price of £8.5 million was negotiable.  In other words, they were saying: &ldquo;make us a realistic offer and we will consider it&rdquo;. Clearly they were saying they were prepared to bring down the price and were prepared to bargain.  My information is that they would have settled for about £6 million.  Not alone did the Minister, and the Department of Education, not enter negotiations, in order to get knock down on the price, they did not even do the courtesty of replying to the vendor's letter.  The Department of Education had absolutely no interest whatever in the project in October 1989 and yet in September 1990 it was all systems go, panic buttons were being pressed, mountains were being moved, statutory bodies were being sidelined, phone calls were being made, secret meetings were being held and, they presto, a £10 million Estimate appeared from the blue sky.

Carysfort is a scandal which will not go away.  It is extraordinary what can be done when there is a friend in need.  Deputy Flynn once described Fianna Fáil as a family. Another Mayo man said &ldquo;The family that prays together stays together&rdquo;.  The Gambinos were also members of the family.  It is extraordinary the lengths to which some people will go to secure public money in cases where there is a friend in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 34 to 40, to delete subsection (5) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(5)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of each regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until such time as a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a straightforward amendment which says that whenever regulations are to be made under this section they should be brought back to the House and that the positive assent of the House to the regulations should be sought before the ministerial order passes into law and effect.  This is all the more important on foot of the advice given to us by the Minister in the Second Stage debate, and in the context of the proposed amendment No. 4 with regard to the fluid position that would obtain under section 5 <Col N="2023" /> when the law is passed.  The Minister for Finance indicated that because of representations from the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party he intended to adopt a more fluid approach, that he intended to refer the matter back to the Gleeson Committee, asking Mr. Gleeson to adjudicate on the issue of severance pay and other matters.  It was hoped to have that report back in the House within three or four months, as indicated by the Minister of State when he was winding up the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in concluding suggested that by using this device we would avoid debate on these matters in the House.  That forced me to interject then and I posit the question again: what is wrong with having debate on this issue?  That is why The Workers' Party are not at all happy about the guillotine and why we criticised the other three parties in the House.  Why are we being asked during the last week of the session to take all Stages of this Bill in such a short period?</P>
    <P>I listened to the contributions of all speakers today and the point that came across was that what we are legislating for here, from the point of view of Deputies, is not unusual, is not extraordinary and is not unreasonable.  I will have something different to say about the pensions proposals for Ministers, when I come to them, but for Deputies in the House there is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary in this Bill.  Why should we be afraid to come into the House reluctant to put it on the record and to debate in the open and at length, what we propose to do?  Our reluctance to debate these matters immediately draws fire and fuels the perception so many Deputies talked about, that we are doing something that is not entirely above board or entirely normal in matters like this.  All regulations generally, dealing with the Bill and ministerial orders, should be available in the House and we should be able to put on record our views, our agreement or our dissent and have the matters voted upon.  In that way, no-one could say that we did things on the nod or in a <Col N="2024" /> hurry or improperly.  In the context of this legislation it is particularly important that all regulations to be made should come before the House and receive the positive affirmation of Members with regard to pay and conditions generally. This is even more important because of the Minister's intention with regard to dealing with representations made to him by members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party with regard to the severence provisions which will be dealt with by way of regulations.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first circulated we were led to believe that there was a very substantial reaction within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and that therefore the Minister would deal with these matters by way of amendment.  We thought we would see amendments from the Minister but we now find that the circulated list contains only one amendment from the Minister.  That is a very small gesture as a result of what we were told was a very heated debate.  I am surprised. My amendment in this regard should be accepted.  We should approach this on the basis that in the future we will be relying on recommendations from the independent body of Mr. Gleeson&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of Deputy McCartan's remarks there appeared to be an innuendo that something was not being done above board or that there was a certain amount of nervousness about the legislation.  The fact that the Bill is before the House in open debate means that there is not any nervousness about the Bill.  There is no question of anything being done beneath the floor boards.  Deputy McCartan knows that and he should withdraw these kind of innuendoes.  We are all getting a bit fed up with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the introduction <Col N="2025" /> of a new allowance for TDs and Senators in respect of expenses which they are obliged to incur in the performance of their duties and which are not otherwise met from the Exchequer.  The Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1962, empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations in relation to telephone and postal facilities for Members of the Oireachtas and provides for the same annulment procedure that is being proposed in the present Bill.  In like manner, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices (Amendment) Act, 1983 provides that Government orders increasing or decreasing the remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas or of office holders may be similarly annulled.</P>
    <P>Under these provisions and under section 3 (5) of this Bill it would be open to any Member of the House, including Deputy McCartan, to move a motion at any time within 21 sitting days of the regulation or order being laid before the House proposing that it be annulled. Should the Dáil pass such a motion the regulation or order would then stand annulled.  This gives the House ample power to annul any regulation in relation to expenses of Members with which it disagrees while at the same time providing an efficient mechanism for putting into effect regulations acceptable to the House.  In these circumstances the Government do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I should say that regulatory powers are contained in many statutes going back many years.  If the suggestion Deputy McCartan has now put to the House were to be contained in several other Bills I doubt very much if the House would do anything other than discuss and re-discuss regulations day in and day out. I do not think that is the way in which any democratic Parliament should proceed and Deputy McCartan knows this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal first with the innuendo because I did not for one moment make any suggestion of impropriety or underhandedness.  Because the point seems to have been lost on the <Col N="2026" /> Minister of State I will make it again.  If, in the future, we come to deal with the question of making improvements in the position of Oireachtas Members, in the wake of recommendations from the Gleeson Commission or otherwise, and the matter is dealt with by way of ministerial regulations without any debate taking place in the Chamber a perception would inevitably arise in the public mind that we are doing ourselves a favour without taking the opportunity to debate the matter in the House.  I understood that it was the view of every Member of this House that we should be open, clear and above board in everything we do.  If that point has been lost on the Minister of State I am sorry but I did not make any innuendo, nor did I suggest that there was anything underhand about the way in which we were dealing with the business today.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has given what I consider to be the standard answer on this amendment.  As he quite rightly pointed out, this is not the first time that such an amendment has been tabled.  The more the Government make provision in legislation for the nuts and bolts to be dealt with by way of ministerial order, the more they will find amendments such as this being tabled.  The primary motivator of this type of amendment is the Government, because it seems whenever a serious issue has to be dealt with in legislation the Government conveniently say that the Minister will deal with it in regulations which he will draft in his own time in his own office, which will be laid before the Dáil and which, in the event of no motion being moved to annul them, will become law after 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way in which we are going. That practice is leading to this House becoming less relevant and alienating us from the business we should be dealing with.  Large amounts of legislation, powers and provisions which deal with everyday problems and conditions are being dealt with outside the Chamber in the offices of various Ministers by way of the regulatory process, not to mention the way in which we deal with European legislation. <Col N="2027" /> This is also dealt with by way of regulations. It is not my fault therefore that this amendment has been tabled.</P>
    <P>I should say that The Workers' Party do not put down an amendment on each occasion such a proposal is made by the Government.  We only do so when we believe it is important that the House should be given an opportunity to have its voice heard and to say yea or nay to a particular proposition.  The Minister of State has given the standard response, that it is open to me or any other Deputy in the House to put down a motion and have it debated but, of course, it is not. He is being disingenuous in suggesting that it is.  I challenge him to point to one occasion during his time in the House, which approximates to my own &mdash; I entered the House in 1987 &mdash; on which such a motion was taken.  I remember no occasion on which a motion to annul a set of Government regulations was tabled on the Order Paper, taken and debated.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is unnecessarily drawing down on us the fire of those outside, the detractors whose numbers are increasing if recent opinion polls are anything to go by.  When we propose to implement a recommendation made by the Gleeson Commission or want to take an initiative, with the consent of the House, which is what we are doing in this case in regard to telephone allowances &mdash; we are endeavouring to catch up in a sensible way and the House has no difficulty with this provision &mdash; we should be able to come into the House and put it on the record.  If any party such as my own, who have reservations about certain aspects of this legislation, or indeed the Independents, who have not been heard yet, want to say that it is wrong, we should not be afraid to give them the opportunity to speak.

Earlier Deputy McCartan spoke about the need to treat people equally, that we should be treated in the same way as people outside are treated.  I do not disagree with that.  We set up the Gleeson Commission as an independent body to take this matter out of the hands of the House and to make recommendations.  If the Deputy wants the House to be treated in the same way as people outside are treated, then every increase within the public service should come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards every increase that has to be brought before the House, it is always the wrong time.  If Deputy McCartan <Col N="2029" /> wants fair play and an even playing field, then surely Members of the House are entitled to be treated in the same way.  If the Gleeson Commission make recommendations which are laid before the House &mdash; these can be discussed in the House, as the Minister has said, but they should not be discussed as of right; otherwise there would be no need to have the Gleeson Commission, and in that event if we wanted an increase, we would bring it before the House and debate it. However, given that we have set up an independent body we should accept their recommendations.  If we want to defer increases because of financial constraints, so be it; or if we do not want to accept them, we should dismiss the recommendations.</P>

This tax free allowance on half our salaries was properly awarded by the Revenue Commissioners.  There is no precedent in tax law for the Revenue Commissioners freezing a tax free allowance on a political basis.  That is extraordinary. We now find that the allowance, which had been frozen at £6,900 but should be about £14,000 now, is being awarded on a <i>pro rata</i> basis and <Col N="2030" /> is based on the lower figure of £6,900.

      <P>Deputy Mitchell's amendment seeks to exempt from tax severance payments which were to be provided under section 5 of the Bill. However, as announced on Second Stage, the Minister will move an amendment to make section 5 an enabling section, permitting him to make regulations providing for such payments, and the Government will be referring to the review body the question of the appropriate nature and level of such payments. It would obviously &mdash; I hope Deputy Mitchell will accept this &mdash; be desirable to await the outcome of the review body's deliberations on the matter.</P>

It is proposed that Members of the Dáil will not receive allowances in future, but is it not the case that there are statutory severance pay arrangements for public servants from State-sponsored bodies through to the public service?  Will the Minister tell the House whether, if he makes an order without this section going through, that order will ensure that Members of the Dáil who receive severance pay will be treated in the same way as permanent public servants and people who work for the broader public service?</P>

      <P>We are making legislation here as distinct from awaiting the outcome of any review body, and we seldom do this for ourselves.  If the review body recommend at some stage in the future that there be a severance payment, as district from a termination allowance which has a rather deathly ring about it, and if they recommend a particular sum of money, in order that the value of that money be real in terms of its purchasing power to the recipient, it would have to be substantial because it would be subject to tax.  That would attract further public opprobrium.  The same civil servants who are advising the Minister now will say that they can understand the argument that Deputies are entitled to such a large sum because the amount they receive will be worth only half that sum in purchasing value, but they will say that such a large sum would undermine the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> or some such future programme and, therefore they will not recommend that we be paid.  The amendment put forward by Deputy Mitchell, which is purely an enabling measure because regulations will determine the absolute sum of money involved, is a matter over which the Minister has control.  I strongly urge him to accept it.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that this <Col N="2033" /> matter will be reviewed by the review body, but if it is incorporated in the legislation as is proposed, regardless of what the review body recommend, we may still be liable to tax unless we introduce new legislation.  I do not envisage any Government in the near future introducing legislation specifically to make severance pay tax free.  The Minister in his reply talked about office holders, but the point made by Deputy Gay Mitchell was that no-one in receipt of severance pay is taxed on it. It is always tax free.  The Minister has said that if severance pay is exempted from tax in this case it would affect office holders, but we are not interested in office holders.  They have done very well out of this legislation and good luck to them.  More is required of the backbenchers than a few crumbs, and this matter should be given compassionate consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>To tax any severance pay is ridiculous and is most unfair to the backbenchers who give their services year in year out if they are fortunate enough to be re-elected. The Government should tell civil servants what they want.  I can understand that civil servants will outline to Ministers the consequences of their actions, but this is an opportunity that comes very rarely &mdash; there are other longstanding Deputies who know how rarely such an opportunity arises.  As we will not have this opportunity again either in my time or in the Minister's time we should act on this matter now and be courageous about it.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister on what conceivable grounds redundancy payments for Deputies are singled out to be dealt with in this way.  I have heard no argument for this.  Secondly, is it not the case that if this amendment or some equivalent amendment does not go through, no matter what the review committee recommend in regard to the treatment of TDs on a par with other people in society &mdash; which I think they will probably recommend with regard to tax in this instance &mdash; it will not be possible under <Col N="2034" /> the Bill as drafted to give effect to their recommendations.  We do not wish to pre-empt the review committee: they should recommend what should be done and we will take it on board, as we have done before.  However, we should not make it impossible for the review committee's recommendations to be implemented.  Therefore, I ask that this amendment or an appropriately adjusted amendment &mdash; the Minister's advisers will tell him what should be done &mdash; be included for this purpose.</P>

      <P>If the review body were to recommend that TDs severance payments be given tax free status there would not be any great difficulty because it could be incorporated in the Finance Bill.  We can await the report of the review body and, having examined it, the Minister can then make the necessary regulation and arrangements in relation to the tax free status of severance payments which could be then incorporated in the Finance Bill.  Deputy Briscoe, among other Deputies, seems to hold the view that if the legislation is not passed on this occasion, the door would be closed on this issue.  Let me say that is not the position.</P>

      <P>The solution offered, no doubt dispassionately, by the Minister's advisers will do exactly what we do not wish to do.  We are now purporting to have on the recommendation of Mr. Gleeson, or somebody else, a special provision to be written into the Finance Bill that will target the spotlight of attention on the fact that uniquely we are getting tax free status.  That is exactly the sort of <Col N="2035" /> thing we wish to avoid.  It is fortunate that the public gallery is empty but on the day we bring in the Finance Bill it will not be so.  The whole thing will be written up in a manner that will make it politically impossible for the Minister to introduce the amendment in the first place.  If the Minister accepts Deputy Mitchell's amendment now, he is under no obligation to implement it because it is simply an enabling provision, but the review body of the day will be aware that any such sum that they so decide will be automatically tax free and therefore they can attach an absolute value to it.  The Minister has been badly advised.</P>

      <P>It is up to the Minister to give the review body some indication of his views on the matter.  I see that plenty of notes are passing over the counter. Many people are in receipt of lump sums that are not taxed.  This may be a new procedure for Deputies, but what is wrong with something new?  We should adopt the proper procedure when introducing such a measure.  We have seen before, when we introduced in the Finance Bill the 19 per cent pay increase for Deputies, everybody did hand-stands and tried to run away from it, but fell into line when the Bill was going to be withdrawn.  We should give a clear indication that any severance payment will be in line with public service severance payments.  Unlike civil servants we can be knocked overboard at any time of the year &mdash; but should we decide to retire after a number of years, a lump sum based payment should be wholly in line with what exists for public servants.  I am surprised at the Minister.  I do not like the use of the word compassion.  I do not want compassion in this House, I want justice.</P>

The review body are independent and will report independently to the Minister and if we await their recommendation, everybody would accept the independence of their report.

      <P>It is very sad that the Minister for Finance has left it to the Minister of State to put his first Bill through the House.  It would take somebody of authority to make a decision on this issue and I fear that the Minister of State is being unduly influenced by the gentleman in the pen.  In deciding on the amount of severance pay to be awarded, account can be taken of the tax status of that award.  If we make a decision now that any payment will be covered under this section, that will affect the level of payment to be made.  In other words the review committee can take into account the precise value of the payment to Members when deciding on the amount to be awarded.  The Minister of State should consider the matter again.  Had the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach been in the House, a decision could have been taken very quickly.  I am sorry they are not here because far from feathering our own nests, this measure will indicate in advance to the review committee the status of any award and that this can be taken into account when deciding on the level of the award.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the views expressed by the other Deputies on this side of this House who have an interest in this matter.  I hope I am not being too facetious in saying that severance payments are not foremost in my mind, but who knows when that day may arise?  I notice that the Minister has not answered one way or the other, but if the position is that senior civil servants and persons in senior positions in the broader civil service, as it has been described, are not subject to taxation on severance pay then I see no reason that we should draw criticism on ourselves here tonight if we were to make the amendment suggested by Deputy Mitchell.  Perhaps the Minister of State would confirm that senior civil servants and other persons within the broader Civil Service are not taxed on the lump sums they receive by way of severance pay on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that a lump sum payment free of tax is a much more equitable method of payment.  I may be wrong about this <Col N="2038" /> and there are those who are better advised on the subject, but the simple reason for my belief is that there are some individuals who are better able to off-load their tax burden.  If they were paid sums of money as income and had other independent forms of income, would it not be open to them to shift the liabilities on the tax they may have to pay?  I believe that this proposal provides a much more equitable way of achieving fairness among all Deputies, that they get a lump sum free of tax that is theirs to spend. As other Deputies have said, whatever recommendation is made can take into account the fact that the sum is a tax-free payment.</P>
    <P>Those are two observations.  If the answer to my first question is that the severance payment to senior civil servants and others in the wider public service is tax free then there is absolutely no reason that the position should be otherwise for Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a point to contribute to this debate.  I think that Members are being a little unfair to the Minister of State in the sense that he is well able to manage his own brief and make his own decisions on the brief before him.  I do not need to make that point on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I do not want to enter into the argybargy about the principle enshrined in the proposed amendment, but I would like to say that I, as a long-serving Member of the House, do not disagree greatly with the views expresed by Deputies about the principle of a tax-free severance payment.  If severance payment is tax free for other areas of the public service then I recognise no reason that the position should be different for Members of the House.</P>
      <P>The debate is bringing us into the whole issue of leadership in our own cause.  I have always taken a strong view on behalf of the House that we are really the authors of our own misfortune in many aspects and that often when we have been shouting our own cause from the rooftops we have been standing back from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> The Minister has made a decision and I am not going to disagree with him in relation to the principle that he has pronounced, namely, that he intends to send the matter to the Gleeson review commission and that if, at the end of the day the commission make a recommendation on severance pay, that recommendation shall be enshrined in an upcoming Finance Bill.  So far as the point made by Deputy Quinn is concerned, it would not matter to me whether the provision were contained in the Bill before the House or in a Finance Bill.  I do not consider that by including such a provision in this Bill Members are going to get away with some kind of subterfuge, but if the provision must be included in a Finance Bill, so be it.  I would not be at all concerned about what people might say about that.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make, and I agree with Deputy Briscoe in this respect, is that some of us have been Members of the House for a long time.  I am not suggesting that because one has been 27 years in the House one should have any extra rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> other Deputies. We are privileged and are proud to be elected by the people but we have been doing ourselves a disservice for too long in taking advice from wrong and different quarters.  We should take our own advice, we should look into our own consultations and make our own decisions here openly and frankly.  I feel very strongly that we would be doing a disservice not only to ourselves but also to future generations of Dáil Deputies if we did not give ourselves a tax-free severance payment.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to address the matter much further, but I would say that Deputy McCartan's views on the Fianna Fáil Party's discussion about the Bill are way off and that keyholing the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party does not help the debate, a debate that is healthy, good and worth while.  The debate centred mainly on the question of the amount of severance pay that would be awarded and the three months' severance pay.  The impertinence of the idea that a Dáil Deputy would at the end of his or her <Col N="2040" /> day receive only three months' severance pay is what I am denouncing.  It demonstrates a lack of leadership in our own cause.  A suggestion came from some genius outside the House that those of us who would receive three months' severance pay should have our pensions suspended during those three months.  I do not want any severance pay at all if it is to be for only three months.  I would not say thank you for it.  I think we should get severance pay for a minimum of 18 months and for a maximum of two years.</P>
    <P>What can be done for the Ministers and the Ministers of State?  They are doing quite well, and properly so.  I do not begrudge that at all but there should be even-handed treatment so that whether one is an ordinary Member of the House, like ourselves, or a Minister or Minister of State one gets the same fair play.  That is what we are asking of the front benches.  Let our voice be heard, let it be heard in our own cause and let us not stand back from that cause.  Let us give leadership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to deal with the three months' severance pay aspect yet because that is being dealt with in the next section but I wish to say that the Minister of State seems to be apologetic in relation to accommodating Deputy Mitchell's amendment to section 4.  The Minister seems to have difficulty with the provision that the severance pay should be tax free.</P>
      <P>The amendment could easily have been worded to state that the severance pay in this case be treated in the same way as it is for others who receive such payments.  There should be no difference whatsoever.  No more than Deputy McCartan, I do not intend to look for severance pay in the immediate future, but if provision has to be made in legislation and if we are not able to stand up unashamedly for what is right and correct, we are not worth our salt and the sooner we get severance pay and are out of here the better.</P>

      <P>The Minister is confusing two separate issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> We are about to legislate the manner in which whatever provision is made should be made; that is our job.  We recognise that it is desirable that the amount of any payment should be recommended by the Gleeson Commission and that the Government should then take approporiate action with regard to that.</P>
    <P>If we were to accept the suggestion that the issue be left open then the Gleeson Commission would not know whether the severance payment was to be tax-free so how could they decide the amount? Our job in the House is to decide the principle that our severance pay should take the same form as that of everyone else.  There should be no discrimination. That having been decided, and we should decide it now without wasting any more time since there are other matters to be discussed, the Gleeson Commission can decide how much it should be, how long a period it should cover or what the amount should be.  That is the way we should legislate.  They cannot legislate whether it should be tax-free or not.  We do not want to legislate about the amount until we get their advice.  Therefore, logically we should determine that it should be on the same basis as everybody else, we should not be discriminated against as regards the principle or the method but the amount is a matter for the Gleeson Commission.  It is quite straightforward, that is the net issue and the Minister should see that and accept it at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief point also.  This provision is relevant to highlighting a point.  I agree with what Deputy Andrews said to whom I was listening outside the Chamber as well as inside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is quite extraordinary in the way it treats everyone except Government Ministers.  A point worth making with regard to this section, and the amendment, is that the Bill is proposed by a group of Ministers currently in Government who are exempt from its provisions.  Its provisions will impact on every backbench Member of this House or, indeed, Opposition Member whether on the Front Bench or Backbenches <Col N="2042" /> regardless of the length of service they have given in this House.  One could be in this House for ten, 20 or 30 years and this Bill provides for three months' severance pay in the circumstances outlined. Equally one could be in this House for three weeks, be on the right side of the Leader of one's party that happens to get into Government, or be in this House for a mere four years, and discover suddenly one is entitled to two years' severance pay.  That may not relate to one's abilities as a parliamentarian but simply to whether one happens to be on the right side of some particular leadership dispute at a given time.</P>
    <P>I take the view &mdash; and it is relevant to make the comment on this section &mdash; that that is debilitating as a legislative process. Instead of trying to encourage people of talent to come into this House and devote their full energies and time to acting as legislators it is a direct disincentive.</P>

I must say &mdash; and I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister present; it is the first time he and I have been in the House when he <Col N="2043" /> was taking a Bill as Minister; I congratulate him on his appointment &mdash; it is indicative of the regard the Government have for the ordinary Members of this House, that there is not a senior Government Minister in this House taking this Bill through Committee Stage.

    <P>It could be argued by people in what used to be the Department of the Public Service in Setanta House that it does not suit the Government of the day to draw direct comparisons between the terms of engagement of the permanent public service and temporary members of the public service such as ourselves, but in <Col N="2044" /> this instance equality of treatment is advisable.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister consider accepting this amendment and take it to the Seanad because we are taking all Stages today.  Were we meeting at another time in another place we could request the Minister to take it to Report Stage, recognising the Minister's position and the fact that, as a junor Minister, he is obliged to consult.  But, having regard to the nature of the matter, I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment being pressed by all sides, take it to the Seanad and, in due course, having consulted with those he must, decide finally in the Seanad.  If necessary he should return to this House when all of us would understand that the decision had been made elsewhere.</P>

That is why I am particularly glad that the weight of the arguments has been so strong.  It is my belief that, in reaching their conclusions, the review body will, of necessity, take into account the views of Members.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's point on how the review body would set the scale of severance payments in the absence of knowing whether they were to be tax-free, it is my view &mdash; if the situation were to be in line with office holders &mdash; that the review body would decide that on the basis of percentages of salary.  In making their recommendations to the Minister they would take all the circumstances on board so well outlined in this House.  I certainly expect the review body to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2045" /> In reply to Deputy McCartan, I should say he is correct in saying that senior civil servant's lump sums are tax-free.  I expect also that the review body, in arriving at their decision, will take that fact into account.</P>

      <P>I might add that I have the greatest sympathy for Deputies on all sides of the House in relation to this matter.  The terms and conditions will be considered by the review body, referred to the Minister for Finance, who must then, by regulation, set down what will be the position or state of play.  I appeal to Deputy Gay Mitchell &mdash; having stated that I consider the contributions made to have been worth while and carrying great weight &mdash; to allow the review body get on with their task, make the necessary recommendations which I have no doubt the Minister for Finance will weigh up very carefully.</P>

The Minister, being new to the office &mdash; in which I wish him every success; I am sure he will make a fine Minister; but it is regrettable he was sent here to deal with this Bill in this fashion &mdash; will find it difficult on the first occasion to tell his civil servants that what is good for the goose is good for the gander.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say to the Minister, in equity, in the sense that if this is paid tax-free it is worth the same to everybody &mdash; it is like a tax credit &mdash; whereas if it is taxable it will be worth more to some than to others, dependent on their appropriate rates of tax.  First, it would be equitable and, second, the review body, in advance, will know its exact value for <Col N="2046" /> each Member because they will know its tax status.</P>
    <P>In equity and by way of assistance to any review body, it is practical and proper that the House should take this decision now.  I recommend to the Minister that he accept the will of the House.  This is the Legislature and there is obvious support right across the House for this. If we were taking Report Stage tomorrow or the following day, the Minister would probably agree to consider this matter before then.  However, we are to take Report Stage within an hour.  Let the Minister take Deputy Quinn's advice and bring this to the Seanad.  If he is not happy with it, he can come back to this House and amend the Bill.  In equity and to give the review body advance knowledge of this matter, the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

It is disingenuous to suggest that I am saying the severance payment would not be tax free.  I have stated that the review body will examine the matter in relation to the terms and conditions of employment of Members of the Oireachtas.  The review body have made recommendations previously which have benefited Deputies and Senators to a certain extent.  I strongly believe that the review body should be allowed to get on with the job, taking into account the strong protestations and the weighty and in many instances unanswerable arguments of Deputies.  This debate has been very worthwhile and every speaker who has contributed has made his position quite clear and argued his case very strongly. I would imagine that in looking at the proposals the review body would have to take into account the anomalous position which clearly exists between severance payments which would not be tax free for Oireachtas Members and severance payments or lump sums for senior civil servants which would be tax free.  I would have the greatest confidence that the review body would take the views of Members into consideration.  The review body should be allowed to get on with that task and the matter should then be reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy keeps saying that, it will never come.  While I agree with much that has been said by the Opposition, the Minister's proposal is very reasonable.  The reason the review body did not make the recommendation in the first instance is obviously that they did not think of it.  We are asking them, almost instructing them, in relation to what we want as Dáil Deputies.  Taking account of the direction in which the Minister's mind is going, we have to do the best we can.  We must make strong recommendations to the Gleeson Review Body and almost instruct them &mdash; although that is probably putting it a bit too strongly &mdash; to make a recommendation which we can enshrine in the Finance Bill.  We must ask them to make the recommendation that severance pay be tax free and that the duration of severance pay be certainly not less than 18 months.  That is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to compare what is being done for backbenchers with what is being given to officeholders.  The latter are being given a special position.  The reason they are officeholders and we are on the backbenches is very obvious &mdash; we have not been preferred.  So be it.  Why should we as non-officeholders be discriminated against?  It is quite wrong.  It is a direct insult to the non-officeholders, the denizens of the backbenches, those creatures who haunt the backbenches over the years.  I am proud to be a Member of the House and whether I am an officeholder <Col N="2049" /> or a backbencher is irrelevant.  I want evenhanded treatment and I do not see that when somebody offers us a pittance of three months' severance pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I referred to termination allowances.  Like Deputy Andrews and others, I believe Deputies should be treated in an even-handed way.  As I have said, the three months' period was derisory.  The Minister proposes in amendment No. 4 to delete section 5 and insert a new section 5 which will enable him to determine the rate of the severance allowance.  I see much merit in the amendment put forward by Deputy Gay Mitchell.  The new section 5 will give the Minister the power to grant termination allowances to former Members of the Oireachtas and will not contain any reference to the three month period which I regarded as derisory. While I am somewhat sceptical as to <Col N="2050" /> when the Minister may bring such regulations before the House I am glad the reference to the three months period is being deleted from the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell in his amendment is seeking to exempt these severance allowances from income tax, as would apply in regard to severance allowances paid to the people who are advising the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no cost as the new section 5 will merely give the Minister the enabling power to make termination allowances.  It will be some time before any recommendation in regard to the level of these allowances is made by the Gleeson Commission, a subcommittee of the House or the Department of Finance.  All Deputy Mitchell is seeking to ensure in his amendment is that these allowances will be exempt from income tax whenever they are introduced. This is a good proposal because, if we do not do this now, we will have to do so whenever they are introduced.  Once the principle of severance allowances or redundancy allowances are established an amendment will probably have to be introduced in a Finance Bill to exempt them from income tax.  This would have cost implications.  Deputy Mitchell's amendment will not cost anything.  The Minister of State said that this could be done under a Finance Bill.  If this proposal costs too much it can also be removed by way of amendment in a Finance Bill.  Therefore, I do not see any harm in including Deputy Mitchell's amendment in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If it causes a lot of difficulties down the road and bodies such as the Gleeson Commission believe it costs too much, an appropriate amendment can be included in a Finance Bill to delete the provision from the Act. Therefore, I do not understand why the amendment cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with what the last speaker said.  If we do not address this issue this evening and have to come back to it in perhaps two years time when Gleeson or someone else reports on it &mdash; I would have considerable worries about Mr. Gleeson's availability because of his involvement in other events to look at this issue for at least another year &mdash; we will have the sort of moralising hypocrisy in the Progressive Democrats displayed earlier today in their speeches on this Bill, attacking Deputies for looking for some exceptional tax benefit which the general public get in similar circumstances. It is very interesting to note that there are no Members of the Progressive Democrats in this House.  Has anyone explained to Deputy Pearse Wyse who has been a Member of this House for, I think, 25 years, the implications of this Bill for him as opposed to its implications for his ministerial colleagues? It is very unfortunate that this Bill is being dealt with in one day.  The message being given to the Minister by all sides of the House is that we should bite the bullet and pass this amendment tonight so that we do not turn this into some sort of spotlight for the moralising public debate which goes on about TDs, their worth and their salaries when all we want is for people to be treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out that I am not making a special plea for myself.  I am in the fortunate position in which if I lost my seat I happily have a job I can go to outside this House.  I preserve that position not only in the interests of retaining my sanity but in the interests of my family.  I have nothing but admiration for Members of this House who take the risk of doing nothing but working as full-time TDs.  As I said, I am not making a special <Col N="2052" /> plea for myself.  If I lose my seat in an election I will happily survive.  However, it is not right that Members of this House who devote themselves full-time to working as TDs and do not have the safety net which Deputy Andrews or I have, should be treated in a way in which no public servant at the service of this State in the permanent Civil Service would tolerate.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Shatter, I would not like to think that this Bill would give me any great advantage.  Neither would I wish to be seen to be making a special plea for myself because, like Deputy Shatter, Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Ahern, I have a profession from which I do well.  Those of us in that special position have an obligation to Deputies who are not in that position.  I would make a special case for full-time Dáil Deputies.  I have a low opinion of the level of salary Deputies receive.  When I have paid the Revenue Commissioners what I owe them in tax I get very little from my Dáil salary and ministerial pension. I do not make any complaint in that regard, rather, I am making a special plea for full-time Dáil Deputies who should be treated properly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's amendment seeks to ensure even-handed treatment of Deputies.  I am not foolish enough to say I would vote for Deputy Mitchell's amendment but I ask the Minister to give it further consideration.  I accept that the Minister has devoted generous time to the amendment and has made his case very well.  However, I ask him to have another look at the amendment.  We need to make this House as attractive as possible not only for current Members but also for future Members who can regard it as a place in which they will get a proper salary.</P>

We have to seek election &mdash; sometimes we have to do this twice in one year &mdash; and put our jobs on the line. That is what democracy demands of us and we have no objection to it.  However, I know Deputies who gave up their jobs when they became Members of this House but tragically lost their seats sooner than they anticipated.  Some of those people had no jobs to fall back on.  That is the position in which a Dáil Deputy can find himself; it is a very tenuous existence.

If we intend to be even-handed let us be even-handed not just for this generation of Deputies but for future generations.  I urge the Minister to look at this amendment very seriously and I support Deputy McCreevy in this regard. As I already indicated, the Gleeson review body will certainly have my views on the record of the House.  I repeat that the severance period is an insult although, as Deputy McCreevy said, it is a good principle.  Why ruin the principle in a mean way by specifying three months?  As far as I know &mdash; the Minister might clarify this point &mdash; Deputies in receipt of a Dáil pension will have to relinquish it during the payment of that pathetic offering, which is an insult.  If it is allowed to stand &mdash; although I do not think it will &mdash; we are doing ourselves an injustice.  We are also doing a disservice to politics, politicians and democracy.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in expressing dissatisfaction at the taxation of the severance payment.  For many years I have dealt with people who have been made redundant and I see the amount they receive tax free.  To talk about taxing the measly sum in question is a joke.  Members who are lucky, or unlucky, depending on the way you look at it, in losing their seats will not qualify for a pension during the term of the severance payment.  I ask the Minister to examine the whole question again and to treat us as rational human beings.</P>

      <P>Many backbenchers have a full-time career in politics.  Somebody mentioned the tenuous existence in politics and I am sure that is experienced <Col N="2056" /> by the wives and families of politicians. We waited a long time for the Gleeson report and it was unfortunate that there is a provision in the Bill causing divisiveness between Ministers and Ministers of State and backbenchers.  I fully support what speakers said on this side of the House.  The offer to ordinary Members of the Oireachtas is derisory. It is unfortunate that in framing the legislation this factor was not evaluated or weighed in advance.  We should not even be debating this matter in the House. However, at least there is cohesion of thinking between the Fianna Fáil side and ourselves in relation to the injustice which has been done.  We all know what a tenuous existence politicians lead.  We all know what ordinary workers get by way of redundancy, which is tax free.  Not enough thought went into this, it is time to redress and evaluate the system.</P>
      <P>I support fully what Deputy Gay Mitchell said earlier, that it is not too late to try to do something about this matter.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is being left in the House, almost for a baptism of fire, and I trust he will see commonsense in relation to this legislation.</P>

      <P>It is clear that no amendments to this Bill will be accepted. The reality is that the amendment I have proposed is the fairest way of dealing with it in so far as it would be worth the same amount to every recipient.  From a tax point of view it would be tax equitable and from the point of view of the review body knowing in advance what it would <Col N="2057" /> be worth, it would be the fairest way to deal with it.  It is clear from all sides of the House that there is very strong support that the will of the Legislature is to proceed by means of the amendment because it is the fairest and most equitable way.  It is clear that a precedent has been created in the public service, that is how other public servants are dealt with. I cannot understand why we have spent so much time on this amendment and why the Minister will not accede to the will of the Legislature.  It seems clear, if he cannot accept this amendment, that it is a waste of time discussing any part of this Bill because the Cabinet decided what would be contained in it and, since they had made the decision it was tough for everybody else.  It is unfair not to accept the will of the House in terms of fairness, equity and of giving notice to the review body as to what it will be worth in our hands.  This is the way to deal with it and I am asking the Minister to consider accepting the will of the House and allow this amendment to go through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to Deputy Mitchell, through the Chair, that I would not consider the debate to have been not worthwhile.  I would consider the debate to be more than worth-while. Deputy Belton asked why the review body, on the last occasion, did not consider that the severance pay should be tax free.  The review body on that occasion were not given a brief to examine pensions of Teachtaí Dáil.  To clear up any confusion, we are not speaking about a lump sum but a recommendation from the review body about a continuation of salary.  The recommendation was that the continuation of salary would be taxed.  In relation to the severance payments which may arise now I should like to say, in this context, in all probability it will be considered to be a continuation of salary.  Having said that, I would like to say that the review body have been asked to look at the paltry three months severance payment period for Teachtaí Dála and I hope they will make a positive recommendation in that <Col N="2058" /> regard.  I agree with Deputy Andrews &mdash; who has vast experience &mdash; and others such as Deputies McCreevy, Briscoe and Opposition Deputies, that where a Deputy would get a three months severance payment it would be considered an insult.</P>
      <P>In order to see if Deputy Mitchell and myself can meet in some way in relation to this issue all I can do is suggest that Deputy Mitchell agree to allow me to discuss the matter with the Minister between the period when this Bill is passed and is sent to the Seanad.  It would mean that the Seanad would have to pass an amendment &mdash; if that were to occur I could give no guarantee &mdash; and it would mean that the matter would come back into this House.  That is as far as I can go.  I would ask the Deputy to accept that and the assurance that the review body will be asked to consider the matter in great detail if that is necessary and if the matter is not resolved to his satisfaction in the Seanad and subsequently in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is what might be called an emerging consensus. It appears that the Minister has now effectively met the amendment.  In the backbenches I have no power but I have a responsibility whereas the Minister has power and responsibility but what the Minister is saying effectively is that he may accept Deputy Gay Mitchell's amendment at the end of the day.  He is asking Deputy Mitchell to allow the discussion proceed to another section by withdrawing his amendment for the time <Col N="2059" /> being, but keeping it there in a technical sense to allow the Seanad to deal with it. I cannot stress how strongly we in this House agree with Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  There has now emerged not only a consensus view but a unanimous view and the Minister said if he was not prepared to accept the amendment he would make a recommendation, based on the views expressed in the House, to the Gleeson review body.  The views expressed to that committee would be that this House feels there should be a tax free severance payment.</P>
      <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said when he was in the Chair, there is another section which deals with the severance pay aspect.  I understand it is to be called the determination payment.  These are only words but the principle is there.  As Deputy McCreevy said, the only problem we have with the severance payment is that it is not long enough.</P>
      <P>I have been perusing the section before the House, and subsequent sections and it is evident that the more one looks at it the more one cannot appreciate the reason office holders are being treated in this way as against backbench Deputies &mdash; the foot soldiers of democracy. One could query the treatment the office holder will get under the provisions of this Bill, but I will not get down to that, we are being offered a three months severance payment.  I understand from one of my accountant colleagues that during the currency of that three months suggested severance payment those of us who are in receipt of the ordinary Dáil Deputy's pension will have that pension lifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like others who have been in this House a long time I am making a special plea.  This Bill, whether it contained provisions for severance payments or any other payments, is of no advantage to me one way or the other.  I know people will say &ldquo;hurrah&rdquo; and &ldquo;halleluiah&rdquo; when I make the point that I would be better off, in financial terms, with my pensions than I am serving here as a Dáil Deputy.  That is a fact, because I am a practising barrister and have already declared an <Col N="2060" /> interest.  At the end of the day the Revenue Commissioners get their whack from my earnings at the Bar and from my Dáil salary so that my ministerial pension is meaningless to me after tax. The only time I will become advantaged is when I retire from politics.  That is when my pension becomes realistic and important.  When I give up the Bar that is when they will become more important.</P>
    <P>I do not make any apologies for the pension I earned as a Minister of State nor do I apologise for the pension I will get after my long term of service in this House.  I earned the pension and I will not go craw-thumping to anyone to suggest that I should not be paid them.  Of course I should be paid the pensions.  I do not propose to put myself in a special position as against anybody else.  I have given a lifetime to public service and if the pension goes along with that at the end of the day, I accept it not with a sense of great gratitude but because I have earned it, because I deserve it and it is what I am entitled to as would a citizen working in any other job.</P>
    <P>Let us not underplay the proposal being made by Deputy Gay Mitchell.  It is a reasonable proposal.  I believe the Minister is meeting it.  He has asked Deputy Mitchell to take a particular position and, knowing that the Deputy is concerned about the present and future generations of Dáil Deputies, he might concede the point to the Minister.  The Minister is an honourable and able man who has placed his word on the record of this House.  We can take it that the record will show what the Minister said and that he did not engage in double speak.  We should take the Minister's word and get on with the other sections.  Deputy Mitchell's amendment is a good proposal and the Minister is effectively accepting it, subject to conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put an additional argument in favour of the spirit of this amendment as well as in favour of its precise nature.  The Minister of State earlier said that in the fullness of time if Gleeson were to recommend that, such a payment could be deemed to be tax <Col N="2061" /> free, could be brought into line with all other such payments for people ending their employment after a period.  In every European country, with the exception of the UK, and particularly in those European countries within the Community where democracy was lost for a period, upon its return due consideration was given to ensuring that the rights of members were properly protected.  Their right to return to employment externally and their right to remuneration internally were recognised and fully protected because of the necessity to address the kinds of argument that Deputies Shatter and McCormack referred to.  As Deputy Dr. Lee put it in his diagnosis of the first seventy years of independence here, the influence of the British Treasury in the culture and ethos of the Department of Finance has wound its way through, not for the first time, but consistently in their treatment of the way the Houses of the Oireachtas function.  Indeed, in some European countries this would not have been a matter for the Department of Finance.  We would have control of our budget and of our Vote.  That is another reason for accepting this amendment.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept the suggestion made.  I know he is in a lonely position. The flow of traffic in and out of the door to the Minister's left is a testimony to the loneliness of his position and to the urgency with which he is seeking company and advice.  I trust the Minister will listen to the advice coming from this side of the House where he has numerous friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too concerned about the traffic in and out of the door but I will bring practical reality to this debate.  I am one of the Deputies some of the senior Fianna Fáil Deputies referred to, who came into the House two and a half years ago.  I was a livestock auctioneer for a number of marts two and a half years ago and I gave up my job when elected to this House.  I was privileged, glad and proud to do that and I am proud to represent my constituency in the Dáil.  I have four children in second level education.  I said goodbye to my job when I came here.  The week after I left the marts, the person who replaced me was working in all the places I worked.  I do not have any other job.  I do not complain about that.  To spend 90 minutes debating whether or not severance pay for the like of me or anybody else should be tax free is ridiculous.  I was 22 years in the marts before I was elected to the Dáil.  I spent ten years building up the business but if I or any other Deputies lose our seats at the next General Election, perhaps due to the revision of the constituencies, we will be offered three months' redundancy pay which is taxable. I do not give a damn whether or not it is taxable.  I will not qualify for pension because I am only two-and-a-half years in the House, but three months' severance is an insult.  We have spent 90 minutes deciding whether or not it should be taxable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet adopted the proposals of the Gleeson Commission.  The Progressive Democrats' Minister for my constituency, Deputy Molloy, spent ten minutes patting himself on the back and beating his chest about what the Progressive Democrats have done in successfully introducing this legislation but neither he nor the Cabinet will be affected by this Bill because it only deals with the pension entitlements of the next Government.  I cannot understand the relevance of this Bill to Members with my service.  I do not care whether or not the severance is taxable.  I am more <Col N="2063" /> interested in Deputy Andrews' proposal that there should be 18 months severance pay.  It took me ten years to build up the position I held in business before I was elected to the House.  It would take three to five years more in a very competitive business to get back into the business, not to talk of building up to the position I had reached.  If we have not the respect for ourselves which would make us support the Bill we are worth nothing and we are not worthy to be returned to this Chamber.  I am not ashamed to fight for my rights and other Members should not be.</P>

      <P>As I said, I am not familiar with this territory; we can call it whatever we want &mdash; severance pay or lump sum.  As other Deputies have said, after an hour and a half, I think we know what we are talking about, even if we have not got the names right.  If it is non-taxable the same should apply in the case of Members of this House.  For this reason I fully support the amendment proposed by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contribution was brief for another reason, that this Bill involves far more than this simple issue.  During the course of the debate on Committee Stage we have had one substantial discussion on one amendment.  I withdrew an earlier amendment when I realised no progress was going to be made, but during the course of the debate on Second Stage and Committee Stage we have constantly talked about the perception among people outside the House and the way in which we will be perceived because of the way in which we have addressed this legislation.  I have to say that we have <Col N="2064" /> done more harm in the last hour and a half in relation to the way in which people outside will perceive us having regard to the progress made on this Bill.  They will realise that, apart from five or ten minutes, the entire debate on Committee Stage was taken up in trying to convince the Minister of State that we should be treated no differently from senior civil servants in regard to the taxing of severance pay or lump sum payments.</P>

I want to register my protest at the way in which the debate on this Bill has been guillotined and at the fact that so little time has been made available to the House to debate the more substantial issues such as those dealt with by Deputy Andrews and others.  These include the scale of the severance pay payable to Deputies, or more particularly, the enhanced conditions available to Ministers, and the question of whether sitting Members of this House should be entitled to a pension irrespective of the amount of time they have spent in office, age or other considerations.  We are not prepared to address those issues.  The Minister of State was not prepared to listen to the reasonable arguments advanced, and I regret to say that we will have drawn down criticism on our heads, deservedly so, over the way in which the debate has been conducted.</P>

      <P>The dual abode allowance is given to certain Ministers and Ministers of State under an administrative practice derived from rule 3 of the rules relating to deductions for employment expenses.  The other tax deductions for expenses granted to Members of the Oireachtas, which are being replaced in the Bill by a tax-free expenses payment, are also given by reference to that rule.  However, the terms of that rule are quite restrictive and it has not always been clear that Members of the Oireachtas are in strictness entitled to deductions in respect of some of the expenses allowed to them or to the full amount allowed.  The main difficulty has been in determining the primary function of Deputies, that is, whether it is as legislators or as constituency representatives. In considering the terms of remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas the review body have confirmed the practice of granting the dual abode allowance to Ministers representing country constituencies. In view of that it has been considered appropriate to put their entitlement to the allowance beyond doubt by putting it on a statutory basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that I have been allowed to raise an issue that is causing a great deal of concern in my constituency.  As the Minister is aware, Kantoher Food Products Ltd., of Killeedy, Ballaugh, County Limerick, which has an annual turnover of £14 million was wound up and a liquidator appointed to the company by the High Court.  The company employ 130 full-time employees and provide a vital industrial lifeline to the people in the surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>The area surrounding Kantoher has a strong dependence on agriculture and this is the most important industrial employer in an area stretching from Tournafulla to Dromcollogher where they draw most of their employees within that catchment area.  The liquidator has allowed the company to trade and they are now catering for a boom Christmas trade.  The plant was established back in the twenties and the technology used in the processing of chickens and turkeys is one of the most modern in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important for the company to continue to operate and for the liquidator, Mr. John Hyland of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, to engage in discussions with potential clients whose ambition is to continue with the processing of turkeys and <Col N="2070" /> chickens in this area.  The area received a body blow recently when Kantoher co-operative was taken over and a rationalisation followed with up to 40 jobs being lost.  Should anything happen to this plant it would be devastating to the local economy.  Many of the workers have firm roots in the area and have taken out mortgage commitments, etc.  The likelihood of other suitable jobs being found would be unlikely.  Over 40 poultry producers who have shown good faith with this project over the years would also be affected by the present discussions on Kantoher poultry products future.  Many of these have borrowed heavily for the provision of broiler houses.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to use all the support of both his office and the Industrial Development Authority to back the liquidator in ensuring that this company are enabled to continue in business for the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the management and workers for the work they have put into this company and I sincerely believe that the high level of skilled workers will be an asset to any suitable employer who is interested in this project and will continue to operate it on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, may I thank Deputy Finucane for raising this matter in the House and I am glad to have the opportunity to reply to this question on the liquidation of Kantoher Food Products Ltd.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at this unfortunate development.  It is always sad to see any company getting into difficulties resulting in the appointment of a liquidator.  It is particularly so in the case of a company such as Kantoher Food Products Ltd., which had such worth-while ambitions for the poultry meat sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kantoher Food Products Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kantoher co-operative, were formed in August 1988 to take over and develop the poultry <Col N="2071" /> activities of the co-operative, that is poultry processing, hatchery, egg laying and egg purchasing and processing.</P>
    <P>The new company embarked on a modernisation programme to upgrade and expand the poultry facilities and by the end of 1990 had a 10 per cent share of the poultry market with an employment level of about 130.  However, it is understood that the company ran into financial difficulties necessitating the appointment of a liquidator.  In this regard the Deputy will appreciate that the decision to appoint a liquidator at Kantoher Food Products Ltd. is one over which the Minister for Agriculture and Food has no control.</P>
    <P>The liquidation is, as I have said, very regrettable, and one's sympathy must certainly go out to the employees who may lose their jobs.  I am also concerned about the poultry producers who supply the company.  However, I understand that the liquidator is trading for a short period and there is the possibility that the business and assets may be sold as a going concern thus preserving some if not all of the jobs at the factory and continuing outlets for the breeders.</P>
    <P>While the Kantoher situation is unfortunate, I would like to say that the poultry industry generally is in a sound state.  The industry has been expanding and now has a farm-gate value of some £130 million which translates into retail values of about £350 million.  The value of poultry and egg exports in 1990 amounted to £34.5 million.  Including Kantoher there are 16 poultry slaughterhouses approved to EC standards with a throughput of about 40 million broilers per annum.  I am confident that the industry has the basic structure to enable it to maintain and develop its position in the EC and world markets and expand employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> The shared home ownership scheme announced in February last during the much-vaunted press conference by the then former Minister for the Environment advertising his plan for social housing has turned out to be a cruel confidence trick for hundreds of desperate housing applicants.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership scheme is essentially a fraud.  People who meet the low income requirement of the scheme and who have no chance of public housing &mdash; because of the virtual termination of the public housing programme &mdash; have been disgracefully misled by the Government in the context of this scheme.  They have been invited to apply for accommodation under the terms of the scheme and the public and this House have been invited to believe that the scheme would make a significant contribution to the housing crisis.  In fact, at the end of 1991, not a single house in the greater Dublin area has been purchased under the scheme.  I am advised that in the State as a whole two such purchases have been effected.</P>
    <P>The disgrace is not due to any foot-dragging on the part of local authorities. It is solely due to the inherent defects in the scheme itself.  A prospective purchaser under the scheme would need to be either an incurable optimist or a fool. How could any Deputy of any party advise a constituent, driven by a desire to get housing for his or her family, to enter into the following kind of deal?</P>
    <P>I take as an example the typical house that would attract a £1,000 deposit under the terms of the scheme for fees and so on and that would require the following mortgage-rental repayments on the 50 per cent purchased, with the obligation to buy out the remaining 50 per cent equity at the end of, or during, the 25 years.  In the case of a house costing £41,000, the monthly outgoings in the first year would be as follows if one were buying a 50 per cent share from the start. The cost of a 50 per cent share would be £20,500 funded by a deposit of £1,000 and a mortgage loan of £19,500.  Mortgage repayments on the £20,500 loan would be £199 a month.  The rental repayments multiplied by 5 per cent would equal £85 a <Col N="2073" /> month, making total repayments of £284 per month.  For a person on an income necessarily less than £12,000 per annum repayments of £284 monthly represent a very hefty commitment.</P>
    <P>However, that is not all.  After 25 years the person concerned owns only half of a house and must then buy out the 50 per cent unpurchased equity.  In the example I have given above the unfortunate occupier would then be faced with a cost of £52,500 to buy out the remaining unpurchased equity, that is the original outstanding £20,500 at an escalator of 4 per cent per annum over 25 years.  Can one imagine a 40 year old person on a low income making hefty repayments over 25 years then being hit with a bill for £52,500 at the age of 65 to buy out the second half of his or her house?  Is it any wonder that not a single purchaser has been found in the greater Dublin area?</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, how is one to find the unpurchased equity?  The Department of the Environment refuse to advise local authorities what will happen if people cannot find the money to buy out the unpurchased equity at the end of the 25 years.  No bank would give a loan to a 65 year old person on a small pension.  Further, the Minister for the Environment has failed to put in place the legislation necessary to enable local authorities to implement the scheme as a single transaction.  As it now stands the scheme &mdash; bankrupt, misleading and fraudulent as it is&mdash;is inoperable because a local authority must first purchase the house, keep it on the council stocks until the council meet and then sell it on to the purchaser.  This practice is unwieldy and unworkable and I ask the Minister to reply tonight to this specific point as well as to indicate whether he intends to address the substantial defects in the scheme itself.</P>

      <P>Criticism of the shared ownership system is entirely ill conceived.  It is wrong to criticise the system for not meeting objectives it was never intended to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shared ownership is one, and only one, <Col N="2074" /> of a wide range of options designed to meet social needs in a reasonable and well targeted way over the coming years. These options include the provision of local authority housing, whether by new building, the acquisition of existing houses or by way of vacancies in the existing local authority rented housing stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, the provision of voluntary housing is being expanded substantially by virtue of the voluntary housing capital grant schemes and the new rental subsidy scheme.  The mortgage allowance for tenants will allow those tenants who can afford to do so to acquire private housing for their own accommodation thereby freeing up local authority housing for re-letting to persons on the waiting lists.  The new sites scheme will assist low income households to provide their own housing, either cooperatively or individually.</P>

      <P>Overall, I estimate that the Government will have catered for the accommodation needs of about 5,500 households in 1991.  Next year will be the first full year of operation of the range of new measures introduced in the plan for social housing and the number should increase to about 7,000.  The shared ownership scheme will make a significant contribution to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shared ownership is designed to help persons on lower incomes to achieve home ownership in stages.  It has attracted a high level of interest.  Local <Col N="2076" /> authorities are responsible for administering the system and have been authorised to deal with 1,000 shared ownership transactions under a pilot programme. Up to the end of September last, the latest date for which I have figures, 760 applications had been received, 59 approvals have issued and two transactions were completed.</P>
    <P>Last May local authorities were authorised to proceed with the selection of prospective owners under the pilot programme. While the full operation of the shared ownership system requires new legislation, the system may be operated on the basis of interim arrangements devised by my Department with the benefit of expert legal advice.  These arrangements allow the purchaser to occupy the house on foot of a letting agreement which will be converted to a formal shared ownership lease with retrospective effect as soon as the legislation is passed.  Local authorities have been asked to operate the system on this basis and to process applications for shared ownership as quickly as they can.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that the interim arrangements provide an effective basis to allow shared ownership transactions under the pilot programme to proceed in advance of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I also assure the House that the Housing Bill will be published early in the next Dáil session and that the House will then have a very good debate on that Bill.  All of these issues can be brought up and I shall discuss them in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent decision by FIFA that World Cup matches would be <Col N="2077" /> all-seated affairs, highlights once again the need for a national all-seater stadium.</P>
      <P>During the recent European and World Cup tournaments tens of thousands of Irish supporters travelled throughout the length and breadth of Europe supporting the Irish team.  Not only were they super supporters, they were in fact excellent ambassadors of this country. It now transpires that most of these fans, many of whom followed the Irish team for over 20 years, will not gain access to home games in the forthcoming World Cup tournaments.  The current prediction is that Lansdowne Road, where the matches will be played, can only accommodate 23,000 seated.</P>
      <P>I am reliably informed that up to last week, 120,000 block booking applications had already been received by the FAI for these matches.  I hope that a mechanism can be devised whereby the real supporters, those who supported the Irish team for years when it was not popular to do so, can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>This scandalous position obtains because of the total inaction by this Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for sport in particular. It is not as if they were unaware of the increased safety consciousness of FIFA and the various European governments, which was obvious in the aftermath of the Heysel Stadium tragedy.  Some three years ago the Minister made headlines when he announced he had proposals to make Croke Park into a super all-seater stadium.  The recent decision by the GAA to refuse permission for a joint Gaelic/Soccer attraction at the RDS would indicate that this proposal was always a non-starter.  The Minister should have been aware of this and come up with alternative proposals.</P>
      <P>There are alternatives, locations such as the North Wall area, Grangegorman, Phoenix Park and Santry Stadium which have been mentioned over the years.  All of these had certain advantages.  If the Minister was serious about a national sports stadium proposals should have emerged by now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2078" /> The national lottery which was originally established to provide facilities for sport, recreation and youth has been an outstanding financial success.  The sporting public demand to know why some of this money has not been used to provide a national sports stadium.</P>
    <P>I listened during the week to a contribution on radio by a real sports supporter, somebody who follows all modes of sport.  He commented that, at the triumphant homecoming of the Irish soccer team from the World Cup, politicians vied with each other to gain access to the victory bus.  That supporter had a point when he said: &ldquo;Some two years later what have these fair weather supporters secured for the sportsmen and women of this country?&rdquo;  Is it not a scandal that young people must go abroad to achieve their full sporting potential because of lack of basic training facilities here?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Given that a new stadium with a seating capacity of 40,000 would cost in the region of £35 million to £40 million, I suggest there would be merit in a joint public-private sporting organisation venture which would not necessarily exclude Lansdowne Road.  Sport here needs a Minister aware of the problems, who is prepared to fight his corner for the necessary finance to resolve them.  I call on the Minister this evening to put his proposals to this House and sporting people in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Ryan said, the original purpose of the national lottery was to provide a national stadium. However, the Government hi-jacked the national lottery using those moneys in a confetti-like fashion, totally ignoring the genuine aspirations of our sporting public.  If one looks at the Book of Estimates one will see millions of pounds of that money being allocated to normal Government spending here.  That is the way in which national lottery funding has been used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the World Cup in July 1990 the Minister stated in the course of a radio interview on &ldquo;This Week,&rdquo; that he <Col N="2079" /> would establish a special expert committee to examine the posibility of providing a national outdoor stadium, which he later denied in this House.  If the Minister did establish that committee would he say whether they ever reported or made recommendations?  Would the Minister inform us this evening whether they did and, if so, what were their recommendations?  But I must say that at present the Minister has frustrated all of the sporting fraternity and they are most annoyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to respond to this debate. Indeed, I thank Deputy Ryan for having raised the issue.  Let me say at the outset that I too want to see a national outdoor stadium developed.  Indeed, much work has gone into efforts to endeavour to bring that about.  I might go through those efforts briefly but before so doing it is most important for all of us to understand that the country needs only one major crowd-capacity stadium.</P>
      <P>The main difficulty we have encountered in recent years is that we have had three sporting organisations all wanting their own stadium, the GAA in Croke Park wanting to develop that stadium, the IRFU wanting to develop Lansdowne Road and the FAI from time to time wanting to do different things but it is fair to say they would like to see their own 40,000 seater stadium, as the Deputy mentioned.  What we do not need here is a 30,000-seater stand costing in the region of £40 million which would be filled on only two or three occasions in the year. That is our major dilemma with regard to the national stadium.  I am not prepared to countenance the development of three stadia here, funded by the State in the first instance, but which would also have to be funded by each individual sporting organisation.  That would be a total waste of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>A total waste of money <Col N="2080" /> which rather should be used in the development of the games of soccer, rugby, hurling or football throughout the country.  We all know that every club, whether it be a hurling, soccer, football or rugby club, needs to put money into the promotion of the game among children. We are not prepared to go along with the develpment of three stadia, putting massive amounts of money into bricks and mortar.  The point is that we want to build or develop one.  But I have found that, unfortunately, the three organisations cannot, or are not prepared, to come together to build one or to utilise one of the existing ones.</P>
      <P>Yes, we tried with regard to Croke Park.  The GAA &mdash; and I respect their stand on this &mdash; decided that they did not want Croke Park shared as a national stadium.  We tried also to develop Morton Stadium and had got initial support and agreement from the FAI who subsequently changed their minds.  We have also examined the possibility of a national outdoor stadium on the green-field site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy to consider that proposal.  I appreciate the sincerity of both Deputies who contributed here this evening but we do not need another 40,000-seater stadium.  As any Member will know, what we need is a 75,000 seater minimum because, whether it be an all-Ireland, rugby international or a soccer international, any fewer than 75,000 tickets is not sufficient.  Therefore, another 40,000-seater stadium, while just about serving the interests of soccer, in my view, would not constitute the proper end result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the IRFU are not interested.  The problem with the GAA in that respect is that they have said to me: yes, we are interested in principle in <Col N="2081" /> becoming involved in this proposal but, at the same time, they are saying: we also want money to develop Croke Park.</P>
      <P>I will be very straight and fair about this, I have to accept part of the blame on the part of the Government that perhaps we have not been as forthcoming as we might have been with very significant amounts of money.  Nonetheless I must say also that, unless and until the three sporting organisations look forward rather than back, we shall not have a national outdoor stadium here.</P>
      <P>If the three national organisations are prepared to put their heads together and develop a national stadium either on a green field site or in one of the existing stadia with a capacity for 75,000 people, I am quite satisfied that I would have a good case to take back to Government, asking them to support such a venture and that they would respond favourably. Otherwise, we are only fooling around with three organisations endeavouring to develop their own stadia which they will then fill on no more than two or three occasions annually.  That amounts to waste of money and I am not prepared to involve this Government in that kind of wastage.  We have met the three organisations and have tried to make progress but we were simply unable to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the mid-eighties the Department of Education approved an extension of four permanent classrooms and a general purposes room for Naomh Erc primary school, Kilmoyley, County Kerry.  In December 1988, following a meeting between the board of management, the local Oireachtas representatives and the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, it was agreed that a modified proposal would be acceptable to the Department of Education and to the board of management. This proposal included the replacement of the existing prefab with two classrooms and extensive restoration work to the existing building which would include <Col N="2082" /> two further classrooms, an office, a kitchen and a library.  Unfortunately this proposal will still leave the school without a general purposes room.  The board of management in their frustration had no option but to accept this compromise.</P>
      <P>The prefab was provided in 1967 and is about to disintegrate.  In January 1990 a window was blown in during a period of strong winds.  This could recur at any time.  Over 25 pupils, junior and senior infants, use the prefab as a classroom. It is totally unsuitable for these young children.  I am not exaggerating.  The officials of the Office of Public Works, and Dr. Lucas and Dr. Jackson of the Southern Health Board have agreed that the prefab and the existing school building are substandard.</P>
      <P>All the preparatory work has been done and the necessary documentation is with the Department.  I ask the Minister to allow the project go to tender immediately and ensure that financial provision is made for the extension in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Deenihan has given me the opportunity to make the position of the above school clear to the House and also to the parents and pupils of Glenderry, County Kerry. The provision of an extension of two classrooms and a general purposes room has been approved.</P>
      <P>However, due to a changed financial climate and the demands on the capital for national schools it was not possible to advance the above extension. Added to the above considerations, the number of pupils attending the school and future enrolments have shown a marked decline.  The numbers have decreased from 172 enrolments in 1989 to 136 enrolments in September 1991. The school has five teachers in five classrooms.  Due to the fact that some of the classrooms are on the small side an extension of a classroom has been approved, together with a staff room and a library-medical room.  This scheme is at sketch scheme planning stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not consider this a priority case as there are sufficient classrooms for the school.  However, when the sketch <Col N="2083" /> scheme is completed a decision will be taken on the way forward, bearing in mind the demands on available capital together with the numbers of other projects on hands.  The chairman of the board of management will then be consulted and given advice on the necessary steps by my Department.</P>
    <P>This is down the priority list.  A number of schools in Kerry have been improved in recent years.  I take the point the Deputy makes and will look at the matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the serious situation in relation to the condition of Adare girls' national school in County Limerick.  Adare is known nationally as a beautiful village but the conditions under which the teachers and pupils have to operate in Adare can only be described as primitive.  The school was founded in 1850.  There are four classrooms and a spare room.  The spare room is used by the remedial teacher and also as a staff room.</P>
      <P>The rooms are small and there is a high noise level due to the type of partitions and the structure.  There is no fire exit in the school and any fire chief would consider its condition totally unsatisfactory and a fire hazard.  The outside toilets are primitive, have a galvanised roof and the toilets do not flush on occasions.  Those unsatisfactory conditions have attracted rats.</P>
      <P>There is serious overcrowding in the classrooms.  I raised this issue with the Minister on 4 December last.  The cost of the extension and reconstruction has been estimated at £100,000.  A dynamic parents committee raised school contributions over 15 per cent of the estimated cost.  Planning permission has been approved and the Office of Public Works and the Department of Education have approved the project.  It was anticipated that the project would go to tender last year, but this did not materialise.  The pupils and the parents anxiously await the Minister's approval for this project to go to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust the Minister will recognise the <Col N="2084" /> primitive school that exists in Ireland's prettiest village, take appropriate action and approve this project for tender.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point the Deputy made in regard to Adare.  It is a priority case and is ready to go to tender.  The Deputy will be aware that discussions with the Department of Finance in regard to next year's budget have just been completed with the announcement of the Estimates today.  I have not yet had the opportunity of examining the allocation for primary school buildings next year.  Bearing in mind that there are a number of school projects at a similar stage to the Adare project, that there are a number of school boards of management vying for the limited amount of resources which will be available next year and that each board of management makes the case that their school is deserving of special consideration, the onus falls on me to ensure that each case receives due consideration.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every consideration will be given to allowing the Adare girls' primary school to go to tender next year, if at all possible.  I accept the very fair case the Deputy has continually made in respect of this school and the need to provide permanent walled divisions between classrooms, as well as modern facilities and adequate fire safety standards in keeping with the stringent legislation laid down by the authorities for the safety of pupils in national schools.  I accept the urgency of this case and I assure the Deputy that I will do everything possible to get the job out to tender in the coming year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to highlight a problem of grave concern to parents, teachers and pupils in regard to the national school at Kinvara.  The Sisters of Mercy first came to Kinvara in 1879 and set up a girls' school.  In 1904 it was re-roofed and in 1970 the then boys' school in Kinvara was amalgamated with the girls' school on this site.  One prefab building was purchased then and a second about seven years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> Unfortunately the latter was secondhand, in very bad condition and there are very serious problems with it now.  The school has 180 pupils and six teachers.  A campaign has been going on since 1987 to have an extension built and refurbishment of the old building carried out.</P>
    <P>I visited the school recently at the request of the parents and was shocked by what I saw.  The roofs of the prefabs leak very badly on wet days.  Water running down the walls makes it too dangerous to use light switches.  There are holes in the floor large enough for a child to fall into.  Children of both sexes are using the same toilets.</P>
    <P>The parents consider the condition of the school to be a serious health hazard. Planning permission for the refurbishment and extension has been sought and received by the manager.  Even the children have written to the Minister requesting that the work proceed.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter on 3 December and was told that the question of the invitation of tenders would be considered in the context of the 1992 budgetary situation.  The Minister went on to say that he was not in a position to say when building work would commence.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister of State, who represents the same constituency, if he will use his influence to ensure that tender documents are accepted and provision is made for this school in the 1992 budget.  The Minister of State availed of an opportunity in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> last week to respond to my invitation to outline what he was doing in regard to this school.  However, in that very good contribution he forgot to say what he has been doing since 1987. He suddenly got very interested in the matter when I raised it in the Dáil.  I welcome his response and ask him to state when building works will commence.</P>

      <P>It states that the question of providing a new school or an extension was discussed by the school authorities, the Office of Public Works and the Department.  No firm decision or action was taken.  That was the position from 1983 to 1987.  From 1987 to 1990 nobody from Kinvara approached me even though I am the TD for the area and live eight miles down the road.  I was approached by the principal of the school in March 1990 to have the project reactivated. We had to start from the beginning. The Department's architectural staff visited the school in April 1990.  We concluded the planning in April 1991 and sent the sketch plans to the parish priest <Col N="2088" /> for planning permission.  We received planning permission in August, 1991.  At present we are in the process of preparing the working drawings for the school.  This is probably the fastest development in relation to any school in the country in view of the fact that the parents and board of management did not come to me until March 1990.</P>
      <P>The present position is that Kinvara is near the bottom of the list.  This is not due to any fault of mine; it is due to inaction by the parents and the board of management.  It is my hope &mdash; this is all I can say &mdash; that at some stage during 1991 we will be able to allow this school to go to tender and to proceed with the construction of this project at some stage during 1993.  The reason for this is that there are five schools in Galway ahead of Kinvara in planning.  I ask Deputy McCormack to accept that we have carried out major improvements in 19 schools in County Galway over the past four years.</P>

      <P>On 27 November 1991 a <Col N="2089" /> circular was issued from the headquarters of the Southern Command FCA's Sars-field Barracks, Limerick to the OC of each unit in the Southern Command FCA to implement a 25 per cent reduction in the Permanent Defence Force cadre. Unit commanders were advised to immediately initiate the selection process as it was envisaged that the reduction should take place before 1 January 1992. Unit commanders were asked to have their recommendations ready by 13 December.</P>
      <P>I understand that this circular was later put on hold.  However, it now seems that it will be implemented as originally planned. This will mean the number of Permanent Defence Force personnel attached to the FCA in County Kerry will be reduced by nine.  These individuals will probably have to return to Limerick or Cork barracks.  It will lead to major upheavals for their families who will suffer not only a loss of income but major family disruption.  The net effect will be a further reduction in the effectiveness of the FCA in County Kerry.  It will also affect the morale of the force, the quality of the training, the organisation of manoeuvres and so on.  The presence of fewer professionals will lead to a decrease in standards.</P>
      <P>This reduction in the Permanent Defence Force cadre has given rise to a fear among the FCA that it is Government policy to disband the FCA.  This would be a tragedy not only from the point of view of Defence but would be a further blow to rural Ireland.  Rather than weakening the Permanent Defence Force and the FCA in County Kerry the Minister should be strengthening the Defence Forces presence in the county for a number of reasons.  Tralee Barracks should also be utilised more by the Defence Forces particularly as a training centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it gives me the opportunity to outline the actual position in regard to this circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no proposals to reduce the <Col N="2090" /> rates of allowance payable to members of the Permanent Defence Force assigned on a full-time basis to FCA units.  As the Minister explained to this House in the Adjournment Debate on Thursday last, 12 December, the report of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces highlighted the need for an extensive examination of the present deployment of the Defence Forces and, in this context, the rationalisation of FCA units is being considered.</P>
    <P>There are over 900 members of the Permanent Defence Force assigned to the FCA on a full-time basis where they are employed on administrative and training duties.  The cost of their pay and allowances amounts to some £16 million per annum.  The military authorities have in recent months carried out an examination of how the training and administration of the FCA might be performed on a more cost-effective basis, resulting in more involvement by FCA members in the running of the organisation.</P>
    <P>While I can understand that the Permanent Defence Forces personnel assigned to the FCA might be concerned at these developments, I would again point out that there will be no loss of employment for any of them.  I would also like to take this opportunity to assure the House that full consideration will be given to the domestic or other difficulties raised by Deputy Deenihan that may arise for individual members of the Permanent Defence Forces by being transferred from their existing locations. Personnel who may be transferred to fill other appointments in the Permanent Defence Forces will, of course, be eligible to receive removal expenses in accordance with Defence Forces regulations.</P>
    <P>The cost of the pay and allowances of the Permanent Defence Forces personnel assigned to the FCA is substantial and, in these times of budgetary constraints, it is particularly important to ensure that the most efficient use is made of the resources that are available.  While most of the administrative duties will continue to be carried out by Permanent Defence <Col N="2091" /> Forces personnel, there will be greater emphasis in the future on the role of FCA personnel in the running of the organisation. In this regard I am satisfied that the members of the FCA will be equal to the task and that the training and administration of the organisation will continue to be performed to the standards necessary for the force to discharge their role.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the necessity to maintain <Col N="2092" /> and improve An Forsa Cosanta áitiúil as a viable component of the Defence Forces and I am concerned that the resources available to us should be utilised to the most beneficial effect for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 December 1991.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received the report produced by the IFA, which claims that middlemen in the pork and bacon business have been taking excessive profits at the expense of farmers and consumers; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the report claims that prices paid to farmers are back down to the level of ten years ago, although the price of some pigmeat products in the shops has doubled in the same period; if he will take any actions as a result of this report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>A copy of the report referred to has been received by me.</P>
      <P>The position is that there is no price control in operation in the pigmeat sector.  However I understand that the IFA have met the Director of Consumer Affairs and that he is considering the report.</P>
      <P>There is also provision under the recently introduced Competition Act, 1991 for the IFA, if they feel aggrieved, to take action against any party engaged in anti-competitive practices, e.g. price fixing or cartel arrangements, prohibited by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Producer prices in Ireland were somewhat depressed between June and August this year but since then have started to recover and are now higher than those obtaining this time last year. Having regard to the latest EC forecast which estimates that pig supplies within the Community will fall by nearly 5 per cent in the period up to July 1992, it is expected that producer prices both here and in the rest of the EC will be maintained during this period above earlier levels.  This improving situation, <Col N="1767" /> combined with existing favourable feed costs, should restore producer confidence and ensure that the current expansion in the national pig herd will continue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 30, 34, 35, 36, 42, 43, 45, 46, 50, 51, 52, 56, 57, 58, 61, 66, 67, 123 and 124 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated to this House on 13 November in response to a question from Deputy Hilliard, and as I also indicated on Friday last here, a major effort is underway to conclude the Uruguay Round negotiations by the end of this year or early next year.  The Director General of the GATT, Mr. Dunkel, has announced that he will produce a Draft Final Act covering all areas including <Col N="1772" /> agriculture on 20 December.  His aim will be to reach an overall agreement based on these texts as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>The agriculture negotiations have been dominated by the differences in the negotiating approaches of the EC and US.  The House will recall that the Community's agriculture offer agreed by Ministers in November of last year provides for a 30 per cent reduction in overall support over ten years from 1986, based on an aggregate measurement of support together with subsidiary commitments on border measures and on export supports.  The US, which is in a position largely shared by the Cairns Group, has been seeking a 75 per cent cut in support and protection for agriculture over ten years with a 90 per cent in export subsidies.</P>
    <P>Following high level contacts between the EC and the US in the Hague in early November, both sides have been meeting regularly to seek to resolve outstanding differences.  While some progress has been made, major political issues remain unresolved.  The extent and effect of any concessions that the Community might make will depend on how these remaining differences are resolved.  Any agreement would of course also have to meet the requirements of the other parties in the GATT.</P>
    <P>The GATT negotiations have now entered a very crucial stage.  My aim during the coming weeks will be to ensure the Community's global approach is maintained and that whatever commitments are entered into in the areas of internal support, market protection and export competition are internally coherent and fit into this approach.  This is essential to the maintenance of an effective and operational Common Agricultural Policy.  It follows that I would have major difficulties with any restrictions on export subsidies which are not coherent with the support mechanisms generally or with import arrangements which did not provide for adequate Community preference.  These are obviously critical points for Ireland.  It is also essential that credit is obtained for past reform <Col N="1773" /> measures and that whatever arrangements are agreed for agriculture must also be accepted as compatible with GATT rules.  In other words, any agreement must in practice recognise the legitimacy of the Community's support system.</P>
    <P>The scope of the measures to be disciplined has yet to be resolved.  The Community's approach is that the compensatory payments such as those proposed under the Common Agricultural Policy reform as well as the disadvantaged areas payments and other socio-structural measures should not be subject to discipline under GATT.  It should be possible to develop appropriate criteria to ensure that payments related to production control and protection of the environment as well as under regional assistance programmes can be exempted from reduction commitments.</P>
    <P>It has been evident since the GATT negotiations commenced that the outcome would result in reduced support and protection levels for agriculture in the Community and in the other participating countries.  Ireland's priorities in the negotiations have always been to ensure that whatever commitments are entered into will not prevent the Community from continuing to operate support measures to the benefit of the Irish agricultural and food sector and the wider economy.  We also have sought to ensure that the more stable trading conditions and trade opportunities which will flow from a satisfactory GATT outcome will be at least as beneficial to the Irish agriculture and food sector as to that in any other country.</P>
    <P>When the Community's GATT offer was being finalised in November 1990 we secured firm agreement that account would be taken of the particularly difficult situation of certain categories of producers and regions and that the total level of assistance to the less favoured regions should not be reduced as a result of the implementation of the outcome of the GATT negotiations.  The House can be assured that I will be pursuing those issues with the utmost vigour.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of (1) the investigation his Department have conducted to determine the loss of jobs in the Irish food industry if the proposed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy goes ahead; (2) the cost to the economy of these jobs losses and (3) the action he proposes to take both at home and abroad to alleviate these effects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Analysis of Common Agricultural Policy reform carried out within my Department indicates that, if the current Commission proposals were to be adopted unchanged, decreases in output at farm level could be of the order of 2 per cent for cattle, 3 per cent for milk and 8 per cent for the cereals sector.  This could lead to a reduction of up to 10 per cent in the farm income level in one full year post-reform.  The establishment of a direct relationship between these changes and employment in the food sector is highly problematic.  In any event in the course of negotiations on these reforms I will seek to obtain full redress for any <Col N="1775" /> negative effect on output, income and jobs.</P>
      <P>Furthermore I intend to prepare and put into effect an integrated programme for the development of the agri-food sector once the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the current GATT negotiations are completed.  It is my intention that this programme will address, among other things, the development of value-added in the industry backed up by a vigorous marketing strategy to achieve a consumer oriented food sector which will make the most of Ireland's natural advantages.</P>

      <P>Each year there is a scheme for the supply of intervention beef to the most deprived persons in the Community.</P>
      <P>In respect of the 1991 allocation the question of distributing canned beef instead of raw beef has been discussed by my Department with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Department of Social Welfare.  This matter is being actively pursued and preparations are being made for the issue of a tender notice.  Until the result of the tenders indicating the cost of processing and canning the beef come to hand it will not be possible to indicate if the range of recipients, which has been the subject of a number of parliamentary questions in the past, could be widened.</P>
      <P>Quantities of intervention butter are also made available annually to charitable institutions and hostels providing meals for the homeless.  No change is envisaged in this arrangement.</P>

      <P>Under the Community regulations, the allocation of milk quotas to producers who participated in the non-marketing schemes, is confined to those producers whose non-marketing period expired after 31 December 1982 and who fulfil certain other criteria laid down in the regulations.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are a number of producers whose non-marketing period expired during 1982 and are therefore excluded.  My predecessor, Minister O'Kennedy, raised this difficulty on a number of occasions during the negotiations in the EC Council of Agricultural Ministers but the Commission were adamant that as the court judgments, which gave rise to these measures, specifically referred to the eligible producers as those whose non-marketing period expired during the reference year 1983, other producers whose non-marketing period expired before 1 January 1983 were ineligible.</P>

      <P>Under the Community regulations on the quota system, the rate of super-levy to be charged on deliveries of milk in excess of the national quota after the completion of the distribution of all available flexi-milk, is 115 per cent of the <Col N="1779" /> target price for milk which is currently equivalent to £1.27 per gallon.  This penalty is fixed at a level well above the price paid to producers by creameries, in order to act as a disincentive for excess milk production.</P>
      <P>The present penalty was decided by the EC Council of Ministers only in 1989 and in present circumstances there is little prospect of its early adjustment.  I am, however, keeping the situation under review and if circumstances change, will seek to have an adjustment made.</P>

    <P>There is considerable pressure on cold storage capacity in Ireland due to the high level of intake of butter and beef <Col N="1780" /> into intervention.  This necessitated exceptional measures such as the use of cold stores in Holland, where Irish intervention butter is already stored and to which 10,000 tonnes of Irish beef stocks are at present being transferred.</P>
    <P>Since mid-year the Community dairy markets have improved significantly due to a combination of factors, notably reduced milk production and increased disposal opportunities.  Butter and skim milk powder are at present trading above the intervention buying-in levels.  The market outlook for the remainder of the year and into early 1992 continues to be positive.</P>
    <P>Beef prices, although fragile, are holding up at present levels because of the support being provided on the market by intervention buying-in.  Unfortunately, reliance on intervention remains high because of the decline of export opportunities on international markets.</P>
    <P>The intervention system has been made more effective in keeping beef prices steady as a result of beneficial changes made in processors margins, which were negotiated at EC level last August.  Price levels have been maintained over recent weeks and I am hopeful now that the peak slaughtering season is over, there will be an upward movement in prices.</P>

      <P>On 18 July last I announced a special licensing scheme providing for the entry of about 20 large all-weather boats into the Irish fleet to facilitate the catching of our underutilised whitefish quotas off the south and south-west coasts.  A total of 50 applications was received by the closing date of 1 October 1991.</P>
      <P>The number of applications from the ports listed was as follows: (a) Howth, Nil; (b) Killybegs, 11; (c) Galway, Nil; (d) Dingle, 8; (e) Castletownbere, 5; (f) Dunmore East, Nil.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that there has been no delay in either the processing of applications or the issue of licences.  The position is that, arising from the initial examination of applications, it was considered necessary to seek additional detailed information from all applicants.  The deadline for receipt of this information was 25 November 1991. Applications have now been assessed in the light of all data received and I would expect to be in a position to make an announcement very shortly.</P>

Consequently, applicants for sea fishing boat licences are generally required to demonstrate that they are in a position to withdraw 100 per cent active tonnage and horsepower from the current sea fishing boat register to permit the entry of replacement boats to the fleet.</P>

      <P>As Minister with overall responsibility for safety of life at sea, I have for some time been anxious to have legislation enacted which would enhance the regulation of the safety of passenger vessels plying our waters.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered by my Department, apply to vessels which carry more than 12 passengers to sea or on rivers, canals, lakes or estuaries.  Such vessels are required to hold a valid passenger certificate and are subject to annual surveys conducted by the marine surveyors of the Department.</P>
      <P>Vessels which carry 12 passengers or fewer for hire or reward are outside the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts but may be licensed by local authorities under the Public Health Acts.  However, the token level of fines under these Acts and the absence of any statutory safety requirements in respect of such vessels has resulted in the legislation being less than effective.</P>
      <P>For some time, therefore, I have been anxious to update the legislation on vessel safety so as to reflect modern realities.  The Merchant Shipping Bill, 1991 which was circulated to Deputies on 3 December 1991 will: bring vessels carrying 12 or fewer passengers for reward, passenger boats, within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts for the first time.  Following inspection of a vessel for suitability for use as a passenger boat and for compliance with safety regulations, if any, made by the Minister for the Marine, a licence may be granted for a period of up to two years; update the level of penalties in the existing legislation for all passenger vessels; and give the Minister for the Marine powers to make regulations governing the safety of fishing vessels, pleasure craft and other craft and their crews and occupants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in the process of setting up safety working groups to review safety procedures and standards on Irish vessels in the fishing vessel, pleasure craft, small <Col N="1789" /> ferry and other sectors and to advise me on measures that might be taken to improve safety, both under regulations and through non-statutory means.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the key question to be answered in deciding the issue was whether the relationship between the company and its agents was an employer-employee one or whether the agents acted as self-employed individuals providing a service for the employer.  The Revenue Commissioners decided on the basis of the terms of the agreement between the company and the agents that the latter applied and that the contract was that of a contract for service.  The factors which influenced the decision were: the level of supervision and control by the company over the agents did not correspond with the existence of an employer-employee relationship; the method of payment and treatment of expenses suggested that the agents were self-employed; the company had no sanction against the agents apart from termination of the agreement which was available to both parties; the usual employee rights were absent i.e. pension, holidays, sick pay etc.; and the agents were not restricted to doing business with the company.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to certain warranties and indemnities given in connection with the flotation of Greencore plc.</P>
      <P>At the time of and in order to facilitate the flotation of Greencore plc., an agreement was entered into between the Minister for Finance (as the then owner of all the issued shares in that company and in its predecessor company, Irish Sugar) and Greencore and its directors whereby certain warranties and indemnities were given by the Minister to Greencore and by Greencore to the Minister and the directors.  In essence the effect of that agreement, dated 9 April 1991, was that certain legal obligations, responsibilities and liabilities to the underwriters of the flotation and to prospective investors in Greencore would be shared between Greencore and the Minister in the proportions in which the funds raised by the share offer were received by them respectively.  The responsibility, obligations and liabilities covered by such agreement essentially relate to assurances that the flotation in the manner proposed was within the legal powers and authorities of the Minister and of Greencore and its directors and that the terms of the listing particulars or prospectus on the basis of which the shares were being sold was in compliance with legal and stock exchange regulations.</P>
      <P>Such agreements are a common feature of flotations on the Stock Exchange. If the Minister and Greencore had not been prepared to give indemnities and warranties, the flotation of Greencore could not have proceeded.</P>

    <P>There is no question of the Minister having any actual liability under that agreement in the absence of its being established in court that the Minister was in breach of the agreement or that the facts were otherwise than as warranted. In the event that such a claim was successfully established in the courts the amount of the liability would have to be <Col N="1801" /> determined by the court having regard to the actual facts of the case and the extent, if any, of the attributable loss of the plaintiff in any such action.

    <P>Fringe benefits to a great extent already come within the charge to tax. The market value of benefits not subject to tax could not be determined from tax records without undue expenditure of staff resources in compiling the figures.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, it is not possible to quantify the yield to the Exchequer which would arise from the taxation of income from other sources which does not come within the purview of the Revenue Commissioners.  However, certain incomes which either are not taxable or are only partially taxable, such as: income of approved superannuation funds; certain earnings of writers, composers and artists; interest on savings certificates, national instalment-savings and index linked savings bonds; income of charities, etc.; income from Irish Government securities where the owner is not ordinarily resident in Ireland; statutory redundancy payments; payments made in compensation for loss of office, and dividend income derived from profits which qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax; would, if taxed on the same basis as other earned income, produce a yield to the Exchequer which is tentatively estimated to be of the order of £250 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce an allowance as proposed by the Deputy.  Apart from <Col N="1805" /> tax policy and potential cost considerations, the Revenue Commissioners are of the view that the giving of such an allowance would not greatly enhance their ability to deal with evasion by landlords, particularly taking into account the level of revenue resources which would have to be committed to operate it.</P>
      <P>However, the commissioners recognise the potential for evasion that exists in this sector and are already operating an extensive programme to tackle such evasion.  A register of known landlords is maintained by Revenue and this is supplemented by details of multiple habitation obtained from the local authorities as well as the register of electors.  The commissioners also have wide powers to obtain details of landlords from both tenants and letting agents.  Finally, information is received from members of the public in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 154 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, extensive consultations have taken place at official and diplomatic levels with the Libyan authorities.  In September 1990, my predecessor visited Libya with officials following which a Libyan delegation visited Ireland in late November 1990.  While they indicated that they would make a <Col N="1814" /> favourable report to their authorities regarding the health status of cattle and beef in Ireland and there have been a series of contacts with the authorities since then, Libya has not yet moved to resume imports of live animals from Ireland.  This is partly because of local Libyan difficulties in the animal health area.  However, contacts between the Irish and Libyan authorities are continuing and I am hopeful that as a result the live cattle trade will resume shortly, and in time return at least to pre-1990 export levels of 30,000 cattle per annum.</P>

      <P>As I have no direct responsibility in regard to the keeping of animals in zoos and wildlife parks, I have no plans to bring in specific legislation governing the welfare of such animals.</P>
      <P>I am, however, aware that the EC Commission have produced draft proposals for a directive on the keeping of animals in zoos.  The preparation of appropriate national legislation to give effect to that proposal will depend on the outcome of discussions at EC level.</P>

      <P>In order to be considered for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas &mdash; less severely handicapped scheme &mdash; an area must be homogenous and meet all five of the following criteria: 1, less than 7.8 per cent ploughed land; 2, less than one livestock unit per forage hectare; 3, less than 80 per cent of the national average family farm income per male farm worker; 4, population density less than 27 per square kilometre, and 5, more than 30 per cent of the working population engaged in farming.</P>
      <P>The criteria, which were laid down by the EC Commission, were used in the recent extension and will remain unchanged when determining the areas under appeal.</P>
      <P>The criteria used for the more severely handicapped areas were the same except in the case of 3 and 5 where the percentages were 40 per cent and 40 per cent respectively.  In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, my Department are at present reviewing both of these criteria to enable the case of marginal areas under appeal to be considered in association with the appeals panel.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the report by the Fair Trade Commission of their review of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.  The report was published on 13 December 1991.</P>
      <P>The majority review of the commission was that the groceries order should be revoked as the main provisions of the order would be superseded by the Competition Act, and that the ban on below-cost selling under the order constitutes a serious interference in the market place and should, therefore, be revoked.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Competition Act has only recently come into force and in order to give interested parties an opportunity to study the report I have decided to keep the question of retention of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 under review for the moment.</P>

      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland are unable to obtain a ruling under the Competition Act, 1991 regarding the alleged abuse of a dominant position by the ESB, due to the lack of adequate information about the extent to which the ESB's consulting subsidiary is truly operating at arm's length; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland have been in touch with the Director of Consumer Affairs about this matter.  Under the Competition Act, 1991 the director no longer has responsibility for investigating issues relating to fair trade.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Competition Act, 1991 prohibits the abuse of a dominant position in trade for any goods or services. Section 6 provides a right of action in the courts for any person aggrieved by such abuse.  It is for the courts to decide on actions taken under section 6 of the Act.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the Minister for Energy's reply of 16 October 1991 to a question on this matter.</P>

      <P>The persons concerned are husband and wife.  In the case of the wife, her application for old age non-contributory pension was rejected in September 1991 as both her own and her husband's means had not been disclosed satisfactorily.  My Department have no record of an appeal by her against this decision.</P>
      <P>In the case of the husband, his pension was suspended in October 1991 pending clarification of his means situation.  My Department are awaiting additional information from him on his capital and income position.  As soon as he provides this information, his entitlement to old age non-contributory pension will be determined.  His wife's entitlement to pension will be re-assessed also on the basis of that information.  It may be in the interests of the persons concerned to provide the necessary information to my Department as soon as possible so that a decision can be made on their case.</P>

The employee however, has since confirmed that he has not received his share of the refund.</P>
      <P>It is understood that a receiver was appointed to the company involved on 12 November and my Department are investigating the matter with a view to establishing whether there is any possibility of obtaining a refund of the employee's portion of PRSI for the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department was extended in 1990 with the introduction of the companion pass which enabled a companion to travel free with a recipient of disabled person's maintenance allowance.  That extension was of major benefit to people in that situation and some 12,000 handicapped persons have availed of the new pass.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the arrangements were further extended to allow recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance to retain their entitlement to free travel when they entered residential care.  By virtue of retaining their free travel pass, they also can avail of the companion pass.</P>
      <P>The question of providing similar arrangements for those who entered residential care prior to 1991 and for those under 16 years of age when admitted to residential care is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislative provisions governing means are contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 and in regulations.  The following are the main areas under which means are assessed: cash income; the yearly value of property owned but not personally used or enjoyed, such as capital or house property or land not personally used by the <Col N="1848" /> applicant; the yearly value of property used or enjoyed, such as a farm of business; the value of income or property of which the person has deprived him/herself in order to qualify for pension or assistance or payment at a higher rate and in the case of unemployment assistance, single woman's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance the value of free board and lodgings enjoyed by the applicant.</P>
    <P>The current short term assistance rate is £50 and the long term assistance rate is £55.  Single people with weekly means below these rates will qualify for payment provided they meet the general eligibility conditions.</P>
    <P>While the means assessment criteria are broadly similar for all schemes there are nevertheless variations in the manner in which some of the components, principally capital and income from earnings are assessed.  There are also different levels of disregards of means under the schemes.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the legislation, the spouse of a social welfare claimant cannot be regarded as an adult dependant of the claimant where he or she is either in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right or has weekly earnings <Col N="1851" /> from employment or self-employment in excess of a specified limit, currently £55 per week.  Where a spouse has earnings, they must be taken into account in assessing the means of a claimant of unemployment assistance.  If one spouse participates in a social employment scheme (SES), a portion of the SES earnings must be assessed against the other spouse's unemployment payment.</P>
    <P>To treat earnings from a social employment scheme differently from earnings from other sources in assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes would raise questions of equity.  I am, however, conscious of the need to facilitate and encourage participation in social employment schemes and I am examining this issue.  Any change in present arrangements would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>She appealed this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office. Her case was recently considered by an appeals officer who determined that she is entitled to an old age non-contributory pension at the rate of £51 per week plus over-80 allowance with effect from 24 August 1990.</P>
      <P>She will be notified of this decision within the next few days.</P>

      <P>Gardaí in the area have been directed to pay particular attention to this problem by way of regular foot and mobile patrols.  In addition, neighbourhood gardaí liaise closely with residents on the problems being encountered.  There are six neighbourhood gardaí assigned on a full-time basis to west Tallaght and two of these are assigned to the Fettercairn area.  The neighbourhood gardaí in the Fettercairn area also maintain contact with the community council operating within the area and visit schools in the locality on a frequent basis.</P>

    <P>There is, of course, a vital role to be played by the community in combating acts of vandalism.  The Garda authorities have informed me that there is scope for the further development of community involvement in crime prevention initiatives such as neighbourhood watch in the area and will give every assistance to any group wishing to participate in such schemes.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the question was discovered to be in the State illegally and, accordingly, was the subject of a deportation order effective from 19 September 1991.  He was detained in custody pending the making of arrangements for his removal from the State.</P>
      <P>On 27 September 1991 the person referred to applied for refugee status. Inquiries concerning his application are continuing and he was most recently interviewed in the company of his legal adviser by an officer of my Department on Thursday last.  A final decision on the matter will be made as soon as possible in the light of the outcome of these inquiries.</P>

    <P>The way in which the question is worded is open to interpretation in such a way as to carry the implication that applicants for refugee status are, as a <Col N="1855" /> general rule, kept in custody pending consideration of their applications.  This, of course, is not so.  In the normal course accommodation for persons seeking political asylum is provided by the Red Cross.  The only reason the person named in the question was detained is that, having been found to have been here illegally, an order for his deportation was made, and he was detained in custody pending its enforcement.</P>

      <P>Applicants for services under the scheme of civil legal aid and advice are subject to a means test.  The structure and operation of the means test under the scheme arises directly from the recommendations of the Pringle Committee in their report on civil legal aid, 1977.</P>
      <P>The committee recommended that a special means test should be applied because of their central recommendation that the legal aid services should not be restricted to applicants who could afford to pay little or nothing for the cost of legal services, but should apply also to people who were better off and who could afford to contribute a reasonable proportion of that cost from their own resources.  For that reason a means test based on disposable rather than gross income was recommended by the committee and the scheme provides accordingly. With effect from 17 January 1991 the income qualification limit for services under the scheme has been increased to £6,200 disposable income per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the grant of criminal legal aid, the position is that this is entirely a matter for the courts under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962.  Legal aid may be granted only if the court is satisfied that the means of the person applying for it are insufficient to enable him to obtain legal aid at his own expense.  The legislation does not prescribe eligibility standards and the review committee on Criminal Legal Aid, in their final report in 1981, recommended against the introduction of an eligibility ceiling or a means test for criminal legal aid, on the grounds that they involve a certain amount of inflexibility <Col N="1857" /> and are not appropriate to a scheme of criminal legal aid.</P>

      <P>By-passes of Donegal town and Ballybofey-Stranorlar have not been included in the tentative list of major improvement projects on national primary roads planned to commence and/or be completed in the period 1989-93 under the operational programme on peripherality and no formal proposals have been received in my Department for these schemes. However, discussions have taken place between officials of the Department and the local authority about these schemes, the timing and construction of which would fall to be considered in the context of the preparation of the next roads programme which will cover the period after 1993.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1991, which govern the licensing of public service vehicles, do not provide for the grant of temporary taxi licences.  Amending regulations, made on 24 October 1991, provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the grant of an additional 100 taxi licences in an extended Dublin taximeter area.  The arrangements for receiving and processing applications and for granting such licences are a matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The regulations made on 24 October 1991 also placed a temporary moratorium on the grant of new hackney (private hire) licences and new taxi licences (other than the 100 in Dublin) pending a report from a review committee which is expected to make recommendations relating to the respective roles of taxis and hackneys.  I have asked the committee to report to me as a matter of urgency and, as soon as the respective roles are clarified, I intend to remove the moratorium on the grant of new licences.</P>

      <P>Appointments to the Post-graduate Medical and Dental Board are made by the Minister for Health pursuant to section 42 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  Before making appointments to the board, the Minister is required, under the above-mentioned Act, to consult with a large number of bodies, to ensure that the appropriate interests and expertise are included in the final composition of the board.  This process was undertaken by my predecessor prior to his making the recent appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, aware that the Programme for Government commits the Government to further progress in the area of equality and also that the interim report of the Commission on the Status of Women has put forward suggestions specifically on the appointment of women <Col N="1871" /> to boards.  However, the degree of discretion which can be exercised in this regard in particular appointments is often, as in the case of the Post-graduate Medical and Dental Board, circumscribed by the consultation or nomination process prescribed in the relevant legislation.  Notwithstanding this constraint, the Deputy can be assured that this is a policy which I wholly endorse and will be guided by in considering appointments to boards.</P>

      <P>The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended in 1987, provide for the levying of charges in the case of persons who are in long term care for a period exceeding a total of 30 days in any period of 12 months. The person in question was an in-patent for a total of 136 days between 13 November 1990 and 12 September 1991 and <Col N="1872" /> is currently in care since 5 November 1991.</P>
      <P>Persons who, while maintaining themselves at home had full eligibility under the Health Act, 1970, may be regarded as not coming within that definition while they are being maintained in long-stay care and may, therefore, be subject to the appropriate long-stay charge.  It is a statutory function of the chief executive officer of each health board to determine entitlement to full eligibility.</P>

    <P>* The figures for 1989, 1990 and 1991 are based on year of registration rather than year of occurrence and are therefore provisional.  The figure for 1991 refers to registrations received up to end of June 1991.</P>
    <P>It is accepted internationally that it is difficult to record the exact number of suicides taking place each year and that some under-recording arises.  However, studies in which the Central Statistics Office have co-operated indicate that, contrary to some media reports, official statistics in Ireland do not substantially understate the actual rate of suicide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 230 and 231 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy, focused on the management and review of waiting lists and general strategies to improve waiting times for treatment.  The group have indicated that the numbers recorded as being on waiting lists may significantly overstate the numbers of patients who are, in fact, awaiting treatment in the absence of regular validation to remove the names of patients who have been treated elsewhere, moved away or no longer require treatment.</P>
      <P>I am determined to tackle the most pressing problems in this area.  As a first step I intend to ensure that accurate, meaningful and readily accessible information is maintained by all agencies.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in the Dáil last week, the Kennedy group, in their recently published report, recommended that a number of important steps should be taken as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;comprehensive, standardised information should be maintained and reviewed by each hospital concerning the numbers and types of patients awaiting admission;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;validation to establish meaningful waiting list data should be adopted <Col N="1876" /> as a firm policy in each hospital and that such policies ensure that appropriate management and clinical action is taken on foot of such reviews;</P>
    <P>&mdash;hospitals should carry out bulk postal reviews of waiting lists where patients have been on waiting lists for more than an agreed period of time;</P>
    <P>&mdash;hospitals should target waiting lists by ensuring that explicit account is taken of waiting times in scheduling admissions, including theatre lists, and that speciality teams have reasonable activity targets to guide their attempts to minimise waiting by patients.</P>
    <P>The group have recently been re-convened and part of their new remit is to pursue the implementation of the recommendations in relation to waiting lists in the Dublin hospitals.  In addition, health boards and hospitals authorities in the area outside of Dublin have been asked by my Department to consider the good practice recommendations contained in the report and to report back to my Department on their plans for the implementation of the recommendations, including those in relation to waiting lists.</P>
    <P>My priority at this stage is to ensure that the validation process as outlined in the report of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group is implemented on an on-going basis in all hospitals and I will be pursuing this vigorously with all the agencies concerned. I will be in touch with the Deputy as soon as progress has been made by the agencies on the validation process.</P>
    <P>In the absence of comprehensive and reliable data, it is not possible to estimate accurately the cost of eliminating all public waiting lists.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question refers to the effect of an increase of 25 per cent in the income guidelines which are used in the assessment of medical card eligibility.</P>
      <P>There is no available income distribution data which would be sufficiently comprehensive and detailed to enable an estimate to be made of the number of additional people who would come within the income guidelines if they were increased by 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>In any case, it must be appreciated that the income guidelines, while used in the assessment process, have no statutory basis and are not the essential criterion for determining full eligibility, i.e., entitlement to a medical card.  The legislation provides that full eligibility shall be awarded to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  In practice the chief executive officers assume that all persons with income below the guidelines meet this criterion, so that further assessment of the medical and other circumstances of an applicant is necessary only where his or her income exceeds the guidelines.  A person whose income exceeds the guidelines but who is found to satisfy the statutory criterion is awarded the medical card.</P>

      <P>The percentage participation of 16 year olds in full-time education has increased from 82 per cent in 1985-86 to over 90 per cent in 1989-90 and it is anticipated that it will continue to increase.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the additional cost to the Exchequer of a formal raising to the school leaving age is difficult to estimate and will depend on the extent to which participation rates continue, in any event, to improve irrespective of the legal school leaving age.</P>

      <P>With regard to (1) the schemes under the aegis of my Department are as follows: the higher education grants scheme; and the vocational education committees (VECs) scholarship scheme; (2) for a candidate to be eligible for the award of a higher education grant, the &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; of the candidate and of the candidates' parents or guardians must be within the income limits set out in the relevant scheme.  For the purpose of the scheme &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; means gross income from all sources, less any sum paid by way of contribution to a superannuation fund, and excluding also children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts, holiday earnings of the candidate and payments <Col N="1891" /> under the family income supplement scheme; (3) the level of income above which an applicant is deemed ineligible for a grant is a function of the number of dependent children in the family.  For example an applicant for a grant in 1991-92 who comes from a family with three dependent children will qualify for a full maintenance grant if the family income does not exceed £11,595 per annum.</P>

      <P>A means test is included in the scheme of special allowances for veterans of the <Col N="1903" /> War of Independence and allowances for spouses of deceased holders of the Service (1917-1921) Medal.</P>
      <P>A special allowance is an annual sum of such amount as when added to the applicant's yearly means will not equal or exceed a prescribed sum.  The current prescribed sums range from £1,694 to £1,737 a year depending on marital status and age of spouse.</P>
      <P>Yearly means in this context include the means of the applicant's spouse.  The value of assessable means is based on reports furnished by social welfare officers.</P>
      <P>The means test for these allowances has been relaxed progressively over the years and is now far from severe.  Social welfare benefits are largely disregarded or only partially assessed as means.</P>
      <P>Awards of special allowances are made for a period of four years.  During that period, the allowance is not reviewed by my Department regardless of any improvement in the applicant's means. However, the allowance holder is entitled to seek a revision of his allowance at any time during the currency of the award if his means have worsened, in which event his case would again be investigated by a social welfare officer.</P>
      <P>A minimum figure of £185 per annum was determined in 1980 for persons who qualify on means for a special allowance. The current rate is £636.  This is also the rate paid to spouses of deceased medal holders.</P>
