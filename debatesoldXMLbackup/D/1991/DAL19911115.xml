      <P>The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 is to provide for expenditure under new subheads on Ireland's participation at Expo '92 in Spain, and on services related to the transfer of functions of the Air Navigation Services Office from my Department to a semi-State body.</P>
      <P>Today's Supplementary Estimate will facilitate Ireland's preparations for Expo '92.  Participation at the &ldquo;Universal Exposition of Seville 1992&rdquo; will cost up to £4 million and this Supplementary provides for expenditure in the current financial year of £1.25 million, which will come from the national lottery.</P>
      <P>Expo '92 is a major cultural event.  It is billed as the last and biggest world exposition of the 20th century.  It is classed as a universal exposition, the highest category within the hierarchy of international exhibitions.  There have been only seven such exhibitions this century, the last one in Europe being as far back as 1958 in Brussels.  The event will run from 20 April to 12 October of next year. More than 100 countries are participating, including all 12 members of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nineteen ninety-two marks the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to America and provides Expo with its main theme &ldquo;The Age of Discovery&rdquo;.  The <Col N="1799" /> event is to be a celebration of cultural and scientific discovery from the 15th century to date.  The organisers are expecting more than 18 million visitors.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot afford to pass up the opportunity of a national presence.  It will be a universal showcase of 20th century technological, cultural and artistic capability and achievement.  It offers Ireland a unique opportunity to reinforce the very positive world image we have been so carefully building up over the years.  The objective of being there is to present in a prestigious international forum all that is best about our country, our culture, our heritage and our products and to explain why Ireland is an ideal location for foreign investment.  It will be a chance to show off developments in technology, agriculture and the arts and to demonstrate the skills and education of the Irish workforce.</P>
    <P>The total cost of our involvement in Expo will be in the region of £4 million. The project is being managed by a steering group comprising representatives of my Department, Bord Fáilte, the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs, the Office of Public Works and An Bord Tráchtála.  The steering group have already appointed a full-time director for the project on a consultancy basis to manage operations on site in Seville.  His contract will run for a period of 18 months and he will be reporting to the steering group.  The major expenditure item will be £2.7 million on the design, construction and fitting out of the Irish pavilion.  Other major costs will be to staff the pavilion and the organisation and staging of some 40 planned cultural events.</P>
    <P>The steering group are at present actively pursuing a sponsorship programme under which commercial sponsors will also have the opportunity to participate.  The exposition offers exciting opportunities for sponsors, especially Irish companies, who already have a European or international presence or companies needing to establish such a presence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> Visitors to the Irish pavilion will be taken through developments in Irish history and culture from before the era of the &ldquo;Island of Saints and Scholars&rdquo; right through to the present day.  They will see exhibits based on the best of Irish industry, Irish technology, Irish agriculture and finally &mdash; Irish people &mdash; both the friendly face of our people and our highly educated, highly skilled workforce.</P>
    <P>Work on the 7,000 sq. foot architecturally unique Irish pavilion is already well advanced.  It is strategically located on site, on Avenue of Europe, and will be highly visible from the Expo monorail which passes close by.  Virtually all aspects of the pavilion will be Irish made, from the design through the construction to the final fit-out.</P>
    <P>Ireland's image as an attractive, highquality holiday destination will be strongly featured in Seville.  The very design of the pavilion will embody some of the key elements of our unique appeal for tourists evoking a clean, green island landscape and coastline on the very edge of Europe.  It is estimated that over half a million visitors will visit the Irish pavilion during the six months of Expo '92 &mdash; in other words, half a million potential visitors to Ireland.  They will be exposed to a package of exhibitions, audio visual displays and performances highlighting the allure of Ireland as a holiday destination.</P>
    <P>Visitor numbers from Spain have more than doubled since 1986, showing growth of 135 per cent between 1986 and 1990. Numbers grew last year alone by 42 per cent on 1989.  The Spanish tourist market into Ireland is now worth over £30 million to the Irish economy and is heading for some 60,000 visitors per annum.  Over half the 18 million visitors expected at Expo will be Spanish, giving us an immediate opportunity to further increase penetration of the Spanish market.</P>
    <P>We are still in the throes of a revolution in Irish tourism aimed at developing the full potential of a sector which last year alone earned over £1 billion in foreign revenue, equivalent to almost 7 per cent <Col N="1801" /> of total exports, and which now supports nearly 80,000 jobs in the overall economy. Tourism is our leading internationally-traded service, accounting for 60 per cent of total services exports, contributing more than £400 million, or over 50 per cent, to the surplus on our overall balance of payments and providing one in every three new jobs created in the economy between 1985 and 1990.</P>
    <P>The £300 million package of product development and marketing initiatives currently being implemented under the EC operational programme for tourism has already resulted in approval for eligible investments totalling £160 million, including £80 million in grant aid from the European Regional Development Fund. This investment will be a key factor in maintaining growth in Irish tourism. There has been a downturn this year in demand for international tourism and travel generally because of the Gulf War and recession in some key markets.  We can take some comfort, however, from the latest CSO estimates of this year's tourism performance.  These figures show that while there was an overall drop of 2.7 per cent in visitor numbers for the first nine months of the year, a considerably lower reduction than was expected, revenue actually increased by 8 per cent for the half year to end June.  All the indications are that tourism is recovering from that setback and the industry are already confidently predicting a return to growth n 1992.</P>
    <P>Our participation at Expo '92 will also, of course, provide an opportunity to raise awareness about Ireland as a modern economy and as a member of the European Community.  It will inform visitors to the pavilion that this country is a serious producer of high-tech goods, an attractive investment location and a competitive source of goods.  As well as Bord Fáilte, the IDA and An Bord Tráchtála will be on hand to deal with the inquiries of visitors to the pavilion in a professional manner</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate also makes provision for expenditure involved in estabishing the new Irish Aviation Authority.  A token provision of <Col N="1802" /> £1,000 has been made for 1991.  As my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, announced last July, the Government decided to establish the Irish Aviation Authority.  The Authority will be a commercial semi-State body to operate air traffic services in Irish airspace and regulate aviation safety matters in accordance with well defined international standards.  The Authority will take over the functions and staff of the Department's Air Navigation Services Office, otherwise known as ANSO.</P>
    <P>Whilst ANSO has the necessary sinews to quickly become a semi-State body it cannot be done instantaneously.  In particular, we need to establish the corporate financial base, to negotiate the transition arrangements with staff and to bring to the House the necessary legislation to give statutory effect to the proposals. The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to make provision for the expenditure that will be necessary in connection with the transition arrangements.  I should mention that this expenditure is part of the overall ANSO cost structure and as such will be recovered from the users.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the new Authority will be operational in 1992 and we will be introducing a Bill for the purpose shortly. The House will then have an opportunity to fully debate the matter.  In all, approximately 600 staff will be transferred from the Department to the new body.  The transfer will bring a welcome lightening to the payroll costs for my Department and for the Exchequer.  My hope is that the new Authority will be able to expand employment with worthwhile jobs in a high technology expanding industry.</P>
    <P>The Aviation Authority will ensure that as a State we can readily meet the challenges posed by increased traffic; and tap the worldwide potential currently emerging in training and consultancy work.</P>
    <P>The Authority will inherit from ANSO a pool of proven expertise which, freed <Col N="1803" /> from the constraints of Civil Service procedures, will respond quickly and positively to the changing circumstances and challenges of the industry.</P>
    <P>During the eighties, there was a significant growth in air traffic.  All reliable indicators point to continued long term growth in international air traffic of about 5 per cent per annum which would be equivalent to a doubling of traffic by the year 2005.  Growth of this magnitude presents an enormous challenge to expand the capacity of navigation systems to meet the growth in demand.  It requires investment in manpower, skills and equipment.  I am satisfied that, so far, we have been equal to the challenge. In establishing the authority we will maintain our ability to meet competitively the challenge in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>A £30 million investment programme initiated in the late eighties and due for completion in 1992 helped us to avoid the worst of the European air traffic problems. The staff and equipment we use to control and manage 100,000 sq. miles of airspace are comparable to the best in Europe.  Moreover, our systems can be integrated with those of our European partners to provide what will be eventually a seamless network of air traffic control facilities throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Delays and disruptions in one country have a domino-like effect throughout the air traffic system.  At a European level we must work effectively to resolve our problems.  We in Ireland have been to the forefront in developing the strategies of flow management and the harmonisation of systems which will resolve the problems we have seen.</P>
    <P>ANSO discharges very clearly defined executive functions that already comprise a substantial business.  Given the right conditions, I am satisfied that this is a business which, to coin a phrase, can stand on its own feet and furthermore can be developed to expand on its considerable employment and profit potential. Currently it employs approximately 600 highly skilled personnel in a variety of operational and regulatory roles.  Under <Col N="1804" /> various international conventions the cost of the services provided by ANSO &mdash; which we estimate at £32 million &mdash; can be, and is recovered from the users. The vast majority of the users are foreign airlines which use Irish airspace and airport facilities.  Indeed more than 50 per cent of current ANSO revenues come from aircraft which do not land at all in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The continuing worldwide expansion of aviation combined with the dismantling of socialist controls in the former Eastern European states is creating a major market for the type of skills that ANSO has.  I am satisfied that, re-created as a viable commercial semi-State body, the Authority can tap into that market, where it already has had one or two small successes.  Moreover, it can, as necessary, link up with other bodies such as Aer Rianta and educational establishments to provide tailormade packages for its clients.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Supplementary Estimate provides expenditure which, on the one hand, will assist with the continued growth in Irish tourism and, on the other, will constitute the first step in establishing a new Aviation Authority. Both the issues involved are worthy of support from all sides of the House.  I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak to this supplementary Estimate.  It is amazing the uses to which the funds from the national lottery are being put.  I would have thought that all the Departments involved would have made funds available out of their own Estimates rather than use national lottery funds.  They appear to be a soft touch when we want to further promote the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State has said, the purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide £1.25 million to meet some of the cost of our participation, up to £4 million, at this exhibition to be held in 1992.  It is very welcome that Bord Fáilte, the Industrial Development Authority <Col N="1805" /> and Córas Tráchtála will all be involved together in selling Ireland at this exhibition. If we have learned anything from the past when different Departments sent people to fairs all across the world it is that a positive approach should be adopted and that we should combine their best efforts under the one roof.  We can no longer afford to send abroad five or six different groups from different Departments and boards to sell Ireland under different headings.  This could mark the beginning of something most important in selling Ireland in the future.</P>
    <P>Expo '92 will provide a golden opportunity to sell Ireland as a tourism destination, an industrial base and a country with many fine companies producing products which are known worldwide. Our presence at Expo will be an opportunity to update and improve our image abroad; indeed after the past four months any opportunity to improve that image on an international basis and stage must be very welcome.  The theme, as the Minister said, for this exhibition is discovery. I am delighted that we will have the opportunity to rediscover what we are good at.  Indeed, the publicity we received abroad over the last couple of months will be put behind us and the opportunities here to would-be investors will be improved.  At the end of this important exhibition we will be seen on the international stage as a most important country in relation to tourism and investment, with a highly educated available workforce.</P>
    <P>Expo '92 gives Ireland an opportunity to be associated with 100 other countries to display what we are good at and to sell Ireland as a tourist destination.  Will the Minister say whether any thought has been given to the possibility of over the period of the six months of the exhibition providing young, educated trained people in marketing and giving some of them an opportunity to attend at different times to see and meet people from a possible 100 other countries?  We have the finest young educated marketing people; and I know many who are in college at the moment, some of whom <Col N="1806" /> will be finishing next year.  They would be delighted to have an opportunity to attend such an exhibition and to make the acquaintance of people from other countries.  During this exhibition will the Minister agree it would be of prime importance that some of our excellent companies, who will not be able to afford to get involved in sponsorship about which the Minister has spoken, would be given an opportunity to attend the exhibition at different times?  Special programmes should be arranged for companies like this whose products would certainly make the grade on the world market.  In 1992 we will have an opportunity to do those things.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State represents the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  I ask them, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach to seriously consider putting together an array of good companies, small though some of them may be, who are excellent in the job they do here to show other countries our expertise as a result of our educated, fully trained professional people who are prepared to market Ireland in their chosen field.  I hope that, if nothing else comes out of this debate, consideration will be given to those points.</P>
    <P>Before I refer to the aviation authority to which the Minister referred I should like to comment on the overall tourism position.  We did not have too bad a year, although figures were down slightly.  This has been blamed on international events, including the Gulf War.  When Estimates are being prepared by the Minister's Department regard should be had to the stop-go funding by the Department, the Minister and the Government for the tourism budget over the last number of years.  Because it is fast becoming the biggest industry in the State sufficient funds should be made available early in the budget without further reductions. There are many positive people in the industry working in different countries throughout Europe and it is obvious from the work done last year and this year, and from the success of the Irish team in <Col N="1807" /> Italia 90, that many more Europeans are interested in coming to Ireland on holidays. I do not believe that reducing moneys in the Estimate and resubmitting them in the budget, as happened last year, is a positive way to finance Bord Fáilte and others involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>The industry has responded very successfully to the request made by the Government.  The work done as a result of the business expansion scheme, the improvements to premises, was worthwhile. I appeal to the Minister before a budget decision is made to reconsider the business expansion scheme on a small scale for family hotels throughout the length and breadth of the country. There was a problem in this regard since it was discovered that there was an abuse of moneys which was not fully in line with what the business expansion scheme was designed for.  I blame the Government for not closing the loophole.  On the day of the budget, because of the pressure from many Deputies on this side of the House, the decision of the Minister for Finance had to be reversed.  If tourism is to continue to thrive in the way it has in the recent past, family hotels will have to be given consideration for moneys to be made available through the business expansion scheme or for grants in respect of up to a 40 bedroom hotel.  Several thousand people, not just in Ireland but throughout Europe, want reasonably priced accommodation in a family hotel. We do not have a sufficient number of them and I am sure that the Minister knows by now how serious the problem is.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration needs to be given to the car rental business.  The Minister is aware that there are about 10,000 cars in the fleet but sometimes during the summer there were not enough cars available.  There is also a serious problem in relation to the cost of hiring a car because the leasing companies must allow for insurance and the cost of replacing the fleet.  Japanese imports have created havoc with the fleet car market in this country.  I was very disappoined to learn recently that when <Col N="1808" /> the organisation for car leasing companies came to meet the Minister the first thing he told them was that if their proposals require an investment of funds there would be no point in having a discussion. I do not believe that is the way a major part of the tourism industry should be dealt with by the Minister.  There is a strong case to be made for a change in the purchasing system of fleet cars.  Perhaps consideration could be given to the non-payment of duty on those cars until they are resold six to 12 months after their purchase.  That would give an opportunity to the car leasing companies to reduce their costs.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of holi-daymakers who came from America to London, spent a week in Britain, hired a car, came across on the ferry and spent two weeks in Ireland.  They found that it cost less to do that than to rent a car when they came to Ireland.  There is a serious problem in that area and it needs to be addressed by the Government.  The proposals in this regard need to be considered in the budget and I hope the Minister will take on board the points I have made.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal by the Minister to set up a new authority to oversee air traffic controllers, I want to pose some questions to the Minister.  Would this country not be much better if we operated under a single European traffic control system?  If such a proposal was introduced would there not be a reduction in fares of about 14 per cent? If my facts are correct we are talking about quite a substantial reduction in the cost of air fares for people living here and business people travelling to and from the country.  Serious consideration should have been given to such a proposal before it was decided to set up a new semi-State body, as was announced by the Minister earlier this year.  I would ask the Minister why he did not propose that Aer Rianta do this work, considering that they are running the business of the airports. Why has he proposed the setting up of a new semi-State body in this area?</P>
    <P>With the opening of the Channel <Col N="1809" /> tunnel our country will be the only isolated country within Europe and I would like to know why consideration was not given to a proposal that would reduce the cost of fares by 14 per cent?  I would also ask the Minister what charges will be incurred by the new company.  He informed us today that a substantial amount of money is being paid by air companies who do not land here.  If my information is true, consideration should be given to withdrawing the proposal to set up a new semi-State body.</P>
    <P>As far as Expo '92 is concerned, we should take advantage of the opportunities involved.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the points I have raised.  The two main problems affecting tourism this year should also be considered by the Government and a decision made on them before budget day.  I would also ask that the points I have raised with regard to the new company be considered.  Proposals to join a European network should be addressed because it would mean a reduction in air fares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this Supplementary Estimate as presented by the Minister.  When I learned that a Supplementary Estimate was required in respect of Expo '92 I was deeply concerned that this money would be funded from the tourism estimates in the budget. Having regard to the pattern of the tourism budget in recent years &mdash; the amount has been reduced each year &mdash; I was deeply concerned that there would be a further reduction, gravely inhibiting the promotional and marketing projects for Irish tourism, which would be a disaster.  I am pleased to know that the Government are providing the necessary funds from the national lottery.  Our involvement in Expo '92 is of vital importance to tourism, agriculture, industry and our cultural image abroad.  In the Minister's submission it is anticipated that 18 million people will visit this exhibition.  That will give Ireland an opportunity over a long period of time to put its best goods in the shop window for all the international <Col N="1810" /> interests to see.  It will be an opportunity for Ireland to put forward an image second to none.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the tourist industry we are at a cross-roads in terms of the magnitude of competition facing Irish tourism.  Having regard to the current position of our economy, with unemployment a major crisis, we must look to tourism as the prime industry, with the capacity and the potential to be the greatest industry in the development of jobs which are so vitally required.  In that exercise we must expend increased funds in promoting the Irish product to all markets.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the present staffing of Bord Fáilte in so far as many of its European and American offices have had to be closed down in recent years due to lack of funds.  Will the necessary expertise in staff that may possibly be needed for several months in the city structure here be taken from other vital sectors?  I hope that the Minister, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, will ensure not only that the promotion is adequately and properly staffed but also that other centres are not robbed of their expertise in the necessary work of promoting and marketing Irish tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We certainly have some excellent tourist products to put on display in Seville. In view of the association there with agriculture and in view of the importance of food and the attractiveness of Ireland to tourists, it would certainly help if not only the quality of the food but also the cooking expertise and the services of our chefs, waiters and others engaged in the tourist industry in farm guesthouses, town and country homes and other such places were brought forcibly to bear on the 18 million people who will visit our pavilion.  We need to highlight the association, co-operation and co-ordination of the marketing expertise of Irish agriculture and Irish tourism because both are very closely linked.  I certainly wish the Irish exhibition within the pavilion every success.  It has the opportunity to present Ireland at its best.  I hope that it will result in much needed expansion in the tourist industry in particular and also <Col N="1811" /> that industry, agriculture and the areas governed by cultural, educational and other activities will grow to benefit the economy.</P>
    <P>Irish tourism is today more important than ever in that it has the potential to create the substantial growth and employment that is so vitally needed. However, as I have said already, neither this Government nor any other Government have recognised the tremendous potential within Irish industry to bring wealth and employment to this country. Our expenditure from national funds is both minimal and inadequate.  That inadequate budget has tended to be gradually eroded each year.  In 1986 for promotion and marketing Bord Fáilte received £25.6 million but in 1990 they received £23 million.  At a time when we want jobs and more investment in tourism that budgetary estimate is completely inadequate and will not contribute towards achievement of the potential role tourism could play in the search for jobs and wealth.</P>
    <P>There was a degree of growth in the current tourist season, but that growth was mainly confined to package tours. The growth was welcome but expansion is still needed.  In addition to that, however &mdash; and this is a subject that the previous speaker mentioned &mdash; Ireland is an ideal location for the freelancing tourist &mdash; individuals, families and groups coming by way of their own transport, whether that be by minibus or car, and the many thousands who come through Dublin and Shannon Airports and the ferryports and who have traditionally availed of our excellent car hire service. That service is now in absolute chaos and that is something to which the Minister and Bord Fáilte will have to turn their attention.  Not only is that service a vital instrument in the overall structure of a successful Irish tourist industry but it is also a creator of jobs, jobs within the car hire fleets and in places such as garages in connection with servicing those fleets. That loss in itself at these times is of very serious proportions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> It was contended, and indeed experienced, that the Gulf War would result in a substantial decrease in the number of American tourists to Ireland.  Any person conversant with traditional Irish tourism would recognise that without a strong USA complement our tourism lacks a very vital part of its overall development and that was experienced this year.  It is my contention that it is too simplistic an explanation to merely say that the substantial decrease of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent in American travellers this year was due entirely to the Gulf War: there were several other contributing factors.  I have already said that our promotion and marketing resources within the huge American market are too little.  Because of immense competition, we must spend to get an increased number of people to avail of our excellent tourist product.  We must also bear in mind that we now have only two major transatlantic airlines servicing Ireland, Aer Lingus and Delta.  That in itself presents very serious restrictions on the choice of airlines coming to Ireland, but we must also take account of the fact that fares from the US to Britain on some scheduled airlines &mdash; and there are ten to 12 airlines servicing Britain every day &mdash; cost $200 less.  I know that is a major factor which will be difficult to resolve, but we cannot achieve the possible expansion in our tourist market without competition in the air fares between the United States and Ireland and the United States and Britain.</P>
    <P>Many airlines service Britain and as a result Britain is a primary tourist destination with between three million and five million American tourists visiting it each year.  We are a secondary tourist resort and we require some positive clawback structure to encourage those tourists to visit Ireland for periods of one, two or three days.  We should have a privileged extended air ticket into Ireland.  It would result in a substantial increase in the volume of trade into Ireland.  At present a similar facility is offered on a limited basis to Australians coming to Britain.  The incentive should be permanently on offer to attract those <Col N="1813" /> people to visit us.  It should be a matter for the airlines and the sea carriers to negotiate with the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and Bord Fáilte and put in place an attractive package that would result in substantial benefits to our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The decision by British Airways in February last to cease their service in Ireland was a severe blow to this business. British Airways, are a very prestigious airline.  They not only brought people from Europe and further afield into Ireland but their massive advertising programme kept Ireland on the map in very important international centres.  We have found no substitute for the loss of the British Airways service to Ireland and that is regrettable.  With a proper programme of incentives it should be possible, in co-operation with airlines and sea carriers, to make a substantial impact on the market which would be of considerable benefit to Irish tourism.  It would also encourage further investment.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the Irish tourist industry invested £56 million, in addition to State moneys, in promoting and marketing the Irish tourist product.  It must be recognised, however, that the majority of those involved in the Irish tourist industry have family businesses or small units. To continually maintain an investment of that magnitude is well beyond their capacity and so I appeal again for a substantial increase in the marketing and promotion budget for 1992.  This was never more necessary to ensure a substantial increase in the volume of business and as a means of challenging our unemployment crisis.  Tourism is a service industry and provides a great deal of employment.  Each increase in the number of tourists provides a corresponding increase in jobs.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Structural Funds have been supplementing the budget for marketing and promotion of our tourist product, but this is very limited. While it is true that some proportion of the Structural Funds has been set aside for marketing, it is channelled exclusively to marketing the particular project for <Col N="1814" /> which the Structural Funds have been made available, and does not extend to the overall Irish tourist product.  The Structural Funds are certainly substantial with more than £400 million to be spent over a four year period.  However, it has been a source of disappointment.  The greater part of tourist accommodation and services is provided by small units. They must refurbish the accommodation to meet competition in the business.  It is a source of disappointment that some part of these funds is not available to provide a financial incentive for the small family units so that they can refurbish and upgrade their properties.  This would make the overall tourist product more attractive.</P>
    <P>I wish Ireland every success at Expo 92.  It affords us a unique opportunity of putting our best wares, including the tourism product, on display to a huge international market.  I hope the Government and the Minister recognise the immense potential of the Irish tourist industry to make a contribution to the jobs crisis because tourism alone offers us the opportunity to provide substantial employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, all shades of opinion in his House support this Estimate. The opportunity offered by Expo 92 in Seville is of tremendous significance not just to our tourist industry but to industry in general.  Essentially, we are providing a huge £4 million shopping arena in which our tourist literature and our products from large and small industries will be on display for the 80 million viewers.  This is an exciting project and I wish it well.  I wish the Office of Public Works and the full-time director appointed to the project, every success. However, we must ask why this is being funded from the national lottery.  Does the tourism industry have to foot the full bill?  Expo 92 is a trade fair and trade surely extends beyond the remit of the tourism brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot quite understand why the money is being administered by this Department.  I should like to know also why the national lottery will fund it.  Since <Col N="1815" /> we are talking about an estimate of £1.25 million for the national lottery for a project that will cost in excess of £4 million in total, it is legitimate to ask: is it the Minister's intention that the total £4 million will come from national lottery funds?  I do not see the case for the national lottery financing what are essentially national projects such as this. Should such projects not fall within the remit of the Department of Industry and Commerce or of the Department of Tourism and Transport?  I cannot understand why these two Departments, which will be responsible for the control and implementation of this magnificent exhibition costing £4 million, should not be liable for the running and building costs. This is probably another example of central Government abusing the national lottery to implement projects that would otherwise be undertaken by various Government Departments.  While the project is a magnificent one, I should like the Minister to explain why the moneys are being extracted from the national lottery fund rather than from the relevant Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also what will be the contribution of commercial enterprises. We must remember we will be spending £4 million of public money to provide this massive complex in Seville, presumably to sell such produce as Bailey's Cream, Waterford Glass, Arklow pottery, Dublin Crystal and so on.  Since we are providing this massive service to industry would it not be fair to demand of them some financial support?</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's introductory remarks that there are to be 40 planned cultural events.  These will be enormously intersting, exciting and of enormous benefit to the various groups who will be invited to perform, to act, sing or dance. While recognising our culture by way of language and dance form, we should be conscious that there is another aspect of our culture that should be projected.  We should not leave the projection of our image solely to cultural groups such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, excellent though they be, but we should afford <Col N="1816" /> the 18 million people who will visit this pavillion in Seville an opportunity to experience young, fresh, urban culture such as that which can be projected by our excellent pop musicians.  We should remember that modern Irish music, performed by young Irish bands, can be as much an enticement to people to visit this country as can the projection of groups such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann or boys and girls in Irish traditional dance dress.</P>
    <P>The arts are alive and well throughout the country and are particularly vibrant and strong in Dublin.  In regard to the 40 cultural events, we should recognise that there is an urban pop culture which should feature.  There is an image of Ireland that must be sold, that is, that we have a young, vibrant, modern face as well as that of the past.</P>
    <P>I might ask the Minister also what proportion of the £1.25 million being provided in this Estimate will have to be expended in revising the marketing material already produced.  For example, the former Minister for State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, is referred to in this promotional material.  Therefore, I presume this material will have to be revised. I wonder how much such revision will cost and how much of this material has already been published.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, spoke about what this pavillion would be about, its benefits to our tourist industry and so on.  Our image in recent years has not been well portrayed by the national media.  I am thinking in particular of the recent scandals that have engulfed this country.  I join with the former Minister of State in recognising that our best proven ambassadors in recent years have been the Irish soccer followers who travelled to Europe, who followed our soccer team in such a warm, clean, good-humoured manner.  I want to recognise, as has been recognised in this promotional literature on Expo '92, that we as a nation benefited tremendously from the influx of Italian tourists, the direct result of the magnificent behaviour <Col N="1817" /> of our soccer fans during the World Cup series.</P>
    <P>I note also from this promotional material that this pavilion, in addition to accommodating all the actors, actresses, musicians and so on, will accommodate other activities.  For example, it is stated in this literature that inside the pavilion there will be a voyage of discovery, that visitors to the pavilion will step into a time machine, that they will walk through an ancient monastic site, see monks at work illuminating The Book of Kells, see the Brendan Voyage and so on.  Given the fact that there is so much money being spent on this project out of national lottery funds, it is sad that while the 18 million people in Seville will be afforded an opportunity to enter this time machine capsule, something similar to that which obtained in Dublin at the Viking Adventure exhibition, that exhibition in Dublin, which was a tremendous success, is no longer operational.  I contend that people in Dublin and nationwide would be justified in asking: if we can spend in Europe all this money, possibly £4 million out of the national lottery or, in any case, out of taxpayers' money, why can we not get the Viking Adventure exhibition operational throughout the year?  Having given the 18 million people of Seville a sample of what they might expect to see when they visit Ireland, it is unfortunate that an exhibition here which proved so successful has been terminated.  If we are to spend national lottery moneys promoting our country overseas, in Seville in particular, then why not ascertain whether there are not some national lottery funds available to allow that Viking Adventure Exhibition to be opened for a shorter period in the winter than in summer months?  There needs to be continuity. The actors have performed extremely well and people from all over the country have visited the centre.  They are keen to see the Viking centre remain a permanent feature.</P>
    <P>I wish every success to those involved in organising and running Expo 92, the architects who designed the pavilion, the workers involved in putting it in place, <Col N="1818" /> those who will man it, the IDA and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I question the provision of £1,000 in the Supplementary Estimate, to make provision for the expenditure in connection with the transition arrangements. The Irish Aviation Authority have about 600 employees and a budget of £32 million. What is the token figure of £1,000 all about?  I congratulate the staff, workforce and managers of the Irish Aviation Authority and wish them well as a new commercial semi-State body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Supplementary Estimate which reflects the Government's resolve to continue to promote in a macro way this very important industry.  The Taoiseach, and the Government, have shown an unprecedented level of interest in the promotion of tourism.  Up to 1987 we were laid back in our attitude to this industry and did not appreciate the potential for job creation and improvement of the economy.  It was only in 1987 that the realisation dawned.  The Taoiseach set a new pace, appointing a new chief executive, Martin Dully, to Bord Fáilte and giving him explicit instructions to double tourist numbers within five years.  Within the aim was achieved.  Tourism has on the aim was achieved.  Tourism has been growing at a compound rate of 15 per cent, which compares with a worldwide growth rate of 5 per cent.  In effect, our tourism industry is growing at three times the world rate.  That level of growth is commendable and all concerned should be complimented and congratulated. Tourism is the world's fastest growing industry and by the end of the decade it will be the largest single industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, on the passionate interest he has taken in his job.  He has travelled throughout the country in the promotion of the tourism industry and has taken the trouble to visit my constituency on a number of occasions to open new projects or to launch tourism-related ventures. The example of the Minister, and of the Government, is the key.  Tourism <Col N="1819" /> has been, I suppose, the Taoiseach's main hobby horse.</P>
    <P>There was a hiccup this year in tourism growth, which was disturbed somewhat by what was in effect a world war.  The aftermath of the Gulf War affected our tourism customers, especially in the North American market.  We have nevertheless done extremely well and all the portents are for an excellent year in 1992.</P>
    <P>Almost any individual or group can become involved in the promotion of this industry.  Deputy Byrne mentioned our football followers in Europe.  The superb example of their behaviour on foreign soil has been an enormous help and will continue to assist in attracting foreign visitors here.  I have seen angling clubs take initiatives that attract tourists.  Other bodies such as the vocational education committee in Wicklow have also become involved, despite the fact that one would not imagine they would be remotely concerned about tourism.  These people must be encouraged in a practical way to involve themselves.  In Wicklow we were totally laid back in regard to tourism until recent years and did not seem to want to know about it, even with all the Godgiven amenities we have.  Because of the example set by the Taoiseach and the Government, a new enthusiasm has been generated and we have set up a new company, Wicklow Tourism Limited. They have taken on the role of spear-heading the efforts, both public and private, of promoting tourism in the county, and these efforts are paying off.</P>
    <P>I understand that approximately 3,000,000 North American tourists visit the UK every year and that only about 400,000 of these visit this country.  This is a very disturbing statistic.  The Minister should endeavour to attract more of these tourists to Ireland.  If they travel 3,000 miles across the Atlantic it should be possible to get them to travel an extra 60 miles to spend even a few days here before they continue their travels or return home.  The Minister would have done a good day's work if he could achieve this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> I wish to refer to the excellent work being done by many of our State agencies, for example, Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works played a major part in setting up the national park in County Wicklow which is totally tourism-related.  One interpretative centre has been built and another is at the planning stage.  These centres will act as focal points for the development of tourism in that beautiful county.</P>
    <P>Wonderful work is also being carried out by CERT in training young people, which means we can offer a quality tourism product which is backed up by professionals. The chefs, hotel managers, bar tenders, waiters and waitresses trained by CERT have a professional approach to their work.  This training is of a very high standard.  The qualifications and expertise of the young people trained by CERT should be recognised in a very practical and tangible way. Hoteliers and others who employ these young people have tended not to pay them the proper remuneration for their qualifications and expertise.  I have raised this issue in the House before and it needs to be addressed.  People who are properly trained should get the appropriate level of remuneration and promotion if they are to stay interested in their jobs and remain in the industry.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years much grant aid has been allocated to the tourism industry.  While this is very welcome more is required.  I welcome in particular the European Regional Development Fund moneys and the agri-tourism grants which are related to agriculture.  People in small towns and villages who get involved in an agricultural-related scheme can glean substantial grant aid for their projects.  Recently a memorial park to the late great Charles Stewart Parnell was opened in my home town of Rathdrum on the centenary of his death. Funding for this park was raised by the local people through the agri-tourism scheme.  I am endeavouring to make people in my constituency more aware of the benefit of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming Leader programme <Col N="1821" /> will be of benefit to many people, particularly those in rural Ireland.  It will also be of benefit to tourism-related projects. This funding is very important from the point of view of attracting private investment. Without private investment we are going nowhere.  Funding on a pound for pound basis will encourage people to invest in this very important industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrell referred to the business expansion scheme.  It was proposed to do away with this excellent scheme in last year's budget and I am very grateful to the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, for his practicality in deciding to leave the scheme in place to a large extent and allow people who had undertaken projects to avail of it.  Fourteen projects in County Wicklow have been approved under the business expansion scheme.  These projects are very important from the point of view of jobs.  I am very grateful to the Minister for the action he took&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We should use every forum available to us to advertise our tourism facilities.  We have a quality tourism product which we can promote and market for the benefit of our economy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision to avail of a stand at Expo '92 which will be held in Seville next year.  As a member of the Council of Europe I had the privilege of visiting this site two weeks ago. Having a stand at Expo '92 means we will be able to put Ireland on the map from the point of view of tourism.  While I was in Seville I was told we had been very slow to take up a place.  Those concerned were being pushed from one Department to another, which is typical, and the matter had to be brought to the Taoiseach's office to get a decision to go to Seville.  There were only five or six countries which were not represented and it would have been very bad had we not been represented.  I am glad we were represented but I hope we would not drag our feet in similar matters in the future. This matter had been mentioned to me and I did not take any pleasure on hearing it.</P>
      <P>We have to look to the Continent for greater development of our markets.  We must look to the EC, where there must be greater development to encourage integration of people moving around Europe.  We should be looking for a large share of that movement within Europe. The Minister would do well to spend time visiting these countries and initiating projects within the Council of Europe to ensure there is a greater awareness of playing a greater European role within tourism.  It is important not just that people visit Europe but also that they feel they are part of Europe.  The best way to ensure this development is to encourage people to move across the countries of Europe, where there is great potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that we are setting up another semi-State body and I wonder what is the reason.  When we encounter difficulties <Col N="1823" /> in Ireland we always set up a body or an authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If we want to move part of the aviation service which heretofore was operated by central Government why not use Aer Rianta, even if it means expanding and developing that organisation further?  That is not the approach, but rather one of setting up a new authority, thus creating more bureaucracy.  We are plagued with bureaucracy.  A pledge was given a few years ago that we would reduce bureaucracy; now, however, we are starting down that expensive road again. When an authority is set up and a fellow is given a table and a chair, after five years he has set up an office with lots of people working in it.  One wonders why.</P>
      <P>It is about time the Minister took Dublin seriously, because Bord Fáilte do not.  I attended a meeting with Bord Fáilte recently and tackled them on the fact that Dublin is not well served by Bord Fáilte or by the tourist industry. Any of the leading hotels will say that their leanest months of the year are July and August.  The only areas that appear to be doing well are the south and the west; the east, and particularly Dublin are totally ignored.  The Government have been grappling with the issue of direct flights into Dublin from the US for long enough and it is time they grasped the nettle.  This is all about numbers coming into the country.  It is not about petty politics or regional politics; it is about getting people on seats and beds filled in hotels.  The only way we can do that is by allowing direct flights into Dublin.  Shannon will not die or disappear as a result: it will be alive and well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin has a lot to offer.  It is an historical city &mdash; and we have had tremendous archaeological finds and developments of one kind or another, <Col N="1824" /> two great cathedrals, mountains and sea.  It has all the charm tourists want, but it is totally ignored.  Indeed, the Director General said the business people do not play their part.  Bord Fáilte are charged with that responsibility.  I want to see the Minister take a decision to allow direct flights into Dublin.  He said he would do whatever is in the best interests of Ireland Incorporated.  One would be very foolish not to realise that if we prevent direct flights coming in fewer people will come to Ireland.  I have no doubt that the more people who come to Ireland the more they will filter throughout the country. It is about time Dublin Deputies took themselves seriously and set up a pressure group to get this done in order to improve the tourist industry, not only for Dublin but for the entire country.  I want to make the point strongly that we are dithering and sitting on the fence for far too long and if we are serious about tourism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Minister; it is more sitting on the fence.  Give us another report.  Let us stop this nonsense and get on with the job.  Tourism has great potential in this country for service industries and for jobs.  Let us stop petty politics.  Instead of a central tourist board I would like to see regional tourist boards <Col N="1825" /> involving competition between the various regions to attract people to those areas.  There is nothing like competition for getting people moving.  If we had more competition and a little less centralisation it would be better for all of us.  Compared to Europe, the US and Australia this is an ideal country, with open roads, plenty of golf courses, good fishing and all the benefits that people living in the modern world today would want in order to get away from the rat race.  Ireland is known for its tranquility and peacefullness, for people who are concerned and friendly &mdash; all of which is a tremendous help to our tourist industry. We need to take ourselves seriously.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that Dublin gets its fair share of tourism.  At present that is not the case, because we are not taking it sufficiently seriously. The way to take it seriously is to allow direct flights into Dublin.  If we allow direct flights, as has been said by other airlines in the US, they will come in directly and even Kerry would benefit because those people would travel to various parts of the country.  Friends of mine who come from Australia are told &mdash; I do not know who tells them &mdash; to get out of Dublin quickly.  Who tells them?</P>

Edinburgh consists of only half a street, with shops on one side and the scenic beauty on the other. Dublin is ten times that size, yet Edinburgh gets more tourists each year than Dublin.  That gives us an idea of where we are falling down, so let us take Dublin seriously and we will all be beneficiaries. I am not a parochially minded person, but as Dublin is the capital city I believe if we get people into Dublin we can get them around the country.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  I will do my best to answer questions raised.  Deputy Farrelly raised the question as to the provision for marketing.  A steering committee responsible for co-ordinating the overall project are actively seeking commercial sponsorship.  A number of marketing initiatives have already been undertaken by the Department of Industry and Commerce, An Córas Tráchtála and the IDA.  If Deputy Farrelly or anybody else can help with regard to sponsorship their help will be very much appreciated.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The door is wide open as long as we get sponsors to supplement the funds already provided.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to stop-go funding in tourism.  Funding for tourism has been constant in recent years.  In addition to Exchequer funding we have the European Regional Development Fund and the International Fund for Ireland along with the resources of An Bord Fáilte.  It is wrong to say that there is not enough money.  We must acknowledge that Bord Fáilte are putting their resources to work and we must acknowledge the support of the industry in response to the programme put before them from Government. Do the Deputies in this House wish us to stand still when circumstances change, when there is a downturn in economies on which we depend for tourism? Are we expected to sit on the sidelines and moan?  That is not our form. We acknowledged the changing situation by providing an extra £1 million in the budget for marketing.  That is better than to stand still and do nothing.  Extra funding was provided in the changed circumstances, with alacrity and with success.</P>

      <P>I dealt with the question with regard to a reduction in air fares.  A number of deputies referred to Aer Rianta.  There is an ongoing role for Aer Rianta in parallel with the proposed semi-State company on air navigation.  In the beginning charges will be a matter for that company. We can discuss these issues when legislation is introduced, but I do not accept that a single authority would produce savings on the scale suggested.</P>

      <P>Airlines are conscious of the need to attract visitors and they continually pay attention to fare structures.</P>
      <P>With regard to funding for tourism marketing, the changes we introduced in 1987, by diverting money from grant aid to accommodation to marketing, is having a good effect.  The marketing effort is right, having regard to availability of resources.  Money is being spent on well focused markets.  The effectiveness of that policy is evident in that we have achieved a growth rate of 15 per cent in the years up to 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne wanted to know why this Department have the co-ordinating <Col N="1828" /> role for exports.  Our experience and our expertise have qualified us for the job. We are pleased to take on the challenge. Deputies referred to the question of the best ambassadors we have had.  Some Deputy mentioned the World Cup.  The success of our cyclists, Roche and Kelly was the start of that sort of promotion. Then we had the Dunhill Trophy in golf. I was abroad promoting tourism on both those occasions and I was proud to be able to refer to those competitions.  I was in the UK in 1988 when our representative team for Ireland were taking part in the European Cup.  I had the privilege of standing up in London that night at a function there and complimenting not alone the representative team but the quality and behaviour of our supporters.  When I said earlier that we would be promoting our successes I mentioned our people.  This has not been confined to one competition in recent years.  Our supporters were a credit to us and I acknowledge that it made our job that little bit easier when promoting, particularly in Germany from where, since 1987, we have had an 93 per cent increase &mdash; admittedly from a low starting base &mdash; of visitors to Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the question of manning the Expo stand, I deleted the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; from my script and substituted &ldquo;staff&rdquo;, because somebody remarked on that.  I will not go further into that.  Let me say that £1,000 is just a token provision.  It does not mean that everybody will be paid out of that £1,000.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to thank Deputy Joe Jacob for his contribution and many others for their efforts throughout the country.  I should also mention that the axis for visitors to Ireland has moved from North America to Europe, although not to the total exclusion of North America. I am glad that Deputy O'Brien had the opportunity to visit the stand.  Let me tell him that we are taking Dublin seriously and we had seven regional boards in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We now move on to debate Votes 14 and 16.</P>

    <Col N="1829" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions arises from two factors.  First, it is due to an insufficient provision in subhead E for general law expenses.  Expenditure in this area is in respect of costs awarded to applicants in judicial review and other High Court cases and to defendants in criminal prosecutions.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy the level of expenditure in this area in any one year as it is dependent on the number of cases taken and the associated costs and expenses. The increase in 1991 over 1990 can be attributed to the following causes: (i) an increase in the number of cases in which the payment of costs was disposed of; and (ii) increases in the average amount awarded.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it is due to increases negotiated this year in the fees paid to counsel appearing for the Director of Public Prosecutions in the various criminal courts. These fees are paid from subhead D. Apart from the application of general pay round increases, the level of these fees had not been reviewed since 1981.  Fees had fallen out of line with remuneration for legal services in both the public and private sectors.  The standard Circuit Court case fee for barristers prosecuting in the Circuit Court that was paid in the earlier part of 1991 was £240.  A revised standard case fee of £350 was agreed. Agreement was also reached that other fees payable for work in the Criminal Courts should be increased accordingly.</P>
      <P>The second Supplementary Estimate is for the amount of £100,000 for Vote 16 &mdash; the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will recall, a competition for 1,000 appointments to the Garda Síochána was advertised in the national press in June of this year.  The Supplementary Estimate for £100,000, which I moved today, will cover the cost to the Civil Service Commission in 1991 of the first phase of the recruitment process. This is a technical Supplementary Estimate as equivalent savings will be made on the Garda Vote in 1991 to cover the cost of the competition this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> The competition includes a written test and a competitive interview organised by the Civil Service Commission.  All candidates who met the educational qualifications were invited to sit a written test. This was held during the week commencing 30 September last and was designed to measure general learning ability.  A total of 12,269 candidates claimed eligibility and were called for the test in Dublin and in six provincial centres.  Eight thousand five hundred and eighty-eight candidates &mdash; 70 per cent of the candidature &mdash; attended.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commissioners have formally approved the results of the written tests, candidates have now been notified of their results and arrangements have been made for initial interviews. It is proposed to commence interviews before the end of the year in order to supply sufficient candidates to the Garda Commissioner to cover the first planned intake of trainees in April 1992.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate covers the staffing costs involved in calling applicants for testing, timetabling and processing of results as well as non-pay expenditure on travel and subsistence, post and telephones and examinations expenses such as hire of premises and printing costs.  The expenditure arises on subheads A.1, B.1, C and D.</P>
    <P>Interviews will continue throughout 1992 and will be concluded by December 1992.  Successful candidates will be admitted to training in accordance with planned intake.  The final number of candidates to be called for interview will be determined as the competition progresses. In the 1988 competition almost 3,900 candidates were called for interview to yield some 1,000 trainees.</P>
    <P>I commend these Supplementary Estimates to the House.  If Deputies wish to raise any points, I will be glad to address them in my reply at the end of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity in relation to the Estimate concerning the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to refer to some aspects of our courts and the fact that there is a Supplementary Estimate <Col N="1831" /> here for the sum of £224,000 for fees payable to counsel representing the Director of Public Prosecutions in our courts.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention an aspect of our courts that is causing a great deal of concern at the present time, that is the courts dispute.  As you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, industrial action by court staff is now in its thirteenth week and has effectively brought the work of the District and Circuit Courts to a standstall. The Civil and Public Services Union has applied to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for an all out picket.  If this application is successful the country's legal system will be thown into total chaos.</P>
      <P>I understand that the claim in dispute was lodged 17 months ago and while there have been some discussions recently between departmental officials and the Civil and Public Services Union, no progress has been made.  The dispute centres on a claim by the union that members are being asked to deal with an increased workload and higher responsibility as a consequence of increases in the jurisdictions of both the District and Circuit Courts.  It should be remembered that the staff involved are low paid workers and the cost of the upgradings is relatively small.  What is currently in dispute is 17 posts with an annual cost of approximately £10,000.  It is that aspect that I would like to refer to briefly.  I am not in the begrudging business and I recognise that the counsel who represent the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions deserve to be paid what they are entitled to.  For this reason I will not oppose the Supplementary Estimate but we should put the matter in context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked to approve a Supplementary Estimate for £224,000 to meet the increased cost of counsel; yet, our courts are in chaos because of the dispute over 17 posts involving a sum of approximately £10,000 per annum.  I put it to the Minister of State that if the current lodgment and search fees charged by the County Sheriff Offices, which were fixed in 1963 at 35p and 37p respectively, <Col N="1832" /> were updated to current money values the extra revenue would meet the cost of upgrading these posts.  I am not asking the Minister of State therefore to dip into the pocket of the taxpayer to find the miserable sum of £10,000 to cover the additional cost involved.  It could be raised by updating the fees which, I am sure everyone would agree, at 35p and 37p, are relatively small.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there is insufficient awareness of the seriousness of this dispute and the potential serious consequences for our system of justice and the commercial life of the country.  I have sought to raise the matter by way of Private Notice Question and the Ceann Comhairle granted me permission to raise it on the Adjournment but the chaos continues.  The Minister for Justice has a responsibility to ensure that an efficient and adequate court service is provided to the public.  He is also responsible for industrial relations with staff employed by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I would like to outline some of the effects of the current dispute.  First, applications for grant of probate and administration are not being processed outside of Dublin. Second, applications for bar extensions for special functions cannot be heard by the courts.  Likewise, annual applications for the renewal of publican's and hotelier's licences, which the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications is interested in, and for the transfer of licences, will also be affected.  Third, solicitors cannot check for a person buying a house whether the vendor of a property is in a position to sell and, consequently, house purchases and sales are being delayed.  Fourth, certain time limits are imposed for the taking of legal action.  In the absence of documents being stamped the time limit may run out for some litigants, that is, their claims will become statute barred.  Similarly, time limits apply for appealing a judgment from a lower court to a higher court.  No new civil claims are being processed. In relation to the Circuit Court and in particular to criminal cases, in most parts of the country outside Dublin <Col N="1833" /> no jurors have been summoned and no lists of cases have been printed.  This means that the parties to a case, witnesses etc., will not know until the last minute whether their case will be heard and, if so, when.</P>
    <P>There is a range of functions which clerical officers and clerical assistants are refusing to perform, for example, processing appeals from the District Court to the Circuit Court and from the Circuit Court to the High Court.  They are also refusing to act as court registrars and process judgment papers, draft orders, civil bills, the endorsement of driving licences and disqualifications.  If the Minister for Justice is unable to settle this dispute, then surely he can call on the services of an accredited and independent source such as the Labour Relations Commission to act as a mediator or abitrator.  This dispute should not be allowed to continue.  Even if the dispute is settled immediately it will take several months to clear the backlog which has already built up.  The longer it continues the greater the chaos.  I am using this opportunity this morning to appeal to the Minister for Justice once again to wake up and realise that what is happening in our courts is causing absolute chaos and affecting the ordinary individual in the ways I have outlined.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters that I would like to mention in relation to this Supplementary Estimate and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I have mentioned on many occasions, when legislation brought forward by the Department of Justice was passing through the House, that our system of justice in no way takes into account the victims of crime.  I find it difficult to understand, as do members of the public, that if the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions decides to proceed with a criminal charge against somebody, the victim of the crime is not even paid the courtesy of being informed of when the court case is going to be heard.  This is extraordinary.  In the rape legislation we recognised at long last that the victims of rape should be consulted but with regard to other crimes the victim is forgotten.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> Recently I spoke to parents who had lost their son in an accident involving a drunk driver.  The driver of the vehicle was brought to court without the parents being told but, even worse, they discovered a sentence had been imposed and the person charged appealed it; they then read in the newspaper that the person had got a suspended sentence.  If we call this a modern system of justice I will eat my hat.  The least that should happen is that the people affected should be informed of an upcoming criminal case and that they can consult with the representative of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions so that they understand and appreciate the procedures to be followed and the whole system.  If a person's house is broken into and they report it to the Garda they may never hear another word about it.  I am not blaming the current Director of Public Prosecutions for this but our legislation fails to recognise that there should be an obligation on the counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions to consult with the victim and on the Garda Síochána to inform the person affected by the crime that a case is pending.  If this were done there would be better co-operation, a feeling that the victim was not being forgotten and we would have fewer disgruntled victims in our society.</P>
    <P>I would also like to avail of this opportunity to mention the legal aid system. The recent report of the Legal Aid Board clearly indicates that our present legal aid system is not working and that the fundamental rights of individuals are not being protected in so far as they do not have access to our courts.  There is an obligation on the Government of the day and the Minister for Justice in particular to provide proper and adequate funding for the legal aid scheme and to establish the scheme on a statutory basis.  The report, as I said, points out that the present spread of law centres is totally inadequate and that large areas of the country have no full-time law centre.  The report also refers to the fact that delays of up to three or four months can occur in obtaining an initial appointment with a solicitor.  This is followed by further <Col N="1835" /> extensive delays in having an application for legal aid processed.  I do not think any society should tolerate, particularly in relation to family breakdown, a situation where peoples' fundamental rights are not protected.  There should be a legal aid system on a statutory basis to provide basic protection for the rights of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Estimate for the Civil Service Commission.  We learned from the Minister's speech that 12,269 candidates applied to join the Garda Síochána and 8,588 candidates sat the written test.  It is a credit to the Garda Síochána that so many of our citizens are anxious to join the force although, of course, it is also a reflection on current unemployment.  I should like to make one point in relation to the operation of the Civil Service Commission.  The Minister said that the Civil Service Commissioners have formally approved the results of the written test, candidates have now been notified of their results and arrangements have been made for initial interviews.  I question that statement because people came to me &mdash; not asking me to interfere with the process of the Civil Service Commission appointments &mdash; to tell me they had received a letter from the Civil Service Commission informing them they had been unsuccessful. If somebody sits a written test they deserve more than a three line reply. When one does not get the result of a test there is always a doubt; I am not suggesting that anything improper is happening in the Civil Service Commission. I totally support the concept of an appointments commission and, for that reason, I am anxious that we should go a little further.  As a result of a written test presumably points are allocated and, perhaps, the first 2,000 successful applicants are called for interview.  That is the way it should be but those who were unsuccessful should be told where they were placed because they will then know that their test had been corrected.  More notice and information should be given to applicants for positions of this nature <Col N="1836" /> so that there is absolutely no doubt as to the bona fides of the whole operation.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose the Estimate, I do not begrudge the increases to those who will receive them but it is unfortunate that the whole legal system can be thrown into chaos because 17 upgradings for clerical assistants and clerical officers, at an annual cost of £10,000, will not be approved.  This morning we are discussing an Estimate of £224,000 in respect of legal fees.  I am not a begrudger, people are entitled to be paid for what they do and I should like to think that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions would get the best people available to do the job on behalf of the State and pay them for doing it. However, there is more to our courts system than the judges and the barristers; low paid workers do important jobs. They have been in dispute for 13 weeks, they lodged a claim 17 months ago and we are now facing the prospect of the courts shutting down which will affect the ordinary citizen as well as those employed there.  I do not think the Minister for Justice should tolerate this any longer, he should resolve this difficulty and if he cannot do it himself he should use whatever independent mediation sources are available.</P>
    <P>This side of the House will not oppose the Estimate.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply to the points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House unnecessarily.  Deputy Barrett referred to the concern of every Deputy because representations have been made to my party &mdash; and I suspect to others &mdash; in respect of this matter.  It would be nice to think that the Minister for Justice could resolve the dispute but, like any other Minister, he is not allowed to involve himself in industrial relations in a serious manner.  This is really a problem in that part of the public service which is the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  The Minister of State present has advice directly accessible to him in respect of this matter and he might be able to say in his reply whether the Department of Finance are blocking the <Col N="1837" /> upgrading of the 17 posts on the grounds that because there are analogous grades in other parts of the Civil Service they will be faced with a knock-on claim.  If that is the case there is some legitimacy in resisting this point.  However, these points should be made because this is a silent dispute.  There has not really been much publicity about it because, unlike utilities such as electricity, transportation or more up-front services like education, these people do not have the same impact on the general public.  I fully support what Deputy Barrett said in relation to the knock-on effect over time of this kind of reduction in the operation of our courts system.  Access to law, to the courts and, consequently, to justice is an integral part of any kind of democracy, especially a democracy where the rule of law must prevail.  We have a tradition of citizens being able to get reasonably quick and effective access to a relatively cheap system of justice.  Certainly this dispute has gone on far too long and its history is an indictment of our industrial relations, systems and methods of resolution within the public service.</P>
      <P>The dispute has gone on for 13 weeks and it is about to escalate to the point where there will be a virtual shut-down of the courts.  It is an indictment of the management of our public service and unless they are acting on explicit political instructions from the Minister for Finance in respect of overall moneys then some explanation should be given.  The Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions relates to the justice system and a sum of more than £357,000 is being sought. Therefore, we should get an explanation as to why additional moneys are not being sought to resolve this dispute.  One could make the same point over and over again but the main point is how long the dispute will last.  What is its full cost?  Can the cost be recouped from the regime of the operation of the courts on the lines suggested by Deputy Barrett or in other ways, such as increasing fees, so that the direct charges are levied on those who use the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's remarks in <Col N="1838" /> respect of the difficulty of estimating the cost of barristers' fees. Apart from the showband business, the courts and the Law Library are probably the last unregulated, free market bastion of rampant capitalism or marketeering. Depending on how good you can sing, how much of your head you can shave or how much you can manipulate the market, it appears you can command extraordinary fees in the music entertainment business.  I am basically cynical enough to believe that the same prevails in the Law Library.  My esteemed lawyer friends would certainly rubbish such a base and crass accusation and would attribute the outrageous variation in the cost of barristers' fees to innate and invisible skills that are beyond the capability of mere mortals like myself to define.  The range of barristers now in the Law Library &mdash; indeed we read in today's paper of their complaints about working conditions &mdash; and the increase in the supply of barristers, not forgetting that these are the people who would go to the death to defend free market principles, would suggest, if the textbooks still prevail in first year economics, that costs should be correspondingly reduced.  Yet that does not seem to be the case.  There is much litigation that is, comparatively speaking, routine, where all that is needed is a talking body to make the necessary representations to a judge.  Indeed the expertise in the Director of Public Prosecutions' office could guide and assist young barristers, male or female, who do not have the necessary family connections to make a fresh start in the arcane world of the legal system.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister and his advisers as to whether given the enormous increase in the supply of professional talent, it would be possible to reduce the cost of barristers' fees.  Why can we not select young barristers who do not hold the Director of Public Prosecutions office to ransom?  We have read what pop singers can get for golden labels and singles such as that of U2 which is being publicised.  It compares favourably with the fees that barristers receive on <Col N="1839" /> a daily basis in Dublin Castle for the tribunal.  If that is an indication of the market value of such people then I take my hat off to them, but if the Law Library has a supply of 850 other barristers, and surely they are not all earning that much money, we should be able to shop around and get value for money, spreading employment and wealth in the process.</P>
    <P>Obviously I make some of those observations tongue in cheek.  Behind the net point I am making there is a validity that has to be addressed.  I am not for one moment suggesting that a cheap barrister is an incompetent barrister, that someone who cannot charge the maximum rate that others get away with is necessarily less competent.  Maybe they never get the chance to prove themselves or maybe their grandfather was not a Fine Gael Deputy or a Fianna Fáil Deputy in 1921 or 1922.</P>

      <P>Briefly I will refer to the Supplementary Estimate for the Civil Service Commission.  I have no problems with this Supplementary Estimate.  Perhaps the bureaucracy in the Civil Service Commission system and its operations could be considered, although this is probably not the time to do so.  To devise a panel of 8,558 people and to draw from that in the manner to which the Minister of State has referred is not unreasonable.  As he has said, this is not a real cost because it will be recouped from next year's allocation so it is really a book-keeping exercise rather than an additional cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> I will not detain the House any longer. I would just like to know if the additional estimate for barristers fees can be reduced.  In the course of his reply perhaps the Minister would refer to the exact nature of the industrial dispute, whether there is a knock-on effect and, if not, why the dispute cannot be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to cover some of the ground that has been covered already.  It seems surprising to many of us that the anachronistic, out-dated, closed shop system that operates for the legal profession, as distinct from the principles that they would apply elsewhere in the economy, persist.  The Minister is quite happy to come before the House with a substantial Supplementary Estimate as a result of an increase in fees negotiated during the year while at the same time the same Minister has locked out 260 low paid workers at the courts.  I see one of the distinguished civil servants shaking his head when I use the term &ldquo;lock out&rdquo;. I am in as good a position as he to know what a lock out is, and as far as I am concerned this is a lock out.  I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Lyons, knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy in a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that these 260 low paid civil sevants have been involved in negotiations for a very long time, served a claim in 1990, finally initiated negotiations in February of this year and were forced to engage in a work to rule on 19 August, no serious attempt was made by the Minister or the Department of Justice to meet their claim. Whereas I suspect that the more recent negotiations probably have been derailed by the internal political turmoil on the Government benches, specifically within the Fianna Fáil element of the Government, I would like to be assured by the Minister that that is the case and that it is the reason the negotiations which took place last week did not reach finality. However that was not the case prior to <Col N="1841" /> 19 August.  At that stage we were still living in the best of all possible worlds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Milk and honey flowed, an economic miracle had taken place, there was unity in the Cabinet, the Taoiseach was to continue at least into the next century and everything was well. Therefore I cannot see why the shy and retiring Minister for Justice could not have applied himself to the question of the court strike before it reached the stage of a work to rule and even after it reached that stage I cannot see why the events of 10 October were allowed to be precipitated.</P>
      <P>The fact that the pay of the senior of the grades concerned &mdash; clerical officer &mdash; starts at £138.96 a week and after 13 years reaches a maximum of £249.86 a week puts this matter into perspective. The maximum pay of the clerical assistant grade is substantially less than that. Therefore we are talking about a group of very low paid workers.  We fixed a fee for the counsel at £350 &mdash;it had originally been £240 &mdash; but the people doing the work are on a rate of pay from £138 per week to £249 a week, if they remain in the job for 13 years, while clerical assistants are paid less.  By any yardstick of equity or by any comparison as between the respective merits of the case which caused the Minister to bring before the House a Supplementary Estimate for £244,000 for barristers fees and the failure to even seriously negotiate the situation affecting the CPSU members, this seems extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the structure of the Bar, some barristers, as Deputy Quinn has said, get a very unfair shakeout and for that reason my party are not opposing the Estimate.  However some of the top barristers will earn more between now and Christmas than one of the court clerks at present on strike will earn for the whole year.  I do not understand how the Department of Justice &mdash; I am not making any claims above all Departments to understand the Department of Justice &mdash; can justify not even making a <Col N="1842" /> serious attempt to resolve the dispute and indeed rebuffing efforts to install a third party as an intermediary in this dispute. It escapes me.  Deputy Barrett has dealt with some of the implications of this dispute, apart entirely from the implications for the staff who are on strike.  The staff concerned can ill afford to be on strike and its implications for them are obviously especially serious.  It seems to me that they have a reasonable case in terms of the recent Courts Act which changed the jurisdiction of the District Court from £2,500 to £5,000 and if memory serves me increased the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly in those circumstances the demand for high quality pre-court processing is such that it is a reasonable claim for any group of trade unionists to put forward a demand for a small number of additional promotional posts.  If my advice is correct, the cost of this will not total £10,000 for 1992, as Deputy Barrett has said; but a figure in the region of £7,000 which was agreed between the CPSU and the official side for 1992. There is no retrospective financial imposition; there is no financial imposition for the current year and it is estimated that the total cost for the following year will be of the order of £7,000.  Perhaps Deputy Barrett is as close to the figure as I am but as compared to the £224,000 for Counsel, none of whom is living in poverty, it seems to be an extraordinary relative scale of justice to be applied by the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the effects of this dispute, which are very serious. The old aphorism that justice delayed can be justice denied, is still correct in a situation where there are time limits on litigation or in circumstances when cases that have been initiated can be statute barred.  The implications are terribly serious.  There is also a number of economic effects if this dispute is allowed to go on.  I understand for example that the whole area of conveyancing will effectively have to be put in abeyance if the dispute is not resolved.  There is an economic fallout which will percolate through <Col N="1843" /> our already reasonably stagnant economy if the causes of the dispute are not addressed and resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This dispute will require all of the manifestly suitable skills of the new Minister for Labour and it should not be nearly as taxing as struggling with MCAs, and the intricacies of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  Provided he decides to take a more benevolent view of other people's points of view I do not see any reason that he should not chalk up an early success.  I ask the new Minister, when things settle down, to devote his attention to this dispute in the immediate days ahead.  Quite frankly it is unreasonable not to accept a third party intermediary in this type of dispute.  The debate on the Supplementary Estimate, if it does nothing else, at least gives us the opportunity to ventilate this.  I am quite sure that the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, will devote a similar proportion of his reply as the three Oppossition spokespersons have spent in commenting on the issue.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to underline the point made by Deputy Barrett which struck a chord with me, although it had not occurred to me before he made it.  I have had a number of cases recently and there appears to be a change in the processing of particular alleged crimes where the file is passed on by the Garda to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda are unable to tell the victim whether a prosecution will be initiated. It seems reasonable to request in these circumstances that the victim be told, whether through the Garda or through the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, whether a prosecution will be initiated.  In crimes of violence, it is apparently a matter of significant psychological importance to the victim to know that a prosecution will be initiated.  The reason that Deputy Barrett's remarks struck a chord with me is that I have two such cases at present and I cannot establish either from the local Garda or from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions whether prosecutions will <Col N="1844" /> be initiated.  There is a time lag which is very difficult to explain to the victim, but even if the victim were advised at the end of that time lag, it would do a great deal to help him in his recovery.  The support group which works with the victims of crime will tell you that this is the first thing the victim, especially the victims of crimes of violence, raises with them and they take comfort in the knowledge that the alleged assailant will be prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>May I just take issue with Deputy Quinn on a remark &mdash; perhaps I am being unfair and Deputy Quinn did not mean what I understood &mdash; that we should be glad that we have relatively cheap access to justice in this country.  As somebody who has been forced into seeking justice through the courts myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was ill advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I could not see justice coming without resort to the courts.  I could not necessarily agree that access to justice in this country is cheap, but it is especially not cheap for the poorer sections of our society who are depending on free legal aid.  Indeed the report published by the Legal Aid Board for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989 seems to me to be a damning indictment of Government neglect of the civil legal aid system.  For those who have the choice and can afford to pay for litigation Deputy Quinn's remark may be fair but it is not relevant for the sections of the population depending on the civil legal aid system.  Any cursory reading of the report of the civil legal aid board for the three years I mentioned will show that it is a very serious indictment of the service. It must be more than ten years since the Airey case, yet we still have this very basic primitive infrastructure of civil legal aid in this country.  It falls far short of what was envisaged by the European Court of Human rights in the Airey case. This is something I know about.  In a constituency such as mine it is painful to have to tell constituents who come to one with minor cases that unfortunately <Col N="1845" /> involve litigation that either they cannot get access to the courts because they cannot pay for it or there is such a waiting-list that if they wait indefinitely they may get access.  That is a fundamental point of democratic rights, but it is not a right or an entitlement that a great many of our citizenry have and there does not seem to be any sufficient attempts by the Government to acknowledge that those rights are being trampled on.  It is an area in which it is necessary to establish an infrastructure capable of responding to the need that is there.</P>
      <P>I do not really have any point to make about the vote for the Civil Service Commission other than that made by my colleagues concerning the fantastic number of our young men and women who want to become members of the Garda Siochána. I am quite sure, as Deputy Barrett said, that that is a comment on the esteem in which the Garda are held, but I suggest, with no disrespect at all to the Garda that it is much more likely to be a reflection of the state of employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy, and it is a pity that that is the case.</P>
      <P>I have no reason not to support the Estimate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts dispute is not technically relevant to this Vote but there are a few points I should like to make, the matter having been raised in all good faith.  For a long time there has been no unwillingness to discuss or to offer reasonable <Col N="1846" /> compromise on the part of the official side.  Protracted discussions and correspondence involving both the Departments of Justice and Finance took place with union officials before the summer recess.  Indications from union sources were that the upgrading of 42 posts would meet the union's aspirations.  The suggestion being made that the courts' staff have been locked out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is not accurate. Notices to that effect have been circulated to CPSU members generally, but it is completely untrue.  Union members decided to attend for work and refused to carry out not merely work which was in dispute but also other work which they had traditionally performed and which was always accepted as appropriate to their grades.  After more than a month of those tactics being experienced, it was indicated to individual staff members that failure to carry out essential and appropriate duties would result in their not being paid.  The union initiated pickets. If somebody could qualify that process as a lockout&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, agreed at London on 29th June, 1990, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 30th September, 1991.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is now some three years since the Dáil last debated the major issue of the ozone layer depletion.  The perception of this global environmental problem has become much more urgent in the meantime, and I am proposing this motion to seek the Dáil's approval for Ireland's participation in the intensified efforts now to be joined to control offending substances.  I welcome today's debate also for the opportunity which it gives me to review the measures being adopted both at home and internationally to tackle this pressing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern about depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is of quite recent <Col N="1851" /> origin.  A paper in 1974 by two American scientists, Rowland and Molina, postulated on a theoretical basis the likely connection between certain chlorine and bromine emissions and damage to the upper ozone layer.  Chlorofluorocarbons (the so-called CFCs) and halons are potent sources of these chlorine and bromine emissions respectively.  While these chemicals are stable at ground level, they release chlorine or bromine atoms when exposed to ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere.  These atoms break down the ozone (O3) molecule in the upper ozone layer and change it into ordinary oxygen (O2)</P>
    <P>Use of CFCs, of course, had greatly increased since the early 1970s.  They were adopted for use as cooling agents in fridges and air conditioning systems, as propellants in aerosol cans, as solvents in the electronics industry and in other activities, and to blow foam for furniture, packaging and insulation.  Halons are used mainly in fire extinguishers.</P>
    <P>The theory of Rowland and Molina soon found empirical verification with the researches of scientists into the Antarctic stratosphere.  The so-called hole which was identified in the Antarctic ozone layer confirmed the fear that breakdown of this layer might be occurring.  The implications of this discovery were profound. The ozone layer acts as a vital shield for the earth's eco-system, filtering and controlling the penetration of ultra-violet radiation.  Excesses of this radiation threaten human and animal health, particularly in relation to skin cancers and eye diseases and, in addition, will lead to various forms of crop damage.</P>
    <P>Scientists spoke until recently of a hole in the Antarctic ozone layer as big as the United States.  Unfortunately that image has now been replaced by an even more alarming one: on the basis of recent NASA satellite measurements, the ozone hole over the Antarctic has increased to four times the size of the US.  This strongly confirms the need for intensified action by the international community to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>The problem of the ozone layer <Col N="1852" /> depletion has impressed itself on public opinion throughout the world and consumer demand has been mobilised for ozone friendly products.  Allied to legislative action by governments and voluntary agreements by industry, this has led to substantial cuts in the use of CFCs including the virtual elimination of their use in aerosols.</P>
    <P>Today's debate concerns another important step in international efforts to protect the ozone layer.  The Dáil is invited to approve the terms of an agreement which substantially strengthens the provisions of the Montreal Protocol, the UN instrument for control of the production, consumption, import and export of ozone-depleting substances.</P>
    <P>The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was concluded in 1985 under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme; this was a framework convention and was intended to be complemented by more specific protocols. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was agreed in September 1987.  That protocol introduced controls on the production, consumption, import and export of five CFCs and three halons implicated in ozone depletion.  Each party to the protocol was required to ensure that its level of consumption of CFCs was halved by 1998 compared to the 1986 levels; consumption of halons was to be stabilised at 1986 levels by 1992.</P>
    <P>The Montreal Protocol was a major step forward in international co-operation to limit air pollution.  As well as dealing directly with ozone layer depletion, the protocol also makes a significant contribution to the global warming problem in which CFCs are implicated as one of the greenhouse gases.  I will return briefly to this matter later.</P>
    <P>The Montreal Protocol contained a requirement for its ongoing review.  At the first meeting of the parties for this purpose in Helsinki in May 1989, scientists reported that, while there was no ozone hole over the Arctic comparable <Col N="1853" /> to the one which had emerged in Antarctica, the Arctic stratosphere had nonetheless been observed to be perturbed with significant amounts of active chlorine present.  Therefore, there was potential for ozone loss in the region.  Scientists also reported that even with a complete phase-out of CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals, it would be decades, or even centuries, before chlorine levels dropped to the level of the early 1970s because of the long atmosphere residence times of these substances.</P>
    <P>Faced with this evidence, action had to be taken.  Expert working parties were set up to consider what might be done. Their proposals formed the basis for adjusting and amending the Montreal Protocol when the parties met for the second time in London at the end of June 1990.  The European Communities, under the Irish Presidency, played a leading role in ensuring the adoption of more stringent measures with earlier targets for phasing out consumption of ozone-depleting substances.</P>
    <P>The adjustments and amendments agreed in London to the 1987 Montreal Protocol can be classified in three parts:</P>
    <P>First, CFCs and halons already controlled by the 1987 protocol are to be subjected to an accelerated phase-out programme, so as to eliminate their production and consumption by the year 2000, with intermediate targets of a 50 per cent cut by 1995 and an 85 per cent cut by 1997.</P>
    <P>Secondly, new substances were identified for control, namely other fully-halogenated CFCs, carbon tetrachloride which is used mainly to produce CFCs and methyl chloroform which is used as a solvent.  A phase-out date for the production and consumption of these other CFCs and for carbon tetrachloride was also set for the year 2000, and for the year 2005 for methyl chloroform.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, a financial mechanism was established to ensure the widest possible participation by countries in the protocol.  This recognised the burden <Col N="1854" /> which compliance with the new provisions would place on developing countries.  The London Amendment accordingly provides for arrangements relating to financial assistance and technical co-operation, including technology transfers, for developing countries. The mechanism is intended to meet all the agreed incremental costs to these countries of compliance with the protocol.  Pending the formal establishment of the financial mechanism, an interim mechanism will operate in the period 1991-93.</P>
    <P>The London Amendment is a valuable achievement and I commend it unreservedly to the House.  I readily admit, however, that Ireland pressed for and would like to have seen earlier phase-out dates for the substances which were already being controlled by the Montreal Protocol.  However, not all countries were able to agree to this.  But in recognition of the threat to the ozone layer, the member states of the European Communities decided in March 1991 that CFCs and carbon tetrachloride should be phased out earlier within the EC: dates of 1 July 1997 were fixed for CFCs and 1 January 1998 for carbon tetrachloride, two and a half years and two years respectively ahead of the London deadlines.</P>
    <P>The control provisions of the original and the amended Montreal Protocol are being implemented jointly by the EC member states.  EC Regulation 594/91 contains detailed provisions for the progressive phase-out of ozone-depleting substances in the Community.  The Regulation prohibits the importation into the EC from countries which are not a party to the Montreal Protocol of all controlled substances with effect from 1 January 1993; it establishes a quota system and licensing regime to restict imports from parties to the Montreal Protocol; exports of all controlled substances to non-parties are prohibited with effect from 1 January 1993; a management committee, representative of the Commission and the member states, overseas implementation of the Regulation; and producers, <Col N="1855" /> importers and exporters are required to report data on their activities to the Commission on a regular basis.  All of this represents a firm and effective regime and joint Community implementation in this area has already proven successful.</P>
    <P>The situation in Ireland is that none of the controlled substances is manufactured here and our overall use of them is relatively small: it is estimated that current usage of controlled CFCs and halons in Ireland is of the order of 2,500 tonnes per annum or 0.25 per cent of global production and consumption.  This does not mean, of course, that Ireland should not be active in tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>Ireland acceded to the Vienna Convention in September 1988 and ratified the Montreal Protocol the following December.  The Environment Action Programme published in January 1990 promised that Ireland would play an active role in the international debate on ozone depletion.  In August 1990 a document entitled <i>Protecting the Ozone Layer</i> was published by my Department; it outlines in non-scientific terms the problem of ozone depletion and action being taken to counter it.  The document was widely distributed free of charge.</P>
    <P>There is a danger, with efforts being concentrated on control of annual production and consumption, that insufficient attention will be paid to CFCs already in use.  The Government, therefore, decided in their Environment Action Programme to make available to local authorities in 1990 the sum of approximately £50,000 for the provision of facilities to recover CFCs from domestic fridges and freezers.  Recovered CFCs would then be recycled, or destroyed, abroad.  The grants were taken up by 16 local authorities.  A further £50,000 is available for 1991 and grants have been allocated to nine local authorities.  Facilities are shared by some local authorities.  The local authorities are publicising the existence of these CFC recovery plants to encourage people to avail of the facilities to ensure that CFCs are recovered from discarded fridges and <Col N="1856" /> freezers.  Most local authorities operate the recovery facilities at tipheads and the grants have included provision of equipment and assistance towards construction of safe storage areas.</P>
    <P>Direct contact was made also with the industry and significant suppliers and users of CFCs in Ireland were asked to develop individual company programmes to reduce and eliminate the use of these substances as quickly as possible.  I am pleased to report that all of the companies expressed awareness of the requirements involved and responded in positive terms.  I will continue to encourage the total phase-out of these substances in Ireland as rapidly as possible and without waiting for the international curbs on production to have full effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges again the big role played by consumers.  Consumer demand led, for example, to the labelling of CFC free aerosols and indeed the early ending of CFC use in aerosols.  The plethora of labelling on aerosols and other products has of course underlined the case for a well recognised and reliable labelling of environmentally friendly products.  The EC Environment Council is currently considering a regulation for a Community-wide ECO label system. I expect that agreement will be reached on this proposal at the next meeting of Environment Ministers on 9 December. The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, which is currently before this House, requires the agency to set up an ECO label system in accordance with the EC regulation.  I believe that an authoritative ECO label will greatly assist consumers in taking decisions in favour of the environment.</P>
    <P>As might be expected, a major international research effort is under way to develop alternative substances to those being phased out under the terms of the Montreal Protocol.  This research inevitably takes both time and money.  An important part of the process is the assessment of the safety of CFC substitutes, particularly from the point of view of likely toxicity.  I am pleased to note that last month the EC, United <Col N="1857" /> States, Japan and CFC industry representatives reached agreement on the testing procedures needed to be followed in the assessment of the replacement substances.</P>
    <P>Very recent scientific evidence shows that the ozone layer is still a cause for concern.  I have already mentioned the NASA finding about the increased size of the hole in the Antarctic ozone layer. Research by NASA and the World Meteorological Organisation Global Observing System also indicates that depletion of the ozone layer is accelerating at a higher rate than predicted and is spreading to non-polar regions. Such research will continue.  The parties to the Montreal Protocol are continuing to assess the situation with a view to adopting further control measures at a meeting of the parties next year.  The direct purpose of the Montreal Protocol is to halt the process of depletion of the ozone layer.  However, as CFCs contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect, the Montreal Protocol is an important instrument of climate change policy.</P>
    <P>A separate intergovernmental convention on climate change is currently being negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations and it is expected to be adopted at the &ldquo;Earth Summit&rdquo; in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.  The European Communities are participating actively in the negotiations in line with the declaration on the Environment adopted at the European Council in Dublin in June 1990.  A joint Council of Energy and Environment Ministers is scheduled to take place on 10 December to develop the Community position on the basis of the already agreed principle of stabilising Community carbon dioxide emission at the 1990 level by the year 2000.  Climate change strategies will also have to take account of the economic development and enviromental conditions of member states.  At the UN level two further negotiating sessions are scheduled for December and February to finalise a draft convention for the Rio meeting.</P>
    <P>As an aside, I should mention that the very different problems which arise from <Col N="1858" /> tropospheric or low-level ozone are not being ignored.  This pollution results from the chemical reaction, in the presence of sunlight, of nitrogen oxides with volatile organic compounds.  Vehicle emissions are a potent source of this kind of pollution, which has reached critical levels in, for example, Los Angeles and Athens, but not, thankfully, in Ireland. Measures to control vehicle emissions and volatile organic compounds are being intensified at international level and will be increasingly implemented during this decade.</P>
    <P>I know the House will share my view of the importance of Ireland accepting the Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The motion comes before us today because of the requirements of Article 29, sub-article 5.2 of the Constitution, under which the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.  A charge on public funds arises from the proposed financial mechanism I referred to earlier; the liability under the interim arrangements is likely to be of the order of £70,000 in 1991 and £93,000 in 1992 and 1993.  Payments will be financed from the Environment Vote.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the next EC Environment Council in December will decide on acceptance by the Community of the London Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.  The Community and member states plan to ratify this simultaneously. It is important that Ireland should go to the Council having completed the required procedures and be in a position to actively support ratification of this measure by all member states.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion deals with a very technical subject.  Therefore, it is not likely to be a headline-grabbing one. Nonetheless it is a very important motion and deals with an issue which is of critical importance not just to Ireland and the EC but to the globe.  Despite the fact that we have a Minister for the Environment and two Ministers of State I am greatly <Col N="1859" /> surprised that no Minister from the Department of the Environment could be found to come here today to move this very important motion.  This does not show any great interest or priority in this issue on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech did not in any sense impart the menacing nature of the depletion of the ozone layer.  He did not convey any idea which ordinary people could readily understand of the implications of the erosion of the ozone layer unless we take urgent action to stop that erosion.  For instance, I understand, if action is not taken speedily, that within 30 to 40 years, and certainly within 60 years, the depletion of the ozone layer will have a catastrophic effect on the level of the seas around us.  Those of us who live on an island have particular cause for concern in that respect.</P>
      <P>The depletion of the ozone layer will form the basis of the complete annihilation of many parts of the earth's land surface unless action is taken.  That is no exaggeration.  Scientists predict that within 60 years at the outside the ice caps on both the North and South Poles will have so melted away and sea levels will have so increased that much of the earth's land mass will be submerged.  I do not see any reference to this in the Minister's speech.  Yet it is one of the most easily explained consequences of the depletion of the ozone layer as people readily understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action needs to be taken urgently. Unfortunately, the actions necessary will greatly retard the already slow economic development of much of the Third World.  The steps which need to be taken will greatly prevent the Third World from getting above a certain level of economic development.  Therefore, there has had to be a compromise both in the original Protocol at Montreal and the refinement of it at Helsinki.  Because of the need to balance the catastrophic environmental implications with the economic imperatives of the Third World dates have been set which are much less urgent than what reality dictates.  Of course, we in the First <Col N="1860" /> World have to have regard to the desperately urgent needs of the Third World.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that in conceding a delay in the dates for the use of halons and CFCs we are taking a wise decision.  I am not convinced that the compromise which is dictated by an understandable concern not to impede the economic development of the Third World is a wise one.  I would like to see much earlier dates for phasing out these dangerous gases and substances.  I know the European Community has agreed to phase out, within member states, uses of these substances before the due date under the terms of the London agreement.  That is a good step but I still do not believe that the right balance is being struck as between the economic and the environmental. The balance is too much in favour of the economic and does not take into account fully the gravity of the environmental threat and the depletion of the ozone layer.</P>
    <P>The EC, Japan, the US and Canada must act in a much more determined way to address the economic problems of the rest of the world.  I do not see that sort of self-enlightened magnanimity in relation to the economic development of the rest of the world.  It is the economic development outside the 25 richest countries of the world that is causing the greatest erosion of the environment whether it is the air, the waters or the forests.  All these things arise from economic underdevelopment outside the 25 richest countries of the world, of which we are one.</P>
    <P>Long-term economics, good sense and enlightened policy would dictate that the European Community together with the other 25 rich countries of the OECD come together and draw up a major economic plan for the rest of the world, otherwise the erosion of the environment will continue at a pace which is utterly unacceptable. I know that one of the fora for looking at global economic issues is the GATT talks.  I would like to say in passing that the GATT discussions, even though they are basically economic, have profound potential implications for the <Col N="1861" /> world's environment.  It seems to me that our Government and the other Governments of the EC should take a longer term perspective in relation to those current talks.  It is in our long term interest, not only that the erosion of the environment is halted as quickly as possible, but that the Third World is assisted in reaching basic standards of economic development because, in due course when they have reached that stage, they will then do trade.  That is the sort of enlightened view that was taken by the US after the victory of the Second World War in it's Marshall Plan.  We need a new Marshall Plan for the Third World for economic reasons but particularly for environmental reasons.  There is a great urgency about this.  In this House the longest serving Deputy is Deputy Blaney who has been here in 43 years.  It may well be that there are some Deputies here now who may be here for 43 years too. Even you Sir, might be here then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Taoiseach said a few weeks ago he may be here.  In 43 years' time if there is not a much more determined attack on the things that are undermining the global environment the situation could be dramatically disimproved.  The world could be a very different place, a much worse place than it is today.  In the political lifetime of even some of the younger Members of this House if something urgent is not done, both here and internationally, the effects on the environment could be enormous.  Along with those effects there would be major health factors.  The new Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon, has spent four and a quarter years in the Department of Health and he knows the cost of health care.  He would be more familiar than most with health factors and would know how much cheaper is prevention rather than cure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment published an excellent booklet last year on protecting the ozone layer.  I suggest <Col N="1862" /> that booklet be reissued to draw the attention of the public to the health implications of the ongoing erosion of the ozone layer.  That publication addresses the implications for health, agriculture, marine life and buildings if this erosion continues.  We learned today from the Minister's speech that the erosion of the ozone layer is four times greater than was previously thought.  The situation has become four times worse than when this booklet was published last year.  The Antarctic hole in the ozone layer is now reckoned to be four times the size of the US.  I do not know whether that means the risk is four times greater but certainly the threat is greater.  The ultra-violet rays of the sun penetrating to humanity have four times more scope than we thought previously.  This can do enormous damage to genetic material which can cause all sorts of long term problems with children being born with deformities etc. It can exacerbate cancer, especially skin cancers which are causing so many deaths.  It greatly reduces the efficiency of the immune system, and we are all aware of how rapidly AIDS is escalating. That arises from a breakdown in the human immunity system.  This increased risk can increase the incidence of blindness because it can affect the eyes and can accentuate cataracts etc.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this is no unimportant boring Friday afternoon matter.  It is a vitally important issue, one to which we need to alert people increasingly.  We need to get more people on the side of the environment, to use discretion in the commodities they are prepared to buy and use and to be co-operative in disposing of those items which contribute to the erosion of the ozone layer.  In that respect the step by some local authorities to provide a disposal facility for old fridges etc. that cause CFCs and halons to be injected into the atmosphere is a welcome development.  Will the Minister let us know what further plans he has to extend this service to more local authorities than the nine presently providing the facility and what further plans he has to publicise it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of this subject and even more difficult to interest the public in it.  We need global action in this area.  If even a handful of countries do not take action and continue to use substances which will erode the ozone layer they can threaten the entire globe.  It is not easy to get all countries to agree on global action but the GATT talks should facilitate that process. The process can be helped by the World Environment Conference to be held in Rio de Janeiro next year.  I hope we will have an opportunity in advance of the Rio conference to debate in this House the implications of the conference, its potential and the contribution we are going to make to the conference.</P>
    <P>We readily agree to this motion because it will facilitate a decision by the EC countries to act next month in relation to the Helsinki addition to the Montreal Protocol.  At future meetings of the Environment Council of the EC the Minister should stress the urgency felt here with regard to more speedy action to prevent the depletion of the ozone layer.</P>

I do not propose to make the Minister's task in that respect any easier, but I am sure we will have plenty of opportunities to exchange views as the months go on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate now taking place on the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer.  I regret that it has taken almost a year and a half since the London conference at which the amendments to the Montreal conference were agreed, for this debate to take place here.  There is now a fairly widespread understanding among the public generally that the ozone layer is being depleted and there is an understanding and awareness in connection with some of the substances which are contributing to that depletion. There is also general public awareness of the threat which the depletion of the ozone layer poses to the future of the globe and the more immediate threat which it poses to the health of people including our own citizens.  It is well established that the depletion of the ozone layer is contributing to skin cancers. When one considers that about 30 per cent of the cancers detected here are skin cancers, it is something that has very direct relevance for the health and wellbeing of the people on this island, apart altogether from the threat it poses to the globe generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a mistaken view that the depletion of the ozone layer is confined to the Antarctic, to the hole that was <Col N="1865" /> detected in the ozone layer over the Antarctic. There is now considerable scientific evidence, and the Minister of State referred to some of it earlier, which was presented to the London conference, which shows that the extent of the depletion of the ozone layer is greater than had previously been understood and that it is far more extensive and not by any means confined to a relatively small area over the Antarctic.  The Australian delegate at the London conference reported a 15 per cent ozone loss occurring over MacQuarie Island which is 55º south, over the last ten years.  It is in a region which typically has high ozone levels.  The region is outside the south polar vortex where the ozone hole forms, extending over a 30º mid latitude and 300º longitude range, about one-eight of the planet.  The northern hemisphere has a similar region extending approximately across Britain and Ireland, Europe, the Soviet Union, the North Pacific Ocean, Canada and the Northern United States. Evidence was also presented by another scientist who found that in areas which were measured in Germany and in Switzerland there was a strong decrease in the ozone layer and that the decrease in those areas over 20 years is approximately 0.5 per cent per year, leading to 10 per cent reductions in lower stratospheric ozone levels after 1967.  Observations from New Zealand show a strong decrease in the yearly average ozone column of 4º to 6º degrees over the last three years compared to the average from 1974 to 1983.  This might be an indication that the special chemistry observed over Antarctica is occurring outside the polar vortex, leading to a more widespread ozone depletion of the southern hemisphere than previously.  The problem relating to the ozone layer is not confined to the area around the Antarctic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell in his contribution referred to a need to stimulate public interest in the problem of the depletion of the ozone layer.  I do not think public interest needs to be stimulated in this area, because the public are well ahead of the politicians in their awareness of the problem of the ozone layer.  One has <Col N="1866" /> only to walk around the corridors of this building today, for example, to find that some colleagues regard the idea of a debate on the depletion of the ozone layer as a matter of some mild amusement, a Friday afternoon filler in the Dáil's agenda, rather than a matter which is, and which the public regard as, extremely serious.  The policy makers have been well behind public opinion, certainly behind scientific evidence and opinion, in relation to the ozone layer over the past 20 years.  Indeed, if the policy makers had taken seriously the first indications and evidence presented about depletion in the ozone layer the degree of the problem might not now be as great.</P>
    <P>As far back as the early seventies scientists warned that the ozone layer might be endangered.  In 1974 scientists identified that CFCs might be a possible cause of the depletion.  Some countries at that time banned CFCs, but it was not until almost a decade and a half later that the first Montreal Protocol was agreed, and that was only after British scientists had discovered the hole in the ozone layer in 1985.</P>
    <P>It is now widely acknowledged that the 1987 Protocol was inadequate.  The fact, for example, that these amendments &mdash; some of them are very significant &mdash; are to be made is proof of that.  My worry now is that the amended protocol may not be adequate, and I feel that this country should be giving more of a lead in the international debate than it is doing.</P>
    <P>Essentially, this Protocol is an international agreement for a phasing out of CFCs by the year 2000.  That certainly is an improvement on the unlimited use of CFCs or the more conservative approach to the phasing out of CFCs contained in the 1987 Protocol.  We have to bear in mind what that means.  It means that for the next decade the world will continue to produce, in very large quantities, substances which we already know are depleting the ozone layer and which have already caused a depletion of the ozone layer to the extent of the evidence already produced.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying that if one finds <Col N="1867" /> oneself in a hole the first thing one does is to stop digging.  One thing we could apply to the ozone layer is that if we detect a hole in the ozone layer we should stop spraying at it.  Unfortunately, the Protocol before us does not provide for that.  It provides for a phasing out, a relatively slow phasing out, but it seems that that is not adequate.  The inadequacy of the year 2000 deadline is highlighted by the number of countries who have declared voluntarily to phase out the use of CFCs completely by the year 1997.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that many countries, as the Minister of State said in his contribution, sought an earlier date to ban CFCs.  It is interesting to note that the principal opposition to that ban at London came from the United States and Japan who have very significant industrial interests.  They would seem to be putting the industrial and economic interests of their own States ahead of the international need to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>One matter not dealt with in the new Protocol is HCFCs, the substitute for CFCs.  They do not appear to have been brought within the ambit of the Protocol. CFC substitutes, called HCFCs are 2 per cent to 10 per cent as ozone depleting as the bench mark CFC11 and are potent greenhouse gases contributing to global warming.  A number of governments have, or soon will, take domestic action to curb use of these environmentally damaging substances.  HCFCs have not been brought into the Montreal Protocol. European Community and Japanese opposition to controls on HCFCs are largely to blame for international inaction. Governments have sanctioned production of a new generation of ozone destroyers, giving the chemical industry <i>carte blanche</i> in legal terms to use these as it pleases.  This is an area that now needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Essentially the problem posed for the ozone layer by the production of CFCs and other substances which deplete the ozone layer is essentially one caused by the developed world.  Almost 88 per cent of the use of ozone depleting substances is in the developed world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1868" /> In addressing the issue of the depletion of the ozone layer &mdash; and here I agree with Deputy Mitchell &mdash; we have to take account of the need to address the problem of underdevelopment in and the need to provide development aid for the Third World.  A fund will be established under the amended Protocol to provide some assistance for the countries in the developing world to enable them approach development without the use of substances which deplete the ozone layer, but the amount of money provided is pathetic.  The amount of money this State is committed to provide under that arrangement &mdash; £70,000 in 1991, £93,000 in 1992 and 1993 &mdash; would hardly buy a car for a former Government Minister much less make a serious contribution to a major international problem of this kind.  The UNEP which has done a lot of work in this area is seriously underfunded and that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the absence of steps being taken in Ireland to address the problem.  The amount of money provided under the environment action plan, £50,000 per annum in grants to local authorities, is completely inadequate.  There is very little any local authority or group of local authorities can do with such a small sum.  If the Government are serious about giving effect to the Montreal Protocol a greater sum of money should be provided in the Estimates and made available to local authorities to enable them provide safe methods of disposing of fridges and other commodities which use CFCs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister to the House in his new position as Minister for the Environment.  Deputy O'Hanlon's family, and my own, go back some time.  It is in the nature of Irish society that one cannot move very far on this island without bumping into somebody who has not had a close relationship with one's family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy related?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very proud to claim relationship with Dr. O'Hanlon on a <Col N="1869" /> family basis.  We have radically different political views but I do not think that should get in the way of the bonds of affection.  I do not think for my part or, indeed, for his that they do.  I wish him well in his new post.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that a medical doctor should assume responsibility for the Department of the Environment because the health implications for the human race, and for Irish people in particular, of the deterioration in the protection from the rays of the sun in the context of skin cancer are very serious.  For this reason the advent of Deputy O'Hanlon at the Department of the Environment, given his political experience and medical expertise, is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go over the ground covered aleady by Deputy Mitchell, whom I listened to on the monitor, and by Deputy Gilmore but I put it to the Minister in relation to what can be done here at home, because what we are doing in effect is ratifying an international convention, that our biggest problem is in facilitating those people who have preenvironmentally conscious type fridges in their possession to dispose of them in time.  There is no satisfactory system of disposing of these items.  We are all aware of the politics which surround the provision of refuse tips and disposal sites but I earnestly request the Minister and his Department to communicate with the local authorities on how best this problem can be dealt with.  There is little point in us bringing forward the date by which the production of CFCs must cease if the CFCs already produced can be discharged into the environment where they would have the same negative effect as new CFCs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The slogan which has been adopted by a number of environmentally conscious groups is &ldquo;Think globally and act locally&rdquo;.  We are thinking globally but we must act locally.  In particular we have to think specifically about our own local authority areas.  Besides being Minister for the Environment in the broader sense Deputy O'Hanlon is also responsible for local government and the local authorities. He has a precise and concise role <Col N="1870" /> in that area.  One has to reinforce the concerns expressed by Deputy Gilmore who indicated that it is a serious matter and that if the ozone layer continues to deplete, the life expectancy of Irish people, because of increased risk to skin cancer, will be reduced below the level of, dare I say it, a Cheann Comhairle, of that of your own generation.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make, and again I concur with Deputy Gilmore, is that the Irish public are way ahead of the political decision makers in this regard.  Young people in particular, including members of my own family, have expressed to me their concerns about the ozone layer because they think globally on these maters.  All the measures being proposed, such as an ecolabelling system, all of which I support, cannot come soon enough.  I would encourage the Minister, his staff and the environmental agencies associated with the Department of the Environment to bring these measures forward.  They will have to be brought forward, however, in the context of the single market, on a European wide basis.  There would be little point in bringing them forward in the Republic of Ireland only.</P>
    <P>While over 80 per cent of CFCs are used in the developed world the Third World does have its problems.  There is a real danger that products containing a high level of CFCs which are no longer acceptable for sale on the retail markets in the developed world because of their damaging effect on the environment will be dumped on Third World markets.  I am not sure what the Minister for the Environment can do in this respect but it is a matter which should be noted.  The environmental protection elements of our bilateral aid programmes, in addition to our multilateral aid programmes, for a small number of countries should include a refrence to the problems associated with CFCs.</P>
    <P>Most people are of the view that climatic changes, such as those that occurred in the Ice Age, take place over a long period of time and therefore can never affect us.  They are of the view that the climatic changes of the scale we are <Col N="1871" /> talking about will take so long to occur that it does not really matter.  History tells a different story.  For example, one can visit the ruins of cities that are now in the middle of deserts, such as the classic Roman city of Magnus Leptis which is located 40 to 60 kilometres south west of Tripoli in Libya.  Tripoli was the home town of the Emperor Hadrian who built the famous wall dividing Scotland and England.  The north coast of Africa, most of which is now desert, was verdant up to about 1200 AD.  However, because of climatic changes and changes in agricultural practices, in particular the introduction of the goat which cropped all the grass, the top layer of the soil covering large portions of that part of the world, which had been the bread basket of the Roman Empire, was irrevocably altered. That is the point I am making: an area which for the previous 2,000 to 3,000 years had been as verdant and which had a temperate climate, similar to the climate on the other side of the Mediterranean, was converted in the space of about 200 years into desert.  Once the process of desertification takes place it cannot be reversed.  The same could happen with the ozone layer.</P>
    <P>We can go back in time in determining what the future may hold for us.  One can walk through the streets of Magnus Leptis and see the baths and the elaborate system, unique at the time, which the Romans constructed in a city which is estimated to have had a population of between 120,000 and 150,000 which would make it similar in size to the city of Cork.  In other words, it was a very big urban settlement and sufficiently sophisticated politically to produce an emperor of the Roman Empire but it is now desert.  Therefore, climatic changes are not new and the timeframe involved is comparatively short.  I support the views expressed by Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Gilmore that we have to try to convey this message to the decision makers because, quite frankly, the public, in particular our young people, have already accepted the message.  It is for that reason that I welcome the <Col N="1872" /> Minister's appointment because he will bring to the Department a dimension which was absent in the past.</P>
    <P>It comes down to the question of getting local authorities to communicate with the people in their areas in the matter of providing special systems of collection for the offending articles which contain CFCs and systems of disposal which are both safe and properly managed. While this may not amount to much globally it is the only relevant course of action that is open to us locally.  Now that the dust has settled on the political horizon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

If Dublin Corporation are given the money that we know the Minister will give us, he is a generous man at heart, we will be able to deal with the problem at local level and if he gives us the level of rate support grant we need and which has been requested, I can assure him on behalf of the civic alliance and even of the entire city council &mdash; I am sure Deputy Mitchell will agree with me &mdash; that we will make a special effort in Dublin city to deal with the problem of securely disposing of offending articles which contain CFCs, such as fridges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my good wishes to the new Minister.  As previous speakers mentioned it is interesting that he comes from the Health portfolio and, being a medical doctor, I am sure he will have a particular interest in this area because it impinges so much on people's health.  I hope that, in his new capacity, he will be preaching the necessity to take great care with sunbathing which causes a lot of skin cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very pleasant debate, we are all &mdash; including the Minister &mdash; on the <Col N="1873" /> side of the angels and I hope it will make up for some of the rancour, bitterness and personalised attacks made in this House over the last couple of days.  I hope we have seen the last of that.  Every few weeks in newspapers and journals there are new reports about the thinning of the ozone layer.  The latest problem, as the Minister is probably aware, emanates from southern Chile, where the animal kingdom are seriously affected; there are blind salmon and rabbits with bulging eyes.  Apart from the effect this will have on us, as hunters and consumers of wild creatures, we must also have sympathy for them as they have a right to be on this planet.  They are entitled to live their lives without these terrible diseases being inflicted on them which are caused directly by us.  They do not have any control over the management of this planet; the planet is managed by us and I am sure all Members in the House agree that we have made a woeful mess of it. The result impinges on us and on the animals and plants who share the earth with us.  We must always remember that.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his comprehensive speech &mdash; and previous speakers &mdash; made a number of points and I will not go over them again.  I commend to the Minister the sentiments expressed by Deputy Quinn in the latter part of his speech. Now that our party have councillors in the city and Dublin county councils I am getting constant complaints about money shortages, particularly in this area, and if the Minister could be more generous it would go a long way.  It is very important, for instance, that refrigerators are disposed of in a proper fashion.  That would cost very little but, up to now, it has not been done although I know that Dublin County Council are making progress in that area.</P>
    <P>When we examine some of the products which cause the ozone depletion, the first thing we must ask is whether we need them.  The propellants in aerosol cans are a major contributory factor in the ozone layer depletion.  I know that progress has been made using environmentally friendly substitutes but one could ask an even more fundamental question: do we <Col N="1874" /> really need the contents of these aerosol cans?  I suggest that, in many cases, they are not necessary or even desirable.  We should look at this area.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister referred to the problem of car emissions.  I know that the car is a necessary evil &mdash; and it is undoubtedly an evil &mdash; but we would all find it very hard to do without one.  I confess that I would find it very hard to do without a car.  Have we done enough in this area?  I do not think that the control of motor vehicle emissions, useful as it is, is any substitute for the development of an electric car, which has been hindered by the oil industry for a number of years.  We should also have improved public transport which would enable us to get round much more easily.  This is the kind of thinking we need to get away from the narrow outlook, to broaden our horizons and to examine our lifestyles and the way we do business.  There are all sorts of ways in which we could improve our environment, not just in this area, but in many others.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn said, young people are way ahead of us in many cases, they are doing things voluntarily and we should encourage this by providing more information to enable consumers to make a better choice because, inevitably, these conventions move very slowly and must be ratified by many different countries. While we are on the subject of ratification it is very pleasing that we are, for once, within the deadline.  Many times in this House I have seen conventions ratified ten or fifteen years after they were originally signed.  As the Minister probably knows, it is a requirement of the amendment to the Montreal Convention that, before it comes into effect, at least 20 signatories shall have ratified it.  Perhaps the Minister will say whether 20 countries have in fact ratified the convention and that it will come into effect on 1 January 1992.  If not, I ask the Minister to take whatever steps he can to make representations to a sufficiently large number of countries to have it ratified. We have an obligation here beyond <Col N="1875" /> merely ratifying the convention, we must see that it is ratified.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to industry and some of the multinational companies.  It appears that some of them, who have been responsible for so much of the degradation of our planet are now at last waking up to their responsibilities, which is very good news.  I have it on very good authority that the IBM Corporation in America some months ago issued a circular to their branches and subsidiary companies throughout the world saying that CFCs will be eliminated from their products in two years' time.  They added that the companies concerned were not to say that it could not be done or that it would cost too much, they were told just to get on with it and to do it.  If all the large international corporations did this it would be the right approach because substitutes can be found for these things. It is a cop-out to say that they cost too much and that it will take five, ten or 15 years to bring them into use.  It is amazing what we can do if we are put to it.  I commend the example of IBM to other companies and there may well be many others; I am just using them as an example.  I would be delighted to hear from other companies who are doing this, they should get up on their soap box and tell us about it because the more companies who do it the more it encourages others to do it.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Green Party commend this convention to the House.  We are all agreed that the depletion of the ozone layer is probably one of the most serious environmental crises to confront the planet.  While I welcome this amended protocol progress to date has been painfully slow.  In order to effect the necessary reductions and the eventual elimination of CFCs it is necessary to have cohesve international action, hence the need for these types of protocols.</P>
    <P>Useful as this amendment is, it by no means goes far enough.  There are serious problems relating to this protocol.  If we look at the compliance procedures, for example, they are extremely weak.  At the convention, delegates from a number <Col N="1876" /> of countries rejected punitive measures in favour of setting out procedures to discuss problems which might arise.  A number of countries regard the procedures as inadequate.  Norway and the United States were instrumental in ensuring that the non-compliance working group will meet further in an attempt to improve on this mechanism.  This is an area we certainly need to look into.  The countries involved are Trinidad and Tobago, Hungary, Uganda, Norway and Japan.</P>
    <P>It must be said again that this revised protocol will not protect us from the risk of severe ozone depletion and the catastrophic environmental damage this would bring about.  The protocol allows parties to take more stringent measures and controls legally required by the protocol itself, but all too few countries have legislated to take advantage of the provisions of Article 2.11.  A few nations have blazed trails for others to follow by setting national goals to eliminate these substances on a sector by sector basis, demonstrating that tougher targets can and should be pursued.  At the same time their industries often get ahead in new technology.</P>
    <P>The stark reality is that if one or two industrialised countries can force the pace there is no excuse for others to hang back.  It is the political will which is lacking, not the technical means to protect the ozone layer.  Non-Government organisations will focus on appropriate national action to create the conditions for a more stringent agreement to see that the protocol is revised again.  Once again I commend this amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to thank Deputies Mitchell, Quinn, Gilmore and Garland for their good wishes on my appointment to the Department of the Environment.  I look forward very much to working with them in a constructive way for the benefit of the people we represent.  It is interesting that comments were made about my transfer from the Department of Health to the Department <Col N="1877" /> of the Environment.  Yesterday when I was speaking about my transfer I referred to the fact, as I did often in the Department of Health, that environmental policies contribute as much to the maintenance and improvement of health as do the health professionals.  I referred specifically to the advent of water and sanitary services as being a major contributor worldwide, where these services have been developed, to the improvement of the health of the people of so many nations.  It is also important that we do not forget that the Department of Health were part of the former Department of Local Government and Public Health until 1947.</P>
      <P>We have had a very constructive debate on this motion and, again, I thank Deputies for that.  They have rightly stressed the global nature of many of the environmental problems facing us and the corresponding need for coherent global solutions.  This is a new and important orientation of international environmental efforts.  Until the mideighties the major pre-occupation of international environmental activity was with transboundary or regional problems: management of shared marine areas or river catchments, transboundary transport of air pollutants and other regionally related issues tended to be the focus of attention.</P>
      <P>The publication in 1987 of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, the so-called Brundtland report, was a watershed for a new more global approach to environmental management.  Entitled &ldquo;Our Common Future&rdquo;, the report stresses the interdependence and commonality of the world's environmental problems.  It advanced the concept of sustainable development as the key to a more rational and viable management of our natural resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke about the dangers of a sea level rise to an island country such as Ireland.  This is an urgent and threatening problem, but it does not directly arise from the phenomenon of ozone layer depletion.  It is related rather to the question of climate change in <Col N="1878" /> which, as the Minister of State has said, CFCs play a significant but not an exclusive part.  CFCs are one of the major man-made contributions to the problem of global warming.  Their impact as a greenhouse gas is highly concentrated and persistent, and they represent 20 per cent of man-made greenhouse emissions.  Elimination of CFCs therefore has two beneficial environmental impacts; it eases pressure on ozone layer depletion and on the increase in greenhouse gases.  Carbon dioxide emissions arising from the combustion of fossil fuels are of course the prime source of greenhouse gases.  The strategy for dealing with global warming must address centrally the question of carbon dioxide control.  Measures to this end are being urgently debated at European Community level at present against the background of agreement in principle already reached by Environment and Energy Ministers to stabilise Community carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the Department's booklet on protecting the ozone layer.  I thank him for his compliments about the booklet and I assure him that copies of it are still available from ENFO, the environmental information service, and also directly from the Department.  Deputy Mitchell also referred, as did Deputies Gilmore and Quinn, to the need to involve developing countries in global environmental strategies. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development has been mandated to translate the principles of the Brundtland report into a set of global conventions and action programmes for the protection of the environment. UNCED hope to conclude in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 an earth chapter setting out fundamental legal principles for environmental protection, specific conventions on biodiversity and on climate change and a so-called Agenda 21 which will set out a series of practical action programmes for the management of different natural resources.  The need to develop special measures to enable the developing world to participate in all of these elements <Col N="1879" /> will be a central theme of the UNCED process.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Deputies that the Irish Government will be making a special contribution to the UNCED preparatory process by hosting a major UN conference on water and the environment in Dublin in February 1992.  The conclusions of this conference will feed directly into the Agenda 21 process.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the need to prevent further depletion of the ozone layer and asked what we are doing in this country in that regard.  As was explained in the opening contribution, the international scientific panel assisting the review of the Montreal Protocol has produced evidence of a worsening situation across most of the globe as regards ozone layer depletion.  Deputies referred to that also. These findings are expected to lead to proposals for an even more accelerated phasing out of ozone-depleting chemicals in the further review of the Montreal Protocol next year.  This should be feasible within the industrialised countries at least, and Ireland would support such a proposal.  The major world producers of CFCs have also indicated that an earlier phase out may be possible.</P>
    <P>I should also stress to the House that the European Community has already set more advanced phase-out targets for the main CFCs and for carbon tetrachloride than the Montreal Protocol has set.  I should clarify also that HCFCs are covered by the original Monteal Protocol of 1987 and not by this amendment.  Of <Col N="1880" /> course, Ireland is contributing to the protocol's financial mechanism in accordance with the established UN rate of contributions for such funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the nine local authorities who are grant-aided by the Department.  Sixteen local authorities were grant-aided initially and an additional nine were grant-aided in the current year, making a total of 25 who are grant-aided out of the 32 local authorities. I hope the remaining local authorities will be grant-aided in the near future.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the need for a number of signatures to the amendment to bring it into effect.  I understand that 11 signatures are necessary &mdash; Deputy Garland thought 20 signatures were necessary &mdash; and four countries have already ratified this amendment. When the European Community as a block ratify it, this will bring the number of signatures up to 16 and the amendment will come into operation in the countries that have ratified it.  I agree with Deputies that as many countries as possible should ratify the amendment, which has an important bearing on protecting the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Deputies for their very constructive and interesting contributions. I look forward to working with them in a whole range of areas for which my Department have responsibility.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3.5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 November 1991.</P>

</Debate>
