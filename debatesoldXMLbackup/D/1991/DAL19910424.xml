      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputies John Bruton and Pat Rabbitte.  I observe that the notices relate to the same subject matter and I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call, therefore, on Deputy Pat Rabbitte to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest, namely, the current industrial dispute in the ESB which is causing serious difficulties for industry leading to workers being laid off, major problems for agriculture and inconvenience for domestic consumers, and the urgent need for the Government to intervene to secure a negotiated settlement to this dispute.  In view of the virtually unprecedented extent of the power cuts and the serious implications for the country of this dispute continuing it is essential that the Dáil should be allowed <Col N="874" /> to debate the matter today and I, therefore, urge you, Sir, to agree to my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to request the Adjournment of the Dáil under the provisions of Standing Order 30 to discuss the urgent matter of the permanent damage to the economy, the loss of jobs and the effect on vulnerable sections of the community arising from the continuing dispute in the statutory body which is responsible for the supply of electricity, the ESB.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, therefore, cannot grant leave to move the motion.  The House will recollect that this matter was discussed here yesterday by way of five Private Notice Questions representative of each of the Opposition parties and Independents in the House. There are other ways of pursuing the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I in no way wish to contest your ruling in the matter but you may recollect that when I asked the Taoiseach if he agreed that there should be an ongoing procedure for the House to be kept informed on this matter he indicated his agreement to that.  This seems to suggest that there is a desire on both sides of the House to ensure that the House is kept informed on the matter.  I wonder, Sir, if in reviewing your ruling on this matter you would take into account the will of the House in this matter.  Would it be possible for the Standing Orders under which you very correctly act to be suspended so that this matter can be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say in <Col N="875" /> reply to Deputy Bruton that the House is supreme in such matters and the Chair will gladly implement its will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I can help the situation, I will be glad to find some way of reporting to the House some time today but I would urge on the House the need for caution in this area.  At present the matter is fully before the Labour Relations Commission and very sensitive negotiations are in progress before that commission.  In my view it would be wise to wait for some time before I report to the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider the potential usefulness of an agreed resolution, signed by all the party Leaders in this House, calling on all the parties concerned to ensure that the interruption of work ceases?  I urge on the Taoiseach the possibility that such an agreed approach from all parties could provide a pretext towards a solution.  Perhaps the Taoiseach, without necessarily responding to this now, could enter into discussions with me and other party leaders with a view to seeing whether such an approach might be useful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very glad to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute the Chair's decision in this matter in relation to Standing Order 30 but it is extraordinary that an issue of such major national importance cannot on an emergency basis be debated in this House today.  I take the point the Taoiseach has made with regard to the sensitivity of the issue, but I am quite certain that Deputies would bear that in mind in their contributions to any debate that might take place. I do not accept that because questions were put to the Minister for Energy here yesterday, it is an adequate response by this House to the situation.</P>

In view of that, will the Taoiseach give an indication that the long promised legislation to update the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are currently based in the Statute of 1866, ought to be given high priority this session?  Will the Taoiseach give a concrete indication that this legislation will be introduced this session?</P>

Will the Taoiseach give an opportunity to the Minister to give details as to how local authorities can act on the proposal until the end of this year?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the exodus from the House is not an indication of the interest of Members in the Finance Bill or indeed of my capacity to enthral the House with an illuminating address on its intricacies. I appreciate that Members have to leave the House and I am waiting, Sir, with your agreement for the noise to die down.</P>
      <P>Yesterday evening I reminded the Minister that it will be necessary for him when replying to Second Stage to set out quite clearly the assumptions and premises on which the Finance Bill is based as it will give legitimacy to the budget of 1991.  In the course of my remarks I drew his attention to the fact that on 30 January this year he forecast an economic growth rate of 2.25 per cent for this year.  However, in introducing the Bill yesterday he was less forthcoming and stated:</P>
      <P>Though it will be no easy task to attain our budget day forecasts for growth, I remain optimistic about the short term prospects for the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is obliged to tell not just <Col N="885" /> this House and the nation at large but those institutions who have an important role to play in our market economy what estimate for growth the Department of Finance are working on at present.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening I outlined the way in which we can evaluate the performance of the economy during the next year and the implications of the Finance Bill. We will be able on Committee Stage to go into some detail on the various sections but I ask the Minister to devote some time when replying, if he can within the time constraints imposed, to the question of the policy of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners on self-assessment and the taxation system.  The Minister indicated in the course of his address that income tax and capital taxes related to personal income will increasingly be included in a package of self-assessment measures to be administered by the Revenue Commissioners but it is fair to say that until such time that there is a perception among the body politic that self-assessment is going to be enforced and the sanctions applied people will continue to feel it is worth the risk or taking a chance and not comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Most people in this country have a connection with or are familiar with the United States and are aware of the dread of citizens and taxpayers of that country of the IRS, the Internal Revenue Services. I am not going to take up the time of the House by outlining just how draconian the powers of the IRS are but until such time that the person who can be shown to have wilfully attempted to evade his tax liabilities by reducing significantly or falsifying the self-assessment return, the amount of tax that he is obliged to pay to the Revenue Commissioners, is punished &mdash;it is up to the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners to determine what the punishment should be &mdash; I do not think the self-assessment system is going to work.</P>
    <P>We have faced for many years the problem of alcohol abuse and of drink driving.  Until we collectively put together a system of sanctions and penalties <Col N="886" /> that, among other things, results in the automatic loss of the driving licence for 12 months &mdash; with a possible return after six months &mdash; there will be a certain disregard for the law.  There is now a clear understanding here of sanctions in relation to that abuse.  The sanctions have brought home the seriousness of that problem.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to elaborate on the state of discussions between his Department and the Revenue Commissioners on the administration of the taxation system in the area of self-assessment.  As we move more and more into self-assessment the public at large will be convinced that self-assessment means realistic self-assessment and compliance with the figures put together by them when submitting their returns.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the House heard Deputy Noonan talk about the Temple Bar provisions. I do not want to repeat observations he made except to say that the Government of which I was a member brought forward the initial concept of designated areas for Dublin city in the first instance and a number of other cities. There was a recognition that at any time in any economy there is a demand for construction activity.  All designation can achieve is to try to direct that activity to certain areas where, in the first instance, if there was a level pitch of competitiveness, it would not be because there were more attractive locations.</P>
    <P>We are now running the danger &mdash; perhaps in some respects we have run the danger &mdash; of tax-led construction being in excess of demand.  Estimates suggest that in the Dublin area alone there is a tax-led supply of approximately two million square feet of office space when the annual demand for such space is of the order of 500,000 square feet.  Indeed, a casual drive around Dublin city will show that some of the tax-led inner city development projects have stalled and have not proceeded past their first phase. I am giving a very truncated exposition of what is well known in the property market in Dublin, is well understood by property and construction economists and by officials in the Department of <Col N="887" /> the Environment and, I am sure, the Department of Finance.  Against the original background of recognising that designation was related to overall maximum demand and the capacity of the economy to ensure there would be supply to meet that demand, the first designation was drawn up in the Finance Act, 1986. That was subsequently enlarged and in Dublin, where designation has been least successful, the operation that took place approximately a year ago was very extensive. As a consequence it has diluted the impact designation was intended to have because of the sheer physical scale of the city.</P>
    <P>The impact of the Temple Bar provisions is something we need to look at.  It is a very attractive area of the city.  The fact that it happens to be in my constituency is irrelevant because virtually nobody lives there.  The number of people on the electoral register for that area is small and so I am not talking about a constituency interest.  That part of the city really belongs to the entire city of Dublin and, indeed, to the nation, but it is on the right side of the river from a commercial market point of view.  The amount of stimulus needed is comparatively limited in contrast to areas north of the river with nothing like the same degree of established wealth or institutional presence.  If it was not for the presence of a State company, Irish Life, in their headquarters in the Irish Life Centre at the top of Abbey Street and the Ilac Centre which they have funded for a long time, the north side of the inner city would be very impoverished.</P>
    <P>The concessions to the Temple Bar area are very substantial and it remains to be seen how they will work to give owners of property the capacity to writeoff the value of their property against development.  I would like the Minister to come back to the House on this.  He is the person responsible.  Certainly, I would expect nothing from the Minister for the Environment.  I do not know if the capacity or willingness to be frank with this House on this exists.  If we are to get the hub of the greater Dublin area <Col N="888" /> right &mdash; we are interfering in complex market forces in urban development terms &mdash; we need to see if there is the right balance and mix between incentive and confinement of territory within the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to sound ungracious or suspicious in the comments I am about to make.  It seems extraordinary that in the Bill we are in effect giving statutory authority, directly and indirectly, by way of a most generous array of tax concessions, to two companies over whom this House has no control.  They will be accountable to nobody that I can see and will be under the direct control of the Department of the Taoiseach.  We have effectively made the Department of the Taoiseach the most influential and, potentially, the most significant property developer in Dublin city.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the State becoming an effective property developer to rejuvenate a central area of our capital city but what worries a republican democrat like myself is that I can see no mechanism of accountability to ensure that the vagaries of the human condition do not prevail over the rights and expectations of the citizens of this Republic.</P>
    <P>I understand this company, whose managing director is an Assistant Secretary in the Department of the Taoiseach, have been given the authority to borrow £500 million from the European Investment Bank, are the beneficial recipient of £3.5 million or thereabouts of Structural Funds from the EC, no doubt on the recommendation of the relevant statutory authorities here.  They negotiated the purchase of approximately 20 per cent of the property in the Temple Bar area from Dublin Corporation and the CIE family of companies, two statutory bodies, one a local authority and the other a semi-State company.  I am not aware if the normal provisions for the sale and disposal of such property have been complied with, to wit public tender advertisements and the like, and I would like to be informed on this.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand it is the intention of the Temple Bar property company to undertake, in conjunction with Dublin <Col N="889" /> Corporation, the pedestrianisation of the central spine street of the area involved, a proposal which in principle I welcome. It seems extraordinary that this should be a private company, not accountable to the Oireachtas and not publicly quoted on the Stock Exchange, although set up by the State, the principal shareholder being the Taoiseach of the day.  How can they anticipate decisions of the local authority?  I am not a member of Dublin Corporation but I am not aware of any public involvement in what is proposed. Having said that, I welcome the rejuvenation of the Temple Bar area and the general focus of attention on the renewal of the inner city.  The entire nation will benefit.  The mechanism raises questions which need to be answered.  There is no other venue in which such questions can be raised and I am not aware of any place where details of the two companies in question have been promoted and reported.  They have not been directly reported to this House, which is being asked to confer on behalf of the taxpayer the most generous array of tax concessions which will transform overnight the assets of people who own property in the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>In terms of the definition in the Second Schedule to this Bill, the Temple Bar area is not very run down.  The perimeter of the area can be covered by walking from O'Connell Bridge along Westmoreland Street, around the Bank of Ireland and along Dame Street, past the Central Bank and Parliament Street to Christ-church Cathedral, turning at Kinlay House down Fishamble Street to the river, past the rather attractive sculpture of a Viking ship embedded in the ground and back along the Liffey to O'Connell Bridge.  This is the area defined in the Schedule.  It includes some derelict property but also some very substantial properties whose value could be dramatically transformed.  Who will be the beneficial recipient?</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Taoiseach has lost the run of himself in his zeal to produce a flagship for the European Year of Culture which Dublin has the honour to host in 1991.  The dilution in the second extension <Col N="890" /> of the designated areas resulting in this package of concessions for Temple Bar may produce some unattractive and some unforeseen side effects.  We need far more detailed analysis of the urban and construction economics which went into the making up of this package of provisions, to which this House is being asked to assent.  The area happens to be in my constituency, a part of the city I know very well.  Its transformation and rejuvenation will enhance the entire Dublin region, but we are being asked to give specific consent to a range of allowances which need to be teased out, otherwise there may be unforeseen effects for which we will be held accountable. I want to avoid a negative reaction in years to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance might address himself to the question of setting up a new property company to deal with this task of urban renewal and the diverting of the personal energies of a presumably overworked Assistant Secretary in the Department of the Taoiseach to run this company as managing director.  Did the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach not consider assigning this task to a body already established by law and accountable directly and indirectly to this House, namely the Custom House Docks Development Authority?  They already have an infrastructure of expertise and a board of directors appointed by different Governments and, therefore, relatively comprehensive in their political coloration, with an existing management structure and knowledge of the territory since they are doing business rather successfully about 300 metres down the Liffey.  Why re-invent the wheel and duplicate an existing body whose major task is substantially underway?  The learning curve of the intricacies of urban redevelopment has been clearly established within that company.  Was that a consideration in the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>
    <P>Has the new body the necessary expertise to assess the eligibility of prospective developers to qualify for these allowances? To whom will they be accountable? The grant of eligibility for an allowance <Col N="891" /> will be a substantial transfer of paper wealth.  This wealth will be tax foregone. I do not begrudge the development of the city.  I am acting as a responsible public representative charged with the equitable distribution of taxpayers' money collected at some pain from all of us as citizens and in this instance the foregoing of taxpayers' money.  As a member of the body ultimately responsible for the Finance Act which will give effect to this provision, I want to be confident that the systems necessary to administer the legislation have been properly thought through and are accountable ultimately to the Comptroller and Auditor General. I welcome the focus of redevelopment but I question whether it has been thought through.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is an extraordinary section which will have to be teased out in great detail on Committee Stage.  There was speculation prior to the publication of this Bill that the unitisation of a property which would qualify for substantial tax benefits could be parcelled out into a large number of small parts and the capital allowances assigned to individual persons. There was great speculation that this method of tax allowance would be introduced to benefit a wide number of people in the property market.  When the Minister is replying on Second Stage we will want a substantial and explicit explanation of what exactly is meant in section 22 and how it is intended to function.  If I may have the indulgence of the House, I will quote section 22:</P>
    <P>(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;property investment scheme&rdquo; means any scheme or arrangement made for the purpose, or having the effect, of providing facilities, whether promoted by way of public advertisement or otherwise, for the public or a section of the public to share, either directly or indirectly and whether as beneficiaries under a trust or by any other means, in income or gains arising or deriving from the acquisition, holding or disposal of, or of an interest in, a building or structure or a part thereof, but does <Col N="892" /> not include a scheme or arrangement as respects which the Revenue Commissioners or, on appeal, the Appeal Commissioners, having regard to such information as may be produced to them, are of the opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the manner in which persons share in the said income or gains, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the number of persons who so share,</P>
    <P>are in accordance with a practice which commonly prevailed in the State during the period of 5 years ending immediately before the 30th day of January, 1991, for the sharing of such income or gains by persons resident in the State and such that the persons so sharing qualified for relief under&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the proviso to subsection (1) of section 296 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  subsection (6) of section 14 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;specified interest&rdquo; means an interest in or deriving from a building or structure held by a person pursuant to a property investment scheme.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person holds a specified interest then, as respects expenditure incurred or deemed to be incurred on or after the 30th day of January, 1991, the proviso to subsection (1) of section 296 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and subsection (6) of section 14 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, shall not have effect as respects an allowance under section 254 (as amended by section 74 of the Finance Act, 1990) or section 264 (as amended by section 50 of the Finance Act, 1988) of the said Act of 1967, which falls to be made to the person by reason of the holding by him of the specified interest.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Appeal Commissioners shall hear and determine an appeal made to them under this section as if it were an appeal against an assessment to income tax and all the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967, relating <Col N="893" /> to the rehearing of an appeal and the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, if you understand that you are a much better man than I. There are many well paid tax lawyers in this town who are paid to navigate the reefs and the rocks and the intricacies of that type of section.  The expectation was that unitisation, which in fact would confer major additional tax shelters for a limited number of people in this country, was not going to be granted in this Bill. The Minister's commentary on the Second Stage debate is to the effect that such unitisation has not, in fact, been conceded.  But I fear, and I have been so advised by some of the tax lawyers to whom I have referred earlier that this is a deliberately ambiguous and complexly written section which is genuinely and premeditatively designed to enable an appeal properly couched and carefully launched to make an exception out of the intended rule of people who know how to go about their business.  That is a serious charge and I hope I am wrong.  In effect what I am saying is that I have been given to understand that what is here will not have the effect of what is written at all, that what you read, in the classic Lewis Carroll speak of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, is not what you are intended to read and what you are intended to read is not written down but can be so interpreted if your appeal is successful.  I am not a tax lawyer nor am I an economist but I know the net point at issue in this section.  The Minister and his advisers know what question I am asking.  I am asking them to clarify the section on Second Stage, if that is possible, or else we will spend a great deal of time on the same section on Committee Stage.  I think I have well and truly made the point.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the capital gains and inheritance tax.  In advance of the commencement of our debate my attention was drawn to the retrospective nature of section 107 &mdash; inheritances taken by parents.  I gather from Deputy <Col N="894" /> Noonan's comments and the Minister's response to them yesterday that this relates to people who through tragic circumstances were probably going to suffer double taxation on the same property. The questions which I had in my notes have been answered but perhaps the Minister would clarify further the extent to which this has been dealt with and perhaps give the House, as I was not a party to this debate last year, an indication of the number of cases that would be affected.  Obviously the legislation relates to all known cases as the Minister specifically gives 2 June 1982 as the date from which the legislation will have effect.</P>
    <P>On the general area of capital acquisition and death duties may I draw the attention of the House and the Minister to an emerging anomaly as marital breakdown and second unions occur increasingly in our society?  I have already put down questions in the usual manner which were spectacularly unsuccessful in eliciting a significant or substantial reply from the Department of Finance.  I now put the Minister and his advisers on notice that I intend to introduce amendments to this at the appropriate time.  We have an anomaly whereby the Department of Social Welfare for the purposes of administering social welfare and tax allowances will regard two adults cohabiting together as if they were a married couple and will treat them accordingly.  As a consequence they have signalled &mdash; and there has been correspondence in the newspapers about this &mdash; that cohabiting couples irrespective of their legal marital status will be treated for all intents and purposes the same as a legally married couple and will be deemed to be entitled to allowances accordingly.</P>
    <P>A constituent of mine brought to my attention the following situation.  If a person is marrying in a Catholic Church &mdash; a marriage which is recognised by the State &mdash; proceeds to get a Church annulment and then remarries in the rites of that Church, and proceeds to live a formal married life in social terms, if this couple buy property in joint names, on <Col N="895" /> the untimely death of one or other partner, the surviving member would not in fact be entitled to any tax relief whatsoever on the value of the inheritance.  In the hypothetical case of an average household where the value of the property is £65,000 and savings and insurance bring the total of the estate to £80,000, there would be an imputed gift transferred from one partner to the other who, as the legal phrase puts it, is a stranger in blood, and the beneficiary of the £40,000 would be entitled to no tax relief whatsoever. In order to meet the tax liability on the £40,000, which for argument's sake would amount to £20,000 approximately, the partner would be obliged in this instance &mdash; I can supply the Minister with a set of figures to illustrate this &mdash; to dispose of what was in fact the only real asset the couple had, the family home, with all the dislocation and pain involved on top of the bereavement following the death of their partner.  If the State is capable, for the purposes of administering tax and social welfare entitlements, of assuming that an adult couple, cohabiting, should be treated the same as a married couple then equally the same State should be capable of treating a cohabiting couple &mdash; living together and owning property jointly &mdash; as a married couple for the purposes of entitlements <i>vis-à-vis</i> capital acquisitions.</P>
    <P>I should place on record my personal interest in this matter.  I would be affected in such circumstances, as I suspect would a number of other Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Attention to my personal circumstances was highlighted on receipt of a letter from a constituent which, on reading made me realise there were reverberations that would have an impact on myself.  Realistically we are talking about increasing numbers of people.  I attempted to elicit a reply from the Minister, and the Department of Finance.  In fact I raised the matter at a personal meeting with the Revenue Commissioners convened to familiarise myself with my brief.  I ascertained that, in most cases, the system of self-certification would apply, that a <Col N="896" /> person can say simply that they are, or regard themselves, as being married to the person with whom they are living when the Revenue Commissioners will not necessarily root behind the relevant documentation.  That is a sort of Irish solution to an Irish problem.</P>
    <P>I am putting the Minister, and the Department of Finance, on notice that I will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage, hopefully suitably drafted and legally competent.  I signal my intention to so do in order to enable the Department to provide alternative draftings.  Once the precedent has been established with regard to the operations of the social welfare code then I do not think the State can be seen to apply one set of criteria or standards in one area and not be seen to apply them in another.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I spoke at some length about the privatisation and sale of State assets to which I will revert in a moment.  In his vigorous noddings in the course of my posing questions yesterday about the use to which the proceeds of the sale of such State assets will be put, the Minister seemed to indicate that the relevant moneys would not be used to bridge current account deficits in respect of the gap between the figures put forward in the January budget and those emerging increasingly as an ever widening gap.  I would have to contend that the Minister, Government and, indeed, the Department of Finance &mdash; comprised of a very wide range of highly skilled and motivated people &mdash; have been obsessed with the agenda of the eighties that dominated the political thinking of everybody in this House, concerned with regaining control of the finances of this State for a variety of reasons for which we all shared some responsibility.  This country from 1977 through the mid eighties lost the run of itself in more ways than one.  Very painfully we had to regain control of our affairs, re-establish our sovereignty in a manner that was not easy.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government, frequently we were told by Members on the Opposition benches there was no difficulty whatsoever in endeavouring to turn the ship around and bring it back into <Col N="897" /> line.  That intellectual argument was a long, slow, painful process but it is over; it has been won.  Whether it be the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the back-benchers of Fianna Fáil or those of my party, nobody now disputes that there is no longer a free lunch out there, that simply by singing an Irish song or because we are nice people we are entitled to a free ride.  We all recognise that we must earn our way in this world.  We all recognise we cannot spend more than we earn. We all recognise that we have accumulated debts that must be repaid, that we have an economy that must be managed by ourselves as adult citizens.  That was the fiscal debate about monetary and budgetary control of the eighties.  It was about injecting a new realism into the relationship between citizens on the one hand and the providers of Government services on the other.</P>
    <P>I am not contending that the debate about the distribution of resources is over, that I am happy about the distribution of the domestic cake; I am not; I am most unhappy about it.  The Labour Party have clearly indicated their unhappiness at the way in which the cake is being distributed internally.  But we recognise, as do the trade union movement, and many other commentators, that there are absolute limits to the size of the cake which were seriously circumscribed by the constraints imposed on this country in the eighties resulting from the manner in which politics evolved.</P>
    <P>My real economic criticism of this administration is that they are still locked into that debate, still fighting that battle, that they are obsessed with money and fiscal matters &mdash; such as reducing the national debt &mdash; that this policy, in so far as one can discern one, about the disposal of State assets is ludicrous in terms of the real problem confronting this economy, and in terms of structural unemployment. We owe £25,000 million; that is a large mortgage.  Were we to take, say, £60 million off that debt through the proceeds of the sale of the Irish Sugar Company or deduct another £250 million &mdash; were we to deduct all of the perceived proceeds from the sale of Irish Life &mdash; it would <Col N="898" /> not significantly dent that national debt figure.  Were we to sell all our State companies, raising something of the order of £1,000 million and reduce the national debt by that amount we would still have an enormous annual debt repayment. Not to use that money to alleviate the major problem of unemployment confronting our economy, as perceived by the NESC and the ESRI, as we approach 1992 and economic and monetary union is reprehensible.</P>
    <P>It is my considered view that there is no economic or political leadership on the part of the present Coalition Government. They are fighting yesterday's battle.  One need only refer to yesterday's MRBI poll to ascertain that the level of perception across the entire political spectrum, among the supporters of all our parties of what is the meaning of European political union and monetary union, is 80 per cent, that is that 80 per cent of our citizens simply do not know what will be the impact of either on this society.  Despite repeated requests the Government have failed miserably to lead this nation, to explain to our citizens the potential benefits of economic and monetary union, indeed the potential pitfalls of European monetary union.  There is a conspiracy of ignorance on the part of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in relation to informing the public &mdash; I really mean this &mdash; that is not unlike a similar conspiracy related to a kind of elitism that can still stalk the corridors of our Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I was a member of an Administration that negotiated the Single European Act. In retrospect we made the great mistake based on our collective arrogance of not taking the public with us because there was a view that regrettably prevails in a part of our political establishment that we know best, that we collectively &mdash; permanent civil servants and Ministers currently in office and us, cognoscenti, who have read the documentation &mdash; know how to lead the people and we should not confuse them with facts, we should not open the debate because all sorts of people with all sorts of crazy ideas will get involved and it is much nicer and <Col N="899" /> much easier to just do the business.  It was precisely that kind of attitude that got the State into the Supreme Court over the Christmas period of 1986-87 arguing the constitutionality of the Single European Act and which resulted in a referendum being held because the political establishment of the day, of which I was a member, did not do their job fully. I am saying to this House and to the Minister of State with responsibility for Foreign Affairs, the prime Department in relation to the Single European Act, that we should learn from the experience of our mistakes.</P>
    <P>In relation to European political union and economic and monetary union, which are far more fundamental in their potential for an impact on the nature of Irish society than the Single European Act ever was, we should not repeat the mistake we made in the past.  There is evidence to suggest that we did make mistakes in the past.  If you talk frankly and openly to anybody in the Department of Foreign Affairs or in the Department of the Taoiseach they will concede that that legal case, the challenge from Crotty, the referendum and the way that whole debate took off was based on a plethora of ignorant and ill-informed people &mdash; I use the word in the sense of being ill informed &mdash; who simply did not know.</P>
    <P>In all probability we will have a referendum in 1992 if the timetable for the two IGCs proceeds.  It is the responsibility of the Government of the day, with primary access to all the institutions and resources of the State, to lead and inform that debate.  That debate is not being informed by the actions of the Government today and it is central to the provisions of this Finance Bill.  When you take the 1992 project with it, it underpins the whole question of tax harmonisation and the real control which the Minister for Finance has with respect to interest rates.</P>
    <P>We had an exchange here yesterday about the relationship between the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance on the one hand and the Governor of the Central Bank on the <Col N="900" /> other.  If economic and monetary union means anything it means that that debate will shift between Merrion Street and Dame Street to somewhere on the continental mainland of Europe because that is where the Central Bank that will control interest rates will be.  Deputy Noonan put his finger on it yesterday when he said it was critical to the capacity of this economy to generate sufficient confidence to invest in order to provide the growth we need.</P>
    <P>An array of factors are currently being negotiated in great detail in Basle, Strasbourg, Luxembourg and Brussels that will make many of the provisions of the Finance Bill irrelevant or will transfer the real power of decision-making away from this Chamber to somewhere else.  Let me give this House an example.  When did we last have a serious debate in this House about agriculture?  When did we last have a debate in this House where it was assumed that the Minister responsible sitting on the Government benches was in a position to make decisions about agriculture? I do not think there is anybody in this Chamber at present who was even a Member of the House when we had such a debate, and I am going back as far as 1977 or 1969 in respect of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Calleary.</P>
    <P>The same will happen in respect of aspects of economic policy.  You cannot speak on four or five pages of a one hour contribution about prospects for 1991, as the Minister did in his opening contribution, and not allude to these factors.  I am not saying we should have the finite exposition by the Government of their position in relation to these matters but whether it is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we are not getting sufficient information either in this House or in a broader sense in the body public at large.</P>
    <P>Three years ago &mdash; if my memory serves me right &mdash; in July 1988, the Government and the Department of the Taoiseach commenced the Europen campaign with a great flourish in the National Concert Hall.  That campaign has ground <Col N="901" /> to a halt.  There is now no public perception of the threats, benefits or possibilities that 1992 holds out for the Irish economy. I put it to the Chair, as he goes through the constituency of Dublin Central &mdash; indeed, I extend the same invitation to anybody in this House whether from Wicklow, Mayo, west Limerick or Tallaght &mdash; to ask anybody who is currently at work in a service industry or in a manufacturing industry of a typical Irish enterprise, which would have ten to 25 employees, what business he is in.  Having got that information, then ask him the following sets of questions.  First, what directives will affect your business after 1992, have they been passed, have the Irish Government sought a derogation, a change or a modification, what new ground rules will affect you in less than 18 months' time?  Second, what new possible markets can your factory and your business get into?  How can you take a market of 3.5 million people and maximise it to a market of 323 million people?  What plans are you and your employers making to maximise that possibility?  Third, from where will the new competition come after 1992?  Who will be your likely competitors after 1992?  Will they compete with you in a manner they cannot do at present because of economic restrictions?</P>
    <P>These are not fanciful questions.  You only have to go into a supermarket to see on the shelves the array of products from European countries which you would not think it was worth their while to sell and you would be amazed that they could possibly mean a profit for the primary producer after they arrived on our supermarket shelves.  I will give an example: rock cakes and confectionery are sold in filling stations on Strand Road in Dublin 4.  The Cathaoirleach has an understanding of business, he knows the number of transactions that have to take place and he will recognise the percentages that are taken along the line.  Yet this confectionery is still under-selling domestic produce that could be made 500 yards away.  If that can happen in the confectionery area, what will happen in relation to insurance, banking, legal services and all <Col N="902" /> the other protected traded areas of our economy which are not subject to the same kind of competition as the areas to which I have just referred?  No Finance Bill should be debated and no Minister for Finance should come into this House at any stage between now and 1992 without bringing us up to date on the current thinking of the Department of Finance and the Government on the impact of 1992 and economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; that if it was not for persistent questioning by myself&mdash; indeed I put down a Dáil question to the Minister for Finance in February &mdash; we would not have obtained from the Minister for Finance a copy of the submissions of the Department of Finance on behalf of the Government, made on 12 January to the Intergovernmental Conference in relation to Ireland's assessment of the impact of EMU on the Irish economy. That information was begrudgingly given.  It was available virtually on the street corners of Brussels for anybody who wanted it.  It is easier for Mr. Barry Desmond, my colleague in the European Parliament, to casually get confidential information from officials in Brussels or Strasbourg about the position of the Irish Government than it is for me, an elected Member of the Oireachtas, to get information from the Minister for Finance who is accountable to this House.</P>
    <P>There is a ludicrous level of suspicion and exchange of information prevailing in this House which is totally contradicted by the level of access to information in the European Parliament or the European Commission.  That makes a nonsense of our parliamentary activities here.  There is in existence a kind of reverse democratic deficit.  We have frequently argued that there is a democratic deficit in respect of decisions made in Europe for which no accountability exists <i>vis-à-vis</i> the citizens of this country, but in some paradoxical respects there is greater access to decision makers by the public representatives elected to the European Parliament than there is here.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment <Col N="903" /> that the culture of the Irish Civil Service should be turned on its head and that civil servants should be talking to everybody. That is not the way we do our business. What I am asking is that the Minister for Finance recognise that this is a real debate.  He should read the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today and should recognise that in Merrion Street and in one or two other areas, that is the sole repository of information in respect of these matters.  That needs to be publicised now because we are in arrears of time in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I said I would conclude on that general observation and I will.  It underpins the relevance and the effect of a lot of the measures that we will debate on Committee Stage such as the harmonisation and administration of VAT and the harmonisation of income tax rates.  As Deputy Noonan said, because we share a common labour market with the UK in particular, personal taxation rates for skilled workers are as much a factor for dislocation in this country as was the position five or six years ago when people travelled across the Border to buy goods in Belfast or Newry.  You only have to talk to people in the personnel area to realise how aware they are of the labour market in other countries and the impact of direct taxation on net salaries.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the Minister that I would like to have an array of questions answered, and I will very quickly summarise them again: the GNP rate assumption; the average estimate of unemployment for the whole year and the consequential impact that will have on buoyancy and tax revenue; following from that the clarification particularly of section 22 and the whole Temple Bar area on which there should be a lot of elaboration &mdash; in my view it should be the subject of a totally separate debate. The Department of Finance are not very good at property development.  They made a mess of selling their own property in Upper Merrion Street.  I do not mean this in a disparaging way but that is not the task of these people and it is not what they were employed for.  They have <Col N="904" /> unique skills and they should be allowed to get on with their work and let people with other skills do the work they were employed to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann believing</P>
      <P>(a)  that it fails to make any significant progress towards fundamental tax reform, broadening the tax base or a shift in the tax burden away from the PAYE sector,</P>
      <P>(b)  that the provisions in regard to reform of BES abuses represent a significant retreat from the measures announced in the budget as a result of extensive lobbying from vested interests, and are particularly unacceptable in the light of the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General,</P>
      <P>(c) that it fails to take any steps to promote job creation, despite the fact that the March unemployment figures were, in real terms, the worst on record,</P>
      <P>declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now evident that the Finance Bill in recent years has been reduced to the status of a mere bargaining document between the Minister for Finance and his advisers on the one hand and various powerful lobby groups on the other. Already, from budget day, we have seen the extraordinary backtracking on the limited measures to restrict abuse of the BES and section 84-based lending.  The Minister for Finance has been ignominiously forced to eat his fine words on budget day and swallow his own trenchant criticisms of the business expansion scheme.  Referring to that scheme the Minister told the Dáil on budget day: &ldquo;It is estimated to have cost about £40 million in tax foregone by the Exchequer in the 1989-90 tax year and it will cost a <Col N="905" /> similar amount in the present tax year if action is not taken&rdquo;.  He concluded that the BES is creating an unacceptable tax shelter.</P>
    <P>Immediately on budget night, starting with his own backbencher, Deputy McCreevy the Minister came under pressure on behalf of vested interest groups, but he continued to protest: &ldquo;Read my lips, there will be no changes in the amendments that I have announced&rdquo;. Within weeks the Minister capitulated and the measures designed to &ldquo;curb abuses&rdquo; were quickly relaxed.  In the face of pressure from commercial banks and, not unnaturally, from the IDA, the Minister has played a similarly supine role in respect of the use of section 84 lending to rip off the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is no longer designed to reflect Government measures announced in the budget.  It is merely a bargaining counter used by those who can afford professional tax advice to pressurise the Minister into continuing gross inequities in the tax code and cheating the average tax-complaint citizen.  Can we be assured that the Finance Bill, finally published last Thursday, thus restricting unreasonably the opportunity for studying its measures by those of us who do not have civil servants available to us and who refuse to take the shilling of the professional lobbyists, is the end of the back-sliding and capitulation to vested interests?</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Finance to commit himself to making no further concessions to those who own or control wealth or make hefty financial contributions to party coffers between now and the enactment of this Bill.  Of course he will give no such undertaking, nor should he because when inevitably further capitulations occur the Minister will be seen to have no credibility left.  If the Minister for Finance finds it palatable &mdash; or is compelled &mdash; to negotiate on the terms of the Finance Bill with the business sector, the financial institutions and other asset rich interest groups, why will he not similarly negotiate changes to introduce real tax reform with the trade union <Col N="906" /> movement or specific measures to alleviate poverty with the various groups representing the poor?  Why must all the changes conceded in an exceptionally unimaginative budget benefit those with power, wealth or assets and not those who work for a wage or who struggle to make ends meet on social welfare incomes?  Those who can afford to play the Stock Exchange and contribute not a whit to job or wealth creation are given almost unlimited incentives while those working for a wage in the real economy are penalised by a burden of taxation entirely disproportionate to their incomes.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection on those of us in this House who represent the PAYE sector &mdash; and on the trade union movement &mdash; that we allow the media to promote, largely unchallenged, the Progressive Democrats as the party of tax reform. The Progressive Democrats, striving to maintain their identity in this temporary little arrangement, seem obsessed with reducing the basic tax rate to 25 per cent and introducing a single top rate.  These twin objectives will be welcomed by the Progressive Democrats' well heeled constituency but they do not represent real tax reform.  Those of us who were on the streets for real tax reform, before the Progressive Democrats were even in gestation, know the difference between tax relief and tax reform.  We can only get real tax reform when the tax base is expanded and some of the burden is shifted off the backs of the PAYE sector on to the corporate and wealth-owning sectors and the professionals who pay for advice to minimise their true tax liability.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has no intention of doing this, since it would involve taxing his friends, and the Progressive Democrats do not want it.  The Progressive Democrats' tax policy would result in the highly paid having a lower tax liability and in a loss in the total tax revenue accruing to the Exchequer.  This can only be paid for in more public expenditure cuts or in selling more of our national assets to finance day-to-day spending.  The Workers' Party or the <Col N="907" /> trade union movement do not want such a solution.  As Deputy Noonan,<i>Limerick East</i>, said in the initial opposing speech, the total tax burden in this economy, by comparison with our EC partners, is not by any means excessive.  The problem about the total existing tax burden is that it is not shared in accordance with ability to pay.  Indeed, it is one of the most pertinent criticisms of the newly agreed <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that it absolutely refrains from tackling tax reform and restricts itself to recording the tax savings secured during the course of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that no matter how one studies the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> starting on page 15, section 3, whereas a lot of time is spent in cleverly writing up the savings accrued during the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, there are virtually no commitments any way meaningful which would constitute real tax reform.  As far as the PAYE sector are concerned &mdash; and as far as introducing equity to the tax code and shifting the burden to those who can afford to pay is concerned &mdash; it is virtually worthless. Again, it goes for the yardstick of tax savings and I would have thought that the experience the trade union movement had of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> would have caused them to abandon that as a yardstick of tax reform.  It suits the Government well.  During the course of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> when we had unprecedented industrial peace, when profits were spiralling and industrial output was greatly increased, inevitably the Government could afford even more tax savings than were promised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> but to go down that road a second time was folly.</P>
    <P>Ireland's status as a tax haven is in no way restricted in this Finance Bill.  Not only does it not curb the multiplicity of tax avoidance schemes, it extends further tax relief opportunities to the owners of property, such as the extraordinarily lavish incentives to the business sector in <Col N="908" /> the Temple Bar area.  The extent of the generosity of the package of incentives offered to developers to move into the Temple Bar area is such that it is likely to utterly change the character of the area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised a number of pertinent questions about the specific proposals for the Temple Bar area.  He put on record what every commentator knows, that in terms of tax-led construction in the Dublin area, there is now an excess of supply over demand.  Indeed, areas of the inner city which most badly need to be renewed and reconstructed do not seem &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; to be availing of the present incentives.  He raised very fundamental questions of accountability in terms of the structure which it is proposed to put in place to supervise the implementation of this extraordinarily generous package of incentives.  It is a cause for concern that there is no formal procedure for accountability in the package as we know it. Indeed, Deputy Quinn raised important questions about the scope of the scheme and about the beneficiaries.  I should like to ask a couple of questions because I, too, like anybody, should like to see the Temple Bar area restored as it has significant economic and tourist potential. However, I wonder whether the effect will be to utterly transform the character of that area; the expressions about it becoming similar to the Left Bank area in Paris conjure up pictures which will not accord with reality.</P>
    <P>In this regard I should like to refer to an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 21 April, not normally the journal from which I take my economic commentary. I should like to quote from a piece by Senator Shane Ross.  He said:</P>
    <P>On Thursday last even some of the hardest heads among the financial correspondents staggered down the steps of the Department of the Taoiseach. The tax incentives offered to developers in the Temple Bar area had left them speechless following a briefing on the measures.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross as you will know, a Cheann <Col N="909" /> Comhairle, clambered aboard the listing Fine Gael ship and whatever one might say about the wisdom of that decision I do not think that anybody in this House would call Senator Ross a socialist.  Yet, that is his view of this extraordinary package designed by the Taoiseach who clearly sees himself in the role of some modern day de Medici prince, no expense spared to restore this area in his own image and likeness.  Senator Ross continued:</P>
    <P>In Ireland when we grant tax incentives we go overboard.  This most radical provision announced in the Finance Bill was the surprise announcement that with effect from April 6th, 1991, refurbishment and conversion expenditure in the Temple Bar area can be offset against all rental income.  In the past it was normal that such expenditure could only be offset against income from the refurbished or converted property.</P>
    <P>The litany of Temple Bar reliefs is long.  It extends from existing to new buildings.  It includes &ldquo;Section 23 Relief&rdquo;, double rent allowances, 100 per cent allowances in respect of Capital Expenditure, all of which will continue until 1996.  It includes owner occupiers, lessors, traders in leased premises and car park developers.</P>
    <P>The Temple Bar area will buzz. Prices of property there are set to rocket.</P>
    <P>Is it worth it?  From a government's point of view one of the great advantages of tax incentives is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the amount of revenue lost to the Exchequer. The parallels with the BES are close.  The new measures granting a reprieve to many BES projects were announced in the same Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I intend to deal with that later, but in what is an incisive commentary Senator Ross concludes that many businessmen have become very rich at the taxpayers' expense.</P>
    <P>He goes on to raise questions of <Col N="910" /> accountability in terms of the new company set up, Temple Bar Renewal Limited, and concludes that Dublin is now over endowed with urban renewal incentives.  He says:</P>
    <P>The trouble with these schemes is that they are abused and exploited, however tightly the legislation is drafted.  Discretion about who qualifies for relief has to be given to somebody. In the case of the Temple Bar area it will rest in the hands of the Taoiseach's Department.  No one would question Mr. Haughey's financial probity, but he may put himself and future Taoisigh in an awkward position if his Department are the arbiters of standards to qualify for tax relief.</P>
    <P>He recommends that the Revenue Commissioners or some other independent body should be assigned the job of monitoring the scheme's progress; that they should have the obligation to report on the progress of the scheme, the criteria used by the Department of the Taoiseach when approving developers and development, and the loss of revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>It is inadequate that we cannot have a more full debate on this major measure in the Bill.  A number of Members are interested in this.  The remarks made so far by the Minister for Finance are not adequate to allay the fears of people who are in no way opposed to urban renewal or, specifically, to the reconstruction of the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the Minister's <i>volte face</i> on the business expansion scheme, which is truly breath-taking.  On budget day the Minister was forced to give some credence to the crescendo of criticism of the operation of that scheme when he told the House:</P>
    <P>The cost of the business expansion scheme relief is high.  It has been high in recent years, despite the action taken in successive Finance Acts to curb abuses.  It is estimated to have cost around £40 million in tax foregone by the Exchequer in the 1989-90 tax year and it will cost a similar amount <Col N="911" /> in the present tax year if action is not taken.</P>
    <P>They are the Minister's own words.  That was his view of the cost in the tax year just finished.  He referred to £40 million in tax foregone, serious abuses and the need for him to address them.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he will confirm to the House that the total cost in tax foregone under this scheme is in fact of the order of £100 million.  That was a figure we secured from either the Secretary of the Department of Finance or the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>The changes I have made in the BES over the past few years have sought to curb abuses and focus the scheme more clearly on what it is supposed to be doing.  It was never the intention that it should provide income tax relief for investment in secure asset-backed ventures involving little risk, but the reality is that this is frequently how it is operating and in the process, it is creating an unacceptable tax-shelter.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister went on to announce what he would do about it.  He said:</P>
    <P>In order to reduce the cost in tax foregone and to focus the scheme more effectively, I am introducing some changes: the scheme will no longer apply to shipping, hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation.  It will, of course, continue to apply to manufacturing and international services, special trading houses and advance factories, and to tourist facilities other than those I have mentioned; the total amount a company can raise under the scheme will in future be limited to £0.5 million; and the amount any taxpayer can claim relief on will have a &ldquo;lifetimecap&rdquo; on it of £50,000. Where a company or individual has already passed the new limits, there will be no claw-back but amounts raised or invested up to yesterday will, of course, count towards these limits. <Col N="912" /> These restrictions will apply to all shares issued on and from today.  There will be no exceptions, not even where subscriptions have already been sought prior to the introduction of these restrictions.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's tough talking on budget night.  He assured the House that there would be no changes.  Indeed on that same night, moving Financial Resolution No. 5 the Taoiseach underlined the criticisms of the abuses of the scheme by his Minister for Finance and quite properly pointed out to Deputy Peter Barry and Deputy Charlie McCreevy that they were engaging in special pleading when they agreed, to quote Deputy Barry, as I do:</P>
    <P>There is no loss to the Exchequer because the investment would not have been made unless the scheme was in place.  To pretend that the scheme has cost the Exchequer X amount of money, in this case £40 million, is not correct...</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach quite correctly replied:</P>
    <P>This is real tax foregone.  This is real income which people have and because of this scheme they do not have to pay tax on it that they would otherwise pay to the Exchequer.  Therefore, there is a real loss to the Exchequer of tax foregone.</P>
    <P>That was the message the Taoiseach hammered home.  Some Fine Gael Deputies, and his own colleague, Deputy McCreevy tried to suggest otherwise. They tried to suggest that it was to be compared, for example, to the question of the tax regime applying here for manufacturing industry and that it was directly analagous in so much as if those companies did not come here in the first place one could argue that there was no loss to the Exchequer.  The Taoiseach dealt with that point too when he replied:</P>
    <P>If an industry comes in here and gets the 10 per cent tax benefit it would be true to say that there would be no real loss to the Exchequer by the 10 per cent concession because the industry <Col N="913" /> would not have been here otherwise, but that is not the case here.  This is a real tax foregone.  This is real income which people have and becuase of this scheme they do not have to pay tax on it that they would otherwise have to pay to the Exchequer.  Therefore, there is a real loss to the Exchequer of tax foregone.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was quite correct, as we all know, in putting that on the record of the House.  He made it quiet clear that these people would have had to pay tax if it were not for the existence of the scheme. However, Deputy McCreevy held a different view.  He started his contribution on that night by calling himself an &ldquo;ordinary man&rdquo;.  I remember pointing out on that occasion that if the Trade Descriptions Act were to apply in the House Deputy McCreevy would be arrested before he left the House because whatever he is he is no ordinary man and clearly knows more about the actual pragmatic operation of these schemes and how to operate the tax shelter than the rest of us.  He went on to say, &ldquo;It is better to have people investing money in something concrete rather than having it lying in a bank account&rdquo;.  That is an intriguing remark because, as the Taoiseach made clear, if money is lying in a bank account, it is liable to taxation. Obviously Deputy McCreevy, knowing something the rest of us do not know, believes it would not be liable to taxation. Therefore, there is no argument.</P>
    <P>I have adduced in my criticism of the scheme none other than the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, both of whom had available to them the very valuable but rare audit report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the business expansion scheme.  I commend that report to anyone seriously interested in the attempt to create a fiscal environment through the use of tax reliefs which will encourage taxpayers to invest venture capital in certain sectors with a view to expansion of output and the creation or maintenance of jobs in the companies concerned.  The remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor General are well <Col N="914" /> worth putting on the record of the House because unfortunately current legislation and financial restrictions do not permit the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct this kind of audit report except very rarely.  He prefaced his remarks in the document with a number of graphs which are very illuminating and show that during the first three years of its operation, when indeed there was an element of risk for investors, the scheme never got off the ground; the amount of money invested was negligible.  When the tax experts managed to figure out ways of exploiting the loopholes and creating schemes whereby they were virtually riskfree the scheme absolutely rocketed, attracting £78 million in 1989-90.  At the top tax marginal rate, that means that approximately half of that amount was tax foregone to the Exchequer.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated in his report:</P>
    <P>Using tax expenditures to provide incentives for the attainment of public policy objectives may be seen as an attractive alternative to the voting of moneys annually by Dáil Eireann for this purpose.  A decision as to which method of financing should be chosen in any particular case is entirely a matter of budgetary policy and therefore the prerogative of the Government to propose; but an essential difference in so far as public accountability for the cost is concerned, is that there is a transparency about the cost of schemes financed by direct expenditure, whereas the cost of schemes financed by tax expenditures is not systematically recorded and is not reported to Dáil Éireann.  Neither is the cost to the Exchequer subject to annual approval by Dáil Éireann and, once the scheme is put in place, its cost becomes open-ended and the total amount of revenue foregone depends on how taxpayers respond.</P>
    <P>A very serious lesson can be learned from the comments made by that independent public servant on the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the section of his report dealing with <Col N="915" /> findings he said that in the light of the scale and pattern of investments identified during the examination and the lack of reliable substantive information on the performance of the undertakings invested in, it appeared that the most critical value for money consideration associated with the BES tax expenditure programme was that large amounts of tax may have been foregone with little net gain in terms of job creation or maintenance. We all know some notorious cases which bear out that contention, the most notorious probably being that involving the Shannon Industrial Leasing Company where for a project in Shannon involving between £24 million and £27 million, there was a net job creation of seven jobs. That was the most notorious exploitation of the scheme for purposes for which it was never intended by the Government who introduced it.</P>
    <P>The main weaknesses identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General were, first, that while the general objectives of the scheme were clearly defined, no related financial cost or employment economic targets were set; second, there were no operational procedures in place to obtain feedback on the extent to which the scheme was meeting its objectives in terms of job creation or maintenance.  He went on to elaborate on that point in some detail.  Third, he pointed out that no procedures were in place to compile relevant information with a view to evaluating the extent to which the scheme was successful in terms of attracting equity capital into companies for high risk undertakings or in terms of increasing output.  He said, furthermore, that an essential ingredient of the scheme that there should be an element of risk in the investment, was rendered largely meaningless by the devising of schemes incorporating a &ldquo;put option&rdquo; which guaranteed no loss to investors on their original investment after the minimum five year period.  Fourth, he found that no procedures were in place to establish the number of jobs maintained or created and, therefore, the cost per job in terms <Col N="916" /> of the amount of tax relief granted was not known.</P>
    <P>The report in full amounts to a damning indictment of the operation of the scheme.  This scheme which was well intentioned, well motivated and designed primarily to attract equity capital into small manufacturing companies which would enable them to grow and expand and create jobs, employment and wealth has effectively been hijacked by an army of professional consultants who, as soon as one loophole was shut off, opened up another.  The result of this, as the Taoiseach agreed, has been that enormous amounts of money have been lost to the State and we have no yardstick of job creation and no adequate measures of supervision or monitoring of that scheme.</P>
    <P>I have been very careful in my choice of critics of the business expansion scheme.  I have selected the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If such eminent and powerful persons so severely criticise a Government measure, surely the man in the street is entitled to expect that something will be done about it. There is an array of so called independent commentators to buttress that criticism.</P>
    <P>I could refer again, for example, to recent very incisive commentary on this matter by Senator Shane Ross, who will find that he will have to trim his sails if he is going to speak with such clarity, authority and truthful analysis on such schemes, should he emerge as a Dáil candidate for Fine Gael, because on budget night they loudly started the lobbying process for the Minister to continue the disgraceful manner in which the BES is being exploited at the moment.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 3 February 1991 Senator Ross urged the Minister to resist the lobbying of the promoters of the BES and declared:</P>
    <P>The BES has been an embarrassment to the image of business and the spirit of private enterprise.  During the last two years the BES has provided a tax avoiders paradise.  No one expected <Col N="917" /> a further extension in its present form last week.  The only real surprise was that the Minister failed to kill the BES stone dead.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross was writing from the point of view of the business community.  To support his view he instanced the case of John McGilligan of the Business and Trading House Investment Company, who applauded the budget changes and whose previous funds were mostly invested in manufacturing industries which will continue to qualify.  Senator Ross concluded by saying:</P>
    <P>If there are further abuses, if the 1991 Finance Act is not proved water-tight, if manufacturing industry and employment do not benefit this time, the BES will have rightly had its final reprieve.</P>
    <P>That is not some left wing or socialist commentator on the operation of the business expansion scheme.  It is a scandal, an embarrassment to business and it was incumbent on the Minister for Finance to ensure that the Bill brought before this House would indeed be water-tight and would, at a minimum, stand by the changes he argued for in his budget speech and on which he promised there would not be back tracking.  That is the least we could have expected.</P>
    <P>Instead, we are now asked to believe that an Irish Government who have been so critical of this scandal and who have played their part in highlighting the deficiencies and abuses of the scheme, are now bringing forward legislation that will ensure the continuation of many of these abuses.  It is almost unbelievable that a measure so criticised by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General should continue to be used as a tax shelter by the professional advisers in the setting up of these schemes who make enormous profits and charge enormous fees to cause these schemes to become operable.  As a result of the statement of the Minister for Finance on 12 March that is precisely what this House is being asked to do. The man who told us, George Bush style <Col N="918" />&ldquo;read my lips, there will be no turning back&rdquo; has now under pressure agreed to climb down on the amendments he suggested on budget night.</P>
    <P>I agree with all the criticisms of the Taoiseach, the Minister, the Comptroller and Auditor General and with Senator Shane Ross's commentary and I would add a few criticisms of my own.  It is clear that a scheme designed to encourage the provision of equity capital for high risk companies which offer the prospect of substantial benefit to the economy in terms of output and jobs has effectively been hijacked by a clique of fund managers who would not know a good manufacturing project if it hit them.  Their energies are entirely invested in marketing the BES as another tax avoidance measure.  There were 20 such explicit advertisements in a recent edition of the <i>Sunday Business Post.</i> These people have an enormous vested interest in the continuation of the BES.  The commercial banks use the BES as a replacement for normal bank type finance.  Together with the fund managers they and not the Government are effectively determining policy on what areas may be expanded and on what areas will not be expanded.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister argued that hotels should benefit from the BES mechanism? Why should they qualify for BES finance?  Why should one hotel qualify and not another?  Are hotels that benefit not going to lead to the closure of other hotels?  The Minister shakes his head.  I would like to know, for example, what the proprietors of Cruise's Hotel in Limerick think about the BES.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government are of the opinion, as I am, that State intervention in the <Col N="919" /> tourism industry at various levels and in various ways is both desirable and necessary, I would ask them if giving hotels this relief is the way to do it.  Would we not be better engaged in seeking to reduce the cost of access transport to this country, even if that meant Exchequer funded grants?  A sum of £100 million is a lot of money to play around with as the Taoiseach made clear on budget night when moving the Financial Resolutions. One can do a lot with £100 million and we could do a great deal more for the tourism industry than we are doing in this way with the BES.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance reneged on his own undertakings, and no doubt the well financed lobbyists that brought about his climb down have noted it as yet another precedent.  What the Minister can be persuaded to do once, they will assume he can be persuaded to do again.</P>
    <P>The hotels lobby could always rely on the Minister for Tourism and Transport Deputy Séamus Brennan to deliver.  The Minister for Finance had already put the final touches to his budget speech when the Minister for Tourism and Transport was being widely photographed in the newspapers with various hoteliers and promoters of schemes arguing publicly the merits of the continuation of the scheme.  This was happening at the time the Minister for Finance was signalling to all and sundry that he would have to tackle the abuses that were going on.  I am aware that a good number of the hoteliers concerned would be very familiar with the Minister for Tourism and Transport from their days in the cumainn when he was general secretary and they made a few bob available to the party coffers at election time and helped in a constructive way no doubt, to formulate national policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it somehow.  The Minister for Finance has to answer the question whether the Minister for Tourism and Transport was calling the shots. The Minister's capitulation to the wealthy and super wealthy is to be contrasted with his miserly approach to those caught in the poverty trap and his failure once again to tackle the question of fundamental structural tax reform.</P>
      <P>The other Opposition spokespersons have indicated that the measures included in this Finance Bill in no way constitute real tax reform.  Indeed, the French Declaration on Human Rights of 1789 states &ldquo;taxes are a common levy shared equally between citizens on the basis of their capacities&rdquo;.  That is certainly not true 200 years on in Albert Reynolds's Ireland.  We now have a complex web of allowances, reliefs and exemptions which enable the wealthy to avoid and evade paying their common levy.  Meanwhile, because of the failure to index tax bands and allowances against inflation, an enormous proportion of taxpayers have to pay out above the standard rate.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that in 1973 only 1 per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rates but by 1986 that figure had risen to 45 per cent.  The head of taxation at Allied Irish Banks recently set out in a paper how someone earning £60,000 per annum could protect 45 per cent of his income from any tax liability by the clever use of exemptions.  Those taxpayers who must spend their total income on the necessities of life do not have surplus income to invest in tax avoidance schemes.  In a recent edition of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> the columnist, Eugene Murray, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish tax and social welfare system is structured so that a person <Col N="921" /> earning between £6,000 and £10,000 per annum earns less after tax for every extra £1 earned.</P>
    <P>That statistic is almost unbelievable and if that is not a disincentive to economic growth I do not know what is.  In the same article the writer highlighted the fact that it was decided in the United States and in the United Kingdom in the mid-eighties to radically reduce personal and corporate tax rates coupled with the abolition of most tax incentives for investment.  He said that this example had been followed in most OECD countries and went on to say:</P>
    <P>Rate cuts have been accompanied by taxing new sources of income and removing loopholes.  The measures are revenue neutral.  While the reduction in the higher rates reduces the redistributional impact of the tax system the elimination of exemptions and the heavier taxation of capital gains and wealth compensate for the loss of progressivity. It is accepted that the fairness of the new system reduces tax evasion and encourages work and the taking of risks.</P>
    <P>Certainly that is not the trend in Ireland. It is now generally accepted that high marginal rates and the structure of our income tax code are disincentives to work.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, once again, reflects the unwillingness of the Government to take this trend on board.  Exemptions are not being removed; on the contrary they are being broadened and extended and the tax base is not being widened.  Virtually all tax reliefs for special interest groups have been maintained and some new ones introduced.  Juggling around with the tax bands, as we have pointed out year after year, does not constitute tax reform.  Any temporary benefit to some families will be eroded by the failure to adjust allowances or bands in line with inflation.  Taking the combined effect of the budgetary changes and the increases provided for under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> those on average incomes will <Col N="922" /> have to endure an increase in their deductions of tax and PRSI.  A single person on the average industrial wage of £11,754 will face an increase in tax and PRSI deductions of £125 per annum while a married couple, with one spouse working, on the same income will see their deductions go up by about £80 per year.</P>
    <P>The report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1989, published last September, illustrated graphically how little progress had been made in tackling the disproportionate tax burden carried by the PAYE sector.  The report showed that not only had the PAYE tax take increased by some £56.8 million between 1988 and 1989 but the overall proportion of income tax paid in PAYE increased in the same period from 74 per cent to 82 per cent.  This further increase in tax paid by the PAYE sector has to be seen against the background of the decrease of more than £31 million in the total paid in corporation tax and the drop of more than £7 million in capital gains tax in the same two year period.  Indeed, there has been a decrease in the returns from virtually all tax categories, other than PAYE.  What is clear from the report is that, despite all the promises of tax reform and the minor juggling with tax rates and bands, the PAYE sector is being bled dry while other sectors continue to escape with little more than a token contribution to the Exchequer.  In addition, it shows quite clearly that many of those in the business and commercial sectors &mdash; the pillars of society listed in the report who were convicted of tax offences or from whom the Revenue Commissioners extracted overdue tax &mdash; take a cavalier attitude to their tax obligations.</P>
    <P>There has also been a misapprehension that the 1988 tax amnesty disposed of the matter of uncollected taxes, but that is very far from the case.  The Minister for Finance revealed in a reply to a Dáil question put down by me last Thursday that phenomenal amounts of tax remain outstanding and that the Revenue Commissioners expect to collect only a small proportion of this money.  The Minister disclosed that out of a total of £352 million in established underpayments of PAYE <Col N="923" /> and VAT up to 1988-89, the Revenue Commissioners expect to collect only £116 million or less than one-third.  He also disclosed that of a further £2,111 million estimated to be due under various tax headings the Revenue Commissioners expect to collect a mere £242 million or just over 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I accept that it may eventually be found that a proportion of the estimated amounts may not be actually due but there is no doubt about the validity of the underpayments established, and the picture disclosed in the Minister's reply is unacceptable.  I find it particularly unacceptable that the Revenue Commissioners should be effectively preparing to write off more than two thirds of the established underpayments of PAYE and VAT.  A large amount of the outstanding PAYE tax is likely to be money already deducted from workers' wage packets and pocketed by unscrupulous bosses rather than passed on to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In regard to the tax amnesty and the mistaken perception that it has dealt with the problem of uncollected taxes, at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners went to great pains to convince and explain to the members of the committee that only £50 million of the £600 million collected by way of the tax amnesty was new tax.  The success of the tax amnesty, which was beyond the wildest dreams of everybody concerned including the Minister, was in bringing in tax from people who were already in the system.  That is a very sobering thought.  A scheme that was predicted by the Minister for Finance of the day to bring in something in the region of £50 million or maybe £80 million brought in eventually just short of £600 million and the largest protion of that came from people already in the system.</P>
    <P>I am trying, unsuccessfully, to find specific comments on this area of tax enforcement from the recent conferences of the tax officials' union where in no uncertain terms they voiced their ongoing concern about the inadequacies of the <Col N="924" /> collection mechanisms to deal with the amount of tax still outstanding.  In the self-assessment area, I recollect the general secretary of the union making the point that somebody complying with the self-assessment mechanism could expect to be audited every 260 years as the system is at the moment.  Obviously, in order to have a reasonable random sample selected for audit there is a staffing implication, but, at the same time, if the extent of concern among the people engaged in the business of tax collecting and enforcing the tax guidelines impelled them to make the kind of statements they made at their recent conference, then I suggest it is a matter for concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>Every £1 in tax evaded by business or employers takes another £1 from the wage packet of the PAYE worker who has no opportunity to avoid paying tax and who sees his wage levels eaten away each week by tax deductions.  Despite the 1988 tax amnesty which brought in £600 million, the Minister's reply shows that evasion and avoidance continue on a massive scale.  It is particularly disappointing that the Bill before the House contains no new significant measure to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>One area that needs immediate attention is the staffing levels in the Revenue Commissioners themselves.  The trade union to which I referred just now suggested recently that the State may be losing as much as £400 million annually because of the failure to audit fully the sample ratio suggested by the union which seems a very reasonable ratio to take.  I suggest there also must be a review of the penalties available for this social crime.  Printing names in the paper is clearly no deterrent to those who stand to gain so much from this evasion.  These people are robbing the State and should be treated by the courts in the same manner as others who steal.  The poverty trap is the down side of the wealth trap provided by the exemptions available to those on very high incomes.</P>
    <P>What is the position of this Government on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems?  I would like to ask the <Col N="925" /> Minister for Finance if he agrees that real tax reform would require this step after the widening of the tax base.</P>
    <P>Referring to Deputy Noonan's contribution, it is important that we make clear again that tinkering around with the tax rates, reducing them a penny here or a penny there, refusing to index tax bands, refusing to broaden the tax base to those who can afford to pay and have a range of exemptions and facilities open to them to avoid doing so, are of no avail. Until we tackle these questions to call what is being done &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo; is a misnomer.  It is extraordinary that the junior partner in Government seems to have captured this area of tax reform in the minds of the public.  This obsession with reducing the standard rate to 25 per cent and introducing a single top rate does not constitute real tax reform.  What the man or woman in the street is concerned about is how quickly he or she becomes liable for tax.  It really does not matter much whether it is 25p or 27p; they are concerned about how quickly they become liable for that and, secondly, how quickly they go into the next band, how soon they become liable to pay the marginal rate.  They are the questions that constitute real tax reform, not the cosmetics the Progressive Democrats are into.  The Progressive Democrats are interested in the optics of tax reform which when they were founded won them, unexpectedly, 14 seats.  Ask anybody out on the street if he or she would like to pay 25p tax in the £1 and the answer is, &ldquo;Of course we would&rdquo;.  We would all like to be paying 25p tax in the £1 but the tax code is very sophisticated and complex.  Under the provisions of this Finance Bill a single person becomes liable for tax on a weekly income of £66. It makes nonsense of the social welfare system and of the incentive to work.  We are being treated to an array of figures to show that in certain circumstances this is a positive disincentive to work.  Tax reform must be focussed on a person who comes into the tax band at that level and then becomes liable for the next rate of tax very quickly.  Contrary to what the Progressive Democrats say, we cannot <Col N="926" /> leave it at that.  If the Exchequer loses revenue, as inevitably it will if some of the burden is shifted from the PAYE sector, that revenue must be made up elsewhere.  I cannot argue for more cuts in public spending, cutbacks in health and education, which would be the inevitable impact of the taxation policy of the Progressive Democrats.  We must raise the revenue that would be lost to the State by bringing in new taxation measures, broadening the tax base and making the wealth-owning sectors liable to pay a fair rate of tax, which they have not been doing.</P>
    <P>I spent a lot of time dealing with abuses of the business expansion scheme.  It is only one of the mechanisms which can be exploited by business.  Most adroit at exploiting such measures are the commercial banks, yet the tax take from them is virtually negligible.  There are so many write-offs and reliefs available to them that their contribution to the Exchequer is negligible, yet they continue whingeing about the minimal bank levy.  That is one area which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The question of corporation tax must also be addressed.  The theoretical 40 per cent rate on the corporate sector is virtually meaningless.  Deputy McCreevy's profession would think one was sick in the head if one was running a business and paying 40 per cent tax.  There are so many mechanisms available to dwindle it that 40 per cent is no more than a notional figure.  I have argued here before for a 20 per cent effective tax rate on the business sector.  That would be far more meaningful than pretending that we have a corporate tax rate of 40 per cent.  We cannot continue with this scandal that produced 750,000 people on the streets in 1979 and 1980.  That kind of popular protest had not been seen since the time of Daniel O'Connell, yet we managed to divert that popular protest and that manifestation of the will of the people which has brought down governments in Eastern Europe. Here all it led to was the setting up of a commission so that we could side track the issue and lead the people into a culde-sac. The Commission on Taxation <Col N="927" /> eventually reported and their major recommendations, not all of which I would agree with, are effectively untackled. The report lies on the shelves of the Department of Finance.  The comprehensive approach to tax reform which it argued has been ignored while we engage in the optics and cosmetics of tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>No doubt the commitment to a standard rate of 25 per cent will be great stuff at the hustings &mdash; or so the Progressive Democrats think &mdash; at the next election. People have learned what the Progressive Democrats stand for and they know that this is illusory and does not constitute real tax reform.  Working people know that they are still bearing the major share of responsibility for running public services. Unfortunately, under the Bill they can anticipate no real relief.</P>
    <P>Business can be happy that its tax havens and shelters are still in place. During the first three years of the business expansion scheme when there was an element of risk, it attracted negligible investment.  This raises serious questions about the nature of our native entrepreneurial class.  Where are these entrepreneurs who, the Progressive Democrats tell us, we should release into the business world?  Until we worked out mechanisms to allow them to invest their money at no risk they were nowhere to be found.  I have grave doubts about the minimal restrictions the Minister is introducing in an effort to assert some control.  He argues that section 15 counters the use of multiple company structures and company splitting devices designed to circumvent the limit he imposes.  I very much doubt whether these counter-evasion mechanisms can be effective.  Even now the tax lawyers are coming up with mechanisms which will ensure that they are not put at risk.  A similar point with regard to unitisation was made by Deputy Quinn on section 22.  I wonder whether this has deliberately been left woolly and vague so that it can be exploited.</P>
    <P>We started this debate by comparing the economic climate now with the picture given by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech and considering <Col N="928" /> whether the targets set in that speech are likely to be achieved.  Most important is the question of economic growth, which he predicted would be 2¼ per cent.  He is alone now in standing by that prediction. Deputy Noonan made the point that if economic growth should fall below 2¼ per cent it is most unlikely that additional net employment will be created.  There is a growth figure below which we cannot fall, having regard to the structure of a modern economy, if employment is to result.  The Minister is alone in standing by the prediction of a 2¼ per cent growth.</P>
    <P>I came across by accident part of a contribution to the debate last year.  It is extraordinary how the economic climate has changed in such a short period.  That speaker was referring to a report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute and I quote:</P>
    <P>The recent medium term review published by the Economic and Social Research Institute heralded the possibility that within a few short years we will be making capital repayments on our debt rather than simply servicing the interest.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute our economy could grow on average by 5 per cent a year for each of the next five years.  By 1991, on the basis of present revenue and spending policies, we would be taking in more in taxation than we have spent for the first time since the early seventies.  This is a rosy picture.  Some would say it is much too optimistic, but even if we allow for a degree of optimism the likelihood is that our economy will grow.  The question that poses is, who will benefit from that growth?</P>
    <P>That is an extract from the debate of only last year when the ERSI were making rosy predictions for the economy.  Now we find ourselves in a position where the Government target on budget day is already at risk; the Exchequer borrowing requirement will be exceeded, in the opinion of every independent economic commentator, and, of course, we know <Col N="929" /> the situation with regard to unemployment. On budget day the Minister predicted an out-turn on the live register of 228,000 unemployed people.  Already, comparing like with like, the figure is in excess of 246,000 &mdash; a frightening deterioration at a time of the year when there should be a pick-up in employment.  Yet that is the margin by which the Minister has already missed his target.  Therefore it makes it all the more regrettable that there is nothing really in this Finance Bill which is likely to stimulate new job creation.  The only reference in the debate so far has been to the question of privatisation.  The question has been posed again: is the Minister going to make up the expected gap in the Exchequer borrowing requirement at the end of the year from the proceeds of the sale of some of our national assets?  We look forward to a clear reply to that question from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I argue that what is needed is the commercialisation and not the privatisation of public enterprise.  I would refer the Minister to a book, <i>The Politics of Public Enterprise and Privatisation</i> by Paul Sweeney.  I appreciate the Minister is a busy man and if he does not have time to read it, perhaps his advisers could read the only book that has been published on this question in Ireland.  A number of books has been published on the privatisation experience in the United Kingdom but to my knowledge this is the only book written on it in Ireland and is written by a trade union economist, Paul Sweeney. Let me refer the Minister's advisers specifically to page 143 where the author identifies the four main reasons put forward for privatisation by the likes of the Progressive Democrats and which Fianna Fáil would not have countenanced before the shotgun marriage which they are now enjoying.  The promoters of privatisation give the following four reasons in its favour, that it:</P>
    <P>(i)  encourages competition,</P>
    <P>(ii)  spreads popular capitalism through wider share ownership,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> (iii)  is a source of revenue for government, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  curbs the power of the public sector trade unions.</P>
    <P>The author examines each of those arguments in turn and he deals with the question of whether this encourages greater competition at some length.  He refers to a number of reviews, surveys and reports prepared in Britain from the benefit of the privatisation programme that has taken place there.  He quotes from a book <i>Does Privatisation Work</i> by Bishop and Kay where they concluded, and I quote: &ldquo;There is nothing to support any claim <i>per se</i> of the superiority of private over public&rdquo; enterprise.</P>
    <P>The book is written from a business perspective and is concerned with the introduction of competition.  It concludes that</P>
    <P>while many UK industries showed improvements in performance, they &ldquo;do not appear to bear any obvious relationship to privatisation.  Privatisation is, we have shown, neither necessary nor sufficient for enterprise change.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The OECD (1986) argued that &ldquo;it is often the case that the government's practices, not its ownership <i>per se</i> which explains a significant part of a public enterprises' inefficiency and that elimination of such policies alone would achieve results similar to privatisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They go on to support that at length.  In fact it is Government practice rather than the fact that the Government own the shares of any company that contributes to the inefficiencies we have seen in public sector companies.  I have no doubt that that is the case.  The major Government party which is promoting this programme of privatisation is to the fore in those Government practices that have led to inefficiency.  They canvassed to give jobs in public sector and commercial State companies where no jobs existed.  That has been part of the political culture of this country, but to claim that inefficiency <Col N="931" /> arises because the ownership of the company is vested in the State is in my view, and in the view of this author, wrong.</P>
    <P>Without going into the matter here in detail, the author deals with each of the other propositions, for example, that it spreads popular capitalism through wider share ownership or as Mrs. Thatcher used to say, it creates a people's share-owning democracy.  He looks at the pattern in the UK, and while it is true that initially when the big public utilities were being privatised a great many ordinary persons subscribed for shares, it is also true that in practice a great many of them subscribed for shares because in the preparation for privatisation the Tory Government put the shares on the market at very low prices indeed.  Within a very short period the shares were again aggregated by the financial institutions as the new smaller shareholders sold them off at a considerable premium as quickly as they could divest themselves of them &mdash; so much for the share-owning democracy of Mrs. Thatcher's dream, which not even the present Tory Party in Britain continues to believe in any more.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether privatisation curbs the power of the public sector unions the conclusion was that it was not the privatisation of these companies that contributed to the curbing of power of the trade unions but rather the dose of anti-union legislation which the Thatcher/Tebbitt Government introduced from the beginning of the eighties. There is one brief paragraph in this book &mdash; entitled <i>The Politics of Public Enterprise and Privatisation</i> by Paul Sweeney &mdash; concerning who are the winners and losers of privatisation which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The winners from privatisation were those who bought the shares well below market prices, the managers of the newly privatised companies, professional advisers and the government. The losers are less visible, being the general taxpayer and those who worked in the companies before privatisation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> I think that will turn out to be the case in Ireland as well because in Britain the policy of privatisation, which appears to be successful, on analysis, has been a failure economically for the Conservatives. I might quote again from page 168 of this book where it is said:</P>
    <P>The privatisation of state assets in Britain resulted in a transfer of wealth from the general public to those few who bought shares in the privatised companies, many of whom quickly sold on.</P>
    <P>Already we have seen the beginning of a similar response in Ireland, a very inadequate one, to the depth of our unemployment crisis and which must, as is pointed out in this book, be taken in the context of the fact, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The top 30-40 Irish-owned companies have expanded abroad by foreign acquisitions in the eighties with few jobs created in Ireland in spite of the barrage of State assistance and the general awareness of the necessity for export-led industrialisation.  Therefore, restructured public enterprise must be retained as an additional instrument of job creation.</P>
    <P>No doubt the House will recall the days when prominent figures in Fianna Fáil, most recently Deputy Brian Lenihan, used to claim that the real socialist party in this country was Fianna Fáil.  That was before they met their Progressive Democrats partners.  The Seán Lemass generation would agree with this remark of Herbert Morrison, the architect of the United Kingdom's post-war nationalisation programme when he said:</P>
    <P>...the public corporation must not be a capitalist business... it must have a different atmosphere at its board table from that of a shareholders' meeting; the board and its officers must regard themselves as the high custodians of the public interest.</P>
    <P>I believe that that view of rational, State intervention in the marketplace is a socialist perspective but one that was subsequently sanctioned by Keynes and, as <Col N="933" /> I said, Fianna Fáil at least in their public rhetoric would have agreed with it, indeed right until the 1977 general election when they gave an undertaking to that effect to the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Now, when the tide of Thatcherism is ebbing in Britain what happens in Ireland?  Once more we ape the British and are beginning to sell off such of our publicly-owned companies as are considered suitable, eligible, prepared and ready; companies that have been slimmed down, like the Irish Sugar Company, companies that have been inordinately successful, like Irish Life, are being prepared for privatisation. I believe the losers will be the taxpayers, the public generally, the workers in these companies.  Ultimately I believe that control will pass out of Irish hands, when we will face an even worse employment crisis than we do at present.</P>
    <P>The question of interest rates has been dealt with fairly extensively in this debate so far.  I should like to refer to one aspect only which is the inordinate haemorrhage of moneys flowing out of this economy. It is now estimated that £3.2 billion will be exported in profits, dividends and royalties this year.  That is tantamount to a haemorrhage out of this economy.  Of course, it has a major bearing on our very high interest rates in comparison with those prevailing in any of our European partner countries, specifically in comparison with our relationship to the German mark within the EMS system.  As far as I can ascertain the Government have no plans at all to tackle these interest rates. They boast of the removal of exchange controls, a very large part of which is comprised of the repatriation of profits from the foreign industrial sector located here.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is not reasonable to expect the man in the street to conclude that there is not the ingenuity within the Department of Finance and elsewhere available to this Government to devise some tax mechanism that will induce these companies to reinvest some proportion of that wealth made here in Ireland.  I am not so naive as to suggest that we can stop that haemorrhage in its <Col N="934" /> entirety.  I understand that, on the terms on which those companies were brought in here, always there will be repatriation to country of origin of some element of their profits made here.</P>
    <P>The facts are that it is now some four or five years since we discovered this black hole, as it was called then.  This repatriation of profits is bleeding this economy dry &mdash; £3.2 billion in outflows this year.  It appears to me that it is incumbent on the Government to ascertain what tax mechanisms are available to them to encourage some of these companies to reinvest in Ireland profits made on their behalf by Irish workers.</P>
    <P>It is evident that, 11 weeks after introducing his budget, the Minister for Finance is already seen to have no clothes. Nobody any longer believes his growth forecast.  His unemployment forecast of 228,000, on his own calculations, has already become 246,000, the real figure being much worse.  The tightening up on the more evident abuses of the business expansion scheme, promised by him on budget day, has already gone out the window.  Interest rates are so high the Minister is reduced to making feeble public protests to the Governor of the Central Bank.  Despite this, the outflows of money are bleeding our company dry. The Minister's response is to extend further tax incentives to the wealthy and superwealthy.</P>
    <P>We are still firm advocates of the economic school of &ldquo;climatology&rdquo;, that argues that all we have to do is get the climate right and the jobs will follow.  Well, the jobs have not followed.  We could not have any more convincing evidence of that than the performance under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> In 1987 no businessman, in his wildest expectations, would have expected to have procured a climate so favourable so quickly that becomes available under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Yet, the net addition to employment was minimal in an economy which, over that period, lost at least 100,000 people to emigration.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>The Presidency Conclusions of the meeting of the European Council in Rome on 27-28 October 1990 are quite clear on this point.  As I reported to the House on 1 November, they state that the second stage of economic and monetary union will start on 1 January 1994 after certain conditions have been <Col N="936" /> fulfilled.  The conclusions include, <i>inter alia,</i> the following:</P>
      <P>The European Council recalls that, in order to move on to the second phase, further satisfactory and lasting progress towards real and monetary convergence will have to be achieved, especially as regards price stability and the restoration of sound public finances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any announcement of a ceasefire by paramilitary organisations.  It is particularly tragic, however, that this announcement was almost immediately followed by the murder of an innocent man and other terrorist activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the political process now offering a new way forward, the futility and <Col N="938" /> irrelevance of violence must, as I said in the House last week, increasingly be apparent and the permanent cessation of violence or support for it must surely now be considered by all those who wish to participate in the building of a new and agreed Ireland.  It must be apparent to all those who advocate or perpetrate violence that their activities only bring sorrow, suffering and tragedy and are at total variance with the wishes of the vast majority of the men and women of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly agree with the Taoiseach's remarks in relation to the futility and the irrelevance of violence. As we stated in the House last week we welcome the announcement of a ceasefire. May I ask the Taoiseach if there has been any consideration between the British and Irish Governments on the implications of the ceasefire which has been announced and the possibility of a ceasefire being announced by the Provisional IRA?  Would that, in effect, have any bearing on the talks that will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, of course, be very welcome and perhaps in a general way it could contribute to the atmosphere but as far as the talks themselves are concerned, they will follow their own agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the most effective ceasefire in the North of Ireland would be one imposed on the paramilitaries by virtue of a political settlement in the North and then imposed by the people there who would tell them to stop their activities which are interfering with the two communities living together?  Would he also agree that that can only be done when there is a political settlement there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I sought to raise this matter last week.  May I suggest that the Taoiseach as the head of Government and the State make a statement on the welcome of a ceasefire; the word has already gone out from here today in relation to a ceasefire from the Unionist paramilitaries.  It might be appropriate that the Taoiseach consider a statement issuing from the Government inviting others to do likewise in terms of allowing an opportunity for the talks to prosper, to come to fruition and create a proper climate for the talks in Northern Ireland to allow all the communities to be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>All of the temporary posts were advertised in the press.  They were also advertised in the local employment offices of the Department of Social Welfare to encourage suitable persons on the live register to apply. The advertisements indicated that preference would be given to persons who were not in paid employment.</P>
      <P>Senior CSO staff either conducted or chaired the interview boards which selected the supervisory grades.  The temporary supervisors in turn interviewed applicants for the enumerator posts.  The CSO made the enumerator appointments following detailed examination of the returns from the various interview boards.</P>
      <P>Appointment to the various temporary field posts was on the basis of open competitive interview, subject to location constraints, with preference being given to persons not in paid employment. These procedures were approved in advance and I am perfectly satisfied with the operation of the selection process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 15,200 <Col N="943" /> applications for the 3,540 temporary posts, including 334 supervisory posts and 3,206 enumerator posts.  Since previous experience indicated that a significant number of persons would decline the job offers it was decided not to notify unsuccessful applicants until the posts were filled.  This was in keeping with normal practice in previous census returns.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that it is bad practice, not to mention downright discourtesy, not to inform a person who applies for a position that is advertised in the public press that the application is unsuccessful?  This was not done in this case, and it is becoming increasing prevalent in public and private companies.  It is something that should be stamped out and companies should be encouraged to refrain from this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated the reasons for the delay in replying to these people.  In the case of the supervisory posts the letters of notification to unsuccessful candidates were issued within a week of the appointment of the successful candidates.  The 3,206 enumerator appointments were completed by about 22 March and their training commenced on 25 March.  It was critical for the success of the census to supply them with all the necessary census material, including laminated personalised ID cards and so on.  Accordingly, it was not possible to notify the unsuccessful applicants until the period 11 April to 19 April, about 14 to 17 days after the appointments.  As I indicated, it was critical for the success of the census that all the appointments be filled.  Previous experience had shown that many applicants declined the post when offered.  It was, therefore, unfortunately inevitable that there would be a delay in notifying unsuccessful candidates. This is not something new; it has happened on many occasions previously. If there is any way of overcoming this problem we will certainly be glad to consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 11 April 1990, I made two separate orders under the mergers legislation.  One of these orders deals specifically with DJS Meats Limited in Donegal and provides that title to the shares in or the assets of DJS shall not pass until Master Meat Packers (Omagh) Limited are disposed of as a going concern and cease to be under common control with AIBP or connected parties.</P>
      <P>The second order relates to Master Meat Packers (Bandon) Limited and provides that title to the shares in or the assets of Master Meat Packers (Bandon) Limited shall not pass until the Master Meat Packers Group, which includes the four Classic Meats plants referred to by the Deputy, are disposed of as a going concern and cease to be under common control with AIBP or connected parties.</P>
      <P>Both orders required that the takeovers be effected within 12 months of the making of the orders, that is, by midnight on 10 April 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally the orders have continuing effect, namely, that no agreement, arrangement or understanding that would prevent, restrict or distort competition in the purchase of cattle in the State shall be entered into between AIBP and the Master Meat Packers Group; and after the passing of title to the shares in, or the assets of, either DJS Meats Limited or Master Meat Packers (Bandon) Limited under the takeovers, <Col N="947" /> none of the rest of the Master Meat Packers Group shall come under common control or ownership with AIBP.</P>
    <P>I have been informed, by letter dated 11 April 1991, by solicitors acting for AIBP, that the conditions specified at article 5 of the order relating to DJS Meats Limited have been complied with and that the takeover, as defined in the order took place on 10 April 1991.</P>
    <P>I was similarly informed on the same date that the conditions specified in the order relating to Master Meat Packers (Bandon) Limited have been complied with and that the takeover as defined in that order also took place on 10 April 1991.  I was informed that sales of each of the four plants had taken place to four separate companies on 10 April 1991.</P>
    <P>This information fell far short of what would be required to enable me to be sure that the conditions of the orders which I made last year have been fully complied with.  I have, therefore, sought extensive additional information concerning the transactions outlined.  Some of this information has been supplied but the bulk of it is still awaited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Will the Minister indicate how he views the fact that the executive concerned already has a conviction within this jurisdiction for fraudulent activity related to the meat business?

      <P>I cannot confirm to the House what the Deputy asked, for the simple reason that I have not been given any information which would enable me <Col N="948" /> to ascertain who has the beneficial interest or who would exercise the control in the companies which, I am informed, are taking over these plants.  I have simply been given a list of the names of four companies which do not, in themselves, mean very much.  I have asked for further information to enable me to make a decision on the matter and, until I get that, I cannot decide or express an opinion on the matter put forward by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is confirmed that this person, with his former association with the Goodman Group re-emerges in the position at which I have hinted, will it be a factor in the Minister's decision? Will the Minister respond to the view that the entire rescue package of the Goodman Group of companies may be at risk if approval is not forthcoming from the Minister?  Does he believe that the entire rescue package might be at risk having regard to the substantial turnover of the Bandon plant specifically, which is estimated in the order of £45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better not to express a view about something on which I have no official information lest newspaper reports to this effect prove to be incorrect.  I will have to wait and try to get the necessary information.  It is, of course, somewhat surprising that I was not given this information at the time; in particular it is regrettable that the efforts by the vendors to sell these plants were left literally to the 365th day of the year which they were given to comply with the order.  The fact that it was left so late has caused the present confusion and the fact that the obviously necessary information was not given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Deputy's second supplementary is concerned, I have to judge these matters in accordance with what is laid down in the Mergers and Monopolies Act and in accordance with the terms of the order which I made in April 1990. If there are extraneous consequences I cannot do anything about them, I have to judge the matter as it is.  The parties involved had 12 full months in which to put their house in order in regard to this <Col N="949" /> matter and I consider it was ample time to have done so.</P>

      <Quest>if he will establish a special commission to review the fundamentals on Irish company law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of certain recent public statements which have suggested that a commission should be established &ldquo;to review the fundamentals of Irish company law&rdquo;, and I assume this is what the Deputy has in mind in framing the question.  These statements were made in the context of suggestions that Irish law in this field is too complex, particularly in so far as the burden of compliance for smaller companies is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, of course, there is no denying that our companies' legislation is complex, but the simple fact is that the subject matter itself is complex.  We are not alone in this, since the same applies in most other jurisdictions with which we share a common legal background, the most <Col N="950" /> notable of which, of course, is the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>As for reviewing the fundamentals, the most fundamental question of all is whether to continue affording people the privilege of limited liability, particularly given the nature and extent of the abuse of the privilege, and this basic question, among many others, was addressed in the preparation of the Companies Act, 1990. It was decided, quite sensibly I think, that Irish corporate life could not survive any undue tampering with this most basic principle of law, although it was equally recognised that there was, and continues to be, a price to be paid for being allowed the luxury of personal protection from one's creditors.</P>
    <P>That price, essentially, is abiding by a body of rules designed to put in place a series of checks and balances, to ensure that the basic protection is not abused. The 1990 Act simply adjusted this balance, which had, by common consent, swung too far the other way.</P>
    <P>Of course, the limited liability issue was not the only fundamental aspect of company law addressed by the two recent Acts.  For many years, an insolvent company faced essentially two options &mdash; receivership or liquidation.  Now, however, as the Deputy knows, companies in temporary difficulties have the dramatic new alternative of protection by the courts, while their future is worked out. This is clearly a radical and fundamental change of philosophy as far as company law is concerned, and has been widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental reform which was put in place by the &ldquo;main&rdquo; 1990 Act relates to the ability of a company to purchase its own shares.  This reform modifies one of the basic principles on which our company law is based, namely the absolute sanctity of a company's capital as a protection for its creditors.</P>
    <P>There are many other reforms in the Companies Act, 1990, in addition to these.  I merely wish to demonstrate to the Deputy how fundamentally we have reformed the law relating to companies recently.</P>
    <P>As far as &ldquo;lightening the burden&rdquo; on <Col N="951" /> smaller companies is concerned.  I hope to be implementing this year, among others, two EC directives which will have this effect.  The first will allow the incorporation of single member companies, and the second will considerably lighten the accounting disclosure requirements for small companies.</P>
    <P>The last external review of Irish company law was the Cox report, which led eventually to the Companies Act, 1963. I have to say, however, that the Cox committee sat for seven years and that, following their report, it took another five years to get the 1963 Act onto the Statute Book, nothwithstanding that the 1963 Act was based heavily on the United Kingdom Companies Act, 1948.  I would not like to repeat such an exercise at this stage.</P>
    <P>Coming so soon after the enactment of the Companies Act, 1990, and the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which, taken together, amounted to the biggest reforming measure in the entire commercial area in the last 30 years or so, I do not consider that it would be appropriate at this stage to establish the type of special commission suggested.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may rest assured, however, that I and my Department will keep the law as it relates to companies continuously under review and, if I feel it needs to be changed, I will not hesitate to propose this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments which gave rise to the question which the Minister has referred to in his reply were in fact made by a High Court judge after the Companies Act went through this House and had been passed into law, so that did not affect the reforming nature.  The High Court judge suggested that a special commission should be established to review the fundamentals of Irish company law because this country, for its size, is over-regulated and small businesses find it extremely difficult to set up and remain in business because of the number of regulations that have to be complied with.  That will be added to by the Competition Bill which will be passed <Col N="952" /> next week and which has no floor as to the size of business to be subject to that law.  Would the Minister not agree that if that is so &mdash; and perhaps everybody would not share his view that all the laws he has referred to are reforming laws &mdash; the very quantity of laws passed by this House in relation to business should be looked at by some independent commission to see if they could be boiled down to a much more fundamental law which would affect all business and take the onus away from business of trying to avoid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir, you are quite right.  Would the Minister not agree with me when I suggest that there may be a connection between the 19.4 per cent unemployment in this country and the difficulties in getting into and remaining in business in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept, Sir, that company law contributes to that.  I think maybe other matters contribute to it but I really do not think company law does.  Perhaps laws generally do, mainly on the fiscal side in regard to PRSI, VAT and those various other reforms.  However, the question relates only to company law.  I have given examples of the changes that have been made and that are about to be made that distinguish between smaller and larger companies and make things easier for smaller companies. I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is commendable that this same feeling which he is expressing now is also felt widely throughout the European Community and that as a result a number of the directives which this country is waiting to adopt &mdash; there are seven at the moment, plus the nine that are under discussion in Brussels &mdash; have in part at least some of the objectives he mentions and which I share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that under the Companies Act, passed <Col N="953" /> by this House last year, in the section relating to directors, the smaller companies, &mdash; even publicly quoted companies of a smaller size &mdash; are now finding it extremely difficult to get people to act as directors on their boards as a result of that and those are the companies who badly need the type of advice they would get from such directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>That was debated at length on Committee Stage.  I think that the committee and this House generally were satisfied that we achieved the right balance in terms of the duties that one has to put on directors for the overall public good, while at the same time encouraging people to act as directors and in particular to act as non-executive directors.  The fact that the office of director has been so frequently abused over the years and was the subject of so much criticism meant that certain things had to be done to tighten up the exercise of that office.  At the same time we avoided a situation whereby there is undue onus on people that would frighten them away from acting on companies that are well and properly run.</P>

      <P>The Minister obviously did not hear or did not choose to hear what I am saying.  I am telling him that at the moment such small companies cannot get people who are qualified as directors to sit on their boards because of the Companies Act passed last year.  My understanding is that what happened in committee was that the points I am now making were very strongly put by both Deputy Barrett and Deputy Bruton &mdash; they were both on the committee, and I was not &mdash; and were resisted by virtually every other party, including The Workers' Party, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on the committee even though they took no part in the discussions.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied, Sir, that after lengthy discussion the committee took the right decisions.  If there is a reluctance on the part of some people to act on the boards of some companies at present it may well be due to the slightly scaremongering commentaries that have been made by some people, perhaps for their own purposes, on some aspects of that Act.  It has only been law for a few months.  When things settle down and people realise that the effect of the Act, so far as directors are concerned, is not anything as onerous as some people in public are suggesting, then this difficulty will not arise.  I make no apology for clipping the wings of people who have abused their directorships and have abused the privilege of limited liability over a long period to the detriment of large numbers of ordinary people in this country.</P>

      <P>All cars sold on the Irish market have to be imported.  I have received several representations expressing the concern of the established importers of new cars about the import of second-hand cars, particularly from Japan, but I am of the view that such imports tend to increase the level of competition on the Irish market.  We cannot unilaterally introduce import restrictions <Col N="955" /> because of our EC and GATT obligations. In any event, I would regard the imposition of such restrictions for the purpose of protecting established importers as anti-competitive and totally contrary to the spirit of competition which I am trying to promote, not least by the new Competition Bill.</P>

      <P>I understand that the only other country in the European Community which could allow the importation of these cars in the normal way is Britain where cars are driven on the same side of the road as in Ireland and Japan.  I understand the British authorities do not prohibit the importation of second-hand cars from Japan.  I believe this does not happen because the price of second-hand cars in Britain on average is a fair bit lower than it is here.  Therefore, it is probably a less economic proposition to import them.  I understand that these cars were imported into Australia and New Zealand but this practice was stopped after some years as a protection measure for the local industry.</P>

Nonetheless, I am aware that the two largest supermarket chains control approximately 50 per cent of the market. I regard that as too high and I have said so.  I cannot prejudge the matter but it may well amount, in the view of the competition authority to be set up when the competition Bill is passed, to a dominant position.  The question would then arise as to whether there was an abuse of that dominant position.  An aggrieved party who feels there is a dominant position and that it is being abused will be able to have the matter examined and, if necessary, litigated.  Such persons do not have that opportunity open to them at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 22, 27, 31 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>I do not see any need for a change in the fundamental objective of industrial policy which is to develop a strong competitive industrial sector in Ireland which makes the maximum possible contribution to employment and living standards here.  I believe, however, that the instruments of that policy have to be continually reappraised so that the aim of more jobs and wealth in Ireland can be attained most effectively and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my view that industrial policy has been too narrowly defined here.  There has been too great a concentration on incentives, in the form of both grants and tax breaks, and on agencies.  This concentration has diverted attention <Col N="960" /> from the critical importance of good economic management and other structural aspects of industrial development.</P>
    <P>Industrial performance in the period 1987-90 was substantially better than in the earlier eightes primarily because of the greatly improved economic conditions brought about by stricter control of public expenditure and better economic management.  The continuation of that approach must have the highest priority.</P>
    <P>The attainment of effective competition throughout the economy is of fundamental importance to the lowering of costs for the traded sectors.  I regard the early enactment of the competition Bill as a key contribution to industrial policy objectives for this reason.</P>
    <P>Our physical infrastructure and our educational, training and manpower policies are also critical to industrial development. We are embarking on a major programme to develop our science and technology capability.  There are changes occurring in global markets, in the process of European intergration, in technology and in the organisation of manufacturing which have implications for our industry over coming decades.  All these inputs to industrial progress and our reaction to them must be advanced in a coherent way.</P>
    <P>The points I have referred to are the essence of industrial policy.  The State's industrial agencies are instruments of that policy and they contribute to industrial investment, and to technological and marketing development, through various programmes.  The impact of those programmes can be seen in the strength of the industrial sector which we now have, in the jobs in industries which set up here over the past 30 years and in the growth of our industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Arising from my Department's <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> and consistent with the aim of achieving greater efficiency in agency programmes, I have announced a number of changes in relation to the level of grant assistance to be made available to industry, the merging of the marketing support services provided by Corás Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council, and the amalgamation <Col N="961" /> of the activities of NADCORP and the IDA.  Details of the grant changes are set out in the review, copies of which have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>As regards job creation, the House will be aware that under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the aim is to create 20,000 new jobs each year of the programme in manufacturing and international services.  After initial uncertainties in the first quarter of the year due to the hostilities in the Gulf, a much more positive trend is now emerging and I am confident that the target set out in the programme will be met.  Underpinning the target is the need for sustained economic stability through the successful implementation of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a number of the Minister's comments.  Would the Minister agree that it is equally very expensive, and not value for money, to keep people on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance?  Would the Minister not agree that at this stage we are somewhat uncompetitive in the international market having regard, for example, to the package on offer in Northern Ireland and in certain parts of the UK?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is important to try to get people off the dole.  The reason in some cases, but not in all, is the interaction between social welfare and net pay.  Our laws on income tax and on PRSI at any given time are crucial to that.  I hope more can be done in that regard.  So far as incentives generally are concerned, there are parts of Europe, including some of those mentioned by the Deputy, where some grant levels may be higher than those available here, but I am confident that our incentives as a whole are more attractive than anywhere else in Europe, particularly when one bears in mind our taxation incentives.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that we tend to concentrate our industrial development policy basically in agencies such as the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta to the virtual <Col N="962" /> exclusion of county development teams, who because of lack of finance are unable to fulfil their developmental role?  Will the Minister consider a scheme to allow county development teams to have a fund of about £200,000 from which they could give low interest loans to various small enterprises in their counties, with a view to providing a revolving fund?  It is something worth considering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the enterprise development programme it is possible for the IDA and other appropriate agencies to give loans and guarantee interest on loans.  The question of extending those powers to companies that do not come within the enterprise development programme is at present under consideration and I hope that that will be done as it would be beneficial and less costly than payments of non-repayable grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that that is a fact.  The triennial review of last December makes that point at some length and regrets the fact.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I am sure, has been told on many occasions by industrialists that given the choice between employing a person and buying a machine, they will almost invariably buy the machine, because of the flood of legislation with which they have to deal to employ somebody and because of the costs involved.  This is what the Minister should address if the indigenous companies are to be encouraged to employ <Col N="963" /> more people and take them off the unemployment register.  We must make it easier for employers to take people on. If we do that indigenous companies will grow.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that one of the problems that assails the young motorist in particular is that the Minister's Department are not getting sufficiently involved and are not monitoring on a regular basis the activities of all parties &mdash; claimants and motor insurers? Would the Minister not accept that a more rigid appraisal of developments on a daily or weekly basis would bring about some benefits to those seeking insurance cover?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance section of my Department are well informed about developments in insurance.  The nub of the problem is that the Deputy really wants the Department to get involved in individual cases, to as it were, sit on insurance companies on a weekly basis.  That is not feasible and it is very much at odds with what his colleague Deputy Barry has been saying to me here in the last few minutes.  It is undesirable and it is not feasible.  There are constant meetings with the Irish Insurance Federation, where many points are made repeatedly and where our urgings in this respect are being taken on board by the companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstood my supplementary.  Would the Minister not accept that the dangerous and unfortunate trend of escalating insurance costs which have surfaced over the last ten years should not be allowed to <Col N="965" /> continue and that the Minister's reply to the question would lead people, particularly insurance companies and those who made fraudulent claims, to the conclusion that the Department are not very interested?  Would the Minister not also agree that if his Department showed a more urgent interest in what was taking place it might become a signal for a change in attitude?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy in reply to a supplementary to an earlier question that over a year ago I and the Department brought the attention of companies to what I believed was a growing incidence of fraudulent claims. Unfortunately, they did not have the statistics I wished they had.  I asked them to get those statistics and to set up structures which would enable them to have those statistics.  I pointed out that that would be the most effective way of putting a stop to these fraudulent claims, or certainly diminishing them.  The incidence of fraudulent claims is now beginning to drop but it was and probably still is a serious matter in this country.  They are utterly dishonest and disreputable and I deplore the fact that they go on because they contribute in a way which must be of some significance to the high level of costs and, therefore, premiums.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that the vast majority of young drivers cannot even get a quotation and that the vast majority of insurance companies will not touch young drivers? In view of the fact that the one or two companies who give a quotation will charge up to £2,000 for first time insurance, would the Minister consider introducing a quota system so that the liability would be spread among the various companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is correct to say that it is impossible for any <Col N="966" /> driver to get a quotation.  They do get quotations but they get them at figures which are way beyond their means, and effectively for an individual that may amount to the same thing.  I have had intensive discussions with the insurance companies on this matter and we have looked at different ways of approaching the problem.  In particular the Government have taken what I think is a very useful initiative in setting up a sub-committee, which I have announced already, consisting of myself as chairman, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for the Environment and the Attorney General to look at substantial ways in which different aspects of our laws could be changed to bring down the costs of motor accidents and their consequences as they are so inordinately high in comparison with other countries as a result of which premiums are inordinately high.  Our court system, as opposed to the systems in other countries, must be a significant factor, that is one of the issues under consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the perception outside Government circles is that the reason no suitable partner for Irish Steel has been found is that there is a difference of opinion between himself and the Minister for Finance as to who that partner should be. If this is so, would either one of them &mdash; I do not care which one &mdash; take this matter by the scruff of the neck and do something to ease the tension for the workforce who do not know where their future lies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's view on this matter is well known.  They are anxious for Irish Steel to be taken over by somebody suitable.  If I wanted to get rid of Irish Steel simply for the sake of having a sale I could have had a sale long ago.  There was no problem about that.  It is incumbent upon me to use my judgment to try to ensure that whoever buys Irish Steel is the best possible person from the point of view of the country and the workforce and the continued viability of the company well into the future.  I have not been able to satisfy myself, in all conscience, that we are in a position to sell the company to <Col N="969" /> somebody who would make that company viable during the next five to ten years and keep it that way.  If we simply wanted to sell for the sake of selling, we could have done so long ago.  I appreciate that there is frustration because it has taken much longer than people anticipated, but I would say to those who are frustrated that it is in their own interest that we try to get it right rather than just get rid of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been approached by and have had conversations with two steel companies from different parts of the world about this matter during the past 12 months.  Both of them assured me they had proposed different forms of partnership to the Government but were told by the Department &mdash; one last May and the other earlier &mdash; that there was no point talking to them as the deal had been signed, sealed and delivered.</P>

Discussions are ongoing with various parties, some of whom would be very suitable if their offer or plans for the future of the plant were acceptable from the Government's point of view, while others might be less suitable for one reason or another.  The matter is still being actively pursued.  In fact, I have been approached during the past few days by a company who expressed an interest about 18 months ago but who then withdrew.  They have again expressed an interest and I welcome that.  I have told <Col N="970" /> them we will be perfectly happy to talk to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to change the grant levels currently in operation.  County Kerry is a designated area under the Industrial Development Act, 1986, which allows for a higher maximum capital grant rate.  While maximum capital grants are seldom given, the IDA, in negotiating with project promoters, take full account of the developmental needs of each area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that recent experience has shown that industry is now attracted to the larger population centres, especially where there is an international airport, and that in order to encourage industry to the peripheral areas there will have to be some form of preferential grant scheme which would give a greater incentive for industrialists to locate in those areas? Would the Minister ensure that the advantages available under our present grant scheme are specified in IDA literature? At present it is very hard for an industrialist locating in Ireland to be made aware that he would get a better deal if he invested in peripheral areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that all industrialists or would-be industrialists who are thinking of investing are well aware of relative grant levels in different places, but the Deputy will have to appreciate, as I tried to make clear in the reply, that the days of the payment of maximum grants of 60 per cent in any part of the country are long since gone, and we will not see them again.  What I think important as the question relates to Kerry is that the Deputy should be aware that the very considerations he is putting <Col N="971" /> forward now are borne in mind.  I am looking at the average capital grant level paid nationally and comparing it with the average capital grant level paid in County Kerry in the period 1986-90, inclusive, and I find the Kerry average figure is 11 per cent higher than the national average. From that, the Deputy can safely conclude that the difficulties or disadvantages of peripheral areas are fully borne in mind and the kind of policy he is advocating is followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister that the advantages he is pointing out have not been very effective in attracting industry into Kerry.  As he knows, in the last ten years we got very little in Kerry so we need more than is there at the moment if we are not to condemn Kerry and other peripheral areas to total depopulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Kerry is doing reasonably well overall.  I would like to see more industry there but, equally, I would like to see more in other counties that are less well fixed than Kerry, but let us hope there will be further development there soon.</P>

      <P>The recently established inter-ministerial group are examining ways and means of improving the environment for motor insurance.  This group are focusing on strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation, amendments to the Road Traffic Acts designed to reduce the motor accident rate, suggestions to improve the cost and availability of motor insurance and improvements or alternatives to the <Col N="972" /> courts system for the resolution of personal injury claims.  The implementation of any agreed measures will be a matter for the Ministers concerned, for example, the Minister for the Environment in relation to amendments to the Road Traffic Acts, and the Minister for Justice in relation to enforcement and for measures related to improving the operations of the courts.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the group may be in a position to report to Government on proposed measures within a matter of a month or two.  I would add, however, that Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs. The general public, including motorists, must play their part by increased awareness of the need for road safety.</P>

      <P>All available information and statistics are being made available to the group concerned to whom I have referred and certainly will be taken into account by them so far as that information is available, but it is not as widely available as the Deputy might expect or might consider desirable. Because of a huge number of claims in this country which run into hundreds of thousands each year, it really is impossible to have information on individual claims.  Companies have to average it but even on the averaging the information is disturbing when you see the increase in the incidence of claims and at the same time the extraordinary increase in the cost of individual claims.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that all the information is made available to us when it is requested.  It sometimes happens that some of the information we require is not available and we have asked the companies in those instances to get the information.  Sometimes they tell us it is very costly to do it and sometimes it may take a year to get it, but in fairness to a number of the companies, I have to say that they have come up with this information even though it has taken some time.  A year and a half ago I discovered that companies did not have as many statistics on claims as I would have wished and I thought necessary in order to try to cope with the problems that were arising, but much more of that information is now available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate earlier I was about to conclude my remarks on the Finance Bill.  In recent years the Finance Bill has become a document which merely forms the basis of negotiation for powerful lobby interest groups.  This has been seen in recent years and is repeated in dramatic fashion on this occasion.  In Britain the publication of the Finance Bill is virtually simultaneous with the announcement of the budget.  This system would do a great deal to obviate the situation here where the Minister is subject to pressure from powerful vested interest groups and even members of his own Cabinet.  Budget measures are no longer accurately reflected in the Finance Bill and the Bill as introduced will unquestionably be different when eventually approved by this House.  This shows that the professional lobbyists merely regard it as an opening counter on which they can secure concessions. Meanwhile the section of society which cannot afford to employ professional lobbyists on their behalf must make do with the paltry and miserly provisions offered by the Minister for Finance. When the tax year was not as it is now, the publication of the budget and the Finance Bill were more closely aligned. The position has deteriorated in recent years and it is an invitation to powerful interest groups to intrude themselves in this fashion, always at the expense of the taxpayer.  They apparently meet a willing ear in the Minister for Finance of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the budgetary measures to which the Bill is designed to give effect are out of date.  I have dealt with the Minister's projection on growth and commented on the fact that it is generally accepted that the Exchequer borrowing requirement as predicted by the Minister will not be met.  The position in relation to unemployment is already drastically worse than the Minister's prediction for the end of the year &mdash; and this only 11 weeks after the announcement of the budget.  Despite this, there are no corrective measures in to the Finance Bill to tackle some of these deteriorating economic indicators.  There is no stimulation of employment, despite <Col N="1054" /> the fact that unemployment is getting out of hand.</P>
    <P>There is no indication that the Minister is prepared to reconsider the extraordinary decision of the Government apparently to abandon for the time being the construction of the Tallaght Regional Hospital.  This is a further indication of how the Progressive Democrat-Fianna Fáil Government view one section of society as compared with another.  This hospital is desperately needed in my constituency. I am not engaged in any special pleading.  The need was identified as long ago as 1968 in the Fitzgerald report.  It is part of the rationalisation of Dublin hospitals and is not a new hospital in that sense.  It would provide very badly needed employment in a constituency which has a huge population of unemployed building workers and would provide jobs for some 1,800 people when opened, as well as a desperately needed hospital facility.  Yet there is no indication in this Bill that the Minister is reconsidering his appalling decision which came completely out of the blue to the people of Tallaght, Clondalkin, Walkinstown, Rathcoole and the surrounding area of west Dublin, north Wicklow and part of Kildare whom this hospital was meant to serve.</P>
    <P>I have reminded the House on a previous occasion that not very long ago a Government backbencher withdrew his support from the Government when it was threatened to close one of three hospitals in Limerick.  The constituency I represent is larger than Limerick and has no hospital.  That is the kind of comparison that can be made when one considers how this Government look after people who are taxpayers, who need this kind of service.  The Government had the unbelievable cynicism in the same week that they announced the decision not to proceed with Tallaght hospital to appoint a Deputy from the constituency a junior Minister at the Department of Health.  That is the kind of cynicism we can do without in politics.  If Fianna Fáil think that will buy off the people in my constituency, they have another thought coming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> The Finance Bill does not tackle the question of fundamental tax reform.  That is the major omission. There is a climb down on the BES proposals announced by the Minister in the budget and the extension of more taxpayers' largesse to the Temple Bar area of Dublin.  Now you could trip over the various designated areas for development in Dublin.  Those tax-led construction projects now far out-number demand.  One wonders if the business community will do anything any more for which they do not get incentives. It would seem that they will not and that the Minister is encouraging that approach to business.  I wish to put on record that at a minimum the Minister should take on board the views expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on the business expansion scheme from which I quote:</P>
    <P>It can therefore be argued that the same criteria should apply to tax expenditures as would be applied to direct State expenditure and that mechanisms should be put in place which systematically measure and record the cost of schemes financed by tax expenditure and which evaluate the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of such expenditures and report on them to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable safeguard which the Comptroller and Auditor General recommended and, at a very minimum, should be taken on board by the Minister. I notice from the Minister's remarks that the Department have somehow suddenly produced a figure for the number of jobs which they claim have been created by the business expansion scheme.  I do not know where those figures were produced from as I have had no opportunity to examine them.  They were certainly pulled out of the hat very late in the day because as recently as two or three weeks ago when the Secretary of the Department was examined by the Committee of Public Accounts he was not able to say &mdash; and this was very explicit &mdash; how many jobs were created by the business <Col N="1056" /> expansion scheme.  In fact he said it would not be possible to state the number of jobs created, but in order to save face for his climb down, the Minister has suggested &ldquo;X&rdquo; number of jobs were created by the business expansion scheme.  However, I cannot accept that without seeing the basis of the figures.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with The Workers' Party view on privatisation but I should have remarked in passing that one of the great privatisers in this Government, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, very much agrees with the Progressive Democrat philosophy of privatising our successful State companies but he was too cute to jump ship and join the Progressive Democrats when everybody anticipated that he would.  When addressing the difficulties in B &amp; I, he did not have very much difficulty in writing off the £28 million accumulated deficit before it will be handed over to some of this Government's friends in the private sector.  If the Government had agreed to write off the accumulated debt when I was dealing with the B &amp; I a number of years ago, it would be the B &amp; I Group who would be taking over the ICG group, but B &amp; I, like so many other companies, was strangled by the accumulated debt. The Government would not write it off then but they are prepared to write it off now for the private sector.  The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications seems confident he can justify that approach.</P>
    <P>The extent of the haemorrhage of funds out of the Irish economy is frightening and requires urgent action on the part of the Government.  There were outflows of £3.2 billion this year which is a haemorrhage that this economy cannot afford.  Some measures must be devised to cause at least a portion of that money to be reinvested in the domestic economy. Unfortunately, this Finance Bill is a poor reflection on what has been a failed budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sat in this Chamber throughout the course of the debate since the Minister rose to his feet yesterday <Col N="1057" /> afternoon.  I have listened attentively to the proceedings.  I have paid particular attention to the contribution from the Opposition benches.  Quite frankly I have been amazed at some of the negative patter over the past two days.  The doom and gloom gospel preached by Deputy Noonan was extremely depressing if one were to give it credence.  However, the reality of the situation is that as a direct consequence of the sustained, positive and progressive policies conceived and implemented by this Minister and Government, the Irish economy is light years ahead of the chaotic and depressed situation which obtained when Deputy Noonan and his party were at the helm. The rate of inflation is now the lowest in Europe and is below that of the great powers.  We recently have seen the initial signs of a reduction in interest rates. Despite what the Deputy said, the Government do not lack credibility with the business sector.  This must be seen against the background of the extraordinary external factors which have occurred and over which we in this country have no control whatsoever, but which Deputy Noonan saw fit not to mention. The entire world virtually has been at war.  All of our main trading partners have been at war but still our economy has performed strongly and buoyantly, although we had a slight hiccup.  That is the reality.</P>
      <P>I do not share Deputy Quinn's doubts and reservations about self-assessment for tax purposes.  I think our approach must be much more positive than that. This Administration has already proved that they have a feel for the timing of such things.  A major example of this was the hugely successful tax amnesty.  This has been attempted by previous administrations but without any success whatsoever, yet the Fianna Fáil Government in their timing and by their mode of application of the amnesty yielded substantial benefits to the Exchequer, and simultaneously enabled thousands of business people and taxpayers' throughout the country to regularise their affairs and start afresh with their fears and traumas eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> I am sorry that Deputy Rabbite has now left the Chamber but I listened to his very lengthy contribution.  He devoted much of his time to criticising the business expansion scheme.  He portrayed the Minister's actions in regard to that scheme in a totally false and inaccurate light.  As far as I am concerned he pulled the figures out of the air when he talked about a loss in revenue to the Exchequer of £100 million.  I should like to know from where he gleaned that figure.  The position with regard to the business expansion scheme, or indeed any other, is that there are always professional people out there, prepared, ready and willing to exploit their provisions, within the law, ascertaining loopholes for the benefit of their clientele.  That is the reality. Successive Ministers for Finance must contend with this practice, will have to do so in the future, closing off the loopholes as they appear.  The present Minister has done precisely that.  In fact he commenced closing loopholes in relation to the business expansion scheme in last year's budget when he saw untoward practices creep in.  He tackled the position again in this year's budget when fresh loopholes and untoward practices became apparent, when he saw great merit in implementing changes in the provisions of the business expansion scheme. Because of its job creation implications he amended the action on which he had embarked at budget time.  I might express my sincere appreciation of the Minister's action in that regard.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently with the chief executive of the Irish Hotels Federation, Mr. John Horan who, in his official capacity, was loud in his praise of the Minister's realistic businesslike, astute handling of the business expansion scheme.  The Minister foresaw its implications for job creation and the advancement of tourism generally.  Consequently he implemented the necessary amendments to ensure that meritorious hoteliers and others, up and running with their plans to upgrade and improve, were accommodated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte spoke about the lack of job creation.  I was very surprised he mentioned jobs at all.  If one did not have <Col N="1059" /> knowledge of Deputy Rabbitte's actions on the ground in one's constituency, his criticism of the scheme, of the merits and attempts of this Administration to create jobs and improve our economy, if one did not know that Deputy and his <i>modus operandi</i> so well, one would be incredulous of what one heard.  Unfortunately I have had experience of Deputy Rabbitte's approach to jobs and their creation. I contend that job destruction would be a more apt description in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is not long since there was the greatest disgrace and scandal in the entire history of industry and industrial relations in my constituency in Wicklow when a thriving, viable industry, the lifeblood of Wicklow town and its hinerland, namely, the VEHA company, went to the wall in an exercise of industrial relations vandalism spearheaded by the actions of that same Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Sherlock) Acting Chairman (Mr. Sherlock)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Sherlock):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that his language is not acceptable.  He must speak about the Finance Bill and that which it could relevantly contain.  That kind of language is not at all appropriate at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept the Chair's censure but it does not change the factual position.  I will go on to more constructive things.  However, the Deputy's name will long be remembered in County Wicklow but not with any fondness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting to tourism, the business expansion scheme and its job creation implications, Deputy Rabbitte repeated a number of times that there was not a job creating factor within that scheme. Taking one small example in the same neck of the woods, in the same area where those jobs were lost in the VEHA company, I can assure the Deputy that the Minister's actions in amending the provisions of the business expansion scheme will lead directly to a number of jobs being created in the immediate future in the case of two hotels in the Wicklow town area which will almost <Col N="1060" /> make up for those jobs lost as a result of the closure to which I referred.</P>
    <P>There have been three years of excellent progress in tourism.  It is now three years since there was a real shake-up in Bord Fáilte, when a new chief executive, Mr. Martin Dully, was appointed.  He was given one simple, explicit instruction: double tourism in Ireland and take five years to do so.  Despite the external difficulties that prevailed in the current year, Bord Fáilte have made tremendous progress, and are almost on target in delivering on that direct instruction from the Taoiseach resulting from a Government decision.  Matters are progressing very well in our tourist industry generally. Despite those external difficulties all the signs augur well for a good year for tourism. The American market may suffer somewhat but it is expected that substitute business from the United Kingdom and Europe will compensate.  We look forward to that with relish because we are all disappointed.  I am particularly disappointed that the economic progress that has been achieved and with the macro-economic issues coming to fruition, job creation has not been increased to the extent that is necessary.  Therefore, we look to tourism as one of the areas where this badly needed job creation can materialise.</P>
    <P>In the same area of tourism, we in Wicklow, in the last couple of years, have been deemed to have a national park.  I would like to raise an aspect of that national park which is of the most vital economic importance to the county and, indeed, to the country: that is the progress with an interpretative centre that is planned by the Office of Public Works in the centre of the Wicklow mountain plateau which is causing some disruption at present for local people who are concerned about the location of the centre.</P>
    <P>I have spoken recently with senior officials in the Office of Public Works and, quite frankly, I have chided them on their lack of liaison and communication with the local people regarding this meritorious project.  The day is gone when the State or anybody else at any level can impose on the people something they do <Col N="1061" /> not want or into which they do not have an input.  This centre is wanted, it is needed and is meritorious.  I have been trying to keep an open mind on the situation. An expenditure of £200 million would be involved and that is welcome in a county such as Wicklow where great efforts are being made to follow the example given by the Government to ensure that the tourism industry is furthered to the ultimate extent.  It comes back to liaison, co-operation and discussion with the people on the ground to ensure their co-operation with the location of such a centre.</P>
    <P>In the past I have taken up the matter of this national park in Wicklow with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Daly, who formerly had responsibility for the Office of Public Works, who was extremely co-operative with me and my constituents with regard to the development of this national park.  I had proposed to the Minister that he set up a board of trustees who would be fully representative of all the interests at local, county and national levels so that that liaison and co-operation, about which I spoke earlier, would obtain.  The Minister took that on board and accepted it but unfortunately this board of trustees, or board of management, have not yet been put in place.  I would ask the Minister and, indeed, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Vincent Brady, who now has responsibility for this area and who, I have no doubt, will be as co-operative as was his predecessor, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Daly, to take that on board as a matter of urgency and put the board of trustees in place. The line of liaison will be there for the benefit of the people on the ground and the Office of Public Works who are endeavouring to do a good and meritorious job.  It would be in the Minister's interest to have a co-ordinated effort on this whole affair which we in Wicklow want but which, perhaps, could progress at a faster rate if that level of liaison and co-operation existed.</P>
    <P>The process of decentralisation is continuing on an ongoing basis.  I am very happy for those counties which benefit <Col N="1062" /> from this process.  This is a very worthy process which takes Civil Service Departments from central areas where they have been since time immemorial and relocates them, thus breathing new life into areas throughout the country.  It is a very worthwhile process, one on which I commend the Government.  As I said previously, it is not necessary to be 100 miles or 200 miles from Dublin to have worthy decentralisation.  At this point I would like to make a strong case for siting one of these Government Departments in my constituency of Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, in the short or medium-term, it will become necessary to relocate the Coillte Teoranta headquarters. Forestry is expanding at an unprecedented rate throughout the country. I would ask that the headquarters of Coillte Teoranta be set up in the premier forestry county of Wicklow.  More land area in County Wicklow is planted with trees than in any other county.</P>
    <P>In Wicklow we have contributed to forestry and afforestation over the years. There have been great advantages to the people of Wicklow resulting in the provision of jobs and a major boost to the economy.  There has been a downside as well in that the heavy trucks carting the forest products have played havoc with the roads.  These roads were never meant for such heavy loads and the safety factor has sometimes been precarious.  All things considered a strong case can be made for locating Coillte Teoranta headquarters in the premier forestry county.</P>
    <P>In talking about forestry I would make one further plea on behalf of the small family type timber operator.  I have spoken about it previously in this House. It is very important that these people continue in the jobs that they, their fathers and forefathers have kept going right across the country.  There are an estimated 350 small operators in Wicklow working in the timber business in family-type small mills.  That is typical of many counties throughout the country. There was a period when the availability of timber to these people was extremely scarce.  I would ask that this matter be addressed so that these people can be <Col N="1063" /> allowed to carry on that tradition for many generations to come, especially in view of the fact that we as a country have, in the last few years, committed ourselves so much to afforestation.  We had been at the bottom of the heap in Europe in terms of planting, with about 6.5 per cent of our land area forested whereas the European average was about 25 per cent. The survival of these people, their children and their children's children should be thought of at all times.</P>
    <P>In my contribution to the Finance Bill this time last year I spoke about the position with regard to post offices, and it appears now that that was somewhat prophetic. I voiced concern last year, but at that time there were just rumours that there might be an attempt on behalf of the company to reduce the number of sub-post offices around the country. Unfortunately that has come to pass with An post's plan to tackle their financial difficulties.  One of the measures they proposed was to close rural post offices. This is as unacceptable as their policy to provide roadside letter boxes throughout rural Ireland.  If these two changes are brought about they will have a major effect on rural life.  We all talk about rural development and keeping people in rural Ireland, and much of our European funding is being channelled into that area but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the implications of the decisions of An Post, I would remind the Deputy that we are discussing the Finance Bill which relates to finance, taxation and so on.  The Deputy's speech is not relevant to that.  I would ask him to be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comply as usual with the Chair's ruling.  Before leaving that point I would appeal to the Minister concerned to go along with the <i>modus operandi</i> in progress at the moment.  In the final analysis, the two aspects to which I referred are infinitesimal when compared to the company's overall financial difficulties. In the context of those two issues rural Ireland should remain unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the important matter of VAT on all hotel services in the context of the European stance on this issue.  The 30 January budget increased VAT in the hotel services area from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent, with a view to this being &mdash; and I quote the Minister on that occasion &mdash;&ldquo;another instalment of the adjustment we must make for participation in the new Europe&rdquo;.  Since budget day on 30 January 1991 there appears to have been a change in the European view on this matter.  On 26 February 1991 Mrs. Schrivener, the EC Commissioner for Taxation, announced that she now favours the application of the reduced rate of VAT&mdash; 4 to 9 per cent&mdash;on tourism activities, including all hotel services. In these circumstances, would the Minister examine the position with a view to perhaps veering in the direction of this apparently revised European thinking. Perhaps the Minister could in this Finance Bill consider this matter favourably in view of the current major momentum of the Irish hotel industry and Irish tourism and in view of the job creation record to date.</P>
    <P>There are some commendable inclusions in this Bill to which I will briefly refer.  The improvement in the family income supplement is extremely welcome and I commend the Minister for taking that on board.  The widowed parents provision is also welcome.  In the area of agriculture, the improvement in capital acquisitions tax is extremely welcome, particularly in these difficult times. The further liberalisation of the installation scheme for young farmers is very welcome.  This is continuing evidence of what the Minister and the Government are trying to achieve.  They are creating an incentive for the young to take over from the old in Irish farming.  The disabled drivers' scheme is another welcome measure.  The provision with regard to inheritance tax being made retrospective to 1982 is extremely welcome.  That obviously will take into consideration the specific and anomalous cases to date.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation the Minister has been playing around with the tax bands to <Col N="1065" /> great effect in the last number of budgets. He continued down that road in this budget, and that is welcome.  He is reducing the tax payable by people on the higher rates.  We are spot on target with regard to the promises and commitments in the whole area of taxation.  Despite the criticism and different interpretations of the situation, the reality is that we are spot on target with the commitments already given.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance and the Government on their quite magnificent performance in the economic management of our country.  I wish them continued success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget was a disappointment and the Finance Bill implementing the budget only compounds that disappointment.  While we are discussing this Finance Bill the twin evils of unemployment and emigration continue unabated. The Government can no longer cope with the situation and it is difficult to find much comfort in the Finance Bill to alleviate the position.  When one considers that there are more than 246,000 people unemployed and another 30,000 on social employment schemes and various training courses, the implications of the unemployment problem are absolutely frightening.  More than 100,000 of those people have been out of work for over a year.  Have the Government become so anaesthetised by the problem that the only comfort they can give each year to these people is to increase the social welfare allowances and hope that by this method they can keep the lid on the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Jacob spouting a lot of optimism, saying that the Government were spot on target.  However, if unemployment is a barometer of the success of the Government then God help us.  The Minister in his speech referred to the innovative approaches towards tackling unemployment black spots but his statement rings hollow because I have analysed the budget and Finance Bill and do not see any indications that there is a positive attempt to do something about this specific <Col N="1066" /> problem.  Indeed, it is incumbent on the Government to try to achieve a positive framework within which to do something about this great affliction.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxation, the Government are possibly long on aspiration but lack commitment to reform taxation; they continue to tinker with the present system. The only utterances in relation to taxation have come from Michael McDowell, the chairman of the Progressive Democrats Party, their appointed spokesman on Finance.  He can talk almost uninterruptedly outside this Chamber in relation to taxation and the laudable and long term ambitions of his party.  However, the Progressive Democrates, who form part of this Coalition, seem to be achieving very little in responding to Mr. McDowell's ambitions.</P>
    <P>There have been minor reductions in the rates of tax but the tax allowances and bands remain virtually unchanged. Some people, no matter what increases and small gains they achieve find themselves in the higher tax bands which means they are paying more tax.  In the last few budgets, because of the increases in social welfare, an unintentional poverty trap has been created for those who work in the main income group earning between £8,000 and £10,000 per year. Indeed, over the last few years, especially from 1986 to 1990, tax receipts grew at an average annual rate of around 7 per cent.  This was possibly because of changes in the tax collection system and indeed its administration and enforcement. Undoubtedly, the amnesty of 1988 helped; it was rather strange to hear Deputy Jacob justify that amnesty, saying that it achieved something and at least allowed people to put their tax affairs in order and start anew.  It almost appeared to me that he was condoning the tax avoidance which existed up to then.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jacob also referred to the self-assessment method; he said that the Government were spot on in relation to self-assessment.  It was a strange remark because, at the recent conference of the Tax Officers' Association, the self-assessment system was castigated.  I agree with <Col N="1067" /> Deputy Rabbitte's statement that there are defects in the self-assessment system and that there were no checks on the people paying tax, with the exception of a very small number, to verify whether it was working effectively.  Where tax officers made those effective checks they found that the people availing of self-assessment were underestimating the amount of tax they should be paying. That proves that the self-assessment system is not working effectively when it comes to monitoring and tracking what is happening.  There is possibly a tax reservoir to be collected; PAYE workers who are taxed at source are incensed at the fact that other people are not paying their fair share.  The Minister for Finance should address this.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised that the difference between a person working as opposed to being unemployed and on social welfare is minimal in many cases.  On many occasions it has been highlighted in this Chamber that there is a poverty trap. The Government have not recognised that there is a problem in this regard; indeed the Minister for Social Welfare will give examples to prove, in relation to certain areas, that the poverty trap does not exist.  However, the Minister is very selective in his examples and I can give many examples to show that there is very little difference between working&mdash; and earning between £8,000 and £10,000 &mdash;and not working.  This has happened because, over the last few years, there has been a narrowing of the differentiation due to social welfare increases and the disposable earnings of those working.</P>
    <P>I am often amused when I hear people trotting out what is regarded as the average wage, well over £200.  I come from a rural constituency and I am well aware of what many factories in the area pay; in many cases the factories are unionised and within a radius of ten miles at least six of them pay the princely sum of £140 to, possibly, £160 per week.  What is the attraction of that sum to a married man with two children working in one of those factories?  Many of them have told me that they would be better off not <Col N="1068" /> working but that that would drive them mad.  The inbuilt motivation is not in relation to the financial inducements and the Government are not helping those people.  We have gone a little bit but not far enough.  We must recognise that our PRSI and taxation systems create a poverty trap for that sector.  I recognise that the Minister has made minor adjustments to help the lower paid but the unemployed must be motivated to try to get jobs.</P>
    <P>As a result of the social employment scheme many people do laudable work in their communities.  I regret that recently the number of places has been reduced.  If anything, I would expand the number of places on the schemes because the money from the Department of Social Welfare would be better used to pay people for working.  It is really only juggling the books in relation to where the money comes from.  The Government should do an in-depth study of the link between social welfare and taxation at work if we are to ensure that those at work are adequately compensated for their efforts and not caught in the poverty trap to which I referred.  I have encountered many people who are fearful of working overtime in case they lose their medical card and other concessions.  A medical card, in recent times, has been valued at in excess of £460.  There is no incentive for a person on social welfare to move into a low paid job.  We must, as a matter of urgency, try to integrate the tax and social welfare systems and analyse the position in regard to these poverty traps.  The question I ask is, is there a willingness by the Minister and the Government to do this?</P>
    <P>We all know that the housing situation is disastrous.  We have escalating house prices.  Young couples are looking for houses.  Yet, progressively since 1987, almost by sleight of hand, mortgage interest relief has been reduced from £4,000 in 1987 to £3,200 at present, a reduction of 25 per cent.  The idea of giving mortgage relief to young, hard-pressed couples is certainly worthy of consideration. I particularly pinpoint that sector because <Col N="1069" /> many of them are making attempts to house themselves.</P>
    <P>We listened today to people advocating that we should get some movement into housing policy here.  We know that over 19,000 people are at present on a housing list.  Many of them have the motivation and desire to house themselves, but we are not giving them any incentive to do so.  They must be given that incentive. What have the Government done in response to the needs of these people? Many young married couples took out endowment mortgages which have a life assurance element, and in this budget the Government reduced tax relief on life assurance policies from 50 per cent to 25 per cent.  Is this a positive approach to the young people in our society who are trying to do something for themselves?  I defy anybody in this House to tell me that they have not encountered people in their clinics who want to get a start, to get out there and provide themselves with housing.  However, there is no encouragement given to them to do so.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Finance Bill to the DIRT and further modifications, particularly in relation to foreign accounts.  When this tax was introduced by the Fine Gael&mdash;Labour Government it was derided by Fianna Fáil who stated that on their return to office they would abolish it.  Then they got an attack of fiscal rectitude, rather belatedly, and retained this tax which is pumping out £300 million a year.  There is one appalling aspect of it that has not been touched on by anyone, that is that our old age pensioners pay this tax and then have the option to reclaim it back.  My understanding is that last year £15.3 million was claimed back by in excess of 20,000 people.  The majority of that 20,000 happen to be old age pensioners and they deserve to get that money back. But I know that thousands of people are not bothering to claim it back.  They are afraid that their pension might be tampered with afterwards; they detest paper work and bureaucracy.  They have all kinds of fears and concerns.  Many of them would need to go to an accountant for professional advice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> I have met accountants who have told me that the same concerns were put in front of them by old age pensioners.  They are worried that it might be deducted from their pensions.  Let us not say that that is fantasy.  It is not.  In the UK, pensioners do not have to pay retention tax; that is determined in advance.  Let us not indulge in this three card trick of taking the tax from them and giving them the option to claim it back but almost hoping that they will not.  Let us have some respect for our older people.  It would not be very difficult for the people in the Department of Finance to some up with a more simple mechanism than exists at present.  I want the situation addressed because it would mean that many pensioners would be much happier. The amount of money involved averages out at about £70 per person, less in many cases.  What must it cost to administer a scheme like that?  It would be worth looking at that whole situation in relation to our pensioners.  Let us show a bit of respect for them, just as our neighbours in the UK do.</P>
    <P>It is because of these fears that pensioners have, that they keep cash in biscuit this under beds.  They are afraid to put the money into the post office, the building society or the bank because they feel it is being watched, that it is being monitored and that it would be better to keep the couple of hundred pounds in the biscuit tin rather than invest it. Because many of these people live in isolated rural areas they run the attendant risk of burglaries.  Last week we read of somebody getting £30,000 because we have these sharp people going around the country with one person going to the front door to distract the occupier and another going in the back door to rob these poor people.  I know of a situation where a women died when there was a fire in the house because she went back to get the biscuit tin with the cash in it and suffocated.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the business expansion scheme which Deputy Rabbitte castigated.  During the course of his castigation he derided people like Deputy Peter Barry for trying <Col N="1071" /> to have it reinstated for the hotel industry and trying to get the Minister to realise that in what he introduced in the budget in January last, he threw out the baby with the bath water.  As a result of pressure from people within the hotel industry and, indeed, this Chamber afterwards, the Minister changed his mind, a very welcome change of mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jacob mentioned that he recently spoke to Mr. Horan who is prominent in the hotel industry and said that Mr. Horan praised the Minister for his realism in relation to the whole business expansion scheme.  I would like to ask Deputy Jacob if he spoke to him recently, or after the budget, because if he had met him after the budget he would have been calling it the business eradication scheme, not the business expansion scheme.  There is no point in saying that the tourist industry will gain us the maximum number of jobs, that we have to have leisure facilities and that we must pump in money if we are to get the tourists into this country.  There is no point in saying that if we are not serious in our attempts to help out the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I applaud what the business expansion scheme has achieved in certain sectors, particularly in the hotel industry.  I do not condone the abuses of this scheme which have taken place in the past, for example, the much heralded investment of over £20 million in the aviation firm at Shannon which created only seven jobs. Whether or not we realise it, professional experts will continue to find loopholes in whatever schemes are introduced and, obviously, these loopholes will have to be plugged.</P>
    <P>I very much resented some of the comments made by Deputy Rabbitte.  He almost castigated Senator Shane Ross on his decision to join Fine Gael.  He said that he had different views about the business expansion scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the only point I wanted to make.  I can assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, that I would not be as uncharitable as Deputy Rabbitte in my comments about Members of this House; there is still a shred of diplomacy in our party.</P>
      <P>When one analyses the budget and the Minister's speech one wonders if the Government ever heard of the word &ldquo;farmers&rdquo;. The Government are well aware of the current crisis in farming and what is happening in regard to the GATT negotiations and the Common Agricultural Policy.  If farmers are looking to the Government for their salvation in the future they will be bitterly disappointed. Farmers feel betrayed not only by the EC but also by the EC Agricultural Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Many farmers have told me they believe Fianna Fáil would be far more critical of Commissioner MacSharry if he came from some other stable and I am sure they would be far more critical of him and would be telling him to do something positive for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Finance Bill is to implement the proposals in the budget. However, as the Minister has now discovered, the economic forecasts on which the budget were based were over-optimistic; independent commentators at the time said that the forecasts were over optimistic.  The unemployment forecast was based on an average level of unemployment of 228,000 in 1991 and the social welfare projections were based on that figure.  However, we all know the <Col N="1073" /> reality which prevails at present. Obviously that optimistic evaluation will lead to an overloading of the social welfare system and increased expenditure by the Government.  The level of unemployment has been higher in the first quarter of the year than had been expected and does not support the Minister's projections.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Government would monitor the evolving situation very closely and would not hesitate to do what they thought necessary.  The indicators already show that economic growth will slow down this year.  Earlier one of my colleagues was accused of making a contribution of doom and gloom.  I was present in the House yesterday when he made his speech and I did not hear any doom and gloom in it; he referred to reality, which is what we also expect to hear from Members on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>Obviously there has been a downturn in the construction industry in the housing area.  There has also been a decline in the tourism industry.  It has already been projected that there will be a reduction of 20 per cent in the number of tourists visiting Ireland this year.  In addition, the contribution made to the economy by the agricultural sector this year will be minimal.  Was the Minister really telling us that another budget would be introduced this year when he said that the Government would not hesitate to do what they thought necessary?  I am beginning to think that is what he meant.</P>
    <P>I began my contribution by referring to unemployment and taxation and I will conclude on these points as I do not believe the Minister has dealt properly with them.  He has certainly failed to respond adequately to the serious problems which will confront us in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Finance Bill which will underpin the consistent growth achieved in our economy since 1987.  This Bill addresses the fundamentals of our economy &mdash; the absolute necessity to curtail public expenditure, <Col N="1074" /> to reduce borrowing levels, particularly our debt ratio, and where possible, to achieve sectoral growth in the economy so that we can cope with the ongoing problem of unemployment.  The Government have been successful in reducing our rates of inflation, public borrowing, foreign borrowing, public expenditure and interest rates.  Our economy is now much more competitive than it was three or four years ago and I hope this competitiveness will continue to improve.</P>
      <P>One of the most important aspects of the Minister's speech was his resolve and determination to maintain budgetary discipline.  He stressed this point throughout his contribution.  The maintenance of our budgetary discipline will be of fundamental importance to our performance during the next 12 months.  It is extremely important that we give a clear signal to our international competitors and the financial world that there will be no slippage by the Government in achieving our budget targets or over-expenditure in achieving our spending targets.  The Minister has made it clear that, if needed he will take action to prevent such slippage or over-expenditure.</P>
      <P>As the Minister was quick to point out, we are only in the first quarter of the year and this time last year the main Opposition spokesman on Finance made similar claims about our inability to achieve the targets which had been set.  As we know, he was ultimately proved wrong.  We expect to see an improvement in the figures during the second quarter of the year and the situation will be reviewed mid-year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill has been framed in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which follows on from the very successful <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Much of what is contained in the Finance Bill flows from the contents of that programme.  It is very significant to note that in this day and age the Government have achieved broad agreement with the social partners, both in industry and the trade union movement, on a wide range of issues covering health, social welfare, employment creation, taxation, etc.  This consensus which <Col N="1075" /> is to be lauded will underpin the Government's confidence in the future of this country over the next three years. The programme allows for a combination of moderate pay increases, low inflation and income tax concessions which, cumulatively, amounted to almost £800 million over the past two or three years.  Real take home pay increased over the past two to three years and is set to increase further in the future.  If inflation can be kept down and income tax and VAT reduced, this will contribute to increased levels of take home pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister has increased the basic rates of social welfare payments over the level of inflation and has brought in some innovative schemes.  Since 1987 the consistent aim of the Government has been to protect and improve the lot of large families on low incomes and social welfare through the introduction of certain taxation measures.  In a difficult budgetary context that has been the aim of the Government.  To a large extent they have succeeded.  The much quoted poverty trap, and the argument that there is not an incentive to work, bears out the fact that the Government have improved the position of people on social welfare to such an extent that they are nearly at the level of people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Workers on low incomes have access to the FIS which was significantly improved by the Minister in the Finance Bill.  The FIS increases the take home pay of workers on low incomes and particularly benefits those with larger families. I am not sure about the argument about the incentive to work.  It has not been quantified by speakers.  It seems to be a throw-away phrase or a useful catch phrase for after dinner speeches.  The vast majority of unemployed people want to work.  They are not unduly worried about taxation or the levels of social welfare payments.  They want work; irrespective of what people may say about the poverty trap or the lack of incentive to work, the majority of unemployed people want to work.</P>
    <P>All the measures in the Bill which will reduce unemployment are welcome.  I <Col N="1076" /> particularly welcome the initiative in relation to unemployment blackspots.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would ensure a greater degree of consultation with local authorities and local interested bodies in preparing a package to tackle unemployment in a blackspot area.  This problem demands an integrated approach from development agencies and Government Departments.</P>
    <P>In the context of preparing the city development plan for Cork city economic blackspots were pinpointed.  Certain short term remedial measures can be taken in relation to, for example, training young people in FÁS workshops, in creating community work projects or social employment schemes, but the long-term answer is to increase the level of educational achievement among young people in these areas.  The number of children who leave schools in these areas at 13 or 14 years of age is too high.  When they leave school they are desperately short of skills and find it extremely difficult to secure a place of employment.  Any initiative which seeks to address unemployment blackspots must address education and devote extra resources to keep people in the educational system for as long as possible and equip them with skills which will enable them to enter employment on a permanent basis.  The Government introduced initiatives in relation to the Youthreach programme and so on, to deal with that problem and we have had some success but the problem demands greater resources.  The Minister has made a move in this Bill and I would urge him to expand on it and consult where possible with the local agencies and local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that 1991 would be more difficult than previous years because of the international situation, the recession in the UK, the recession in the US and the Gulf War. While we are all glad that the Gulf War has ended there is not any question but that it had a negative impact on economic activity, both in construction and tourism. I hope we can recover by the end of the year in that respect.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties, the Minister <Col N="1077" /> made genuine efforts to reduce the basic rates of income tax.  When one considers that 29 per cent applies to the lower band, a significant decrease has taken place over the last three years.  Likewise, VAT was reduced by 4 per cent over the last three years.  This has had a beneficial impact on inflation and take home pay. Larger families on low incomes have also benefited from the tax provisions in the Bill.  The exemption limits have been substantially increased, by varying degrees up to as much as 60 per cent, for example, for a couple with five children.  These improvements along with the improvements in the FIS have assisted large families. The standard rate band exemption has also increased by 40 per cent in certain areas.  The higher tax rate has been reduced over the years from 58 per cent to 52 per cent and a significantly lower percentage of taxpayers pay the higher tax rates than two or three years ago. That, combined with the VAT reductions, means that we have made significant improvements in tax reform over the last three years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when one considers that we have introduced a new taxation system for the self-employed and the farming community and that we raised £500 million over two years ago, on the tax amnesty, it is fair to say that we have made inroads on the broad taxation front. We have increased the yield from corporation tax and capital gains tax.  In that context it is difficult to explain the opposition from some Members of the House to local service charges, for example. When service charges were originally introduced it was argued that they represented double taxation in that people were already paying through PAYE.  To what level does one reduce income tax or VAT and to what level does one increase the yield from corporation tax or capital gains tax to render local service charges acceptable?  The people who opposed that tax have yet to come up with an answer.</P>
    <P>This is one area of local taxation which has been fudged right across the political spectrum.  The Government have basically said that the other options are not <Col N="1078" /> palatable and that therefore they will continue with the service charges but most politicians on the other side of the House will talk about the need for local taxation but will not specify what they mean and how we are to go about funding it.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that our taxation system represents the major disincentive to employment that it is made out to be. Neither am I sure about Deputy Noonan's argument yesterday that we should have a significant reduction in tax rates for those entering employment.  I sympathise with the point in relation to having a low commencement rate for people entering employment, but the Deputy failed to specify how we should fund this.  When one contrasts that idea with the contributions of other Members of his party who suggested that we should increase mortgage interest relief or life assurance relief, one begins to find a certain degree of incompatibility in their positions.  We cannot reduce rates, continue to increase allowances and at the same time insist that we must keep public expenditure down and reduce borrowing.  The equation does not work out.  We had a number of generalities yesterday in the House but few specifics as to how the taxation system should be changed.  It is about time people stopped talking in generalities and got down to specifics in that area.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme received a lot of attention during this debate.  By and large the business expansion scheme represented a success.  I can say unequivocally that when the scheme was extended jobs were created in the tourism sector.  Indeed, there is hardly a hotel in the city of Cork which did not at some stage successfully utilise the scheme and as a result create extra jobs in hotels and the tourism industry in general.  I welcomed in particular the Minister's move after the budget to allow those concerns who had entered into contracts prior to the budget to go ahead with those contracts; and I can honestly say that at least one hotel in Cork was saved from going out of business.  Unfortunately, the scheme was abused.  It is a sad indictment <Col N="1079" /> that schemes introduced to create employment and encourage people to invest are so blatantly abused as this one has been and as others will be in the future.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the business expansion scheme is not dead as far as tourism is concerned.  Contrary to what Deputy Finucane said, it has not been eradicated; it is still in place to help smaller companies who can raise up to £500,000 to undertake ventures which carry a degree of risk.  I was impressed by the figures given by the Minister for the number of jobs created under business expansion scheme related projects during the past few years.  The Minister referred to an interdepartmental review and suggested that an additional 4,250 jobs had been created in 347 companies.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that while hotels are excluded, a number of other enterprises in the tourism area, such as marina services, cruiser hire, equestrian centre services and tour coach services, can still benefit under the scheme.  Tourism is not just about hotels.  One of the conclusions of the ESRI study on tourism, and indeed other studies, was that our product was not what it should be and we were not meeting the needs of tourists.  People can still invest in a broad range of areas in the tourism industry by utilising the business expansion scheme and I suggest that the Minister should highlight this fact for would be investors. As he mentioned in his contribution, there is a lack of investment in certain areas and the quality of the product on offer needs to be improved.</P>
    <P>I was particularly struck by the strategy outlined in the Bill for the Temple Bar area and other designated areas throughout the city.  I welcome the proposal that the Temple Bar area, which I visited, was picked out for specific treatment.  The strategy is an interesting one and the Minister should consider adopting a similar strategy in other cities which could be considered as a flag ship project for tourism and the arts.  Recently the residents of the marsh area of Cork city produced a very interesting plan, along the lines of the Temple Bar project, to <Col N="1080" /> create a tourist trail along the old medieval city wall, incorporating examples of period housing going back century by century and a number of interpretative centres.  Depending on the success of the Temple Bar project, this is a strategy which could be implemented in other cities, Cork in particular.  I suggest that the Minister take this idea on board.  A model could be drawn up for the south parish through to the middle parish and Shandon.</P>
    <P>Another welcome provision encourages private owners to loan works of art to galleries for display to the public.  The provision states that where a work of art worth over £25,000 has been on loan to an approved art gallery for over six years for display to the public it will be exempt from capital gains tax on its subsequent disposal.  That is a very enlightened provision and will be welcomed by the art world.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly indicated that the Government are still on the right road; that they will try to keep inflation down, to have moderate wage increases, to control expenditure, to reduce borrowing, to create jobs in the areas of tourism, aquaculture, fish farming, the electronics industry and so on, to reduce the lowest income tax band to 25 per cent by the end of 1993, and ensure that we have a fitter, leaner and more efficient economy during the next decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>During my contribution I would like to address the question of unemployment, which is the most serious economic and social problem facing us, and the transport sector in my capacity as Opposition spokesman on that area.  People do not seem to realise the extent to which the unemployment position has deteriorated in recent times.  At present 250,000 are unemployed and up to 30,000 people emigrate each year.  In addition, between 24,000 and 25,000 young people leave school annually.  As a consequence, there is a great need to create jobs.  I get the impression from statements made by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach <Col N="1081" /> that they do not think they can do anything about unemployment and that essentially they have thrown in the towel. They have said that the right economic climate and confidence need to be created if we are to create jobs but there is no direct role the State can play.  This is wrong and this issue must be addressed.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses I remember the lobbying of the then Minister for Finance to introduce the business expansion scheme to which Deputy Noonan referred.  Over 6,000 jobs have been created since that scheme was set up.  We need to look at our tax code and investment policy to see how they can be reorganised to give preference to job creation.  I would like to put forward a number of suggestions in this debate because unless we are serious about restructuring our tax code to create jobs we will not improve the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter which needs to be dealt with is the cost of employing a person. Not so long ago I spoke to the boss of CIE, our biggest transport operator, with three holding companies.  That group have reduced the number of their employees from 22,000 to 11,000 and intend to reduce it further.  If we talk to the personnel managers of large companies we will find that they are equally intent on shedding labour wherever possible. The point I am trying to make is that we have made it very costly to employ people.  To put £1 net pay in the pocket of a married man with one or two children costs something like £2.20 in average employment terms.  To put £1 overtime in someone's pocket costs £3.10.  We have organised our tax affairs by penalising labour intensive industries and people who employ others.  There is no need for that.  We can tax other things; we can tax profits, turnover and so on, but why do we tax jobs in this way?  The Coalition Government's fixation to have two rates of tax, 40p and 25p, misses the whole point of our tax code.  We need to address all the focus of tax relief towards the lower end of the scale so that more <Col N="1082" /> people will have less gross-net pay differential and the disincentive to employing people will be removed.</P>
    <P>I will try strongly to make an issue in the next election of the fact that heads of households with larger families find it less attractive to work because the social welfare system pays you for having more children and the tax system gives no recognition for having children.  In other words, I favour strongly the reintroduction of a children's tax free allowance which more than anything else would swing the scales for those it pays to work or not to work.  It simply does not pay people to work if they have four children or more and if they are getting anything less than the average industrial wage because their entitlements for house rent and medical card are based on gross rather than net pay, not even taking into account travelling expenses and so on. Unless we reintroduce a children's tax free allowance and re-orientate our tax system to favour the majority of workers by reducing the lower band exclusively and changing the bands and allowances in that regard we will not remove those poverty traps and will not reduce the cost of employment.</P>
    <P>Employer's PRSI at 12.8 per cent is a tax on jobs.  The more people you employ the more tax you pay.  It directly penalises labour intensive industries, and extensive data show that our industrial policy has succeeded in attracting capital intensive industries to Ireland and not labour intensive industries when what we require is exactly the opposite.  In other words, we give very substantial allowances and reliefs for capital expenditure.  We give substantial IDA grant aid for capital expenditure, and we give virtually nothing only stiff taxation in the form of employer's PRSI to people who create jobs.  It is no surprise, therefore, that we have the lowest industrial base in Europe in terms of employment and the second highest rate of unemployment, at over 21 per cent.  Therefore, I favour the abolition of employer's PRSI strictly on the basis that that money will be made up by an increase in corporation tax or a new tax based on company turnover, and I <Col N="1083" /> urge that we move away from penalising people on the basis of employing them. Until we do that and perhaps introduce exemption at a high level, maybe up to £85 a week, where they would be free of all PRSI and get the full class A1 credit, we will make no serious inroads into the situation.</P>
    <P>One thing that has been proven successful is the social employment scheme, the only scheme that will deal with the permanent level of unemployment we have.  I do not know whether the figure is 90,000 or 100,000, but it is estimated there is a permanent level of unemployment. What is the best social response in those circumstances?  We in Government introduced the SES and it has been successful but it has been limited in a number of respects.  After a year people have to leave it.  People can get on it only if they are on unemployment assistance.  We should extend the scheme to cover a number of voluntary activities.  I know many voluntary organisations who could not afford the sponsorship of the SES.  I would even favour introducing grants to such bodies to help ensure they can engage people.  In the area of personal services, people may employ, for instance, a gardener or baby sitter.  There is a huge black economy there.  If the SES is extended to include that it would make a meaningful contribution.</P>
    <P>In summary, I am suggesting under this Finance Bill in relation to employment that our tax reform be based on reintroducing a children's tax allowance to restore the incentive to work for those who have more than three children, that we gear income tax relief not across the board but to the lower paid to ensure there is not a tax on employment in that way, that employer's PRSI be abolished and replaced by a proportionate increase in corporation tax or a new tax, and that we extend the SES.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses proposed the introduction of a jobs tax credit, an American idea, under which an employer taking on an employee who was on the dole for a year or more can get a credit of, say, <Col N="1084" /> $1,000 in the first year, or $500 in the second year if he retains the person for the full period, to set against any tax bill the company might have, corporation tax, personal income tax for a sole trader, or whatever it might be.  It has worked and I believe is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>There are significant problems in the transport sector in relation to taxation. Our transport costs are double the average in the EC.  If you want to bring a container of goods from here to any other part of Europe the average cost is 9 per cent of product price.  In Europe the average is 4.5 per cent.  That is obviously because of our peripherality and we will have to deal with it.  If we are to be competitive in the Single Market let us consider the basics.  We have higher insurance costs, certain higher wages costs, we have to cross a couple of seas and so on, but if we look at taxation the implications are very clear.  If you buy an articulated vehicle for the transport sector you will pay 6.5 per cent excise duty which is not reclaimable at all in the Republic.  There is no excise duty on vehicles of that kind in Northern Ireland. VAT is reclaimable but VAT in the South is 21 per cent and in the North 15 per cent.  The rate of excise duty on fuel oil in relation to the price per hectolitre here is one of the highest in Europe, second only to Italy.  Similarly, VAT on fuel is 21 per cent here and 15 per cent in the North.  These are the cost disadvantages the Irish transport sector have to carry.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder then that we see an increasing proportion of freight out of this country going through Larne?  Northern Ireland hauliers can come down here, offer cheaper quotations, come across the Border and sabotage our business. With the development of cabotage whereby there will be total free haulage movements within Europe, we will suffer even further.  The legitimate haulier here will see his business eroded by illegal hauliers on the one side and traders from the UK and Northern Ireland on the other.  This type of penetration is very damaging to the transport sector and provides no great basis on which it can grow.</P>
    <P>The only prospect of resolving this <Col N="1085" /> problem is harmonisation of taxation. The only analogy I can use is that this Government's attitude to tax harmonisation is something akin to a child's attitude to the dentist in so far as they are doing everything humanly possible to resist it. They are seeking exemptions and derogations in every direction and are even going so far as to look for compensation if the EC insist.  The only way to have a competitive transport sector is by tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>Earlier speakers mentioned the privatisation of Irish Life.  We must have a very clear policy in relation to privatisation in the transport sector.  No such policy exists.  We had the attempted sale of the B &amp; I line for £6.3 million.  The strategic interests of transport are so strong that the State must retain an interest in the transport sector.  Be it Aer Lingus or B &amp; I, a stake must be retained by the Exchequer.  Whether that should be a minority stake, a majority stake or a golden share will vary from case to case. It is wrong, short-sighted and too simplistic for the Minister for Transport simply to wash his hands of the B &amp; I Line after the investment of £100 million.  A golden share must be retained because of the vital strategic links.  Eighty per cent of all our exports are shipped.  Therefore the shipping services on the Irish Sea are vital to the economy.  If we completely wash our hands of involvement, what will happen in ten years if Irish Ferries say they cannot make money on the venture and sell it to Sealink or some other foreign owner?  Leaving aside the short term interests of the employees, that is not in the long term interests of the economy.</P>
    <P>We have no policy in relation to Aer Lingus, which will lose £40 million on air transport this year.  When the market is liberalised in 1993 there will be complete deregulation.  We have seen spectacular collapses of some of the largest airlines in America and we need to be very careful that Aer Lingus is not left behind. Other airlines such as British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Swissair and SAS have taken cross-investments in different airlines.  They have set up a European <Col N="1086" /> quality alliance and have taken shareholdings in each other because they see an interdependence and globalisation of shareholdings.  Aer Lingus is still on its own, the bachelor of Europe which will be left on the shelf, adding to our problems of peripherality.  We must have a clear aviation policy.  A minority of the shares in Aer Lingus should be sold to different airlines to give us marketing and cost tie-ups, links to the Far East and Australia and strong transatlantic links. Unless this is done and there is clear thinking about that element of privatisation we will be left behind.</P>
    <P>If anybody has a good case for spending money it is the motorist.  Having gone to considerable lengths to get the figures from the Department of Finance, I discovered that the driver of a truck, an articulated vehicle, a van or an ordinary car spends £1,260 million on VAT, excise on vehicles, fuel, tax, road tax and fines. That is a great deal of money.  It is not unreasonable that the motorist should ask for a little bit of that money to provide reasonable roads.  It is agreed by the Department of the Environment and by the EC Commission that at 1987 prices it will cost us £3.3 billion to bring our roads up to European standards.  I am not talking about the roads around Ballybay or the backstreets of Ferns and Camolin or Lyrecrompane.  I am talking about the inter-city radial routes.  To bring our roads up to standard by the year 2010 would require the investment of £200 million or £250 million per annum.  The level to which the Government are committed is much less.  They have not even set up the national roads authority, only an interim body which has acted as another layer of bureaucracy.  There is no clear thinking by the Government with a view to resolving this problem.  It must be borne in mind that the motorist is paying £1,280 million in taxation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the national routes, there is the question of the potholes competition being held through the media to find the largest and the worst.  It is a joke.  The problem of non-national roads will only be resolved by more resources.  Deputy Boylan's constituency of Cavan is <Col N="1087" /> regarded as the capital of potholes.  It is unacceptable that the people of that area and other places, such as Clare, should have to put up with roads in this condition. My constituency of Wexford is not the worst but is certainly not the best We will shortly be putting forward radical proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>Total motor tax receipts by local authorities are estimated to amount this year to £161 million.  The level of grant paid by the Government is £68.13 million for non-national roads.  The idea is that the national roads authority will deal with all national primary and secondary routes, that is 6 per cent of all roads carrying 37 per cent of all traffic.  The remaining 94 per cent of roads must have a new financing scheme.  Motor tax revenue should be retained by the local authorities.  This would make available an additional £41 million.  Some may say that all the money will go to Dublin.  It would be possible to devise a scheme whereby no local authority would get an increase in their road fund of more than 30 per cent and a transfer of resources would then take place to counties like Clare and Cavan to ensure that this problem is dealt with.  We need also a road audit to ensure that local authorities are performing, that the work is being done and that no money is wasted.  We must have uniform costings per kilometer for the restrengthening and resurfacing of our roads.  Until we have a real plan to get to grips with our pothole problem there will be no resolution of it.  This will be a major issue in the local elections and our party will have a sound and well thought-out solution.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that in the operational programmes to deal with peripherality within the EC the funding received by the railways is derisory.  It is virtually nonexistent, apart from some diesel cars to Dundalk.  At a time when the British Government and the Northern Ireland authorities are prepared to expend very substantial resources in upgrading the Dublin-Belfast link, this Government have dragged their feet and have not put any money into it.  They are looking for <Col N="1088" /> more studies, more reports and more reviews.  It is not right that the transport company, Irish Rail, should have to bear the total cost of the permanent way, the railway track.  No motorist has to pay for the cost of the roads in that form.  The cost of maintaining and upgrading the permanent way, which I understand ranges from £41 million to £45 million a year, should be included in the Public Capital Programme.  The Public Capital Programme for both roads and railways should be included under the auspices of the Department of Transport.  This has been done in Denmark where they have been very successful.  They have an integrated transport policy involving air and sea, roads and ports and railways.</P>
    <P>The lack of investment in upgrading our railway line means that the Government have to make a decision either to abolish or retain the railway.  If they want to abolish it, let them say so.  If not, then why allow the situation on the line from Sligo or Ballina to Dublin, where the train has to travel so slowly for safety reasons because the rolling stock is run down and the permanent way is run down that fewer and fewer people will use the slow and unreliable service.  That is unacceptable. The Government have no clearly thought-out policy.  They have not even approached the EC for aid towards the cost of maintaining the permanent way.</P>
    <P>Even those of us who are not Dubliners know that it is taking longer and longer to get to the city centre.  It now takes 40 minutes for people to get to work when it used to take 20 minutes.  The problem of congestion will get worse and because 40 per cent of the population live in the greater Dublin region.  Frankly, this problem requires a solution.</P>
    <P>Having looked at various options, such as guided bus ways, which are dedicated routes on which only buses can run, light rail and the possibilities offered by road development, it is my considered view that we must embrace the option of light rail in a planned coherent way, encompassing two or three phases over the next five to ten years, for example, starting <Col N="1089" /> with the Harcourt Street line, then developing a route to the airport, a route to Cabra and another to the south-west. Unless we have a concerted policy of investment in light rail, for which we seek EC funding, we run the risk of seeing Dublin's traffic congestion problem get completely out of hand.  That simply is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The advantage that light rail has over any other mode of transport is its exclusivity, in other words, it will not be caught up in traffic jams.  This is where Dublin Bus has failed; even though there are bus lanes, there have been problems with illegal parking.  The fact is although buses are very efficient and carry up to 80 passengers at a time, they get caught up in the same congestion as the motorist. Therefore, that is not a solution.  I understand that for an investment of something in the order of £350 million we could provide a very high quality light rail system.  In over 300 major urban centres, some of which are of a similar size and have similar problems to Dublin&mdash;such as Manchester&mdash;they are now opting for a light rail system.</P>
    <P>There will be EC support for the development of light rail routes and there is a 75 per cent grant for national primary route development.  If we put together a concerted expenditure programme of £350 million, we could actually achieve results similar to those achieved on the DART corridor, in other words, more than half the people who go to work from Howth to Bray go by public transport; less than half go by car.  On any other route where Dublin Bus operate, less than one third of the commuter traffic to and from work use public transport.  Here we have an opportunity to solve the problem but we cannot have a half hearted commitment.  You cannot reopen the Harcourt Street line only; you must have a concerted approach to the development of light rail transport.  From the point of view of the environment, transport, bringing greater life to the inner city and sound investment, this is the way to go.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the two growth areas of transport where there is <Col N="1090" /> enormous potential.  I referred to cabotage earlier, but I believe we must look at international haulage as an export traded sector and give it the preferential corporation tax treatment that applies to other internationally traded sectors.  The second area of growth is in shipping.  It is undoubtedly the case that Fianna Fáil made a special case of the shipping sector in 1987.  They promised grant-in-aid, that the business expansion scheme would apply and that they would restore the whole fleet&mdash;this was after the difficulties of the Irish Shipping Company which had been put into liquidation.  What do we see in 1991?  The grant scheme has been gutted and virtually no container can now get grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The situation is quite unacceptable because people's hopes were raised.  For no reason the business expansion scheme has obliterated the shipping sector.  There was no evidence of abuse or of the asset based schemes in this sector as there were for hotels and golf clubs, but for some mysterious reason the business expansion scheme no longer applies to shipping.  I think this is very unfair.  The modest Irish shipping sector for container traffic, less so for deep sea traffic, are disappointed at the way they have been treated. This is shameful and runs totally in the face of what was promised by Fianna Fáil earlier.  I do not wish to detain the House, but these are some of the transport issues that need to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The most important issue at the end of the day is employment.  If we are serious about dealing with the problem of unemployment we will have to move away from the climatology approach where if interest rates and inflation are OK, jobs will be created.  The fact is that inflation has been very low by European standards over the past three years but we have not seen the jobs.  Real interest rates are too high.  The rate of return on an investment when you pay interest rates of 15 per cent is simply unacceptable, and even an interest rate of 13.5 per cent is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The differential between deposit interest returns and the lending rate is out of line and is too high.  That will <Col N="1091" /> retard growth.  We can only convert economic growth into jobs by abolishing employers' PRSI and increasing corporation tax proportionately, reducing the lower rates of income tax and reintroducing the children's tax free allowance so that it pays people with families to go to work; to reintroduce a jobs tax credit, as they have in America, to give a direct incentive to create extra employment, and to extend the social employment scheme way beyond its present frontiers so that it will cover new services and many voluntary organisations.  I believe that up to 70,000 jobs could be created by the voluntary sector who are doing unpaid work ideally suited to people working one week in every fortnight.</P>
    <P>This budget is disappointing but I will return to some of the issues that I have raised in the future.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann&mdash;appalled by</P>
      <P>the disastrous losses to industry, agriculture and services,</P>
      <P>the disemployment of large numbers of workers,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> the hardship caused to families and individuals, particularly to the most vulnerable,</P>
    <P>the risk to life resulting from the widespread cutting of electricity supplies,</P>
    <P>calls on the workers involved, in the interest of the economic and social welfare of their fellow citizens, to suspend their strike action and return to normal working while they and management use all the available industrial relations machinery to resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>In the past two years the economy of this country grew by almost 10 per cent. Inflation is down to a few percentage points.  The living standards of social welfare recipients has been protected.  The climate for enterprise and investment improved radically.</P>
    <P>We have, in fact, developed a consensus which has resulted in a new approach to economic and social development. It is only months since we signed a new three year deal which will ensure the continuation of that new approach for the next three years.</P>
    <P>This new approach and climate have resulted in the best record for days lost through industrial disputes.  The first quarter of this year showed a continuation of this favourable trend &mdash; 10,000 days were lost in 14 disputes.  I hope we will never again see years when over a million days were lost as happened in the past.  We are approaching a situation where we could be on a par with the levels of industrial conflict in the best European economies and it is important that we strive for that goal in terms of investment and employment.  If we do not create the right climate for investment then we will not create the employment this country so badly needs.</P>
    <P>The Government have made every effort to ensure that adequate machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes exists.  We have recently put on the Statute Book the most fundamental review of trade union, trade dispute and <Col N="1093" /> industrial relations law since the foundation of the State.  We have set up the Labour Relations Commission to promote good industrial relations and to revamp the conciliation process.  The Labour Court also exists should the parties wish to avail of its services.  In the case of the current dispute, the ESB have their internal machinery which has proved to work very satisfactorily over the years and has made a great contribution to industrial peace in the ESB.</P>
    <P>Industrial disputes, especially in large public service utilities, give us an image as a country which is not helpful to investment or the creation of employment.  We must, as a country, do everything to avoid such disputes.  <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for a period of industrial peace and, as I have said, there is no absence of industrial relations institutions to help solve problems when they arise.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware of the widespread disruption being caused all around the country.  All sections of the community &mdash;industry, agriculture, health services and domestic consumers &mdash; have been seriously inconvenienced.  The ESB have about 1,250 megawatts now available compared to a normal peak load of 2,100 megawatts and are making every effort to share the available power equitably across the country.  However, their efforts in this regard are hampered by the fact that the switching operation would normally be carried out by ETU members.  The ESB of course, will endeavour to give priority to essential users of electricity.</P>
    <P>One fact about the current dispute is that the damage being done to the economy and the hardship being inflicted on individuals is totally out of proportion to the issues involved in the dispute.  This is all the more so in a case where it should be possible to call off the action to allow procedures to operate to find a settlement.</P>
    <P>The Government have considered the situation.  I should emphasise the main points of the Government statement issued yesterday: <Col N="1094" /> 1.  The Government are extremely concerned that a dispute in this essential industry should have occurred so soon after agreement on a new three year national programme had been reached between all the social partners and the Government and after this programme and the pay agreement associated with it had been over-whelmingly endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; 2.  The interests of the country and its people cannot be allowed take second place to the interests of any one group of workers when there are procedures to enable their grievances to be considered; 3. The Government are determined that the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> shall be adhered to.  The electrician's claim can be assessed by procedures in that context. The Government therefore, in the public interest, call for a return to normal work immediately while the appropriate procedures to look at any possible grievances are put in train.</P>
    <P>I would now like to briefly summarise the background to the dispute.  About 18 months ago the Electrical Trade Union initiated a claim for a salary increase for electricians mainly on the grounds of impact of a reorganisation plan of 1986. Negotiation sessions took place with the union but, as no agreement could be reached, the claim was referred to the ESB's Joint Industrial Council in September 1990.  The council issued their recommendation on 14 November 1990, which effectively requested both parties to meet again to find a solution.  The sides met subsequently on at least two occasions.  The matter was then referred back to the Joint Industrial Council who ruled that one in-scale increment would apply to all electricians; and that electricians on their natural maximum &mdash; that is, those who may not advance further without promotion or progression through qualifications or promotion &mdash; be paid a once-off lump sum of £650.</P>
    <P>The ESB accepted the decision of the Joint Industrial Council, but the ETU rejected the council's ruling.  Following <Col N="1095" /> expiry of the 30-day cooling-off period which applied after the issue of a council recommendation &mdash; in accordance with agreed procedures &mdash; the union informed the ESB by letter dated 5 April 1991 that its executive, having carefully considered the matter at issue, decided to sanction entering into an official dispute with the ESB.  This letter formally put the ESB on 14-days' notice to that effect.</P>
    <P>Further meetings took place all day Friday last but negotiations broke down. The strike took effect from Monday morning and the Labour Relations Commission immediately invited the parties for explanatory discussions. Those discussions have continued throughout the night and are in progress as I speak.  I am keeping in close touch with both sides in the dispute.  I sincerely hope that a formula can be arrived at soon which will allow a return to work to enable further consideration to be given by both sides to the issues involved in a less-charged and more rational atmosphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Flaherty, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I suggested that there should be an all-party motion calling on the workers on strike in the ESB to return to work immediately.  I made this suggestion because I know that a point may be reached in the negotiations at which there are the beginnings of a desire to return to work but there is a need for a pretext to explain why such a decision is being taken.  The initiative taken this morning, whereby all party leaders, or their representatives, are now calling on the workers concerned to return to work indicates a common political will and will provide justification and, in a sense, cover &mdash; if that is necessary &mdash; for those responsible for taking the decision to recommend to their members within the ESB to return to work.  It is fair to say that the workers concerned have made their point.  They have brought their grievance in this matter to public notice. The public realise the important role they <Col N="1096" /> play in the economy.  Having made their point, however, there is no need to continue with this extremely damaging dispute.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that this dispute is doing permanent, not temporary, damage to the Irish economy.  Ireland, as an investment location, Ireland as a place in which to create work is rendered less attractive if public services are unreliable here. Therefore, the existence of a strike such as this renders the creation of employment here more difficult.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to say that this dispute is doing permanent damage to the Electricity Supply Board; the reliability of the board itself, in the eyes of their customers, is damaged by this dispute.  Any potential future customers of the ESB, as a result of this dispute, will look more closely than they might otherwise have done at alternative energy sources.  That does damage to the ESB and to everybody whose living is dependent on the successful operation of the ESB.  Permanent damage is being done by this dispute.  I call on those responsible, in particular those on strike, to return to work.</P>
    <P>However, on this occasion I would also have to say that I am deeply concerned at the negligence of the Government in this matter.  The fact is that the Government and those in authority in the ESB, who are responsible to the Government, those in authority in the labour relations area, who are also responsible to the Government, seem to have been taken unawares by this dispute: it seems to have arisen to their surprise.  That surprise should not exist and the existence of such surprise ultimately stands as a condemnation of Government management of this affair.  However, there will be another occasion on which to debate that matter. The important issue at this moment is that there should be a united voice in this House asking those responsible to return to work so that an atmosphere will be created in which, whatever difficulties exist, can be sorted out amicably without threat to either side.</P>
    <P>Having said that I would like to pass <Col N="1097" /> the remainder of my time to our spokesperson on Energy, Miss Flaherty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>As our Leader has said, we in Fine Gael wish to restate our conviction that there should be an immediate return to work.  The havoc wreaked by this strike is out of all proportion to the grievance involved.  The impact of the cuts to date is virtually impossible to over-state, for example, the serious position pertaining to the sick, the elderly, industry, dairy farmers, animal rearers and indeed the average householder is being recorded hourly on the airwaves. Some areas are in a critical position having had no power for two days.  If this dispute continues I would ask the Minister for Energy to ensure that, within the limited resources available, special help be given to those communities who have experienced a total breakdown in supply.  If the power supply cannot be reconnected, then other emergency assistance should be given to them by the Army and Civil Defence.  I gather that the supply situation is critical.  If any one of the three major stations operating, at Aghadoe, Tarbert and Moneypoint, were to shut down, even the current limited rota would collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today the ESB group of unions have backed the strike.  This may lead to further cuts when ballots have been completed in the various unions.  Everyone wants to know how and why this could happen and why the Government seem powerless to act.  Clearly there is a very serious industrial relations problem here which did not start only on Monday last. Despite an elaborate industrial relations mechanism, this dispute has ended in a strike.  A number of questions need to be answered.  Why, first, did this industrial relations mechanism fail?  Why is there clearly a lack of knowledge between management and workers as evidenced in the information given by our leader in his contribution?  Why was there no procedural agreement which included recourse to the State's labour relations mechanisms, in the event of a failure of their own internal system, as is common in most <Col N="1098" /> other in-house industrial relations agreements and, indeed, is common to agreements in this House with groups of workers?  What were the Ministers for Labour and Energy doing before Monday last to avert this strike?  Why did the Labour Relations Commission not intervene before Monday during the 14 day strike notice period?  Why have the Government, and the management, not ensured that there is at managerial level, or available to management, sufficient expertise to maintain at least an emergency service?  Yesterday we had the frightening scenario painted for us by the Minister that he could make no commitments whatsoever about power supplies in the coming days.  The public are demanding answers, they want an end to the crisis and changes implemented to ensure it cannot happen again.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by this strike should not be allowed to rest.  I have tabled eight questions to the Minister for Energy on the industrial relations climate and practice in the ESB.  Fine Gael will insist that once this dispute is settled the Labour Relations Commission be asked to report on the industrial relations problems in the ESB and propose appropriate changes. These assurances should lend extra weight to our insistence that the workers return to work while procedures are being followed in the knowledge that the issues raised will not be allowed to rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I am glad to support the motion before the House.  When all parties in the Dáil can agree and find common ground in relation to a dispute of the magnitude of the ESB dispute that in itself should be an encouragement to those locked in the dispute to redouble their efforts to bring about a solution and find common ground.  At the very least I hope both sides to the strike will now be under no illusion about the gravity of the situation, as has been described, and the gravity with which we view the actual and potential damage being inflicted upon industry, workers, families and on the community in general, all of which has been detailed in this House over the last 24 hours.</P>

      <Col N="1099" /> It is not our duty to assign fault or blame or to try to establish a guilty party in this dispute: that would be an exercise in scapegoating and I am not prepared to be party to any effort to make a scapegoat of either the ESB workers or of the management in this context.  Neither is it possible for us in this short debate to provide solutions.  They must come from the parties involved in the dispute.  I have no doubt that given adequate goodwill it will be possible to find a solution that reconciles the interests of both sides and that in turn reconciles those interests with the urgent need of the whole community.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to assign blame for this dispute there are, however, a number of important questions that arise.  In the interests of accuracy and fairness these questions should be addressed and have not been to date.  The dispute has been brewing for a considerable time as outlined by the Minister for Labour, yet it appears that the ESB management were taken totally by surprise on Monday morning.  The degree of support for the dispute within the workforce in the ESB appears to have been far more widespread than management information would have suggested to them over the past fortnight.</P>
    <P>The so-called early warning system, about which we have heard much in recent months available under the new industrial relations mechanisms, appears to have failed completely to pick up any hint of the impending dispute.  Sadly, the new Labour Relations Commission appear to have been somewhat slow and amateurish in their response to this serious crisis.  Certainly many questions about their lack of response over the weekend arise.</P>
    <P>There was a time space of 14 days in which there could have been a response, in which intervention could have taken place and do what the Minister for Labour said this new body would do, intervene before strikes took place.  They failed to intervene over the weekend following the breakdown of the talks on Friday afternoon.  It appears that nobody <Col N="1100" /> was either available or willing to intervene until Monday morning when the crisis was upon us.  It is impossible for us to make a judgement.  In making the call contained in this motion and agreed by all, we should also seek an assurance from the Minister for Labour that he will stand ready to intervene in the event of any further breakdown of negotiations.  I would like that assurance from the Minister before this debate concludes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of the far-reaching implications of this dispute that The Workers' Party are supporting this motion.  If the agreement of all parties in this House is to serve any constructive role in facilitating a resolution of this very serious dispute, it is important that we avoid simplistic knee-jerk reactions or uninformed partisan criticism.  In my experience that kind of partisan criticism can only aggravate a dispute such as this. Notwithstanding that I am satisfied that the union most centrally involved in this dispute fully acknowledge that there must be a sense of proportionality about a dispute that threatens to put fellow workers out of employment, many of whom are on low pay.</P>
      <P>If the management of the ESB were not alert &mdash; and certainly it seems from recent events that they were not &mdash; to the depth of grievance and determination of the workers concerned and to the completely unexpected extent of support they got from fellow workers, they have been truly jolted awake in the past 48 hours. The electricians have made their point and The Worker's Party join with the other parties in the House in urging a suspension of the strike while urgent talks to resolve the dispute continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we speak I understand that a formula is being hammered out under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and hopefully that formula is well on the way to being accepted by both parties.  I hope it is accepted by both parties but if it should require further refinement, I suggest that that process can continue after the suspension of the strike action.  The question must be asked, why <Col N="1101" /> talks on such a formula were only initiated after the strike began?  Why were the ESB management so complacent? They say now that they were surprised at the level of support from other unions in the ESB.  They are paid not to be surprised.  They are paid not to be out of touch with such a critical category of the workforce in the ESB.</P>
    <P>The House may, indeed, have been unaware and the public may have been taken by surprise but there is no excuse for the ESB management to have been taken by surprise to the extent that they were.  The dispute, it is now clear, has been simmering for some years.  As long ago as 4 March the internal agreement was observed when 30 days' notice were served by the union on the ESB management, as required in the cooling off period, and subsequently on 5 April, prior to initiating industrial action, the union concerned served 14 days notice of strike action.</P>
    <P>Why was nothing done during that period of 44 days?  That is what the public want to know.  When were the Government first informed of the pending dispute in the ESB?  That is something we have not been told.  When they were informed why did they do nothing?  If the elaborate industrial relations machinery that exists in the ESB was inadequate we have just put in place a more elaborate conciliation and industrial relations system than the old conciliation system of the Labour Court.  Why was that system not up to the occasion?  During the passage of the legislation in the House which put in place that system I offered the opinion that the Labour Relations Commission may be indeed a good solution, but what was the problem?  It seems that the old Labour Court network would not have allowed this to happen.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that both the ESB management and the Government have been caught napping in the manner in which they were.  It is reasonable to ask whether the fact that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is now in place has induced a sense of complacency in management of major enterprises here and in the Government.  They seem to be <Col N="1102" /> absolutely satisfied that there can be no fractures of industrial peace now merely because they have managed to put the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in place.  That clearly is not the case having regard to what has happened and that kind of complacency is not justified.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is unthinkable, as I said yesterday, that in a dispute so grave as this negotiations were not initiated on Friday night rather than on Monday after the strike started.  The Minister for Labour seemed to be in as scant evidence as the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission.  The Minister, when enacting the new industrial relations Act, made clear in section 38 of that Act that he wished to reserve the right, in grave disputes affecting the public interest, to intervene and facilitate a settlement in the manner specified in subsection (1) of that section.  It seems there is nothing sacrosanct about the internal machinery in the ESB whereby if it did fall down, as it so manifestly did on this occasion, it was open to the Minister to intervene, as provided for in the Act, and to cause, as he has power to do, the Labour Relations Commission or indeed any other person to conduct an inquiry into the dispute.  The Act states that where the Minister is of the opinion that a trade dispute is of special importance, he may request the commission, the court or another person or body to conduct an inquiry into that dispute and furnish him with the findings. It seems that should have been done when faced with the present crisis.</P>
    <P>The workers concerned must observe a sense of proportionality about this dispute.  They have made their point.  We cannot justify thousands of low paid workers being thrown out of employment. Their point is now well established.  There is no reason why strike action should continue.  The dispute can be suspended and discussions continue if the formula being hammered out at this moment does not prove immediately acceptable to both sides.</P>
    <P>It is rare, as Deputy Spring remarked, for all parties in this House to speak with <Col N="1103" /> one voice, but we are doing that this evening in supporting this motion.  I hope the workers will take appropriate notice of this fact and see their way to suspending action to allow restoration of power and the use of all available procedures to settle the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank speakers from all parties in the House for their support for this motion.  We can now say that the people of the country have spoken by the statements made by the various parties, and I thank the Members of them for their contributions.  They will certainly help the discussions which have been going on continuously under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission since 12 o'clock yesterday.  As I said at the outset, the amount of damage and disruption being caused to all sectors of the community, domestic, essential services, agriculture and industry is far beyond what is involved in this dispute. Perhaps even the parties involved believe that.  I hope that when these talks are completed tonight or tomorrow there will be a resolution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The Labour Relations Commission played their role during the last few days to my full satisfaction.  This House has always believed that industrial relations are based on the process of free collective bargaining.  I know Deputy Rabbitte would be extremely quick, as he has been on most occasions in the past, to criticise my intervention if it was one minute earlier than desirable, but today he put forward a different view.  The Labour Relations Commission have worked extremely hard in the last few days.  I assure the House that they, and all the other machinery involved, have been working flat out to try to bring this major dispute to a resolution.  I thank the speakers and the House for their support in trying to resolve the dispute.</P>

    <P>&mdash;(Deputy Rabbitte)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  The Finance Bill is part of the annual budgetary process.  The budget successfully promoted the recovery of the economy while at the same time providing for the needs of the low paid, the under-privileged and the disadvantaged in our community.  The consensus between the social partners and the Government has been central to the success of our economic and social objectives.  The consensus has ensured advances in areas of employment, debt <Col N="1105" /> reduction, social equity and tax reform. The broad economic strategy of the Government was set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> continues that strategy and underpins the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>The Government's economic strategy in the last few years has been based on the reduction of the national debt and the associated debt servicing cost, the firm linking of the Irish exchange rate to the European monetary system, the achievement and maintenance of a low domestic inflation rate to ensure competitiveness among our exporters and a reform of the tax system to encourage growth and the creation of employment.  The provisions of the budget, taken with those of the Finance Bill, represent major changes towards gearing our tax system to the needs of our economy and fulfilling our objectives following the completion of the single European market.</P>
      <P>This Bill not only provides for tax rate reduction but also ensures that our main taxes, such as capital gains, stamp duty and capital acquisitions, are all based on self-assessment.  The tax concessions in this year's budget, combined with the pay increases agreed in the programme and our relatively low rate of inflation of 3 per cent, provide the basis for a further increase in take home pay. Income tax reliefs announced in the budget will benefit nearly 700,000 taxpayers who will see their marginal income tax rates reduced as a result of these changes.</P>
      <P>In a little more than a year we have achieved a great deal, a reduction of 3 per cent in the standard and top rates of tax, a cut of 4 per cent in the standard rate of VAT, a narrowing of the difference between excise duties in this country and the UK, a reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax of 40 per cent from 1 April and significant reductions in the top rate of capital taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the exemption limits by £150 for a single person and £300 for a married couple &mdash; and the age exemptions going up by a similar amount <Col N="1106" />&mdash;will be of benefit to the low paid.  This year's measures will exempt about 18,000 taxpayers from having to pay tax and a further 26,500 taxpayers will be given marginal relief.  The reduction of 1 per cent of both the standard top rates of tax brings them down to 29 per cent and 52 per cent, respectively.  Before the 1989 budget they were 35 per cent and 58 per cent.</P>
    <P>Chapter VIII of the Bill deals with the urban renewal measures, in particular the special package of investment for the Temple Bar area.  Under the new urban renewal programme a generous package of incentives is available to encourage investors to participate in the physical development of our towns and cities.  The incentives consist of tax concessions and rates relief for development in designated areas and in 23 specified urban areas. This scheme has been a major success; national projects costing £600 million will be completed in the near future in addition to the development work of £400 million at the Custom House Dock site and the new incentives package for the development of the Temple Bar area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The renewal scheme involves a partnership between public and private sectors; with a combination of tax concessions and the right climate private enterprise is investing in the development of our towns and cities.  Local authorities are playing their part by initiating modern planning laws.  They have now become development operations in the true sense of the word.  Last week in Wexford we had a visit from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, who formally opened a £10 million urban renewal project in Wexford town.  This project has revitalised the town and given the people there confidence and an incentive to invest in their town.  It has also given them a belief that they are one of the best towns in the country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to give serious consideration to extend this incentive scheme to places like Enniscorthy, New Ross and Gorey.  In Wexford <Col N="1107" /> we have the expertise, developers, finance, know-how and confidence and I have no doubt that if the Minister extended the urban renewal scheme to Enniscorthy, New Ross and Gorey, he would see the same results that we have successfully achieved in Wexford town which is now the flagship of urban renewal.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the extension of the scheme to those towns.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the social partners and the Government is of central importance to economic progress.  Tax reform and social equity are of equal importance in the Government's overall strategy.  Low interest rates are also of paramount importance; I believe that the Central Bank misread the market before Christmas when they, unnecessarily, raised interest rates.  The rates of interest charged for mortgages obviously affect the demand for house building and, indeed, have a crippling effect on low paid workers.  I cannot understand the present position which exist between building societies were there is such a variance between rates charged and hidden costs.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that on a £25,000 mortgage there can be as much as £5,000 of a difference in repayments over a 20 year period.  I call on the Minister to ask the building societies to publish each month a comparative list showing the interest rates charged and any hidden costs involved in taking out a mortgage.</P>
    <P>The Government's economic strategy in the last two years has been based on low public borrowing, improved competitiveness and an adherence to our obligations within the EMS.  Investment in major projects is of particular importance to the development of our economy.  I should like to acknowledge the £2 million granted by Bord Fáilte for the development of major projects in 11 locations.  I am delighted that one of these is in County Wexford, in the Kilrahan area; I have no doubt that this will make a major contribution in providing temporary and permanent employment and will be a <Col N="1108" /> great tourist attraction for the south-east region.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Finance to reduce VAT and to have harmonisation in all areas of tax. The Customs and Excise personnel in Rosslare Harbour are unsure of their position; they have been guaranteed their jobs up to December 1992 but, because of tax harmonisation, they do not know what their position will be after that date. There are a number of options open to the Minister, the allocation of new work to existing staff, redeployment to other public service Departments in the local area, redeployment involving relocation to customs and excise or other public departments elsewhere or early retirement. I hope that, in the not too distant future, the Minister will clarify the position as there is a great deal of anxiety at the moment among the staff and their families.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill introduces a new allowance to help widowed parents which will apply for three years following the year in which a spouse dies.  There will be a grant of £1,500 in the first year, £1,000 in the second year and £500 in the third year.  I very much welcome this, as not alone is there great sadness and anxiety when a spouse dies, there is often a great deal of financial hardship.  I would like to compliment the Minister on recognising this by making this provision in the budget.</P>
    <P>Section 114 provides for a reduction in the level of conversion required from 30 per cent to 20 per cent of tax-exclusive costs of the vehicle for qualification under the disabled drivers scheme.  I welcome this, as many genuinely handicapped people have been excluded from the advantages of this scheme because of this stipulation.  Under the 1989 disabled driver's tax concessions regulations repayment of excise duty on motor vehicles imported for use by severely and permanently disabled passengers is limited to vehicles with an engine capacity of 4,000 cc.  An anomaly exists in this area.  In my own town we have a handicap association which transports seven or eight handicapped persons.  Their bus is under <Col N="1109" /> 4,000cc. and they are entitled to a refund of excise duty.  However, another association that transports 17 or 18 handicapped persons are not entitled to a refund of excise duty because their bus is over 4,000cc.  I would ask the Minister to address this problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for introducing this Bill.  It reflects sound Government policy, encouraging investment, while at the same time ensuring that those who are less fortunate, those who are underprivileged, those who are disadvantaged, are looked after in our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual purpose of the Finance Bill is to give legislative effect to what was announced in the budget.  It also allows the Government some time to receive representations and submissions from the various interest groups throughout the country who now have the professional ability to analyse the budget and its effects on them within hours of its publication.  It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that there are sufficient funds in the national coffers to provide the services which are asked for by way of representations.  In carrying out their responsibilities, particularly in the area of health, social welfare and housing, the Government must ensure that the overall tax take of the State is preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcomed the Government's change of heart following the most extraordinary submissions in relation to the business expansion scheme.  There was a lot of controversy about this scheme and it was subject to many abuses.  Our concern was to be fair to projects, many of them in my own constituency in South Tipperary, in relation to which people had in good faith entered into legally binding contracts for the purchase of property, additional land etc.  In some cases people had entered into legally binding contracts with builders.  It was appropriate that the Government should realise that great injustice was being done to genuine applicants under that scheme.  There has been criticism of the continuation of the scheme but there are exceptions to all <Col N="1110" /> rules, and I certainly would agree with the changes made by the Government in line with legally binding obligations embarked upon by many applicants in the belief that the scheme was in operation.</P>
    <P>Our spokesperson on finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, has expressed his concern at the failure of the Minister to recognise other areas that concern us also.  He mentioned particularly the growing number of people who are unemployed.  Very little in this Finance Bill will address the problem of emigration, the lack of employment opportunities and the lack of incentives to employers to participate in the process of ensuring that as many people as possible would have gainful employment in their own country. Deputy Quinn mentioned that on present statistics the numbers unemployed could reach the most unacceptable figure of 300,000 before too long.  If that happens it will have catastrophic effects on everybody's standard of living because of the dependency factor that will be created, both the standard of living of those who remain at work and of those who are totally dependent on their parents for their basic needs.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill has been obsessed with tax, self-assessment, tax exemption schemes and so on but it has failed to grasp the nettle and do something with the tax base so that more people would pay a fairer share of income tax, profit tax, corporation tax, wealth tax and so that the burden would be spread more evenly and that the burden borne to a large extent by the PAYE workers would be lightened considerably.  It is obvious that there are disagreements between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The Minister for Finance has the responsibility to answer to us.  There seems to be some measure of disagreement within Government as to how to tackle the problem of taxation in order to spread the load.</P>
    <P>There are other ways of approaching this problem.  We suggested that we would welcome all-party involvement in many areas.  There are many people who could make suggestions that would leave the State with more money available to <Col N="1111" /> distribute to the people who need it most, given the strictures that must be on any Minister for Finance.  The Department has been very slow to really grapple with this problem of tax.  If the burden was spread more evenly among people there is no doubt that the State would have a larger income.  In addition, the burden on those who are paying at present would be reduced.  While I welcome the exemption threshold for families on low incomes, this threshold is pitched at a level which is not much better than social welfare limits.  One must reach that threshold before one can benefit for children's allowances under the tax system. Some of the tax changes introduced appear to be almost anti-family.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to tax evasion and self-assessment. Due to the reduction of staff in tax offices since the introduction of self-assessment the opportunities for evasion have increased.  While in the past most of us believed that everyone wanted to pay their fair share and very few people owed money to the State, the tax amnesty brought in spectacular amounts of money.  That proved our point that tax evaders needed some incentive to pay their fair dues to the State.  It is unfortunate that people have that attitude to paying their fair dues to the State, which is expected to provide services such as health services in which I have a direct interest.</P>
    <P>The Government are creating a two tier health system &mdash; one tier for those who can afford to pay for the services they receive and another tier which subjects people to the odium of means-testing, waiting lists or a lack of medical cards.  Even people who have medical cards are forced to wait in never ending queues for basic health and surgical treatment. Since the Health Act, 1970 the Government introduced additional forms of taxation.  They were the first Government to introduce charges for hospital services.  Up until then such charges were accepted as being included in PRSI contributions. Those contributions are not sufficient any more and people who do not have a medical card are expected to <Col N="1112" /> pay an additional fee of £12.50 per day for up to ten days.  This is double taxation on workers.  The Government do not seem to be interested in spreading this burden more evenly.  People who can ill afford it are being forced to join the VHI. It has been proven that VHI cover is not sufficient to pay consultants' fees for the services they render.  Since the Government took up office thousands of people who work in the health area have been made redundant, thousands of beds have been closed and thousands of patients have had to wait months and years for hospital treatment.  The Government seem to be giving priority to the private sector instead of to those who are in need.</P>
    <P>We have always argued that health care should be available to all our people. Even when the Minister decided to provide access to a public bed to everyone irrespective of income he failed to reach agreement with those who will provide the service.  He failed to initiate discussions with these people before he announced his intentions.  I wish him luck in this but I suggest this is not the way to go about introducing the comprehensive changes needed in hospitals where there are waiting lists for beds of all descriptions. The Minister has said that all people are entitled to a public bed but sometimes these are not available.</P>
    <P>Those of us with responsibility in these areas do not like to have to preach doom and gloom all the time but this fact is brought home to us on a daily basis in our constituencies.  Old people in need of acute hospital treatment are being discharged from hospitals early into the community where there is no back-up service.  Sometimes these people are forced into private nursing homes which they can ill afford because of the failure of the State to provide a public service in geriatric sub-acute hospitals or welfare home type of accommodation.  The State is refusing to provide such a service.</P>
    <P>Less than seven months ago we passed legislation in this House to enable the Minister to give subventions to approved patients, presumably medical card holders, in private nursing homes.  The Minister informed programme managers <Col N="1113" /> this year that this legislation now empowered them to make these payments but reminded them that they must provide such payments from their existing allocations. As we have proved in this House, programme managers have £20 million less this year to deliver existing services. How can the Minister expect us to believe that funds are available to give subventions to old people who are taken out of acute beds and have no place to go? The commitment given in the legislation has not been followed up with the necessary allocation. No health board have said they can manage to survive on the allocation given to them in the budget.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problems in agriculture. The Government do not have any policy in regard to the review of the CAP, the extension of disadvantaged areas or the redesignation of existing classified areas.  People in rural Ireland are not being given any incentives to stay in rural Ireland.  Instead small farmers have been plagued with tax forms which they are incapable of completing.  Those farmers have been forced to go to their public representatives for help.  Even when they submit documentation those small farmers are penalised by the Revenue Commissioners because it is out of date.  I am dissatisfied with the Bill and the Labour Party will oppose it on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I was welcoming some of the initiatives introduced by this Government since 1987 in relation to inequality.  The recent enactment of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1990, is an example of the Government's sustained attempts to promote the principle of equality.</P>
      <P>Women account for more than two thirds of all part-time workers here and more than three quarters of part time workers in the 25 to 44 age group are associated with rearing children.  The new protections offered by that Act will be of particular benefit to women, and that is welcome.  Women were blatantly exploited in supermarkets, retail outlets and other services under the previous part-time workers legislation.  Now part-time workers who work for at least eight hours a week and who have completed 13 weeks' service will enjoy the protection that full-time workers enjoy.  I am glad that the Minister for Social Welfare in the Social Welfare Act has introduced the necessary changes to qualify part-time workers for the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House would give the impression that new legislation could not be introduced in relation to equality without this Bill being passed. Over the past 20 years enlightened legislation was introduced to benefit women.  This Government have introduced a number of initiatives which will be of major benefit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year there is a 19 per cent increase in the annual grant for the Council for the Status of Women over the 1990 allocation. The Taoiseach is placing more and more women on boards.  Up to now members of State or semi-State boards were predominantly male.  Since 1987, 297 women were appointed to State boards.  This is a move in the right direction but more could be done, as there are many other women who have a right and the ability to be appointed to State boards.  A new carer's allowance was <Col N="1115" /> introduced and in the 1991 budget the carer's allowance now includes disabled person's maintenance allowance.  A sum of £0.5 million was allocated in the budget for programmes for women.  One hundred and fifty thousand pounds was assigned to the Rape Crisis Centre, and Deputy Monica Barnes was very much to the forefront in ensuring that that money was made available to the centre.  I hope in future the amount allocated will be substantially increased.  Money was allocated to Women's Aid to help victims of domestic violence.  Domestic violence seems to be on the increase.  The Minister for Justice must become involved in this area.  The court buildings in rural Ireland especially are not suitable for family law cases which are supposed to be heard in camera.  We should provide proper facilities for families, particularly for women who may not have people to take care of their children while they attend court and so must bring them along with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance introduced a special tax allowance for widowed parents with dependent children, to apply for three years following the death of a spouse.  This is a worthwhile project and will go some way towards helping a bereaved person who has suffered the trauma of the death of a spouse and has to live on a substantially reduced income.</P>
    <P>There was an extension of the dental and optical benefit to the dependent spouses of insured workers in 1987.  This benefited mainly women working full time in the home.  Unfortunately some dentists refused to operate the scheme. There have been 85,000 claims for dental benefit, so obviously the scheme is successful. In Wexford no dentist to date has decided to operate the scheme.  It is a disgrace that the spouses of insured workers in County Wexford are denied the right to dental treatment because the dentists are well off and do not need this type of business.  The Minister should encourage the dentists to take it on.  I appeal to young dentists to set up in County Wexford and use that scheme <Col N="1116" /> to provide a service for a worthy and important section of the community.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that women should have the option to remain at home and look after their families or to go out to work as well as rear their families.  Life should be made easier for working mothers whether they are married or single parents.  There should be supports for women in the workplace from the State and from employers. There should be proper child care facilities and full social welfare entitlements where needed.  The role of the employer is important here.  In many cases women can work for only certain hours.  Employers should be flexible and should allow time off or flexi hours to facilitate working wives who in many instances have to work to supplement the income of their husbands.</P>
    <P>Women working in the home and rearing families are often taken for granted. It is difficult to quantify in monetary terms the work of the housewife or mother.  If the State were to pay mothers for the work they do at home rearing their families, for the stress, the work, the hours&mdash;seven days a week around the clock, the social welfare budget would be immediately doubled.  I suppose that is not practical given the present financial circumstances.  Women working in the home deserve some kind of recognition whether it be money or special pension-type concessions or social welfare credits for the period spent at home looking after children.  Many suggestions could be put forward tonight.  Some housewives or &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo; women are very aggrieved that no Government have recognised the important role they play. Indeed, I read recently that an economist in 1828 tried to estimate the value of a housewife in the home but we are still trying to do that 100 years on.  The Joint Committee on Women's Right should consider this matter and make recommendations which could possibly be incorporated in legislation in the future.</P>
    <P>It is good that we are having this debate but there is no need for this Bill. The Government, like previous <Col N="1117" /> Governments, have been able to introduce enlightened legislation without there being any need to make changes to the Constitution.  I believe that will continue to be the case in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for his contribution and I am happy that he has been converted on the road to Damascus or some such place.  I welcome this Bill and commend Deputy Mitchell for carrying out such detailed research and for his commitment in bringing the Bill forward. I regret the absence of the Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  We were informed last night that she is out of the country and I accept that that can happen.  I have the greatest respect and admiration for her but, given that we seldom have debates or discussions on political issues related to women, it is a matter of regret that she cannot be here to listen to the contributions and make her own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that we heard a sad and spiritless speech from the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach last night.  He trotted out a catalogue of facts and a tirade of criticisms.  In my opinion he had some nerve to come into the House to list Government reforms which included the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy and the Judicial Separation Act.  That takes brass neck given that both these Acts were initiated, drafted and processed by Fine Gael. it is clearly a case of Fianna Fáil thinking that if they say something often enough and with enough conviction they will convince not only themselves but others that they are their achievements.  I ask the Minister of State to instruct his speech writers to end the myth and not dishonestly claim that Fianna Fáil were responsible for the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy. Everyone knows that it was I, as Minister of State, during the term of office of the Coalition Government in the eighties who introduced this reform.  The Judicial Separation Act, which was also listed by the Minister of State, was introduced, again, as everyone knows, by Fine Gael. It was initiated by my constituency <Col N="1118" /> colleague, Deputy Shatter, and vehemently opposed initially by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State went on to say and this jumped out at me:</P>
    <P>No one has seriously suggested to date, or has been able to demonstrate that any of the reforms so far undertaken or, indeed, any of the reforms that might be contemplated or advocated have been inhibited or prevented as a result of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is wrong and I challenge him or whoever is going to speak on his behalf later to come back to the House to state the Government's view on this matter.  The Government are certainly inhibiting legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is significant and deserves support. Indeed, when it was launched recently at a press conference it was welcomed and was the subject of very favourable media comment but it is doubly significant as we witnessed last night.  It is taking a census of party as commitment to women's issues, real commitment which will result in action and change.  Fianna Fáil have nothing to offer women though they try desperately to cover their nakedness claiming other people's achievements.</P>
    <P>What about the Labour Party?  Last night we heard a most petulant speech from Deputy Ferris.  He said that yes, they will support the Bill but in an ungenerous and critical way.  It seems to be a case of &ldquo;because we did not get there first with our Bill we will give you little or no credit for yours&rdquo;.  Their contribution betrays the typical Labour Party lip-service to the cause of women.  They have a Bill that would extend rights to women, among other groups, and I have to say that it is not a bad one but they did not give it priority in their Private Members' time.  It has been on their shelves for months and I have to ask why.  It is obvious that everything else is more important whan that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party would do well to take the lead from Fine Gael on this matter.  They should look at their benches and their parliamentary party; they have <Col N="1119" /> no women Deputies, Senators or MEPs. It seems that in the rush for safe constituency seats women in the Labour Party get knocked down by the men.  Debates like this hold up a mirror for women to see which party genuinely have their interests at heart.  There is no doubt that the highest scorer are the Fine Gael Party.  It was Deputy John Bruton as Minister in 1983 who set up the first all-party committee on women's rights who have proved to be an effective parliamentary vehicle for highlighting issues and at which groups in society are given the opportunity to put their points to parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Garret FitzGerald who as Taoiseach appointed the first and only Minister of State for Women's Affairs. That was an important move and, if not perfect in its form and objectives it was an innovation which should have been built on.  It was the Fine Gael Party who set up the very successful women in business programme which produced so many women entrepreneurs in a short space of time.  However, the Minister for Finance abolished this programme as soon as he took office.  Fine Gael also set up the mediation scheme which is vital in that it helps avoid conflict in marriage breakdown cases.  This scheme is lucky not to have been abolished but it is only limping along at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald is a man deply committed to the cause of women to the extent that he was prepared to step out of line and put his head above the parapet in support of this cause.  I do not think many political leaders show the same commitment but the torch he carried was carried on by Deputy Alan Dukes, by our present Leader, Deputy John Bruton, and by people such as Deputy Gay Mitchell in our party.</P>
    <P>All the initiatives I mentioned arose from the experiences of Fine Gael women who had an insight and understanding of what women need and expect.  Ours is an open-minded party where women's thinking and tuition is respected at parliamentary party level and throughout the organisation.  Their <Col N="1120" /> involvement has not only influenced policy and legislation but has contributed greatly to raising the consciousness of their male colleagues.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Coughlan made a fine contribution for which I thank her. During the course of her contribution she quoted one of my historical heroes, the classical feminist of the last century, John Stuart Mills.  The quotation she gave was taken from a debate on women's rights in Westminister.  Mills was a man who had a great insight, incredible sensitivity and was extraordinary for his time.  I would like to quote him further.  In a famous essay, The Subjection of Women, he made the following claim:</P>
    <P>I deny that anyone knows or can know the nature of the two sexes as long as they have only been seen in their present relation to one another. If men had ever been found in society without women or women without men or if there had been a society of men and women in which the women were not under the control of the men, something might have been positively known about the mental and moral differences which may be inherent in the nature of each.  What is now called the nature of woman is an eminently artificial thing &mdash; a result of forced repression in some directions, unnatural stimulation in others. It may be asserted without scruple, that no other class of dependants have had their character so entirely distorted from its natural proportions by their relations to their masters.  In the case of women a hothouse and stove cultivation has always been carried on of some of the capabilities of their nature, for the benefit and pleasure of their masters.</P>
    <P>The male control that John Stuart Mills spoke of in the 1870s of course was very extreme and was a different control from what would be experienced today but in my opinion is a control based on thousands of years of male legal privilege, custom, practice and tradition that favours a male position and male power. It survives in today's Irish society.</P>
    <P>In last night's debate there was a <Col N="1121" /> degree of scorn about this amendment The Minister of State said we were introducing it for publicity, which in the way he said it, is utter nonsense.  Deputy Ferris said it was not necessary as their law, the Labour law yet to be introduced, was what we really wanted.  To the Minister of State I say, &ldquo;yes, we were doing it for publicity in the context of letting people realise the inadequate response of the Government to women's issues and the need to amend our Constitution.&rdquo;  I suggest to Deputy Ferris that we need an equal rights amendment to the Constitution as well as an equal status Act.</P>
    <P>I challenge male speakers who come in here with a condescending air.  As someone who has worked for 20 years for women's rights, from the days of Irish-women's liberation when we were ridiculed and jeered for seeking a right to contraception in 1972, as one who rolled up her sleeves and created the first hostel for battered wives in Dublin when priests and politicians turned their backs on those women and children and as one who stood as a feminist in 1977 and broke the mould of the all-male candidate ticket, I know what women expect and want in 1991.  This amendment has been welcomed by the Council for the Status for Women and by the women's committee of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. I strongly suspect that when the Second Commission on the Status of Women report in time one of their recommendations will be a constitutional amendment to realign women rightfully in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution is steeped in the values of a thirties Ireland, the Ireland of the invisible woman, the wife as possession and woman as submissive and passive creature.  That shadow is still hanging over us in Article 41 and it contributes to negative and narrow attitudes in our policy-making and our legislation.  More important, it is right now a barrier to legislation being introduced on the family home.  There are at least three cases with regard to matrimonial property which have been referred to the Supreme Court from the High Court.  I know that, because of decisions of the High Court <Col N="1122" /> and judgments of Mr. Justice Barr and Mr. Justice Barron, this matter is unsure as it refers to Article 41. Indeed, I suggest that the Minister of State or his advisers in drafting his speech did not read the judgments in those cases which are outlined in chapter 10 of <i>Marriage Breakdown in Ireland</i> by Duncan and Scully which deals with a number of unreported cases of legal disagreement based on different interpretations of Article 41 and woman's role portrayed therein.</P>
    <P>I recommend that before the end of the debate the Minister study that and I suggest that if he does he and the Government will change their mind about the need for a constitutional amendment. Those judgments relate to disputes over a wife's right to a share in the family home.  It appears that, far from giving straightforward protection to the wife and mother in the home, she is instead set apart and, apparently, not worthy of jointly sharing the home she lives in.  It is not clear.  I wish to quote what Mr. Justice Barrington said in AH versus PH in July 1989, page 287 of the Duncan and Scully book:</P>
    <P>It appears that the Court should recognise the contribution the wife makes by her work as a carer and rearer of the family within the home, because it appears to be quite inconsistent with the values of Article 41 of the Constitution that the wife who leaves the home and has an independent income and is therefore able to make a financial contribution towards the repayments of the family mortgage, might at the end of the day be in a very much better position than the wife who fulfils the constitutionally referred role and remains at home to rear the children. That seems to be an inconsistent conclusion and inconsistent with the principle of Article41.</P>
    <P>Another view expressed by Mr. Justice Barron on page 286 of the book deals with L <i>versus</i> L.  He said:</P>
    <P>While I see the equity in recognising the contribution made by the plaintiff towards the welfare of her family, <Col N="1123" /> there does not seem to me to be anything in Article 41 of othe Constitution to support her contention that she should become entitled thereby to a share in the family home or any other property of any member of the family. The Article seeks to protect the family. The right granted is one whereby the State shall &ldquo;endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home&rdquo;.  In so far as this provision may be construed as a guarantee of financial reward, and I express no view on this aspect of the matter, it seems to me that it must be a guarantee of reward from outside the family rather than a distribution within the family.</P>
    <P>In other words, when it comes to property and possessions this woman, this mother in the home, enshrined in Article 41 of our Constitution, has no right to a redistribution or share of resources from within that family.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Gay Mitchell is certainly worthy of support and important in its own right.  It is not too far removed from the equal rights amendment that was the focus of a magnificent effort by American women in the early eighties.  They too saw the need to ensure protection for women citizens in their Constitution.  By a very extraordinary technical method this amendment had to be introduced in each individual state and debated, voted on and passed by each state.  However, despite massive sums spent on that campaign in an effort to have each state ratify that amendment before a pre-ordained date, all their efforts were in vain.  Their amendment did not go through and did not become part of the American Constitution.  I recall from reading, listening to and speaking to women at the time the great bitterness that campaign and appeal met with from right wing politicians, institutions and religious interests.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that we should go further even than this simple amendment.  I would say, &ldquo;Scrap Article 41.2º&rdquo;.  It is <Col N="1124" /> meaningless.  It has Irishwomen caught in a time warp, trapped firmly in a de Valera vision that is not relevant today nor for the future and I suspect never was relevant for real women.  Irishwomen need clear legal rights established by the Oireachtas.  We do not need judicial, intellectual argument at High Court or Supreme Court level by judges many of whom are totally out of touch with the thinking of real women of the nineties as distinct from the constitutional woman framed in time, a remote idealist unrelated to real life today.</P>
    <P>The real commitment by parties in this House will be judged by their actions on this legislation and by their agreement to remove the anomalies and all the inequalities to the advancement and full participation in Irish society of women here.  This means dealing with our Constitution. It means an equal rights amendment. Inevitably it means thinking about removing the yoke of Article 41 of the Constitution which, in my opinion, has more place in comic opera than in our Constitution.  I know it influences the thinking within the Executive.  From my experience as Minister dealing with memoranda for Government, recommendations, amendments and so on to proposed policy and proposed legislation I know the thinking of the Executive.</P>
    <P>The constitutional requirement that women should be encapsulated in the home status or role stands as a shining beacon to civil servants and policy makers.  Perhaps any initiatives or requests for funding would be more favourably considered if they related to women in that role rather than as workers who are having great difficulty holding on to their jobs and looking after their children.  It is clear that this Article influences very strongly the political decisions taken.  There are many examples. Many people would, perhaps, argue that this is a good thing and that mothers in the home should be protected.  I do not deny that mothers in the home are playing a very important role.  The attitude I have described is, however, hampering the broad development of women because it is rather too cosy to believe <Col N="1125" /> that the traditional de Valera woman will go on forever in Ireland.  This is not the case.  Like every other developed country, in time this country will leave behind the woman who sees housewifery and house minding as a career.  Women will develop their full potential, go out into society and become equal in every way with men.</P>
    <P>This Article in the Constitution is extremely inhibiting.  I hope we will see a very real change when the second Commission on the Status of Women reports. This Constitution has long outlived its usefulness.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, on the introduction of this Bill.  I am happy to listen to the debate which provides a level of enlightenment and awareness.  I commend the Bill and seek support for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with a number of points made by the previous speaker in her rather chippy and divisive contribution.  I do not, however, intend to spend too much time on her contribution. Deputy Fennell's criticism of the absence of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was unfair and unnecessary, although, of course, the Deputy paid tribute to the excellence of the work of the Minister concerned.  She knows, since it was explained clearly in the House yesterday, that the Minister of State is absent on official business.  The Minister will return in the next day or two and enter this debate in due course. It has never been a convention of this House that an absent Minister be criticised, especially when abroad on official State business. That narrow view taken by the previous speaker is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was in Deputy Fennell's contribution the proprietorial attitude that a woman &mdash; she being the woman &mdash; is the only person entitled to address this issue. That is unacceptable.  She has a good record on women's issues which cannot be denied, but that does not entitle her to be abusive and to dismiss worthless people like myself who stand up to make a contribution on this or any other issue. It is an attitude of illiberality which I find <Col N="1126" /> unacceptable.  Does it really matter who introduced what as long as it was introduced? If a cure is achieved, does it matter which Government were responsible? That has been my attitude.  As long as the cause of women is advanced, does it matter whether a Fine Gael Government introduced a measure or a Labour Government or a Fianna Fáil Government? If the problem is solved, that is all that matters.  This is an issue where I thought consensus would be looked for and obtained.  We have to deal with the attitude the former Minister adopts.</P>
    <P>I am glad she made her contribution, which I respect, but I do not accept her criticism of various other contributions. Apparently the Labour Party have no role on women's issues, Fianna Fáil are dismissed out of hand, as well as The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats.  The only party who have addressed women's issues, according to Deputy Fennell, is the Fine Gael Party. So be it.  The only women in this country are Fine Gael women.  That is the catechism according to Deputy Fennell and anybody who goes outside those narrow confines is in grievous error.  <i>Mea culpa.</i></P>
    <P>I now launch my unworthy contribution on this issue by congratulating the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party, for standing in during the absence of the Minister on official business abroad.  His contribution recalls to mind the issues which have been addressed over the years.  The touchstone date is 1957 with the introduction of legislation on the status of women.  The full title of the Bill escapes me.</P>

      <P>I am pleased and thrilled that the Deputy is here. I do not deny her right to be here, as the Deputy would <Col N="1127" /> not deny my right to address the issue of women.  The Minister of State read out a litany of legislation in his contribution yesterday. The touchstone legislation was the Married Women's Status Act, 1957.  From that Act flowed much legislation relating to the equality of women. There was recognition of the genuine need to update the status of women in our society.  There is no doubt that women were second class citizens.  This was brought about by biblical and various religious attitudes to women which I have always found unacceptable.</P>
      <P>We are here to discuss the amendment proposed by Deputy Mitchell.  He seeks to interpose in Article 40 of the 1937 Constitution that all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law and to include the following:</P>
      <P>Rights under the law shall not be limited or denied by the State by virtue of distinction of sex.</P>
      <P>He goes on to repeat what is already in the Constitution:</P>
      <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactment have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
      <P>Let us examine very carefully the first sentence of Article 40.1. of the Constitution which states:</P>
      <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume &mdash; and the courts would be of the same view &mdash; that &ldquo;all citizens&rdquo; means all men and women shall, as human persons &mdash; which again applies to men and women &mdash; be held equal before the law. Deputy Gay Mitchell, decent man that he is, wishes to introduce constitutional sunburstry that rights under the law shall not be limited or denied by the State by virtue of the distinction of sex.  I respectfully suggest that that is tautology, it is repetition.  I would have thought that on close scrutiny it would be found by the courts to be unconstitutional in its present format.  We have a perfectly <Col N="1128" /> straightforward definition of all citizens' rights and their equality before the law. In those circumstances I would have thought that this proposed amendment was irrelevant.  For that reason I strongly urge the House to reject it.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the views expressed by the previous speaker that the Constitution is bad.  The Constitution has served this country extremely well since 1937 and will not be found wanting in the future.  Of course, there are defects in it but that is not a good enough reason to wipe it out in its totality.  As far as women are concerned, I think the Constitution has served them well and the courts have interpreted it in successive cases accordingly.  There is no good reason to accept this amendment and if there was a good reason to accept it, it is my view that issues of this nature should be resolved by consensus and by a non-divisive approach to the debate.  We are all in the business of trying to improve the lot of citizens, and in this instance the lot of women.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, which is the third such committee.  The first Joint Committee on Women's Rights was set up in 1983, as Deputy Fennell has said, by the then Coalition Government.  We will given them their deserved pat on the back.  This present committee was set up in December 1987, some considerable time before the most recent general election. It is important to place the terms of reference of that committee on the record:</P>
    <P>(a)  to examine or propose changes in the law which would materially affect the interests of women.</P>
    <P>(b)  to consider any means by which any areas of discrimination against women can be eliminated.</P>
    <P>(c)  to consider economic and social disadvantages applying to women in the home and to recommend changes to help eliminate these disadvantages.</P>
    <P>(d)  to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on these issues.</P>
    <P>I am privileged to be a member of this committee which is presided over by a <Col N="1129" /> woman, Deputy Barnes from my constituency, and a more excellent chairwoman of a committee one could not find.  She rules with a sense of fair play and much of what will emerge from the committee will be due to her chairwomanship. The work priorities of this committee are again very clear.  I wish to disabuse the idea that this House is in some way not concerned with women's issues &mdash; nothing could be further from the truth. On average, the committee meet on a bi-monthly basis and since December 1987 we have had 20 meetings, which is not a bad record.  The priorities of the committee are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  attitude towards environmental and peace issues</P>
    <P>(2)  women and family law reform including research into the continental system of community of matrimonial property</P>
    <P>(3)  domestic violence</P>
    <P>(4)  rape and sexual violence</P>
    <P>(5)  women and the media</P>
    <P>(6)  women at work</P>
    <P>(7)  financing of rape crisis centres and other women's organisations</P>
    <P>(8)  education.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed that the joint committee should work closely with the EC on matters affecting women.  It was also agreed that as a priority the Joint Committee on Women's Rights should establish the position regarding the equal status legislation. The House has charged a committee to examine the role of women in our society.  This is not to suggest that there are not areas where women are discriminated against.  Recently our most able chairwoman wrote letters to various organisations including golf clubs and other organisations asking them about their attitudes on the equal status of women.  She received some replies but other organisations did not reply.  But in the main, I think golf clubs have faced up to their responsibilities to their women members.  However they are still to be <Col N="1130" /> found wanting in that regard.  Personally I find that unacceptable.  The sooner they get their houses in order the better.  Other organisations may discriminate against women but a message should go out loud and clear from this House that this is not acceptable.  This is one of the reasons that we should be grateful to Deputy Gay Mitchell for raising this issue.  I do not think you can threaten people in our society but organisations should be told that they should make an effort to bring about equality of the sexes in the context of their rules and regulations.  They must be told that the Oireachtas finds discrimination against women within their organisations unacceptable in 1991 and that we, as a legislative assembly, will continue to ensure that women are not discriminated against.  That is one of our fundamental duties.</P>
    <P>Instead of addressing a constitutional <i>non sequitur</i> we should address the real issues and the real work that needs to be done in the area of discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>The last Fianna Fáil speaker, Deputy John Browne, made a very good speech on the role of women in the home.  He spoke of society's attitude to women in the home which I would have thought applied years ago.  From my own experience I know that women have a huge role in the home.  They are mothers, chancellors of the exchequer, advisers, they preside over children's examination efforts in our absence.  From A to Z they are absolutely irreplaceable.  I do not for a moment deny women at the end of their mothering period the opportunity to work outside the home.  If they can work both inside and outside the home at the same time, so be it.  I feel as strongly as Deputy Browne that there should be some form of financial compensation to women for their work in the home.  I do not know how it can be structured but there are enough civil servants out there to present proposals to the various Ministers concerned.  It should be proposed in this House that women be compensated for the magnificent role they continue to play in the home.  If it is easier to give them the advantage, as it were, of a role <Col N="1131" /> in the home rather than outside, so be it. That is not meant in any way to enter a constraint in that regard; if women are capable and able to work outside the home in addition to undertaking their mothering tasks, so be it.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the subject of women working outside the home.  It is not so much a case of equality of rights as one of equality of opportunity.  I know for a fact that if there is a man and woman applying for the same job with an all male interview board, invariably the man will get the job.  That is unfortunate.  If you like, that is another type of repressed discrimination from which a woman suffers but which may not be so evident. Throughout our society, wherever women have made it to the so-called top, they have been found to be exceptional. That is why I contend that the problem is not one of equality of rights but rather one of equality of opportunity.  I am not certain that we should be writing that type of thing into law.  Rather it is an attitude of mind that we in this House should endeavour to change.  Women should be given such opportunity, be treated as citizens and not discriminated against on the grounds' of sex.</P>
    <P>I might refer now to the work done in this regard by successive Governments. For example, there was the Succession Act, one of the most far reaching Acts introduced in the history of any nation which was probably a precursor of similar legislation introduced in other countries. That Bill was introduced when I was a neophyte in this House in 1966 or thereabouts. It was a tribute to the then Fianna Fáil Government that they introduced that Bill.  I am giving credit where it is due.  I know that the Fine Gael Party contend that they are more concerned about women than all of the remainder of Members in this House.  Obviously it was some form of accident that the Fianna Fáil Government introduced the Succession Bill.</P>
    <P>I have just addressed the issue of equality in the work place.  Then there is the matter of equality within the tax code.  I might refer to one area in which there is <Col N="1132" /> not equality, that is, in respect of free legal aid services.  Three-quarters of the representations to the free legal aid services are made by women which is a very sad commentary on the men to whom they are married.  The Minister knows this.  He very kindly presented himself to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights on 20 February last when he gave a first class account of his concern for and knowledge of the various issues raised by us in that Committee at that time.  He is aware of the absence of adequate funding for those services.</P>

      <P>At the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights we also addressed the issue of the detention of women in prison, the segregation of young and old women and the non-custodial attitude to women.  I mention these matters to lay the bogey that in some way we, as a Parliament, are not concerned about the equality or the role of women in our society.  For example, there is also the protection of the status of women rearing children, working full-time in the home, so ably addressed by Deputy Browne of Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was the helpful intervention of the Married Women's Status Act of 1957, the first Commission on the Status of Women to be followed by the second Commission on the Status of Women. There have been also the abolition of the bar on married women from working in the Civil Service, paid maternity leave and, since 1957, the abolition of illegitimacy. Then there has been the reform of the adoption laws.  I remember raising the matter of illegitimacy in this House <Col N="1133" /> 20 years ago.  If Deputy Fennell was responsible for the legislation which abolished illegitimacy, I congratulate her because it had long been overdue.  We must give credit where it is due.  Then there was the reform of the adoption law, the Judicial Separation Act, reform of the law on rape and the children's abduction legislation.  Recently there has been appointed another woman High Court judge to complement the already well established and respected High Court judge, Miss Justice Carroll.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the appointment of women to State boards and a substantial section of the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> devoted to the equality of women.  As I have already said, many Articles of the Constitution have been used to vindicate women's rights and to challenge laws discriminating against them.  But the issue of equal opportunity is the real challenge rather than that of equality of rights.  I believe I have adequately demonstrated the case for equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already outlined with admirable clarity the reasons this Bill must be viewed as another episode in the Fine Gael Party's desperate effort to convince the people that they, and they alone, have cornered the market on women's rights.  I should have thought that Private Members' Time was a device intended to afford Deputies in Opposition an opportunity to initiate legislation. Unfortunately, the Bill before the House proposes a totally unnecessary constitutional amendment which would necessitate a full scale referendum.  For example, the Bill makes no reference whatsoever to any specific proposal that might improve the lot of women.  From time to time a Deputy comes to the House with a Bill designed to positively improve our laws.  This Government have taken account of Bills proposed by Deputy Shatter, the first of which was the Judicial Separation Bill, subsequently amended and enacted.  The second was the Foreign Adoptions Bill now being dealt with by a Special Committee of this House.  These are two examples of the <Col N="1134" /> type of opportunity that can be availed of by Opposition Deputies in the context of the time now being used for what I might describe as an irrelevance.</P>
    <P>As we know, the United Nations has a very clear Charter in the context of women and their equality. As a nation we subscribe to that United Nations Charter unreservedly and without equivocation. Of course, we subscribe also to the European Commission Charter in the context of women and the requisite changes which national governments are called on to implement.  I happened to pick it up as I was coming in to make my contribution to this worthwhile debate on the general condition of women.  It relates to the equal treatment of women in the context of the social welfare code and states:</P>
    <P>Following on the implementation in 1986 of changes necessary to introduce equality of treatment in accordance with the EC Directive on Equal Treatment, married women are now treated in exactly the same way as all other claimants in so far as rates of payment, increases for dependants and entitlements to unemployment assistance is concerned.  In fact, the only remaining areas of inequality within the social welfare code relate to the more favourable treatment of married women as compared with married men in so far as entitlement to certain survivor's benefits and family benefits are concerned. Considerable progress has been made by the Minister in these areas during the past two years, however, through the introduction of assistance schemes for widower's and deserted husbands with children and more recently, through the introduction of the lone parent's allowance scheme which provides for full equality between men and women in so far as assistance payments are concerned.</P>
    <P>The dental benefit scheme was extended to dependent spouses of insured workers in 1987, mainly women working full-time in the home.  To date there have been 85,904 claims for dental benefit from <Col N="1135" /> dependent spouses since the extension of the scheme to this category.</P>
    <P>We do not raise that issue as any form of self inflicted kudos.  This is what should be done, this is what has been done and will continue to be done.  Discrimination against women of any description must cease once and for all.  To suggest that one party are better than another or that one Government are better than another is not the issue; the issue is that regardless of whatever party or Government are in power they must ensure that the issue is addressed and the problem is solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>First I welcome the Bill and I hope Deputy Fennell will not regard me as being petulant or scornful if I criticise it.  The Bill is important from the point of view of providing this House with a rare opportunity to debate the issue of discrimination against women and while there are serious defects with what is proposed nevertheless it is important that we have the opportunity to debate the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will begin my contribution by referring to the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  My party made a recent submission to that commission entitled &ldquo;Equal to the best&rdquo;.  It is important to bear in mind that what we are talking about is equalising the rights of women and the opportunities of women upwards and not levelling them downwards.  For too long various Governments &mdash; no Government are exempt in this respect &mdash; implemented legislation and regulations which tended to level downwards, particularly in the social welfare area.  That is true with regard to directives coming from the European Community.  By and large, Irish Governments have been dragged virtually screaming to the point where they implemented in law what was already required of them by European directives.  When they implement them they tend to do so on a most begrudging basis.  It is important to bear in mind that what we are trying to do is to equalise people upwards.  That is why we indicated <Col N="1136" /> in our submission to the commission that we wanted equality with the best.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to women's equality specifically is part of a broader commitment to social progress and the betterment of all citizens who are disadvantaged and discriminated against. We reject completely the idea of equalising downwards, of reducing anyone's status to that of someone who is even more disadvantaged in the name of so-called equality.  We want women to be equal to the best in Irish society not the worst.  More specifically, we also want women to be more equally and activily involved in defining what is the best.  It is not for us, particularly this House which is dominated to a huge extent by men, to define what is best for women.  It is important that women have a role in defining that also.</P>
    <P>It may seem unnecessary to specifically reject the lowest common denominator brand of women's equality but, unfortunately, there have been several attempts by Irish Governments to introduce equality on the cheap by levelling downwards rather than levelling upwards.  There have been numerous attempts by employers to circumvent both the spirit and the letter of equality laws through various technical and legal loopholes.</P>
    <P>The submission I referred to from the The Workers' Party, which was a fairly substantial one, had more than 40 specific recommendations in it, some of which relate to a constitutional amendment, some relate to legal amendments and some do not require any legal base.  It is important that the Bill before us addresses the question of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific proposals &mdash; I do not propose to go through them all &mdash; we made to the Second Commission on the Status of Women we addressed the question of the Constitution and the ambiguities in it at present.  I propose to deal with that later.  We draw attention to the fact that employment equality laws need to be reformed and ensure that women are not discriminated against and we give a specific example.  At present for a woman to prove she should get <Col N="1137" /> equal pay with men doing the same type of work a man has to be employed in the job where that woman is working.  If the employees are exclusively women in a particular employment then she has no case despite the fact that in some other employments men may do exactly the same type of work and get even double the rate of pay that she receives. Our proposal to the commission suggested &mdash; and this may tickle the fancy of some women &mdash; that a notional man be introduced in relation to employment where it will be assumed that a man who might be employed in a particular job would receive a particular rate and, therefore, women claiming such a rate would have a case and not be dismissed automatically simply because a man was not employed in the specific area where she was working.  That needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Social welfare laws need to be reformed.  We still have this ridiculous situation where adult dependants do not have an independent existence of their own.  By and large adult dependants are women.  We argue that social welfare payments should be individualised and each person in their own right should have an entitlement and not one based on their husbands' or their sons' or some other form of dependency.  We also propose very strongly a minimum income system which would be backed up by minimum wage legislation to avoid abuse of it.  We are not at all happy with the idea of proposing a wage for women in the home.  Obviously, we are not opposed to the idea of women being paid for the work they do in the home; that goes without saying, but we have grave reservations about the idea that there should be an employer wage relationship between spouses in the home.  The idea of a wage for house work would lead in that direction.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing is a totally new concept of a minimum income system which would derive from a harmonisation of the tax and social welfare system which would provide a minimum income for all adults in our society, immediately abandon the idea of dependency by women and obviate the wage relationship that a wife would then have with her husband <Col N="1138" /> if we were to go down the road of having a wage paid to women in the home.  Equal status legislation is required.  I have no doubt that there is a need for a ministry for women's affairs.  We have a very good and capable woman in the Government, although she has only yet reached the point of Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Maire Geoghan-Quinn.  She has responsibility for overseeing what other Departments do in relation to the status of women but she has no obligation to report to this House or to let us know what Departments are doing specifically to improve the status of women, and that is not good enough.  There has to be Cabinet responsibility for dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>Maternity and paternity leave are important, as is community based child care.  Parental and family leave should be introduced along the lines proposed in the draft European Community Directive. Major efforts need to be made to upgrade the status of unpaid work both by highlighting its social importance and its intrinsic value and by ensuring that those who engage in such work are not impoverished, as happens in 90 per cent of cases at the moment.  By and large, it is women who are the carers in our society; it is women who care for elderly parents and end up with virtually no rights of their own and no entitlements. A carer's allowance was introduced in the last couple of years but it is totally inadequate and needs to be drastically overhauled.</P>
    <P>The whole question of occupational pensions for women needs to be addressed.  A woman who works in the home has no automatic rights, in her own right, to a pension.  That matter also needs to be addressed.  Companies and other organisations who employ ten or more people should be requird to include equality information in their annual reports: that would be a breakdown of the workforce by sex, age, grade and earnings, and a comment on whether this is seen as balanced in terms of sex and a commitment to specific remedial action if women are not adequately represented at all levels.  That would be an important reform and one which would not require <Col N="1139" /> a major amendment of our companies legislation.  It is important that we introduce some form of contract compliance which would be used by Government in promoting equality by ensuring that no State contracts are signed unless and until certain equality tests are passed by the contractors seeking the work. Consumers also have a responsibility in this area, and this does not require legislation. They should apply equality tests to companies and other organisations in which they place funds, and campaigns to this end should be directed at institutional investors, individual investors and pension fund trustees.</P>
    <P>The trade unions, of course, have a responsibility in this area.  I think it can be truthfully said that the trade union movement mirrors the patriarchal society in which we live.  Decision-making bodies ri = "5"in industry, trade unions and other organisations must include an appropriate proportion of women &mdash; at least 50 per cent. At least 50 per cent of future ministerial appointments to boards should be women if this is required to redress imbalances left by other nominating bodies.  The latter should be required to nominate equal numbers of men and women where possible.  The Worker Participation Act, 1977, and the Pensions Act, 1990, should be amended to provide adequate representation of women as worker directors and worker trustees, respectively. Again I stress that equality information in annual reports is a vital prerequisite to effective monitoring in this area.</P>
    <P>There is need for change in the tax code and the social welfare code as well as in the means test area.  Elderly women require particular attention as most are in grave risk of poverty due to poor financial provision and a lack of independent income.  A minimum social welfare pension of £68.20 per week &mdash; about 10 per cent above the minimum income proposed &mdash; is required to give all pensioners a modicum of independence and financial security.  Special attention must also be given to ensuring the physical security of elderly women, particularly those living alone.</P>
    <P>Our health services need to be looked at.  We need a charter of patients' rights. <Col N="1140" /> We must ensure that high-handed or patronising treatment of women in hospitals is ended and that all patients have equal rights to access, privacy, confidentiality, information and an independent complaints procedure.  Family planning legislation must be reformed and a draft Bill to this end should be before the House in the not too distant future, although if we are to go by recent press reports I fear it will be a very inadequate approach to the whole area of family planning.</P>
    <P>Education plays a crucial role in forming attitudes and shaping the economic lives of all our citizens.  Many reforms are needed in this area.  There is need for new life skills programmes in schools, civics programmes, greater emphasis on resources for adult education and distance learning, teacher retraining and better public library facilities.  The area of education is a vast one and needs specific attention and a special committee to look at the reforms that are required.</P>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Andrews, referred to the United Nations and the Irish commitment to the United Nations and the United Nations Charter.  He said that that commitment is totally unequivocal. We have not yet acceded to the article in the United Nations Convention on eliminating sex discrimination which concerns equal access to financial credit and other services and to recreational facilities.  The continuing discrimination by financial institutions and other companies providing consumer credit should be investigated by the Ombudsman appointed by the Council of Credit Institutions who should report publicly on the extent of such discrimination as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are a whole range of areas that need to be addressed, areas which require legal and constitutional change and which also require a change in attitude.  I would address some of my remarks to political parties specifically. The fact that about 80 per cent of the Members of this House are male is a reflection of the fact that political parties do not assist the movement of women through their ranks.  It is essential if our commitment to equality is to be genuine that we look at our own organisations to <Col N="1141" /> see how we can facilitate the participation of women in politics.</P>
    <P>The Women's Political Association have done very good work over the years in specific areas, but their work is among a particular stratum of women and does not reach the grassroots.  I am not denigrating the work they have done but there needs to be a far more specific commitment by political parties as to how they do their business.  I am including myself and my own party in the criticism I am making here.  Traditionally party political meetings take place in the evening at a time which suits men and in places which suit men.  Very few parties I know of provide the services of child minders to enable women to go to meetings.  It is obvious that most male TDs would not be here were it not for the fact that they have wives who take on the bulk of the burden of family rearing and commitments in the home.  That is an area which political parties specifically need to address.  It does not require legislation, but simply a change in attitude and an understanding of the needs of 50 per cent of our population who have a right to participate in the political process.</P>
    <P>These are all areas which need to be addressed.  The area the Bill before us attempts to address is the Constitution.  I am not belittling the efforts of the Fine Gael Party in bringing forward the Bill. They are doing a useful service in generating this debate, but the Bill contains serious gaps and is not very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for the decade, the thirties, in which it was drafted, the de Valera Constitution adopted a narrow and restrictive approach to its treatment of women.  It was not perhaps surprising, given the well established constructive credentials of the author of the Constitution and the fact that his principal adviser appears to have been Dr. John Charles McQuaid, who later became the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.  Few objections were raised at the time with the honourable exception of people like Senator Kathleen Clarke but, given the growth in demand for equality of treatment for women over the past few decades and the considerable progress in a number of areas such as jury service, <Col N="1142" /> taxation and employment rights, it is surprising that there has not been a stronger campaign for a constitutional amendment to reflect the changes in public attitudes which have been won since the thirties, very painfully and slowly.</P>
    <P>The more one reads our Constitution the more it becomes evident that its treatment of women is grossly unsatisfactory. There are a number of highly significant Articles in the Constitution relating to the status of women in society, particularly Articles 40, 41 and 45, some of which are very ambiguous.  Article 40 states that all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law. However, it goes on to allow the State in its laws to have &ldquo;due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function&rdquo; which seem to imply that unequal treatment is acceptable in certain areas, although these are not specified.</P>
    <P>Article 41.2.1º states that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.  The legal implications of this are far from clear.  Article 41.2.2º says that the State shall endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.  This very clearly implies that, as far as the Constitution is concerned, a woman's place is in the home.  I know very few women &mdash; and indeed very few men &mdash; who accept that as a justifiable principle in this day and age.  Article 45 states that all citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood.  It also directs the State to ensure that they may, through their occupations, find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.  Furthermore, it pledges the State to safeguard the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community and, where necessary, contribute to their support.  Finally it says that citizens shall not be forced by economic necessity to enter a vocation unsuited to their sex, age or strength.</P>
    <P>Articles 9 and 16 forbid any exclusions on grounds of sex from Irish nationality and citizenship, for membership of parliament or from voting for Members of <Col N="1143" /> parliament.  Over the years, Articles 40, 41 and 45 have been cited in a number of constitutional cases concerning women's rights in areas such as employment, taxation, social security and family and property law.  As a consequence, a number of important principles have been established under the Constitution, for example, that women cannot be deprived of employment purely on grounds of sex, that the exclusion of women from jury service was invalid and that the tax rules which treated married couples less favourably than unmarried couples living together was an attack on the institution of marriage and, hence, unconstitutional. However, although these particular forms of sex discrimination have been found to be unconstitutional, other principles have yet to be tested and, moreover, some of the tests, because of the inherently anti-woman bias in some sectors of the Constitution, could in fact prove to be negative.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to one case some years ago concerning Denis Dennehy. Based on the right of a woman to live in the home and rear her children he, as a deserted husband, sought a deserted wife's allowance but was refused it.  He took a constitutional case and lost it on the basis that he was a man so there are clearly the possibilities of negative outcomes to constitutional test cases.  For example, the Constitution does not clearly rule out discrimination against women who work outside the home, especially if they are married.  Indeed Article 40, when read in conjunction with part of Article 41, clearly implies the permissibility of unequal treatment of men and women in certain respects.  Nor has the nature or extent of the State's protection to women working in the home been tested or defined, except in relation to property.  The important question of whether indirect sex discrimination or discrimination by impact is unconstitutional has not yet been resolved either.</P>
    <P>Against this background there is a clear argument for amending the Constitution to remove ambiguities and to provide a clear prohibition on all forms of discrimination. We greatly fear, however, that <Col N="1144" /> if the Fine Gael proposal is passed in its present form it will achieve little.  We would like to see the Fine Gael amendment extended to include all forms of discrimination, direct or indirect, which are based on sex, marital status, sexual orientation, family circumstances, race, nationality, ethic origin, colour, age or disability.  These are all areas where there are serious discriminations in our society and they should be outlawed by our basic constitutional document.</P>
    <P>We are particularly concerned that the Fine Gael proposal provides for the retention of the references to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function in the Constitution which could facilitate continuing discrimination. We believe that it is also necessary to include a provision to allow positive discrimination and we suggest the following additional wording to the Fine Gael proposal:</P>
    <P>This amendment shall not preclude any programme, activity or legislation that has as its objective the amelioration of conditions of individuals or groups who are disadvantaged on account of the above mentioned characteristics.</P>
    <P>This is based on a similar provision in the Canadian Constitution; it is a positive and inclusive one rather than a negative and exclusive one as in the existing Articles and indeed in the Fine Gael proposal.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I welcome the fact that Fine Gael proposed this Bill; I am quite happy and satisfied that they are genuine in bringing forward the Bill and that their intentions are to improve the situation of women in society.  However, I have serious reservations about the impact it will have and the gaps it will leave if it is passed in its present form. We will be supporting the Bill when it is voted on at the end of Second Stage next Wednesday night.  If it is carried here next Wednesday &mdash; although judging by the response of the Fianna Fáil speakers that seems unlikely &mdash; then we hope that Fine Gael and the other parties participating on Committee Stage will accept reasonable amendments to the Bill to make it all-embracing and to cover the serious gaps to which I referred.</P>

      <P>I will be taking up the substantive points later.  I agree with the sentiments expressed here last night by Deputy Ferris of the Labour Party who said that the Bill as it stands is almost irrelevant, although not quite.  Having researched the subject we are of the opinion that the Bill is badly prepared and thought out.  A constitution &mdash; any constitution &mdash; is an important document, it is far too important to be tinkered with and certainly far too important to be changed in the way proposed by this Bill.  This Bill and the wording is fundamentally flawed. Serious problems will arise which I will outline in my contribution next week.</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the new measures the Minister for Agriculture and Food proposes to implement to combat the use of angel dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this matter to be of great importance and urgency.  The illegal use of angel dust as a growth enhancer is extremely serious and, indeed, very damaging to the image of Ireland as an agricultural country producing agricultural products within the European Community.  To date, Irish farming and food products have had an exemplary image abroad and that is an image we must do everything to protect to ensure that it is not destroyed by the intrusion of angel dust into agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid it has become more evident that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is unable to conduct or direct a serious investigation into the illegal use of growth enhancers such as angel dust which has been talked about a lot this week.  His response must be seen as exacerbating what is already a critical problem for our beef producers.  His latest proposals, enunciated by him on Monday evening and again last night lack credibility and they appear, certainly to the European Community, to be too little <Col N="1146" /> too late in dealing with this serious problem.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that his response to date has been totally inadequate. Instead of, to use his own words of Monday evening, considering implementing stringent measures, it is time for action and things should be done by the Government and by the Minister on behalf of agriculture.  He should have already given powers to the Garda and to the customs authorities to search and seize so that they can combat the threat to the beef industry which he has acknowledged in a number of speeches in the last couple of days.</P>
    <P>It was in December last that the Minister for Agriculture and Food conceded that more than 10 per cent of herds which had been sampled for the illegal growth enhancer were positive.  It is now clear that the Minister is unable to face up to the challenge that the illegal use of the drug presents to the Irish agriculture and food industry and our image of wholesomeness in the European context. We are very proud of the image we have established over the last number of years but that image is now in serious danger. The Minister's inability to confront the problem in a responsible and constructive manner has added further difficulties and resulted in damaging press abroad in recent weeks in relation to Ireland's agriculture and food industry.  The Minister has admitted as a fact that a mere 97 herds to date have been sampled for the abuse of this drug, and this represents a mere three herds per county out of a total of over 150,000 herds in the country as a whole.  The extent of the sampling is totally ineffective and minuscule when one takes into consideration the media attention and the fact that farming and the food industry are now awash with rumours of the widespread abuse of angel dust in the industry.</P>
    <P>In a recent response to a Dáil question, the Minister for Agriculture and Food failed to contradict the suggestion that meat factories were encouraging farmers to use angel dust or to dust cattle prior to slaughter.  Pathetically the Minister, with the full apparatus of the State at his disposal, was actually forced to appeal in this House to Members of the Dáil for <Col N="1147" /> any information on the use of angel dust. It is now well known that angel dust is a lethal drug if handled improperly.  There are widespread reports in farming circles of a number of tragic deaths due to inexperience and ignorance in the handling of the drug during the preparation of the foodstuffs.  There are questions which remain unanswered in relation to the Minister's seriousness in coming to grips with this problem.  This House, and the industry as a whole, need to be convinced of his seriousness.  Any proposals the Minister has should be brought before the Dáil and I am convinced that he would get the support of all the parties in this House in trying to rid Irish agriculture and the Irish food industry of the threat that now exists.</P>

      <P>I regret that on this vital issue Deputy Spring has not used the occasion to condemn out of hand those few unrepresentative shamefully irresponsible people whether in the farming sector or in the meat industry who have done a disservice to the industry.  I regret the fact, though I am not surprised, that Deputy Spring prefers instead to find some mean party political advantage that he can use to turn against the Minister. One might expect from the leader of a party on this issue that he would at least demand that those who are trying to undermine this industry would be isolated and ostracised.  He has not done so.  It is almost as if the Minister of the day was the one who caused and is responsible for it, and that is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My position in this matter is well known.  I would like to set on record the range of measures which I have implemented to tackle these illegal veterinary medicines.  In July 1990 I introduced specific legislation to deal with and combat the use of any growth promoting substance.  I took this action because I was aware that certain substances could be used as an alternative to hormone growth promoters which had been banned in 1987.  I was determined that no apparent loophole of this nature would encourage or facilitate a drift towards the use of illegal substances.  I do not need <Col N="1148" /> any convincing on the need to tackle and eliminate this problem or of the risk that it poses to our meat industry if it gets out of hand.</P>
    <P>The measures I have taken are more comprehensive and stringent than those applicable in any other member state. They comply with the views of the European Parliament who have passed resolutions calling on the Commission to extend hormone type controls to the use of all illegal growth promoting substances.  I have called repeatedly at Council of Ministers meetings for a harmonised approach &mdash; in essence, I want other member states to introduce measures as stringent as those I have introduced here.</P>
    <P>Our legislation now provides for the following measures &mdash; a total prohibition on the manufacture, importation, sale and possession of prohibited substances a ban on the use of prohibited substances in farm animals and the sale or processing of meat derived from an animal so treated with prohibited substances; powers for authorised officers to stop any vehicle, enter any land or premises and search for, examine or test any animals, meat or meat product, or anything believed to be a prohibited substance; search warrants to be obtained by authorised officers, members of the Garda Síochána and officers of Customs and Excise to enter and search any land, premises or vehicle on reasonable grounds of suspicion; the locking up of herds and meat pending further investigation and surrender of identity cards; and condemnation of the meat or meat products containing residues.</P>
    <P>To ensure observance of the regulations I have stringent enforcement measures in place.  Over 400 officers are authorised to enforce the regulations. Veterinary inspectors at slaughtering facilities are empowered on suspicion to detain and sample any animal or meat and, if the use of illegal substances is confirmed, to condemn such animals or meat.</P>
    <P>Last November I launched an intensive campaign to counteract any temptation to drift towards the use of beta-agonists. I assembled a special team of officers to devote their full time attention to this <Col N="1149" /> duty and to carry out on-farm inspections. So far they have tested 100 herds and on results to date 17 herd owners will be prosecuted.  The process is going through what Deputy Spring, as a lawyer, will recognise as the proper legal procedures. I cannot walk into court without going through the normal procedures. The activities of the squad have been broadened to cover van men, retail outlets and other distribution points.  To date 26 raids of this kind have taken place.  There have been some notable successes in the seizure of illegal substances. This campaign will be continued. Therefore, at present, the situation is that there is a strong body of legislation and resources being devoted on the ground to enforcement.  Liaison between officers of Customs and Excise and the Garda Síochána has been strengthened.</P>
    <P>I propose very soon to introduce further legislation to make all members of the Garda Síochána fully authorised officers and to give them additional powers to investigate suspected breaches of the regulations.  Deputy Spring would also know, if he consulted with the former Attorney General who used to be his adviser, that this matter has to be done after full legal inquiry and confirmation, and that is what I have been doing for some time.  Regulations are at an advanced stage of preparation to require all sellers of veterinary medicines to be licensed, thus completely outlawing all sales by van men.  I will introduce legislation to make offences in this area indictable and thereby make penalties even more prohibitive.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the intensive campaign has generated adverse publicity in the media, particularly in the foreign media. Responsibility for this problem should be laid where it belongs.  The least Irish people expect the leader of any party in this House to do is that.  However, Deputy Spring has not done so. Responsibility rests with those unscrupulous people who want to make a quick buck from the importation and distribution of these substances.  It rests with those farmers who are so greedy and foolish as to think that somehow these substances will make beef production more profitable.  Ultimately it is their <Col N="1150" /> industry and livelihoods which they are playing with.  There is only so much that any Minister or Department can do in terms of enforcement and prevention and I am determined to take my powers to the very limit.  However, I need the support of the beef industry generally in getting on top of this problem.  Having listened to the debate this evening I am entitled to say that I need the support of this House and not petty political point scoring.  I know that the representative organisations condemn the use of these substances.  It is time for the industry and the farming community to work more actively against their use.  This is not a problem which has arisen because of some draconian proposal, it is not a viral disease which we cannot prevent.  It is a problem which can be quickly eliminated if the entire industry takes the sensible and obvious choice, which is to have nothing to do with these substances and to collectively ostracise those shamefully irresponsible few.  I hope that Deputies will target those people and not the Minister whom some would like to target in order to score petty political points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indebted to the Cheann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.  At the outset, I should like to thank the Minister for the Environment for attending the House for the debate.  I hope he will respond to my remarks in a positive manner.  I had mistakenly anticipated that he would instruct his junior Minister, my constituency colleague, to reply to my comments on a problem with which I am sure he is only too familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter having read with some interest and in some detail the document produced by the Minister entitled <i>A Plan for Social Housing.</i> It is a glossy document which runs to 42 pages.  However, there is no mention in any of those 42 pages of the humble rural cottage.  At <Col N="1151" /> a time when topics such as integrated rural development and the preservation of the rural way of life are emblazoned across our newspapers on an almost daily basis it is sad that the response of the Government has been to exclude the isolated rural cottage from their plan for social housing.  I hope that prior to the introduction of the housing Bill consideration will be given to preparing a plan of action to build more rural cottages.</P>
    <P>I make these remarks as a Deputy who represents a rural constituency.  People in County Laois now have to wait for periods of up to ten years to have rural cottages constructed on their sites.  The programme of works to be carried out by Laois County Council this year will include the building of six rural cottages and a total of two rural cottages will be built in the neighbouring county of Offaly.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there is merit in the Minister's Department considering changes to the rules and regulations which apply to such housing.  My information suggests that an isolated rural cottage is designed to house a small farmer or agricultural worker.  Under a memorandum from the Department entitled H.1 of 1964, such a farmer must have a land valuation of £5 or less.  As we all know, less than 16 per cent of Irish people are directly engaged in agriculture.  Nevertheless, many people wish to live in rural areas.  Housing policy must be geared towards the provision of houses in rural areas.  Reference is made in almost every local authority county development plan to the aspiration that the local authority will promote the rural way of life and the building of rural cottages where there is such a need.</P>
    <P>Villages in County Laois such as Camross, Coolrain and Ballyfin do not have any local authority housing of any degree or description.  It is incumbent on people-who seek housing in these areas to go on the housing lists in the larger towns of Portlaoise and Mountrath.  I am not here to condemn the Minister's housing programme &mdash; that record speaks for itself; it is disastrous &mdash; but if people from rural areas have to migrate distances of <Col N="1152" /> ten or 15 miles before they can gain consideration for a local authority house this will denude vast areas of rural Ireland of inhabitants.  A townland in my constitutency, the Glendine Valley in the Slieve Bloom Mountains, does not have any inhabitants.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider putting life back into such areas by building a cluster of rural cottages where there is a church, a school and, dare I say it, a post office.  Bungalow bliss need not necessarily be the result if we plan our cottages carefully so that they tone in with the surrounding environment.  The economic cost of providing rural cottages must be considered in the context of the social problems being experienced in housing estates not alone in cities but in many rural towns.  We must review the entire concept of building blocks of 70, 80 or 100 houses in an estate.  This point was mentioned in the Minister's document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by requesting the Minister to state clearly his plans, hopes and policies for rural housing in anticipation of the housing Bill.  The building of two rural cottages in County Offaly and five in County Laois will not meet the justifiable demand which exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn):</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the wording of the item put down by Deputy Flanagan I should like to make it clear that rural cottages are built to the same high standard as the normal type of local authority housing schemes.  I want to see that high standard continue and it will be my policy to see that that is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation the procedures to be followed and the standards to be applied in providing local authority housing are set out in the memoranda and circular letters issued by my Department. What we are trying to do is eliminate the inefficiencies and high costs which have arisen in the past, for example, inadequate site selection, uneconomic layouts, over-use of expensive materials and <Col N="1153" /> the frills and unnecessary alterations in specifications during the course of construction.</P>
    <P>We have to be satisfied of the need for an isolated rural cottage and that there will be a continuing need for the dwelling during its useful life.  Subject to this, and the cost control procedures, local authorities are not prevented from providing rural cottages within the limits of their approved overall programme for new housing.  The cost control procedures at present in place involve the use of specialised techniques of cost planning and cost analysis and are an effective means of controlling the cost of construction projects from the earliest stage through to the final accounts.</P>
    <P>The controls in operation at present by my Department for the provision of local authority housing are the minimum necessary to ensure that, consistent with appropriate standards, the maximum output is achieved from the State's massive investment in this capital programme down thorugh the years.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, however, that it would not be practical to have the same stringent procedural measures applying to the innumerable small schemes of less than six dwellings that have been built or are in planning throughout the country and, in particular, single rural cottages, as apply to the larger local authority schemes. I am, therefore, surprised at the Deputy's comments on this matter.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain conditions housing authorities are not required to seek my approval at any stage for the provision of individual rural cottages.  These conditions are that where a housing authority include a rural cottage or a number of such cottages as part of their approved programme or new work in any particular year, use house plans that have previously been approved by my Department and keeps within its approved unit cost ceiling for such a dwelling, then it is not necessary for the authority to seek my Department's approval for that cottage.  Some authorities may choose, for their own reasons, not to obtain a unit cost ceiling approval from my Department or, if they do, may fail to have it revised at regular intervals. <Col N="1154" /> That choice is solely a matter for the individual local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would point out, however, that the most recent memorandum, No. N 2/90, issued by my Department on 26 April 1990, in relation to the procedures for providing local authority housing, again reminded housing authorities that in the case of single rural dwellings it was still open to them to continue the existing practice of obtaining annual approval to unit cost ceilings for such dwellings as an alternative to submitting tenders in individual cases.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Deputy recognises the great advance in the plan for social housing.  I gave some details of the programme on this night last week, following a debate here with Deputy Allen as to the situation regarding the guidelines and the regulations dealing with the aspects outlined in that programme.  For the benefit of all the Deputies I will be happy to reiterate that tomorrow, if they wish, I would be happy to give an update of the position to anybody who wishes to have it.  Some of the guidelines have been provided.  Some of the regulations are in place and they will all be issued by the end of next week.</P>
    <P>There is legislation to deal specifically with the shared ownership and the improvement in lieu of social housing. We are attempting, as an interim measure, to get a clearance to enable us to deal with that in advance of the legislation.  If we can achieve that, all that plan goes ahead.  Most of the guidelines have issued and most of the circulars too.  If we cannot achieve that, we have a little difficulty with the shared ownership, but apart from that the plan goes ahead in its entirety.</P>

      <P>Thank you for permitting me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The following item appeared in last Thursday's issue of <i>The Dublin Tribune:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> District Justice Hubert Wine criticised the &ldquo;lack of acceptance of responsibility of the Government&rdquo; in Dún Laoghaire Court last Thursday when a 13 year old youth with 17 charges against him was remanded for the third time that week.  The boy's case was up for report to see whether a place was available for him in a detention centre.  Justice Wine said: &ldquo;In relation to the very serious nature of this matter, the passing of the buck appears to be continual&rdquo;.  He called for a nonequivocal statement from the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Christopher Flood, setting out what was going to happen.  &ldquo;It is nothing short of outrageous that members of the judiciary are not advised about the future.  This charade has got to stop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He told the court that plans for building a centre in Finglas were &ldquo;highly unsuitable&rdquo; and that what was needed was a place of safety for those who require corrective treatment medically and otherwise.  I ask the Government once and for all to wake up to deal with this matter as they should be doing.  I have nowhere to send him except to the streets.&rdquo;  The boy was remanded until 15th April.</P>
    <P>Since then, yet another charge has been brought against this 13 year old and he is not the only one.  Currently there are another 14 year old boy and a 12 year old boy, against whom there are multiple charges, who have had to be remanded by District Justice Wine and released back onto the streets, simply because there is nowhere to put them.  Trinity House is full and so far the Government have failed to provide a remedial detention centre for young offenders.</P>
    <P>This is not a new issue.  District Justice Wine has been speaking out about it for quite some time.  In February 1990, when the same district justice refused to send a 15 year old girl to an adult prison, the Minister for Justice promised that the question of a remedial detention centre would be treated as a matter of urgency and priority.  Since then, little or nothing has happened, as the issue has been passed back and forth from the Departments of Justice to Education to Health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> The continuing failure to provide a remedial detention centre is undermining law enforcement in the Dún Laoghaire constituency, and in my view, it is now contributing to the growth in crime in the area, as these young criminals know that no matter what they do, they cannot be punished or corrected.  They are walking out of the court and literally giving the two-fingers sign to the gardaí who have prosecuted them.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are becoming increasingly frustrated; even if they catch one of these young criminals, and even if they produce evidence, no sanction can be imposed because there is nowhere to send them. The young criminals know this.  It is open season, a licence for anarchy.  They can do what they want and get away with it.</P>
    <P>The public simply cannot understand why the Government are allowing this lawlessness to continue.  There is a growing crime problem in the Dún Laoghaire constituency.  The single most frequent issue now raised with me, as a public representative, relates to crime.</P>
    <P>In the past week alone, I have been told of one housing estate where nine houses had sitting room windows broken by stone throwing, a doctor whose wife was attacked in their car while he was doing a house call, cars stolen and burned out and numerous cases of burglaries and physical attacks on local people.  Today, I was told of the father of three teenage children, whose wife died three years ago, and who is now in a critical condition in hospital because of a savage beating he got last night.  A lot of this trouble is unfortunately attributable to a small number of young thugs, some of whom are behaving like little mafia chiefs.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that this tiny minority of troublemakers can, with impunity, intimidate people, force women and children into a state of virtual house arrest after dark, frighten people away from using the DART, frighten retired people from taking an evening stroll down the East Pier, and carry on a campaign of destruction and mayhem in local communities.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it will take more than a detention centre to solve the crime problem, we will need more gardaí.  We will need changes in the law, but the most <Col N="1157" /> urgent need is for a detention centre.  We cannot wait for another two years, or another year, or even six months.  The matter should be addressed immediately so that the Judiciary will be able to convict these young criminals and send them somewhere for corrective treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present three centres for boys committed by courts &mdash; Trinity House in Lusk provides secure accommodation for up to 30 boys, Finglas Children's Centre, comprising St. Michael's Assessment Centre, for about 20 boys on remand and St. Lawrence's Special School, for approximately 55 long stay boys, most of whom are committed by courts.  St. Joseph's Special School, Clonmel, has accommodation for 75 boys about 60 per cent of whom would be committed through the courts.  There is one centre for girls, Oberstown Remand and Assessment Centre in Lusk which has eight places for girls under 17 years of age.</P>
      <P>The increasing frequency with which young offenders are appearing before our courts on serious charges and attracting custodial sentences is a matter of serious concern.  It was in response to this development and the resultant need to provide adequate and suitable places to accommodate such cases that the Government decided to establish the interdepartmental group to consider ways of addressing this problem.  One of the recommendations to come from that group was that additional accommodation be provided for both boys and girls to supplement existing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have taken urgent action to follow up on this recommendation and arrangements are currently being made to bring new facilities on stream.  The focus is on providing extra places for boys and girls dealt with by the courts.  Arrangements are already well advanced for the refurbishment of a major part of the former Scoil Árd Mhuire in Lusk with a view to providing an additional eight to ten places for girls on an interim basis and 36 places for boys. Some site work has commenced and steps have already been taken to recruit staff. <Col N="1158" /> The first of this additional accommodation for boys is expected to be available in September of this year.</P>
    <P>The reason accommodation for girls is on an interim basis is that a new purpose built school for 20 girls is being planned and should be completed in 1993.  The new school will be located adjacent to the existing Finglas Children's Centre. Eight of the 20 places to be provided will be for girls on remand for assessment and the remaining 12 places will provide long term accommodation.  Consultants have already been appointed to this project and the preparation of detailed plans is proceeding as a matter of urgency.  It will be appreciated that the nature and purpose of the new school will be such as to require very careful planning at all stages to ensure that the best interests of the inhabitants are served while at the same time ensuring that the special nature of the school is not undermined. The number of places, 36, being provided for boys will be further supplemented when the new centre for girls at Finglas becomes available and the girls unit at Ard Mhuire becomes vacant as a result.</P>
    <P>In regard to the security aspects of the institutions at Oberstown and Lusk, County Dublin, a detailed assessment of existing and future custodial features and requirements is being carried out at present under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  I am satisfied that satisfactory security arrangements will be in place when the school opens in September next.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can assure the House that the development of a more effective system of caring for youngsters who require secure confinement is high on the list of Government priorities.  The extra accommodation being provided at Lusk and the recent assignment to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Christ Flood, of co-ordinating the efforts of the Departments most involved in this area, namely, Education, Health and Justice, are clear indications of the Government's commitment to tackle this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise, once again, tonight to speak about the free port in Cork which had a long and difficult birth and which is now dying an infant death because of the failure of the Government to provide tax incentives and a marketing budget to ensure that the free port is marketed worldwide.  At the last count only four industries remained in the area. Indeed, one industry, tragically, went to the wall just one week ago.</P>
      <P>This matter must be viewed against the background of a 10.4 per cent increase in unemployment in Cork city and the Cork area during the last 12 months &mdash; a frightening increase &mdash; and the provision of £50 million of taxpayers' money for the free port at Ringaskiddy.  I believe that the free port has no resources and is a lame duck.  It is also one of the best kept secrets in Europe given that foreign agencies and industries do not seem to be aware of its existence.  Furthermore, it cannot compete with the Shannon Free Zone or the Dublin financial services centre as companies in the free port area do not qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  I believe that the free port authority should not tolerate this charade and should put it up to the Minister to provide tax incentives and make the resources that it requires to market the port abroad available, or resign.  The members are frustrated and disillusioned and we have now reached the point where it is either make or break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister is going to say that the local authorities, the Industrial Development Authority, Cork County Council and Cork Corporation provide a marketing budget, but these bodies cannot finance themselves at this time.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister <Col N="1160" /> that he should either provide tax incentives and fund the port or else do the charitable thing and disband the authority, as the free port represents a sop to the Cork area where there is a high rate of unemployment.</P>

      <P>The promotion of Cork harbour and of Cork as an industrial location are, in the first instance, matters for the Cork Harbour Commissioners and the Industrial Development Authority.  The following are the facilities available at the free port: State infrastructural services, including water, effluent and drainage systems, natural gas, electricity, roads, airport and telecommunications; skilled labour; social and recreational amenities.  The free port confers specific tax advantages on qualifying companies within the area. The tax regime at the free port is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The ongoing costs involved in marketing and promoting the free port are met by the Industrial Development Authority, Cork Harbour Commissioners and local interests.  The marketing strategy is that Cork Harbour Commissioners market the portal facilities for the normal trade and traffic activities of the ferry and the deep water terminals, and the IDA have primary responsibility for the attraction of port-related industries to the free port.  Ringaskiddy free port is being vigorously promoted and marketed.  This is evidenced by the fact that in 1989-90 site visits to Ringaskiddy were undertaken by a total of 65 companies.  Regrettably, to date, as the Deputy said, there are only four companies and one subsidiary company operating in the free port.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Sectoral Development Committee which was established in 1981 and the various Sectoral Consultative Committees that have been established from time to time by the SDC to assist in the preparation of particular reports.  My Department have been represented on the Sectoral Development Committee since 1981 and responsibility for the committee was transferred to my Department in April 1989.  The Sectoral Development Committee normally meets on a monthly basis and their most recent meeting was held on 22 April 1991.  My Department were represented at that meeting.  The last meeting of a sectoral consultative committee was that of the Sectoral Consultative Committee for the bread industry which was held in early 1990.  This committee were under the chairmanship of an officer from the Department of Agriculture who have responsibility for the food industry.  My Department were not represented on this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sectoral Development Committee were a tripartite committee representative of employer associations, trade unions, Government Departments and State agencies, but now with an independent chairman, have had the role of evaluating and making recommendations on sectoral issues.  The committee published 12 reports between 1983 and 1986 and while they were comparatively inactive <Col N="977" /> between 1986 and 1989, a further two reports were published in 1990 with a further two subsequently completed and currently awaiting publication.  As a tripartite committee representative of the social partners the SDC have been able to make a useful contribution towards a consensus approach in addressing issues of a sectoral nature including those adverted to by the NESC.  To a degree the work of the SDC may in recent years have paralleled that of the NESC and the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> These bodies largely shared common membership with that of the SDC.</P>
    <P>The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which has recently been agreed with the social partners, provides for the establishment of an industrial policy forum involving the social partners and relevant Government Departments to examine industrial policy issues such as those adverted to by the NESC, including the implementation of measures for indigenous industries and the achievement of the maximum return from the industry budget.  Detailed arrangements for the operation of the forum and whether the more relevant functions of the SDC might better be continued within that forum are currently under consideration.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that the review of industrial performance drew attention to the increasing use of equity by the IDA in assisting companies. Measures are being adopted whereby up to 50 per cent of financial supports from IDA to medium/large indigenous industry will be in the form of equity or other remunerating forms of aid.  There has also been an improved flow of equity into Irish industry through the business expansion scheme, private venture capital, the smaller companies market, and the Irish Stock Exchange generally. These factors lessen the justification for a separate State agency mandated to promote equity investment, particularly given the scope for further rationalisation of the industrial development agencies identified in the review.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, it has been decided that the activities of NADCORP should be amalgamated with those of the IDA. This is considered to be the best method of providing a more cohesive and integrated approach to State equity investment in enterprise.  The Government will maintain and intensify the current practice whereby IDA takes equity in industry, and will continue to support projects which add to commercially viable jobs and manufacturing activity in Ireland.  IDA's strategic use of equity, grants and industry knowledge to provide a tailored package of support for long term development can be a very useful tool leading to the development of strong internationally competitive Irish based companies and consequent employment growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be emphasised, however, that the role of the private sector is and will remain central to the development of industry and it must play the leading part in the provision of equity investment in Irish industry.  The State's involvement <Col N="979" /> in this task will always be peripheral at most.</P>

      <P>In providing data on claims and claims costs insurers are not required to differentiate between third party, third party fire and theft and comprehensive claims.  Consequently, it is not possible from the data available to my Department to separate third party claims from comprehensive claims.</P>

An additional premium is charged, for example, for fire and theft and accidental damage cover based on the claims experience of the individual company for these optional types of cover.  There is, of course, no legal obligation on a policy-holder to effect any additional type of cover.  This is a decision solely for the individual concerned.</P>

It is not part of the Finance Act legislation.</P>
      <P>A total of nearly £6 million has been made available by the banks and 114 projects have been aided.  Approximately £0.5 million of the total has been provided through State institutions.  One of the participating banks, Bank of Ireland, recently announced they were increasing the amount of funds committed to the scheme by £2 million.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is taxable on both pensions.  The taxpayer is not entitled to exemption from tax as her income exceeds the exemption limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare pension is paid in full without deduction of tax and the taxfree allowances due are set off in priority against that pension.  The certificate of tax-free allowances which issued on 4 March 1991 reflects this fact and includes all the allowances which the taxpayer claimed.  The taxpayer is liable to PRSI at the rate of 2.25 per cent on her county <Col N="986" /> council pension.  No PRSI is deducted from her widow's pension.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 21 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> stated that a five-year development plan for the horticulture industry was under preparation which would lay the basis of the creation of 1,500 to 2,000 jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour force survey does not provide a breakdown for specific areas of agriculture.  However, it is estimated that <Col N="1016" /> approximately 9,500 people were employed in horticulture in 1987.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in the period 1987 to 1990 some 800 full-time and 600 part-time jobs were created in horticulture. This is in line with the targets set out in the An Bord Glas programme.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the cost of public liability insurance has resulted in an appreciable number of firms operating without such cover.  I understand that business firms generally consider employers and public liability insurance to be a necessity.  However, there is no statutory obligation on any firm to take out such cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of insurance, including public and employers' liability insurance, tends to reflect the claims experience of insurers. In 1987 and 1988 insurers sustained <Col N="1017" /> underwriting losses of £18 million on their liability accounts.  These losses increased to £30 million in 1989 and are expected to exceed that figure for 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 64, 65, 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the objective of policy in manufacturing industry involved creating approximately 20,000 extra jobs on average over a ten year period.</P>
      <P>This target was fully achieved over the three year period 1988-90.</P>
      <P>The programme identified a number of specific sub-sectors which had potential for developing job opportunities in manufacturing.  Indications were given of possible job targets which could be attained, some over a five to eight year period. These targets were based on various assumptions which were of course subject to the normal fluctuations of a market economy and could only be regarded as being indicative in nature.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this qualification, progress has been achieved in regard to the specific sectors identified in the programme.  In the tool-making area, the targetted growth was spread over a five to eight year period and there has been steady growth which is likely to continue over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regard automotive components, <Col N="1019" /> strenuous efforts have been made over the past four years to impress upon Japanese manufacturers the need to invest both directly and indirectly in Ireland through the establishment of manufacturing operations and through purchasing Irish made auto components.  We will continue to pursue all possible means to bring this about.  Job creation in this sector has been buoyant and the target of 3,000 is within reach.</P>
    <P>The electronics industry have also experienced positive growth and the targets of the programme are being achieved.  Certain pressures caused by the war in the Gulf and a shake out in the mini-computer sector are now being felt in this industry but it is hoped that these will not appreciably affect job creation potential.</P>
    <P>The target for the clothing industry of 3,500 has been more than achieved while job creation in the crafts product sectors continues to show a positive trend.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme is targeted at long term unemployed persons who are at least 25 years of age.  The current level of payment on the scheme to a person without any dependant is £69 per week while the corresponding unemployment payment to a long term unemployed person is £52 per week.  The SES payment rates are pitched higher <Col N="1020" /> than the level of social welfare unemployment payments to compensate for the loss of certain social welfare benefits to which participants would be entitled had they remained on the live register.  The scheme is part-time and participants may engage in other activities while not involved in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to extend the scheme to persons under 25 years of age as this could only be done at the expense of those whom the scheme was designed to assist.  I have already advised the House that I intend to carry out a review of the allowances payable under the scheme later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £500,000 has been included in my Department's Vote for 1991 for the <Col N="1021" /> payment of grants to voluntary organisations providing services for emigrants in Britain.</P>
      <P>In 1989, when it became evident that there was an increase in the numbers going abroad, the allocation for grant assistance was doubled, from £250,000 in 1988 to £500,000.  The figure was maintained at that level in 1990 even though net outward migration in the year to April 1990, had declined by 15,000.  The indications since then suggest that the figure for the year ending April 1991 and for the remainder of the year will show a further significant decline.</P>
      <P>Despite the very difficult Exchequer situation, I am satisfied that the Government have demonstrated their concern for the welfare of emigrants by maintaining the allocation for grant assistance at £500,000 for the third successive year, bearing in mind that the level of net emigration will have declined to around half of what it was two years ago.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that DÍON, the advisory committee on emigrant welfare services, who make recommendations to me on the allocation of State assistance, will also bear the changing circumstances in mind in determining their priorities for grant assistance this year.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to stress, once again, the vital importance of adequate advance preparation by intending emigrants so as to minimise the risk of encountering subsequent difficulties abroad.  FÁS provide a pre-departure advice and information service which should be made use of. Young persons going to London, in particular, should ensure that they have accommodation and employment arranged beforehand.</P>
      <P>My advice to those who do not have the educational qualifications skills or financial and other resources which would ensure a reasonable chance of success, is that they should not emigrate.</P>

      <P>In assessing means under the lone parents allowance scheme earnings of the lone parent of up to £312 per annum for each dependent child are disregarded. This earnings disregard was fixed in 1982 and its present equivalent would be about £9 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the earnings disregard, allowance is also made for expenses related to employment which the lone parent may have, such as child-minding <Col N="1023" /> expenses and travel costs.  Furthermore, there is a general means disregard of £6 a week which applies to pension schemes generally.</P>
    <P>The question of changes in the level of the earnings disregards would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context. I am examining ways in which lone parents who wish to take up employment would be encouraged to do so and the question of the earnings disregard will be relevant in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant progress has been made over the last few years to improve the position of families through increases in the basic rates of payments.  This has included substantial increases in child dependant payments together with increases in child benefit.  In the 1991 budget, the main improvements in child related payments were: an increase in the minimum child dependant rate to £12 per week representing an increase of 9 per cent, and streamlining to three rates; the payment of the higher child benefit of £22.90 in respect of the fourth child onwards, which represents an annual increase of over £85 for families of at least four children and improvements in the family income supplement scheme including an increase in the income limits and the removals of the limitation on the level of payment.  This latter improvement will be of significant help to low earners.</P>
      <P>In addition, the child-related tax exemption scheme, with effect from 6 April 1991, provides for a child tax exemption of £300 for the first and second child in a family, and £500 for third and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to single parent families in particular, the lone parent's allowance scheme was introduced in November <Col N="1024" /> 1990.  This new allowance, for the first time, provides a special means-tested social welfare payment for lone parents such as separated spouses, unmarried fathers and prisoners' husbands.  Higher child dependants allowances are paid in respect of the children of lone parents both through this new scheme and through the existing insurance schemes for lone parents.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government intends to provide the level of resources necessary to implement the additional child income support measures recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, some £69 million in 1990 terms, over the ten year period of the programme.  The particular measures taken will be decided in the light of up to date information on child and family circumstances and in the light of available resources.  In this context the structure of all child-related payments, including child benefit, will be examined taking account of the issue raised in the Deputy's question.</P>

Last year I announced a special concession whereby recipients of the free electricity allowance, the natural <Col N="1025" /> gas allowance and the free television licence who are over 80 years of age would continue to receive them where other people who would normally disqualify them from receiving the allowance came to live with them.  Further changes in the conditions for entitlement to these allowances would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    <P>The number of gardaí assigned to individual stations is not fixed and the Garda authorities adjust station strengths on an on-going basis having regard to available resources, local circumstances and other demands on Garda services.  They inform me that the current overall strength assigned to stations in County Westmeath, which includes two additional sergeants assigned to Mullingar station today, is the maximum that can be provided there at present but that the situation is being kept under continuing review.</P>
    <P>As regards measures to deal with crime in provincial towns, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos.20 and 72 on 27 November 1990 in which I indicated that each garda divisional officer has prepared a programme of measures to address crime in his division. These programmes are currently being implemented and I am confident that the approaches being adopted to meet the varying needs of individual divisions will make a very significant contribution to tackling crime.</P>

      <P>Motor cycles with an engine capacity not exceeding 125 cubic centimetres, motor cycles of 125 cubic centimetres and upwards, cars, minibuses, and articulated trucks are in separate driver licensing categories and a person must pass a separate driving test to qualify for a licence to drive vehicles in each category.  Furthermore, a person seeking a provisional licence to drive a minibus must already hold a licence to drive a car; a person seeking a provisional licence to drive an articulated truck must already hold a licence to drive a drawing vehicle, and a person seeking a provisional licence to drive a motor cycle of over 125 cc engine capacity must already have held a licence to drive a lower powered cycle for at least two years.</P>
      <P>These are all requirements made in the interests of road safety.  I see no anomalies in these requirements and I do not propose to make any changes in the driver licensing regulations which make them mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person visiting this country from <Col N="1033" /> abroad may drive for up to 12 months on the basis of a licence issued in another country and licences issued by member states of the European Community and Japan, may be exchanged for Irish licences. I am reviewing the position in relation to other countries.</P>

      <P>Since 1988, local authorities, in conjunction with the farm development service of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the regional fisheries boards, have conducted extensive surveys on farms with a view to identifying water pollution risks and ensuring that preventive measures are taken.  Substantial grant assistance has been made available to farmers for the provision of slurry and silage effluent storage tanks, animal housing and fodder storage under the operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution and the farm improvement programme&mdash;both administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>While the costs of preventing water pollution by slurry have not been quantified, overall expenditure under the operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution is estimated at some £190 million over the period 1989 to 1993.</P>

      <P>Waiting lists are a feature of all health systems throughout the world and this will continue given the infinite demands which will be made on finite resources. The success of new techniques and forms of treatment which has improved the quality of life for many patients has, however, led to increasing demands being placed on the health services with a consequent effect on waiting lists and waiting times.  I have placed great emphasis on tackling waiting lists over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Certain areas were, however, identified as requiring special attention.  The Deputy will be aware of my concern about the problems which had arisen in the provision of cardiac surgery, ear, nose and throat procedures, cataract and hip replacement operations and will also be aware that additional funds were made available in 1989 and 1990 to reduce waiting times in these areas.  The effects of the additional funding were clearly seen towards the end of 1989 and throughout 1990.</P>

    <P>The waiting list figures are approximate.</P>
    <P>*1990 throughput was lower than 1989 because of the change in medical practice at the Mater Hospital.  Activity there has now been restored to 1989 levels i.e. a target for annual activity of 900 procedures.</P>
    <P>My Department are in active consultation with health agencies regarding their service plans and priorities for 1991. As these discussions have not yet been finalised, I am not in a position to indicate the exact projected throughput of patients this year in the areas mentioned by the Deputy.  I would point out, however, that waiting lists for hip replacement operations have decreased by 16 per cent since April 1990.  Waiting lists for ear, nose and throat surgery generally have decreased by over 9 per cent.  Waiting lists for cataract operations have decreased by more than 12 per cent since 1989. With regard to cardiac surgery, special funds were provided for the provision of ten additional cardiac beds at the Mater Hospital, Dublin which, I have been informed by the hospital, came into operation on 2 April 1991.</P>
    <P>Two additional posts of consultant neurosurgeon for Beaumont Hospital have been advertised recently.  The appointment of these consultants will enable the hospital to further increase its throughput of patients.  I am confident that the progress which is being achieved in these areas will be continued in 1991.</P>

As a result of that review, I have decided to allow boards of management of community and comprehensive schools to make permanent appointments in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it will now be open to the board of management of a community or comprehensive school, having due regard to the enrolment trends and curricular requirements of the school, to make permanent appointments to the teaching staff where such are warranted by reference to the ordinary junior and senior cycle enrolments and where such appointments can be accommodated within the normal staffing allocation.</P>

His application was referred to the Army Pensions Board, which is the statutory body appointed under those Acts to report on such applications.  The board reported that the applicant did not satisfy the conditions for the award of a disability pension in that his disablements were not due to a wound, an injury or a disease attributable to his service in the Permanent Defence Force.
