      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12 and 5.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House and notwithstanding the Order of the House of 14 May that: (1) business shall be interrupted at 11 p.m. tonight; (2) No. 5 shall be taken from 5.45 p.m. to 8 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (a) the opening speech of the Minister for Agriculture and Food shall not exceed 30 minutes, (b) each of the groups &mdash; as defined in Standing Order 89 &mdash; shall be entitled to not more than 30 minutes in the aggregate in the course of the debate, (c) the Minister for Agriculture and Food shall be called on not later than 7.45 p.m. to reply to the debate and (d) if a division is demanded thereon such division shall be postponed until 8.30 p.m. tonight and (3) Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 24, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to create a row this morning or to go over old ground &mdash; I did not participate in the row yesterday &mdash; however, I want to <Col N="1046" /> raise the point that an hour and a half was lost yesterday on the Local Government Bill and an hour and a quarter will be lost tonight.  Could the Taoiseach, through the Whips, arrange to have that time restored, because yesterday we only reached amendment No. 5 out of 298 amendments?  I am just asking that at least the time that was originally allocated be restored.  Perhaps the Whips would discuss this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will observe that as a gesture and in an attempt to meet that point, the Government have allocated an extra half an hour this evening.  We were due to rise at 10.30 p.m.  In fact we are adding another half an hour for the Local Government Bill.</P>

      <P>On the same issue, the Opposition spokespersons should be enabled to deal with the Bill in an orderly way.  If Committee Stage will not be concluded until 11 p.m. tonight and Report Stage is to be commenced at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow, it is a bit unreasonable for the Government to expect us to resubmit our Report Stage amendments and have some analysis between 11 o'clock tonight and 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.  Perhaps the Whips could meet to discuss the practicality of trying to deal with a Bill in this impossible fashion.</P>

Is the phrase &ldquo;each of the groups &mdash; as defined in Standing Order 89 &mdash;&rdquo; intended to specifically <Col N="1047" /> exclude the Progressive Democrats from contributing to this debate?

At the same time the Government representatives are negotiating on behalf of this Republic far reaching changes in relation to economic and monetary union and political union within the EC. Because of that, and for no other reason, will the Taoiseach at some stage indicate to this House when we will have a properly constituted foreign affairs committee that will allow this House to do its business?

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1991: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 5a:</P>
    <P>In page 7, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Oireachtas shall enact such further Acts as are necessary for the general purposes or for any particular purpose of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Dukes.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening before I reported progress I had made comments on the Minister's reply to what I said in moving my amendment and to comments made by other Deputies on this side of the House.  I would like to repeat that I found the Minister's reply to be absolutely, utterly and indomitably bureaucratic. The purpose of my amendment is to clarify in this important matter of reform of local government what the function and purpose is of primary legislation in this area and to clarify the distinction, where the borderline should be, between primary legislation and what the Minister chooses to call subsidiary legislation. I am very concerned with clarifying that boundary because what we have before us is primary legislation which gives us only a bare outline of one stage of the kind of reform the Minister claims he has in mind but it is backed up by an enormous potential volume of subsidiary legislation which is where the Minister's real intentions will be given a force.  This is an undemocratic method of bringing these matters before the House and a method which will not allow this House to legislate in the full knowledge of the facts and of what it is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill strikes entirely the wrong balance between primary legislation and subsidiary legislation.  It provides for a <Col N="1052" /> very cosmetic transfer of powers from the Government to local authorities and takes back most of those powers under the provisions of section 3 and the orders and regulations the Minister may make under the provisions of that section.  I hasten to add that clearly I am not the only one who is worried about this.  Those worries are shared on all the Opposition benches in this House and by no less a person &mdash; I hope I am in order in quoting his name in this House because he went public a couple of days ago &mdash; than Mr. Dick Haslam, the former county manager of Limerick County Council and, much more important, a member of the expert advisory group the Government set up to make proposals on local government reform.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cares to re-read &mdash; if he has read it in the first place &mdash; the article by Mr. Haslam in <i>The Irish Times</i> a couple of days ago he will see there exactly the same concern as I have expressed about the balance struck in this Bill between primary legislation and this form of subsidiary legislation which, as I said, is all very fine in its place but is not the proper instrument for bringing about reform of local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is straying very far from his amendment, No. 5a.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with that.  My amendment is to the effect that we should have primary legislation instead of the kind of subsidiary legislation provided for in section 3.  I think, Sir, in making that case I am entitled to say why I believe primary legislation is the proper way of going about the action set out before us in this Bill.  If this amendment is accepted &mdash; and I hope it will be &mdash; it will require consequential amendment to 13 sections.  I have already recited what they are and I want to give you notice of my intention, to ensure that there will be no misunderstanding when we come to Report Stage, that this amendment, if it is not accepted, and those consequential amendments to the 13 other sections &mdash; which I hope we <Col N="1053" /> will be able to discuss during Committee Stage &mdash; will be repeated on Report Stage because this is the central issue of principle and importance in the Bill.  Those amendments would be intended to focus on the correct balance between primary and subsidiary legislation in this matter.</P>
      <P>It is absurd for the Minister to claim, as he did last night, that my proposal would lead to the business on the Order Paper of this House being clogged up with an unending series of administrative details; nothing could be further from the truth.  What I want to do is to make sure that we have one proper piece of primary legislation so that this House does not have to keep coming back again and again to all the fiddly details that the Minister wants to bring before us.  The Minister promises us that he will have before us an unending stream of orders and regulations which he hopes will be passed on the nod or passed under the 21-day rule. It is the Minister who wants to clog up the Order Paper of this House with all of these statutory instruments and other measures.  What I want and what my amendment seeks to bring about is that we would have adequate, clear well-defined primary legislation and this House would know exactly what it was doing.  The Minister is getting it wrong in both ways.</P>
      <P>The orders and regulations he proposes, which cannot be amended by this House &mdash; they can only be accepted or rejected &mdash; are not the appropriate way to do the important business in sections 9, 12, 24, 31, 33, 40, 41 and 43.  Why?  It is simply because primary legislation is the proper way to deal with those issues of weight and substance and not a raft of orders or separate regulations or even a raft of separate Bills.  All those matters should be dealt with in this Bill which is before the House.  Equally, such orders and regulations are not appropriate for section 47.  That is more appropriately a matter for primary legislation and for the Bill before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As another example of the kind of interference the Minister is proposing to operate under the provisions of this Bill I draw the attention of the House to <Col N="1054" /> sections 46 and 49.  These are two areas in which the Minister can give directions. He can give directions whether, and to what extent, local authorities can confer honours or bestow gifts on distinguished persons who come to visit them.  The Minister for the Environment will have the power to give directions &mdash; if I may take one example &mdash; to the Newbridge Town Commissioners if they want to give the President a marble clock when she comes to visit the town.  The Minister for the Environment can give directions to the Castlebar Urban District Council, of which I have been a guest, if they want to give an illuminated scroll to me &mdash; as they have done &mdash; to commemorate my visit.  That is not the business of the Minister for the Environment and that is not why he is paid a ministerial salary to sit down in the Custom House and legislate. He should not be involved in those things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is proposing to grant powers to himself under the provisions of this Bill to do just that.  I cannot for the life of me see the slightest reason why he should have that power, nor can I see any reason why the Minister should have any power in deciding expenses for members of local authorities who represent their local authorities at conferences or anything else.</P>

      <P>I happen to support Deputy Dukes's amendment.  I think he spoke for almost an hour last night in proposing the amendment.  Having regard to the fact that there are a very large number of amendments and that a number of Members are anxious to contribute, I suggest that he is now repeating substantially the contribution he made last night.  Having regard to the limited amount of time available to us I <Col N="1055" /> am concerned about the degree of repetition in Deputy Dukes's contribution.</P>

      <P>The Chair does share, to a large extent, the view of the Deputy in that this is a limited debate and there has been an element of repetition. Speeches are, perhaps, overlong and tend to be more appropriate to a Second Stage debate than Committee Stage.  I have adverted already to the desirability of confining remarks to the amendments under discussion rather than ranging over the whole Bill as is the tendency.  I hope regard will be had to the atmosphere in which are seeking to operate and that strict regard will be had to the amendments before us.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being given powers to interfere and to get his finger through every aspect of local authority activity.  I will reply to the nonsensical claims the Minister made last night against the proposal I have made and which, I gather, has the support of The Workers' Party and the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister alleged last night that in putting forward this amendment I had suffered in some way a change of heart compared to the time I was in Government. He read out the numbers of various statutory instruments that had been <Col N="1056" /> passed during that time.  I have been very clear on that issue.  Ever since I entered this House I have been of the strong view that orders and regulations of the kind the Minister is proposing here are not suitable ways to bringing about the effect we seek to achieve with primary legislation. I would be happy to sit down with the Minister and look through the hundreds that have been passed and tell him which of them are not appropriate and were not appropriate at the time. I have argued against the use of that instrument while in Government and in Opposition.  I will take no lessons from the Minister for the Environment about that issue because on no occasion did he or his party colleagues ever exercise themselves to look at what is the proper dividing line between primary legislation and subsidiary legislation.  The balance between those two is what is at issue in the section and in the amendment before us.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  If he does we will then have to proceed to amend the other sections to which I have referred and we will have done a good day's work for the proper definition of primary legislation.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment, then he is telling this House that he is opposed to real democracy, to any real independent functions for local authorities, and he is actually against giving any reality back to local government.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to the debate last night on the distinction between secondary legislation and primary legislation.  It is not a new debate.  The arguments which were put forward by Deputy Dukes, interesting though they were, were hardly novel because many of those arguments were put forward in the twenties when the new despotism, the whole issue of secondary legislation, was a very lively debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out last night there were no fewer than 1,130 statutory instruments or regulations of one form or another, pressed through in three years while Deputy Dukes was in <Col N="1057" /> Government.  No doubt it will be of interest to historians to note that Deputy Dukes was opposed, perhaps vehemently, to some of them but it is obvious, because they were put through, that his opposition and his arguments in principle did not cut ice with his colleagues at that time.  The arguments mustered by Deputy Dukes today and at excessive length last night, cut no ice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, however, deal very briefly with the proposition Deputy Dukes has put forward.  It is clear that there is a balance to be struck between primary and secondary legislation and it is clear that on occasions that balance is not properly struck.  The only practical way this or any other Minister for the Environment can deal with the very substantial problem of off-loading and devolving certain activities and functions <Col N="1058" /> from the centre, where they have been gathering over the years the State has been in existence, to local authority level is by order.  It is not practical to suggest that every one of those items should be the issue of primary legislation, and I am sure that is also Deputy Dukes's belief. Just because Deputy Dukes raised a number of hares during his speech, it is hardly rational to suggest that the later sections he instanced will be used by this or any other Minister to say whether the scroll which is presented to Deputy Dukes or any other visiting dignatory by a town commissioner or urban district council will be of one form or another</P>

He seems to wish to portray elements of this Bill in a perverse light.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to focus exclusively on the issues before us to avoid any extraneous matters and certainly any personal comment.  We covered a lot of ground last night and I just want to restate the case.  We are discussing three amendments in my name together with amendment No. 5a in the name of Deputy Dukes.  Basically there are three options in relation to the enactment of regulations that are consequent to this legislative provision.  The Minister was good enough last night to acknowledge my consistency in any legislation that comes before this House in trying as far as possible to have the greatest degree of scrutiny of legislative provisions by the Members of this House.  It is totally undemocratic and wrong for the bulk of important and substantial policy issues to be decided primarily by civil servants and Ministers outside the scrutiny of this <Col N="1061" /> House.  In the series of amendments I put down, some of which are being taken now, I am seeking that the consequent regulations would have to come before this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister started off by being kind in acknowledging my consistency but then did his best to rubbish the proposal. The methodology used to do so was that it would be too burdensome &mdash; that is one of the phrases the Minister used last night &mdash; on the Legislature to have this onerous task of having to positively pass regulations of substance in relation to local government.  Another phrase used by the Minister last night was that it would clutter up the Dáil programme.</P>
      <P>Being a party Whip, I have had an advantage over the Minister when it comes to setting the time-table of business of this House in recent years.  On Thursday of each week we set out the legislative programme and other matters to be discussed in this House.  Quite often regulations go through by agreement without debate.  They are formally moved in a matter of seconds at the commencement of business but they have to be drawn to the attention of the Whips on the previous Thursday and the spokesmen have a chance to look at them to see if there is anything of substance that requires debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the mechanism I am seeking here.  There would be no cluttering of the Dáil programme.  It is surely not beyond the wit of this House to establish a monitoring committee of statutory instruments. My fear &mdash; it is a very genuine fear &mdash; is that increasingly the volume of real legislation carried out by this House is diminishing and the volume of real and all-encompassing legislation being undertaken by civil servants and Ministers is increasing.  What we want to do is bring back power to this House, and nothing would be more appropriate in a Bill that deals with local democracy and local government.  If we are to have democracy extended and the notion of empowering and devolving powers to local communities, surely it is out of synchronisation and at odds with the notion of <Col N="1062" /> diminishing the power of this House as a national assembly.</P>
    <P>Three mechanisms were put forward, one by Deputy Dukes which would require primary legislation &mdash; and for a great deal of the subsequent regulations required by this Bill it is a good idea &mdash; the second mechanism, which I have consistently endorsed, is the requirement to have a positive vote or the assent of this House to regulations or orders; the third, minimalist, mechanism, the one supported by the Minister, is, by and large, to have the power vested in the Minister with only the power to annul vested in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister in making the case last night repeatedly asked how many times annulling orders had come before the House and accused me of never having brought forward an annulling order.  I corrected him by instancing two cases in which, when I was spokesman on Health, I brought in annulling orders in relation to charges for in-patient and out-patient services.  However, it is, I agree, an exception because the vast bulk of statutory instruments are consequent on legislation agreed in principle by this House. We should have a monitoring role and I am increasingly of the view that as we enact more and more enabling provisions and devolve more and more authority to civil servants and Ministers outside the scrutiny of this House, we diminish our own democratic controls and indeed democracy itself.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly comment on the specifics of my amendments.  Amendment No. 6 simply requires the Minister in subsection (1) to insert &ldquo;subject to subsection 4&rdquo;.  It is a very powerful sentence which gives very wide and sweeping powers to the Minister to delineate and delimit his powers to some degree by making them subject to a new subsection which I propose in amendment No. 13, that the positive assent of this House would be required in regard to legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7, in my name, seeks to remove one phrase from the sentence and, if accepted, would mean that the Minister may make regulations for any <Col N="1063" /> particular purposes of this Act and to remove the power from the Minister to make regulations for the general purpose of the Act.  The Minister did not address this last night and perhaps he will do so today.  Why does he need powers to make regulations for the general purposes of the Act?  His response, when questions like this are posed, is to say that it has always been done this way.  I have every legislative provision since 1800 here but the fact that it was done in the past does not make it a good way to make progress today.</P>
    <P>I am fearful of giving power to the Minister to make regulations, as he sees fit, for the general purposes of this Act because it means, in essence, giving power to the Minister to make any regulations as he sees fit in relation to any aspect of local government.  If that is not the case, perhaps the Minister will set the record straight.  The Minister should have the power, subject to the new subsection I wish to include, to make regulations but he should not have the power to make them on a sweeping basis on any related matter in local government.  In essence the case has been well made and we should make a decision on this fundamental principle before we get to the meat of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous speaker, when I say I will be brief I intend to be brief.  The amendments to this section get to the core of a fundamental issue which goes way beyond the scope of this Bill, which has been taken under a guillotine motion of the Government. Unilaterally, the Government have suspended Standing Orders, which is fundamentally wrong, because Standing Orders are the constitution of the House to protect its Members and they should not be put aside by the vote of one side of the House.  The practice has grown because Standing Orders have been set aside by agreement of both sides of the House but now it is by the vote of one side.  I am not saying it is without precedent but it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, there are many <Col N="1064" /> precedents for providing for secondary legislation by either regulation or order. The Minister is correct in saying that some regulations or orders must have a positive vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas and that there are other types of orders &mdash; passive orders &mdash; which do not require a positive vote of both sides of the House.  However, even if an annulling motion is put down, it does not have to be taken unless the Government order it.</P>
    <P>In section 3 of the Bill the extent of the regulations, orders, directions and prescriptions which the Minister takes on himself are quite astounding; they go beyond any Bill I can recall and give the Minister extraordinary powers.  This House is not being given an opportunity to scrutinise and to properly examine the possible implications of all these sections, orders and regulations.  Even under the guillotine, we will never have an opportunity to discuss most of the regulations and orders made by the Minister.  We are probably not creating any precedents but we are certainly pushing out the frontiers, which is dangerous.  In calmer moments, away from the heat of debate on any issue, this matter should be looked at in the interest of protecting democracy in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the Minister's reply last night to this amendment. The section with which we are dealing gives general power to the Minister to make regulations for the general purposes &mdash; or any particular purpose &mdash; in relation to this legislation.  It is, as has been said, a very extensive power which the Minister is asking the Oireachtas to give him.  The Minister's defence was that if we denied him section 3 he would be left naked before the whole system of local government, unable to make regulations about important matters like councillors' expenses, the allowances for chairmen of councils and matters relating to the twinning of local authorities.  Of course that is typical of the kind of disingenuous and dishonest contribution which the Minister regularly makes in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of councillors' expenses <Col N="1065" /> and entertainment expenses in respect of a council is covered in section 46 (3) where the Minister gives himself specific powers to make regulations in this regard.  On the question of the expenses and allowances for chairpersons of local authorities described by the Minister as chairmen, under section 42 (4) the Minister has specific powers to make regulations governing those matters.  Therefore, he does not need section 3 for that.</P>
    <P>On the question of reserved functions, the Minister under section 41 (2), has given himself specific power in relation to these functions so he does not need section 3 for that either.  On the question of the establishment of regional authorities he is giving himself specific power under section 43 (1) to make regulations regarding the regional authority.  In regard to twinning he gives himself the power to make regulations under section 49 (4); on the tenure of office of managers he has given himself the power to make regulations under section 47 (1) (a) and (b).  On the composition of local authority committees, he has given himself the power to make regulations under section 40 (1) and on the question of boundary alterations he has given himself the power to make regulations under sections 31 and 34.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us yesterday that he intends to introduce further legislation to reorganise local government in Dublin.  The question I want to ask him, therefore, is a very simple one and that is, having given himself specific powers to make regulations in relation to a whole range of matters covered by the Bill why does he need section 3?  Furthermore, what additional regulations does he propose to make under that section for which provision has not already been made in the individual sections of the Bill dealing with important matters such as councillors' expenses and the twinning of local authorities?</P>
    <P>That is a question which the Minister must address.  I ask him to state if he envisages a need to make regulations which would require the House to give him the wide-ranging powers contained <Col N="1066" /> in section 3.  I suspect that what he has in mind is a provision which would allow him, where a local authority adopt a particular position in representing the interests of the local community and he does not like what they are doing to make regulations to limit their powers.  I also suspect that he has in mind a provision which would allow him, where a local authority take the initiative in the provision of services or want to enter a joint venture with a company to build a leisure centre and he does not like what they are doing, to make regulations to prevent them from doing so.  I fail to see why the Minister needs to include section 3 and I would ask him to state if he envisages a need to make regulations under that section.</P>
    <P>I am fearful that instead of this Bill devolving power to local authorities or giving them greater autonomy it will provide the Minister for the Environment with a long lead on the local authorities with the result that each time they become wayward, as he sees it, he will be able to check them.  Certainly in terms of its concept, section 3 has been lifted directly from the legislation introduced in Britain by the Thatcher Government to control the local authorities in Britain. This is a Thatcherite approach to local government.  This is what they did to the Greater London Council and local authorities in Britain when they did not like the initiatives being taken by them and when they wanted to impose the centralised control so dear to the then Prime Minister.  This is the kind of legislation that they introduced which gave the Department of the Environment rigid control over the activities and initiatives of the local authorities.  Unfortunately, our Minister seems to be locked into that approach and that is the reason section 3 is being included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have listened to all the criticisms made of the section during the course of the debate on the amendments tabled by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Dukes and I would have to agree with speakers on this side of the House and acknowledge that this section, which the <Col N="1067" /> Deputies are seeking to amend, is the one which will ensure that the dead hand of the Minister will control everything that happens in local authorities throughout the length and breadth of the country. I do not wish to provoke Deputy Gilmore as I agree with the arguments he has made but I listened with some wry amusement, nevertheless, to the comments made by him this morning.  If we can sum up the intent of the Bill, it seems that the Bill makes provision for the so-called system of democratic centralism which The Workers' Party advocated for so many years, a system of democratic centralism which the Fianna Fáil Party have now apparently adopted at a time when it is being abandoned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is clear that the Minister for the Environment intends to follow that well-trodden path.  The amendments proposed by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Dukes are very serious ones because there is a fatal flaw in the Bill.  In effect, what the Minister is doing is, as it were, creating a skeleton and leaving it to him and his Department to flesh out and shape that skeleton in whatever way he deems appropriate by way of regulation. Rather than this legislation marking a return to local democracy it is copperfastening the controls which the Minister for the Environment of the day, be it this Minister or any future Minister, will be able to exercise over the local authorities.  The Minister should not have the power, without a vote of this House as envisaged by the amendments, to amend the legislation or to flesh out specific parts of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House unduly but I want to refer to two of the powers the Minister will be able to exercise which I regard as extraordinary. It is not stated in the Bill what powers will be devolved from central Government to local government.  One of the essential planks of the report of the committee on local government was that there be an extensive devolution of powers from central Government to local government. The Minister will have the power to <Col N="1069" /> devolve whatever functions he sees fit. Indeed, nobody knows if functions will be devolved from his own Department, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, the Department of the Marine, the Department of Justice or any other Department.  The Minister has not enlightened us to any great extent about what powers will be transferred. Neither do we know if his colleagues in other Departments will resist this move, nor, for that matter, do we know if they will resist the transfer of powers or whether Deputy Harney or the Progressive Democrats and Deputy Connolly and Deputy Flynn of the Fianna Fáil Party within the Department of the Environment are <i>ad idem</i> and in harmony on the question of what powers should be devolved.</P>
    <P>Not only do we not know what powers will be devolved but it appears that if the Minister does devolve a power and he does not like the way the local authority are independently exercising that power he will be able to bring it back to himself by way of a statutory instrument without a discussion having to take place in this House.  That is the exact antithesis of local democracy.  What is even more insidious is that the Government will be able to exercise control over the various powers of the local authorities.  It may be a good idea that a city or county manager be appointed for a specified term of office but it is not a good idea in the context of the Minister having the power to decide whether to renew the appointment.  That means that local authorities are not only going to be the play things of the Minister for the Environment with no real political independence but that the city and county managers are going to be the play things of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>What city or county manager who is on a specified term contract and is dependent on the Minister of the day to renew his contract, is going to do battle with the Minister on behalf of his local authority to get essential funds for a project that the local representatives believe should be brought forward but which the Department are resisting?  That city or county manager will know that his future <Col N="1070" /> job prospect will depend on how meek and co-operative he is with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The ultimate irony in this Bill, and in the inter-action between the Minister's powers to make statutory orders and effect the future framework of local government, is the inter-action between this section and section 43, which deals with the establishment of local or regional development authorities.  The Minister may or may not establish regional authorities under the Bill.  We know the Minister is confused about the need for regional authorities because he is now reversing a policy he implemented four years ago, or at least on the face of it it appears so which was widely regarded as wrong and inimical not only to local government but to the economic wellbeing of this country.  This is the Minister who abolished the regional development organisations.</P>
    <P>At a time when the European Community was pressing for greater local democracy and for a greater local and regional contribution in the use of structural funds, this Minister wiped out the regional development organisations. Subsequently the Minister had to set up cosmetic groups around the country to satisfy the European Commission's requirements.  The Minister has now taken it upon himself, by way of a statutory instrument, to decide whether he will or will not establish regional development authorities.</P>
    <P>In his public relations exercise the Minister has made a great deal of the fact that this Bill provides for regional development authorities but what he has not told the media &mdash; and it is not understood &mdash; is that it does not.  It gives the Minister a discretion.  The Bill does not say the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; establish such authorities but says that he &ldquo;may&rdquo; and, equally he may not.  He can establish such authorities in any size or shape but he can abolish them if he does not like them without getting the approval of this House.  I suspect they will not be established by this Minister and that this is another cosmetic exercise.  However, if we see such authorities, they will not have teeth.  If they are established and do <Col N="1071" /> something the Minister does not approve of I expect they will be rapidly abolished. It should not be possible by way of statutory instrument to play around with legislation that is supposed to be establishing a new form of local democracy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a sham.  The fact that the Minister is not willing to take on board the amendments tabled by either Deputy Howlin or Deputy Dukes to section 3 confirms that it is a sham.  Basically, this Bill is a public relations exercise designed for the local elections and makes a pretence at local government reform.  It is a disaster in the context of the Dublin area, but we will deal with that later.  I do not know what the Minister intends to do with regard to his powers by way of statutory instrument in the context of the city and county of Dublin.  The proposals he is bringing forward are no real reform and will leave no one responsible for the way Dublin city works and with no central focus of responsibility for local decisions that are essential for the running of both the city and the county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister is not willing to take on board the amendments that have been tabled to this section.  This section, in conjunction with the other sections I and other Deputies have referred to, confirms that this is not a Bill to reform local government but one that seeks to ensure that everything done at local level is controlled absolutely by the Minister for the Environment from the Custom House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The real fear of Members on this side of the House is that the Minister wants to contol fully the powers of local authorities.  Members who are also members of local authorities have seen that happen over the past few years and this Bill convinces them that that is the Minister's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out where he can introduce regulations.  Deputy Dukes pointed out that the Minister can make regulations and orders but, in case he forgot anything, he included a blanket provision in section 3 that gives him power to make regulations for the general <Col N="1072" /> purposes of this Bill.  For Deputy Roche to say that the Minister's proposals are to remove the power from central Government and give it to local authorities is laughable, because it is the other way round.  We all know that.  Members of local authorities see that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say last night he would give us the general principles of local government reform but that he would retain the &ldquo;subsidiary government functions&rdquo;.  The Minister, and his officials, will use that power to introduce statutory instruments, regulations and so on.  Members of local authorities know about ministerial regulations and statutory instruments; we deal with them regularly but the Minister will continue to issue them at a greater pace when this legislation is passed.</P>
      <P>In arguing against Deputy Howlin's point the Minister said that if we were to have primary legislation to deal with regulations we would be here 365 days of the year.  I have only had one experience of Members of the Opposition expressing anxiety about regulations and that was in relation to the Criminal Justice Bill. The Minister of the day gave an undertaking that the Bill would not become law until he introduced the regulations in primary legislation.  It is only right that the Minister for the Environment should consider announcing the powers he intends to give himself by way of regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not intent on ranging over every section when we are dealing with a specific amendment.  There are three ways of looking at this.  Deputy Dukes wants to replace the entire regulation-making process by way of primary legislation.  Deputy Howlin would like every order or regulation made under the Bill to be approved in draft by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The third view was promoted by Deputy Mitchell.  He sees the necessity for regulations in the traditional way but he would like to see some changes, and these should be brought in by draft.</P>
      <P>The fundamental question to be asked is whether we accept the role for subsidiary legislation.  We have to accept that this is a way of allowing legislation to work.  We have to have a system and this is the best system and has been proven over the years to be a responsible way of dealing with legislation.  Subsidiary legislation is a basic principle in formulating workable primary legislation.  That is principally what I am doing here and I have to consider how best I can do it.  It must be borne in mind that the important regulations will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in draft form and the whole raft of other regulations dealing with the minutiae will be dealt with in the ordinary way.  Experience has proven that this system works well.  Every regulation made under this Bill will come before the Dáil.  Listening to Deputy Howlin one would believe that this will not happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth putting it on the record that the important regulations will <Col N="1074" /> certainly have to be approved in draft. All the other regulations can be annulled by resolution of the Houses within 21 sitting days.  Therefore, in effect, Parliament will have absolute control over all regulations, be they draft or otherwise, so far as the implementation of this legislation is concerned.  The making of regulations is a fundamental and necessary part of the legislative process and, consequently, I do not think it is realistic to pursue this matter in the way the Deputies have been doing.  For this reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter referred to a range of matters.  His contribution was similar to contributions he made on a whole range of legislative measures.  He has adopted the same attitude and used the same speech &mdash; the Minister is getting too much power and he must not do this and that. I accept that he has to oppose the legislation, and he can find a good reason for doing this, but there is a similarity in the style he uses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was wrong so far as the regional bodies are concerned. However, I will deal with this issue at a later stage.  I outlined both in my press statement and Second Stage speech what these boards will be asked to do.  I believe they have a function so far as co-ordination is concerned and that they will play an important role in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that managers will have to depend on the Minister to have their contracts renewed is patently dishonest.  The managers will be appointed by the Local Appointments Commission for a certain length of time and if they wish to continue in that job or to apply for a different job, this will be done in the normal way, through the Local Appointments Commission. He also made the point &mdash; I reflected on this for a moment &mdash; that the Minister can devolve powers to the local authorities and said he would like to think that the Minister would do this either through his Department or after consultation with other Ministers.  He also <Col N="1075" /> said that if the Minister did not like the way things were going he could take back these powers.  The point is that if the Minister devolves a function to local authorities and they do not carry out that function in a satisfactory manner, then the Minister should have a residual power to step in.  Otherwise services could be disrupted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore rightly noted that some sections will give the Minister specific power to act.  He referred to certain sections which will give the Minister power to do things by order and written direction.  He was quite right in his assessment of these sections. I should explain that the convention in drafting is to provide for order rather than regulations to establish a new body or assign functions.  I think this is catered for in a fashion which is acceptable to Deputy Gilmore.  Regulations are used <Col N="1076" /> essentially for procedural, incidental and supplementary matters.  Those words are specifically used in the section.  This is what the Bill is all about.  The major matters will be covered by draft and the procedural matters and the implementation of the section will be done by way of regulations.  This system has worked well.</P>
      <P>One can have a fundamental objection in principle to the system, which Deputy Howlin has.  He makes this point on a continuing basis.  Basically it is a question of whether we believe in subsidiary legislation, which I do.  This has proven to have worked well over the years.  The broad matters are dealt with in primary legislation and the other matters are dealt with by way of regulation.  This amendment would clutter up the time of the Dáil and inhibit the good working and intentions of this legislation.  Consequently, I cannot accept it.  I ask the Deputies, in good faith, to recognise that what is intended here is to devolve powers, to provide a mechanism which will enable that to happen and to improve the situation so far as local authorities are concerned.  The Minister is only taking the necessary functions and powers onto himself to enable this to happen in a practical, proper and efficient way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a brief question to the Minister.  I am going to be unashamedly parochial about this issue as we will not have time to elaborate later. Does the Minister think that the regulations and powers being given to him under this section will be capable of dealing with the problem in my constituency where some 4,000 houses have been built by Dublin Corporation, and are the responsibility of that corporation, but no elected representative of any party in that vast area of public housing is represented on Dublin City Council?  In other words, there is no accountability to the people, through their elected representatives, for the management of that vast housing area.  Dublin Corporation have proved unwilling to hand over, by whatever arrangement is necessary, those 4,000 <Col N="1077" /> plus houses to Dublin County Council, who elect members to deal with these matters.  The result is that there are terrible problems in this area.</P>
      <P>There is no estate management policy in Tallaght and very little care is taken in the allocation of these houses.  In addition, there is a very defective maintenance policy.  As a result there are endemic problems in that area which seem incapable of being dealt with purely because no elected representative of any party can get up at the city council and make the managers accountable for the manner in which they have neglected and let the estates run down.  These estates are unkempt and there are severe environmental problems in the area.  It is now emerging that the policy of Dublin Corporation to take troubled families from other parts of the city and put them in Tallaght, the area where there will be least outcry, has given rise to very serious problems of vandalism and petty crime in the area.  Will this section enable the Minister to deal with such problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting point. I take it that the Deputy is saying the corporation have purchased property outside their area, built houses there and that the income from these houses is going into an administration which is not <Col N="1078" /> responsible for that general area.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered this matter at some length in the formulation of the Bill.  The Deputy has made what is a reasonable suggestion that in the new arrangement, where there are four authorities &mdash; the corporation and the three county councils &mdash; that matter will have to be addressed.</P>

      <P>The amendment was somewhat lost in the general discussion. Although I referred to it twice, the Minister did not give me a satisfactory reason in either of his contributions why the provision is in the Bill and, in particular, why he needs the power and whether the provision is, as I fear, an all-powerful provision that allows the Minister to <Col N="1082" /> interfere with virtually every aspect of local government.  Could I ask the Minister to respond very briefly to those questions before I determine my attitude to the amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete the words &ldquo;for the general purposes or&rdquo; in relation to section 3 (1).  I was not too much taken by the amendment.  I felt it was thrown in for the sake of making an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of that that I thought I had better take a closer look at the amendment.  I think the section as it stands is a reasonable one.  It allows for minor matters arising from any provision of the Bill to be dealt with when there is no specific porvision for them.  I shall not go to the stake about this issue; is it the Deputy's wish to leave out the word &ldquo;general&rdquo;?  Is that the main thrust of what he wants?</P>

      <P>No.  There is not difference between &ldquo;any purpose&rdquo; and &ldquo;general purpose&rdquo;.  What I want to achieve is that the Minister would have the authority under this section to make regulations arising from the enactment.  What I want to prevent is having the power divested to the Minister to make regulations on any matter that occurs to him in the general ambit of local Government. That is what I feel the import of &ldquo;general purposes&rdquo; in this section does.  If the Minister feels he needs the power to make regulations on anything that comes into his head in relation to local Government, let him tell the House that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to oppose this section of the Bill.  I really do not think the Minister's amendment fundamentally changes subsection (1) as originally proposed. It deletes the words &ldquo;for the general purposes&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo; but as it would now read it says the Minister may make regulations for any purposes of this Act.  That leaves him still with powers as wide as we talked about here for the last day and a half.  I do not think the Minister's proposed amendment substantially changes things.  It still leaves the Minister with the wide ranging powers that we have been complaining about over the last several hours.</P>

      <P>If there is no agreement in the matter, I cannot do anything to accommodate Deputy Howlin.  I thought perhaps we might have got the general agreement of the House and it would be dealt with now expeditiously rather than doing anything else.  The offer is still there, but unless Deputy Gilmore reconsiders his position I will have to withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My objective in this section was to curtail the power of the Minister as far as possible.  We have failed in that amendment No. 5a has been <Col N="1085" /> defeated.  We have failed in my amendment No. 6 to make any regulations subject to positive affirmation of the House. The last unsatisfactory element was that phrase in subsection (1).  I would be happier with the new form of words for, I am legally advised, the phrase &ldquo;for the general purposes&rdquo; is a very sweeping one. I would like to confine it to the particular functions of this Act.  While it is not a satisfactory situation &mdash; we can vote against the section if people are minded &mdash; the small half-step the Minister is willing to take in this regard is better than the broad sweeping powers that are there.  I would, therefore, urge my colleagues to accept at least this small step.  It is not satisfactory to any of us but it is better than the existing provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>To be honest, we are probably being a bit semantic.  The new subsection will not refer to particular purpose of the Bill; it will refer to any purpose of the Bill, and that could be either general or particular.  In order to help I will reserve my position until we come to vote on the section as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), line 40, to delete &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but this word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; seems to give the Minister an additional layer of power on top of the extensive power he already has <Col N="1086" /> under the other provisions of this Bill.  It seems that if the Minister deems a matter not specifically covered by this Bill to be supplementary to the provisions of this Bill he can make regulations or orders or provisions.  I would like to know exactly why the Minister wants to insert this word and what he considers it will cover.  This legislation has gone much too far and this word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; pushes the limits even further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The central point Deputy Mitchell is making is that he objects to the word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo;.  My attitude is that regulations should be capable of including any supplementary provision necessary to enable them to operate properly.  Not to provide for that would be careless.  The Deputy seems quite happy that regulations should include incidental or consequential provisions but not supplementary ones.  I do not see why he makes that distinction because the three words often go together in drafting provisions of this kind and there is not a great deal of difference between them.  I do not think it is necessary to split hairs and I would ask the Deputy to see it that way.  These three go together and it would be an omission if we neglected to include it at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's amendment which is being taken in conjunction with my own amendment. This really is the catch all section.  Subsection (1) gives the Minister omnibus powers to make regulations as he sees fit.  But, just in case this is not enough, subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to any other provision of this Act, a regulation or order under this Act may provide for such incidental, consequential, supplementary or transitional provisions ... as may appear to the Minister to be appropriate for the purposes of this Act or any regulations or order made thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case he had not crossed every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and dotted every &ldquo;i&rdquo;, in case there might be a loophole, we have this omnibus provision <Col N="1087" /> to make sure that he has all powers again. We have flogged this issue to death, so the Minister knows our views on it.</P>
    <P>The import of the amendments in mine and Deputy Mitchell's names is to try to delimit the power of the Minister which seems to be all pervasive in this regard. I am seeking to remove the words &ldquo;as may appear to the Minister&rdquo;.  There is almost a whimsical nature in this because whatever comes into the Minister's head he can regulate for as he sees fit.  It is important that we put down a marker that that is not in accordance with the democratic principles we would like to see enshrined particularly in a Bill on local government and local democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister that this is far from splitting hairs.  I accept the need for the Minister to have power to deal with such incidential or consequential matters as may arise obviously consequential on the provisions of the Bill.  However, to add the word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; pushes the boat out too far.  It gives the Minister scope of a kind that this House may very well not want to give.  We do not know what the Minister may consider as supplementary now or in the future.  It seems a very wide-ranging power, the sort of power I imagine Dr. Salazar in his heyday had in Portugal.  He could announce whatever diktat he thought was appropriate and this could happen here in the hands of this Minister or some future Minister if we allow such a wide-ranging section to go unamended.  I ask the Minister to make some concession in regard to the concern of the House for the excesses of this Bill and particularly the excesses of this section and to agree to delete the word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that and there is no point in going over it.  I think it necessary for the good and effective use of the section to include that.  I ask the Deputy to see there is nothing unnatural about that.  The effect of Deputy Howlin's amendment would be that the regulations could include appropriate <Col N="1088" /> provisions, but they have to seem appropriate to someone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so why not say so? Amendment No. 9 does nothing to improve the test; I see it as a disimprovement. The section should stand as it is.  If the Minister has no good grounds for claiming that the regulations are appropriate then of course it is a matter for the House to settle and to challenge him in that matter.  The safeguard is there.  Consequently, I think the thing should stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I do not put in amendments for cosmetic reasons.  The whole thrust of what I want to say on this is that control should not rest with the Minister.  If that has not sunk into the Minister's head yet I have been wasting my time for the last day and a half.  The power should rest with the Dáil.  Under amendment No. 13, when we reach it, I will be proposing that a positive decision of the Dáil will be required for regulations. It is to the Dáil the regulation should seem appropriate and not to the Minister.  It waters down the provisions because the Minister may make regulations as he sees fit under this wording. I want to take those words out to provide that the Minister may make regulations not as he sees fit but as appropriate.  It must be this House which decides what is appropriate when the regulations come before us for positive affirmation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in pursuing it further.  It is a follow-on of Deputy Howlin's point.  Once he started the chain of events he set in motion under section 3 he must pursue it in this way to be consistent.  I recognise that, but the argument still stands good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (3) (a), to delete all words from and including &ldquo;to a specified class&rdquo; in line 2, down to the end of the paragraph.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete part of the areas that would be under the authority of regulation.  Section 3 (3) (a) provides that:</P>
      <P>Regulations or an order under this Act may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) apply to local authorities generally, to a specified class or classes of local authorities, to a particular local authority or to a particular part of the functional area of a local authority.</P>
      <P>I read that several times and really it goes down to the Minister being able to designate streets over which he has authority.  Can he give decisions and make regulations about streets facing north having to be painted blue and streets facing south having to be painted red?  It is a sweeping, insidious power. He can divide up towns; he can make regulations to apply to specific areas of towns or counties.  What exactly is the purpose of having this omnibus power to specify who the regulations apply to? Surely in general terms the regulations should apply to the generality of a local authority.  Will he give instances and specific cases where he feels he needs this all-pervasive power?  I would like to hear the Minister argue his case for the inclusion of this power to go down virtually to the individual houses in an electoral area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 would <Col N="1090" /> mean regulations could apply only to local authorities generally and amendment No. 11 would mean that the different provisions could not apply to different local authorities.  The whole basis of local government law is that different legal provisions apply to different classes of local authority.  We have town commissioners who, the Deputy will be aware are not planning authorities, whereas urban district councils are. Counties are fire authorities but a few of the larger urban district councils are also. Section 3 (3) simply allows regulations to reflect those arrangements and it is the basis on which local government regulations have been made for very many years.  Obviously, different regulations will also be necessary to cover the Dublin provisions and even within County Dublin we will need different provisions for the Dún Laoghaire area.  That is the basis and I think it is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I understand the Minister.  Will he give us a specific example of a regulation that would apply to a specific area and not to another in the same local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The transitional order to cater for Dún Laoghaire, but the power to give directions is not new.  An example is section 15 of the 1978 Act which relates to directions or instructions by the Minister to enable things to be done.  Different clases of authority, giving different classes of services in a wide range of activities, would require separate directions for the purpose which would not apply generally to the whole area of local authority.  For that reason you are going to need different regulations to deal with different circumstances because of the sizes and the activities of the various authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not understand the Minister's reasoning.  He mentioned as an example of what he has in mind the transitional arrangements which might apply to Dún Laoghaire in relation to the changes that will take place in the Dublin area.  I do not follow <Col N="1091" /> that.  One area I can see being very controversial in relation to Dún Laoghaire is water charges.  At the moment Dún Laoghaire Borough is the only part of the greater Dublin area which has water charges.  On one side of a street in Sallynoggin people pay water charges and on the opposite side of the street they do not.</P>
      <P>In a throwaway remark on Second Stage the Minister made reference to the possibility of extending the borough boundary as far as the Bray Road.  People who live between the existing borough boundary and the Bray Road are not liable for water charges because Dublin County Council abolished water charges. People in those areas would strongly resist a change in the boundary if it would result in their paying water charges.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister talking about here?  Is he talking about making a regulation that would prevent, as an interim measure, Dún Laoghaire Borough Council imposing water charges or is he talking about making a regulation which would prevent the new proposed authority, Dún Laoghaire Borough Council or Dublin County Council imposing charges for the area between the borough boundary and the Bray Road?  I cannot recall off hand any function which is carried out by Dublin County Council that is not already carried out by Dún Laoghaire Borough Council as they have basically the same functions.  Dún Laoghaire Borough Council probably have more functions as they are a fire authority whereas Dublin County Council, for the south county area, are not.  Perhaps the Minister could give some practical examples of what he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is concerned about is whether the Minister will be giving directions so far as water charges are concerned.  Let me state unambiguously that it is not the intention of the Minister to do that in any shape or form; that matter is a reserved function for local authority members.  I do not intend &mdash; and it never was my intention &mdash; to direct that charges of that kind <Col N="1092" /> would be applied in any area other than where the reserved function has been addressed by the members themselves.</P>

      <P>That is something that needs to be teased out a little further because, in the context of the Minister's powers in relation to boundaries and the implications of the exercising of those powers, it is not sufficient for the Minister to tell the House that it is not his intention to impose charges.  I represent a constituency in Dublin South where, currently we are represented on the Dublin County Council when it debates in sub-committee. As I understand this Bill, the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown sub-committee and Dún Laoghaire Corporation will be subsumed into one.  At present water charges are imposed on the citizens of Dún Laoghaire.  There are no charges currently imposed or paid by my constituents living in Dundrum, Clonskeagh, Mount Merrion, Stillorgan and Kilmacud areas.  It would seem to me that after these elections, on the assumption that Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the Dún Laoghaire Rathdown sub-committee will be subsumed into one, by implication and of necessity it is the intention that the charges imposed by Dún Laoghaire Corporation extend into that part of south county Dublin that will form part of that committee area.  The Minister needs to clarify that.</P>
      <P>What we have here are charges by stealth.  People in south county Dublin are not being told the implications of this legislation.  If charges are to be imposed let the Minister tell the people.  If charges are not to be imposed can the Minister explain how some of the people who live in one local authority area &mdash; those who live within the boundaries of the old Dún Laoghaire Corporation area &mdash; will be required to pay for services which another group will not.  Their view is that they do not get them free but rather, by virtue of the income tax they pay, they are paying for their services and they do not want to be taxed a second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to labour this point as we will be coming back to it in other sections but there is an implication here. <Col N="1093" /> The Minister cannot wash his hands of it and say this has nothing to do with him but is the responsibility of the local councillors. He is changing the shape of the ballpark; he is changing the political playing field; he is changing the political forum and the local authority and subsuming the two into one.  That means local charges will be abolished in Dún Laoghaire or that they will be extended into a large part of South Dublin where they are not currently charged.  You cannot impose charges on some people in one local authority and not on others. The Minister should clarify his intentions.</P>
    <P>I am sure he communicates with members of the Fianna Fáil groups in Dún Laoghaire Corporation and in Dublin County Council and I assume they have sought some clarification from him as to what is happening in this area.  I am sure that behind closed doors discussions have taken place and, if so, we should be told that those discussions are.  After 27 June next people should not suddenly find bills coming through their letter boxes which nobody told them they would get.  The Minister should clarify this issue.</P>
    <P>I regret, Sir &mdash; and I say this on behalf of all of us who are taking the trouble to debate this legislation &mdash; the absence of the media from listening to this debate. It is a disgrace that there is not a single representative from one of our national newspapers who appears to regard the substance of this Bill and the debate taking place as worthy of reportage as opposed to the political skirmishes that have taken place over time, which have been very important but which do not deal with the substance of the issue.  If people outside this House knew of this Bill and this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to say one thing to Deputy Shatter: there have been no meetings behind closed doors with anybody to determine what might or might not happen consequent on this legislation.  The Deputy should not suggest such things.  I would have thought Deputy Gilmore was quite happy when I gave the assurance about this matter but I will put it on the record again.  No part of County Dublin is being added to Dún Laoghaire under this Bill.  That is not the position.  Why then should charges or any other provisions that apply in Dún Laoghaire be extended to anybody or anywhere else?  It will be purely a matter for the newly elected councillors of that county council area to determine whether they will impose charges.  That is what applies in every local authority now. Everybody knows it is not a matter for the Minister one way or another and Deputies know that.  To suggest that some kind of deal is being perpetrated is unworthy of Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assumes incorrectly that I am happy with his reply. We are dealing with an amendment which refers to a section which will enable the Minister to make regulations which will relate to local authorities generally, a specified class of local authority, a particular local authority or a particular part of the functional area of a local authority. In teasing out what exactly this meant, Deputy Howlin asked the direct question if this meant the Minister could make a regulation in relation to an individual street.  In reply the Minister said one of the things he had in mind in putting this provision into the Bill was the interim arrangements which would apply between Dún Laoghaire and the rest of south Dublin in the transition period, between the existing Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and Dublin County Council, and the creation of the new Dún <Col N="1095" /> Laoghaire-Rathdown Council, whenever that will be created by new legislation. As I am a member of both Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and Dublin County Council I was exercising my brain to think what functions the Minister could possibly have in mind.  What functions do either Dublin County Council or Dún Laoghaire Borough Council have that the other do not have or do not exercise? The only one I can think of relates to water charges.  Since 1986 Dublin County Council have not imposed water charges. In 1988 Dún Laoghaire Borough Council voted to reintroduce water charges in Dún Laoghaire Borough.  That became a very controversial topic, and is a very sore one with the citizens of Dún Laoghaire Borough who cannot understand why they, of all the people who live in the greater Dublin area, should have to pay for water, and very often for a water supply that is inadequate.  There are parts of Dún Laoghaire Borough where, on a Saturday, you cannot use a washing machine or get enough water to wash you teeth at certain times of the day.  There is a great deal of opposition within the Dún Laoghaire Borough area to water charges.  There are people living outside the Dún Laoghaire Borough boundary who have read in their newspapers that it is proposed to create a new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and one of the questions they ask is whether this means they will now have to pay water charges? People living in Shankill, Cabinteely, parts of Sallynoggin and Glenageary, immediately outside the Dún Laoghaire Borough area, who see their neighbours having to pay water charges are now asking if they will have to pay water charges after this legislation is passed.  The Minister said he is not going to make regulations to the effect that people living in the existing county part of south County Dublin will have to pay water charges, but is he going to make regulations in relation to the funding of these <Col N="1096" /> local authorities?  It is the peculiar funding arrangements that apply in Dún Laoghaire that have given rise to a situation where some of my colleagues on Dún Laoghaire Borough Council have felt they should reintroduce water charges.</P>
      <P>I would like some clarity on this matter.  It was the Minister who raised this question and not I.  I had no intention of discussing Dún Laoghaire in the context of this Bill until the Minister raised it, but now that he has raised it I would like to see it through.  What did the Minister have in mind when he said he would use this section to make regulations as part of the interim arrangements in relation to Dún Laoghaire?  It seems the only thing he has in mind relates to the imposition of water charges.  We have only the Minister's word that he will not introduce such charges.  This Bill gives the Minister power to make regulations in relation to any part of the functional area of a local authority.  Does this Bill not empower the Minister to make regulations in relation to charging for water in the part of County Dublin which is currently outside the Dún Laoghaire boundary but which will become part of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council? We have only the Minister's word that he will not introduce those charges but the Bill empowers him to do so.</P>
      <P>If a successor to this Minister feels like introducing such charges the Bill would empower him to make a regulation directing Dublin County Council or the Dublin county manager to do so.  What would stop a Minister from making a regulation and saying to Dublin County Council: &ldquo;You may only exercise your reserved function to make water charges, or not to make water charges, for all of your administrative area with the exception of the administrative area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown&rdquo;?  In relation to reserved functions the Minister will have power to make regulations and give directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill it will be open to a Minister for the Environment, as an interim arrangement, while he is trying to get people in south County Dublin <Col N="1097" /> used to the idea of paying water charges, to make regulations in this regard.  He would be empowered to direct Dublin County Council that they can exercise their reserved function only in relation to water charges solely for the Belgard and Fingall areas.  That power is given to the Minister under this Bill and we only have his word that he will not exercise it.  That is what this section is about, and it relates to any part of the functional area of a local authority.  Far from being happy with the Minister's reply, my fears and suspicions are growing by the minute in relation to what the Minister has in mind in regard to this section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The further we go down this road the more alarmed we have all become.  The Minister has been more than a little disingenuous and a little less than forthcoming in his response to the specific question I asked.  He led himself down a path that opened up the argument we are putting forward now.  I simply asked what is intended in this provision. The Minister has not mentioned any specific regulation he has in mind that would require this sort of targeting with such precision.  As other Deputies have mentioned, it was the Minister who raised the issue of the transitional arrangements for the creation of the three new councils.  It was not my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, who raised the issue of water charges. As he was speaking the Minister was thinking about water charges, and the Deputy knew what he had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew well what Deputy Gilmore had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us tease out this matter.  Rather than trying to mind read let us deal with the specifics.  The Minister put forward an immediate defence and said he is not going to give an instruction, issue a directive or make a regulation requiring a local authority to introduce charges.  We take his word for that, or do we?  One of the Minister's predecessors, as Environment spokesman for the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Robert Molloy, stated not only verbally but in <Col N="1098" /> writing in &ldquo;Power Back to the People,&rdquo; the Fianna Fáil alternative local election manifesto of 1985, that Fianna Fáil would restore financial stability to local authorities by repealing the Coalition Government's Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983. That was his word but, without straying beyond the bounds of what is allowed to be said in the confines of this House, I do not think his word counts for very much with the electorate.  In 1985 they stated they would keep their word.  We on this side of the House have to take the Minister's word today in the context of that of his predecessor who is now departed from the Minister's party but not from his company.</P>
      <P>There is a very fundamental issue here. There is more than one way to skin a cat. The Minister might achieve the objective, if that is his objective, of requiring a local authority to impose charges without having to make regulations that specifically require them to do so.  Let us tease this out and have an accurate, open response from the Minister.  What regulations has the Minister in mind that would require him to have the precision of power that he would be able to target particular parts of the functional areas of a local authority?  It is interesting that the first idea that came to his head was the one we are trying to tease out now.  Why did that idea come to his head?  What power has he in mind in this regard?  I am sure his officials are struggling valiantly to come up with something, but our suspicions have been aroused.  The fact that the Minister thought of this before anyone on this side of the House underscores that those suspicions might indeed be realised.  Let the Minister come clean on this.  I will pose again the question I posed earlier: what powers by way of regulation are needed for this level of targeting that requires the Minister to maintain the paragraph as it is worded in section 3 (3) (a)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth spending time on this section and the amendments thereto because I cannot over-emphasise how sweeping the powers are in the Bill <Col N="1099" /> and which are controlled, to some extent, by this section.  In some amendments I seek to change the Minister's power to make regulations or orders, even without the prior approval of the House, where the Minister is taking power by regulation to amend existing regulations because, in that case, he should come before the House.  This is the equivalent of a ministerial patriot missile because he can even decide the colour which Dublin Corporation or county council can paint the door of No. 47B Fatima Mansions.  That brings it to absurdity but it is the power the Minister is taking to himself.</P>
      <P>As I said many times before, it is dangerous to give the Minister so much power and, unfortunately, it means that the system of local government will be even more clogged and lethargic than it is at present.  Local government needs to be liberated from the dead hand of ministerial regulations, order, directions, prescriptions and interference.  When local government needs to be re-invigorated and reawakened, the Minister is coming down on an already nearly dead body with another ministerial steamroller. The Minister has gone too far because the Bill is the reverse of what is needed, which is to return to local people power and influence over their local environment.  I asked the Minister the other day about the number of dwellings within a mile of his plush office which did not have a bathroom or inside toilet.  The Minister said that he did not know the answer.</P>

      <P>Well, the Government have spent it.  The Minister has very plush offices which I would not mind occupying sometime because they are very comfortable and have a lovely view over the Liffey.  However, the Minister does not know whether people who live within one mile of him have toilets or bathrooms and, what is more, they will never have them unless he gives the go-ahead.  The whole system is choking because local councils are told by their management that they cannot do this, that or the other because there is no money; all they can do is pass motions about refurbishment of flat complexes or run-down housing estates, most of which are a legacy of the Fianna Fáil low cost housing policy of the late sixties and early seventies when Deputy Molloy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, who has been so loquacious in defending this Bill, presided over low cost housing and another Fianna Fáil Minister presided over the high rise flats which are an environmental nightmare for the residents.  The point is that local councillors had repeatedly voted to have these areas refurbished or to have those bathrooms built; I began a campaign in Dublin Corporation in 1974 to have 400 houses in Ballyfermot provided with bathrooms, which was agreed. The programme was started in 1976 but the Government changed in 1977 and one quarter of those houses still do not have a bathroom because the Minister has, since 1977, repeatedly taken to himself more and more contol and power with a consequential and equal reduction in power and influence of the local council and the local people.  Now, there is a question of more power and centralisation for the Minister; more Salazar type authority, which had the effect in Portugal of running down the economy. That is the position in local government today.  Nothing is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of what local authorities do <Col N="1101" /> depends on their finance.  Since the abolition of domestic and agricultural rates in 1977-78, because of an offer of fixed costs, local authorities are almost entirely dependent on funds from the rate support grant.  Since the Minister came to power in 1987 the provision of the rate support grant to local authorities has gone down from £256 million to £196 million in 1988, to £168 million in 1991.  The local authorities have been run down by the Minister in his four years in office and they cannot do anything without ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that the Minister could, at least in theory, decide the colour of the toilet paper which local authorities should use and some people thought I was joking.  It was a way of illustrating the powers in the Bill and I am not joking as the Minister could, in theory, say that he wanted the local authorities to use lilac toilet paper instead of pink toilet paper. That is the extent of the power he is taking in this section.  While he may protest he will not do that, the reality is that he can do an awful lot of other things to control specific items in each local authority.  I appeal to the Minister to liberate the local authorities and to agree that he will on Report Stage introduce a redrafted section 3 which would include the provision that any regulation or order which he seeks power to make, which has the power to amend or override existing legislation either generally or in a particular case, would require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 40 (1) says that the Minister may make regulations and it specifies many specifics in this regard.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>Upon the commencement of this Part and of regulations under this section, the matters to which this Part relates and with respect to which the regulations were made shall, as respects any local authority concerned, be governed by the provisions of this Part and the regulations, and such previous provisions (whether made by or under <Col N="1102" /> statute) as may be specified in the regulations applying to that authority and relating to those matters shall cease to have effect as respects that authority.</P>
    <P>By regulations under section 40 the Minister can override existing legislation without the prior approval of this House.</P>

I have to acknowledge that he is moving amendments which are more in line with my way of thinking than the way he thought originally.

      <P>The Chair appreciates that section 3, which deals with the right to make regulations, is fundamental to the legislation, but I suggest that we should confine ourselves to the amendment to this section rather than fly to others which we know are not appropriate.  A passing reference may be necessary but for the last while there has been a certain amount of repetition of the points the Deputies would wish to make.  Perhaps we should exercise a certain economy, given the limited amount of time available to us, and confine ourselves to section 3.</P>

      <P>I do not think anyone could accuse me of intervening at great length too often.  As I said, section 3 is fundamental to the extensive powers the Minister seeks.  I feel very strongly about this matter.  I also feel, even if this is a futile exercise and, as Deputy Shatter said, there are not that many members of the media present to alert the public, there is a duty on the Opposition to highlight the dangers presented by the provisions of section 3.  The Minister has just said that what I said about section 40 was not true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is stated that any provision shall cease to have effect once the Minister makes regulations, which will not have to be laid before the House. Therefore it appears the Minister will be able to override existing legislation passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, for either a specific or general purpose, by making regulations which will not be discussed by the House, even if a motion to annul them is put down within 21 sitting days because it is the Government who order the business of the House. There are ample precedents for Governments to make time available to take a motion to annul regulations.  I have no bones about labouring the point in the House today that some of the provisions of this Bill are dangerous and are moderated by section 3.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The remedial works scheme has been <Col N="1104" /> high on the list of priorities of the Minister for the Environment for a couple of years now.  Indeed, the amount of money made available for that scheme has been increased substantially since the date referred to by Deputy Mitchell when the figure stood at around £2 million.  This year £16 million has been made available to carry out the work which he considers to be necessary, and I agree with him.  In relation to the sub-programme dealing with bathrooms, I would have thought that the Deputy would have been very happy to conclude that the Minister had done something worthwhile in allowing bathroom as well as sanitary facilities to be provided under the remedial works scheme.  No one had ever contemplated doing this previously.</P>
    <P>I resent the fact that he referred to one part of the city as an environmental ghetto given that a major works programme is under way there.  A substantial amount of money has been provided to allow improvements to be made at that location.  He did not name the area and I do not intend to do so either except to point out that that work is under way.  I have visited the area and the residents are most happy with what is contemplated.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be recognised that different legal provisions apply to different classes of local authority.  It also has to be recognised that local authorities are of different sizes, scales and capacities. It is only proper therefore that regulations be made for small as well as large local authorities.  It will be necessary to make regulations for different local authorities and in particular to deal with the position in Dublin.  The position in Cork is that there are three health districts which must be dealt with in different ways.  All I am saying is that we have to take note of this fact because it has always been the practice to deal with authorities in different ways.  I was asked to state the maximum allowance payable to a chairman. Would the same upper limit be set for Newbridge, Tralee and Ballybay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In normal circumstances there will be no interference whatsoever, it is only a residual power, and if local authorities were doing something that was out of proportion it would be necessary in the public interest to do something about it.  Let me say there is an overriding principle that has to be established here and now.  In the final analysis, responsibility for the local government system rests with the Minister and the Government have to bear that in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point, because the Minister represents the House. Surely if the Minister who is representing the House should have the residual power to see to it that there is not any abuse &mdash; I am not talking as if there is going to be any abuse &mdash; he should at least have in law the means of dealing with it if it needs to be put to rights in the wider public interest.  That is all that is involved here. There is no point in Deputy Gilmore seeking to put out scare stories about things which the Minister has no intention of doing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and no interest in doing so.  Let me say that Deputy Gilmore knows full well that as I stated we are not adding on anything, we are talking about a new council and whatever <Col N="1109" /> reserved functions a council have, they can use them in whatever way they choose and it will not be a matter for the Minister to direct them or prescribe or make regulations as to what they will do in so far as the reserved functions were concerned.</P>

I was fearful that the Minister wants to have all-pervasive powers in this regard and I am determined to resist that.  The very real fears raised by Deputy Gilmore in relation to the Minister's power to impose charges are real unless we modify them.  I wish strongly to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware from my reply to Dáil questions by him on 13 November last, the proposals and recommendations set out in the consultant's report have been for some time the subject of discussion between my Department and the trustees of the Chester Beatty Library. The trustees are the legal owners of the library and its administration rests in their hands.  The objective of these discussions is to assist in the orderly development and reorganisation of the library.</P>
      <P>In their reorganisation of the library, the trustees have taken into account all the relevant proposals of the consultant's report which concern the organisational aspects of staff management.</P>
      <P>The position of director was advertised in the national press on 5 April 1991 and the closing date for applications is 1 July. The terms of appointment have been approved by my Department and the advertisement was submitted to my Department in advance of publication. The proposed interview board will include members of the trustees, a nominee of my Department and an outside expert nominated by the trustees.</P>
      <P>It is intended to grant-aid the library in 1991 with a sum not less than the figure paid last year although the final amount has not yet been determined.  The grant in 1990 was £220,000.  The normal conditions relating to the furnishing of accounts to my Department and control over staff numbers and pay levels will apply as well as the more effective and efficient running of this publicly financed institution in the light of management and organisation changes which have now been adopted from the consultant's report.</P>
      <P>I regard the Chester Beatty Library as being a cultural institution of international importance and I will ensure that it is helped to discharge its mandate effectively in a full and proper manner.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the information with regard to the library.  I fully agree with him as to the importance of this library.  Will the Taoiseach not accept that there is considerable disquiet abroad at the manner in which the library are conducting their affairs in recent times, and that because of the way in which matters have developed there, the collection has not been developed to its full potential both at home and abroad where it has a very important international contribution to make?</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any disquiet of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  As the Deputy is aware we had an inquiry into the whole affair and as a result of that a considerable programme of action has been undertaken, in particular the appointment of a new director is now underway.</P>

Will the Taoiseach indicate if the condition relating to the tenure of office of the trustees is to be acted upon and implemented by the board, and whether his Department are to be allowed an extra place on the board?</P>

      <P>The reply is not very informative.  I asked the question specifically because of the contradictory statements made last week.  The first figure was 10,000 native Irish speakers given in Brendan Ó hEithir's posthumous autobiography.  There was a denial of that.  It is only right that we should have an exact idea of how many people are speaking Irish as their everyday language, and how that figure has varied over the past 40 years.</P>

It is clearly set out in the Single European Act and it is acknowledged by all member states of the European community.  Matters relating to common defence security policies and other similar matters are the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 28 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces recommended that the system of promotion heretofore in operation in the Permanent Defence Force which was based almost exclusively on seniority should be changed to a system based on merit.</P>
      <P>The Commission recommended that the new arrangements should be implemented without delay.</P>
      <P>It advised, however, that changes proposed in relation to minimum potential service in the higher rank should not apply for a period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission recommended that <Col N="1120" /> Promotion Boards should be used to assess and interview candidates.</P>
    <P>In the case of promotion from the rank of Colonel to Brigadier-General it recommended that the Board should consist of the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General, the Assistant Chief of Staff and a civilian member appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>To provide for the new promotion system in connection with the five Brigadier-General vacancies which were filled recently an amendment to Defence Force Regulations was made and a Promotion Board was established as recommended.</P>
    <P>Criteria for the promotion of Officers are laid down in the Regulations.</P>
    <P>The Promotion Board was required to certify that a candidate (a) was fitted to fill an appointment in the higher rank, (b) had given evidence of reliability, devotion to duty, zeal, industry, ability, initiative, leadership, and (c) had been recommended for promotion, in addition to a number of other factors.</P>
    <P>The Board arranged preliminary interviews and following a second interview recommended a number of candidates to fill the vacancies.  I accepted the recommendation.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for promotion at other officer levels are being drawn up and will be put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The elected representatives of officers were afforded an opportunity to express their views in the formulation of the arrangements for the filling of the Brigadier-General posts and will be consulted in the next stage of the develpment of the promotion system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the day before the interviews took place notice was issued by Army headquarters of a board set up to examine the Gleeson Commission's recommendations and make proposals for a promotions system and to consider the recommendations of the Gleeson report?  In fact at the time of the interviews the recommendations had not been <Col N="1121" /> complied with; in fact the system was not properly established.  Is the Minister not further aware that four of the colonels appointed to the position of brigadier general did not in fact hold the necessary qualifications, that is, the position of colonel for two years?  Would the Minister please let this House know what his view is on that irregularity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the recommendation was widely accepted by the Defence Forces.  The Commission that recommended that this new system of promotion on merit would be put in place stated quite clearly that they were absolutely convinced of the urgent necessity to introduce an officer promotion system based on selection by merit.  Everybody, especially those involved and eligible for participation in that competition was fully aware of the details of how this decision was arrived at and why this line was taken.  It was also widely welcomed by the people in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain to the House why paragraph 2210 of the Gleeson report was not complied with in relation to the qualifications of those who were promoted; and why colonels were promoted to the position of brigadier general where it was absolutely necessary that they would have previously held a command position but practically all of those appointed were not in a command position at the time of appointment?  Would the Minister agree that that was a grave irregularity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear that the changes proposed in relation to minimal potential service in a higher rank should not apply for a period of five years.  That was stated in the Commission's report. The Commission were quite adamant that this new system should be put in place as a matter of urgency.  They also recognised that in the initial stages matters like this would arise but that in the long term the system based on merit was far superior and would have a better <Col N="1122" /> effect on morale throughout the Defence Forces.  I believe that is the position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister then suggesting that appointments in the Army up to now did not actually take place on merit?  Is the Minister suggesting that merit was not a consideration in relation to promotion in the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not really know what the Deputy is getting at.  If she is criticising the new system, she should say so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows exactly what I am getting at.  I am asking the Minister specifically if merit was a consideration in promoting Army officers before now?  Was it or was it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely essential that merit would always be a consideration but it was clearly and straightforwardly explained by the commission that one of the most important issues in this whole commission document was the implementation of this recommendation which we are doing with the urgency which the commission attach to it.  The people in the Defence Forces generally are very pleased with this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 10 and 29 together.  Under the provisions of the Defence Act, 1954, as amended, the Reserve Defence Force comprises a number of separate constituent organisations namely, the First Line Reserve, the FCA and An Slua Muiri.</P>
      <P>The First Line Reserve is made up of former members of the Permanent Defence Force.  Members of the FCA are not required to have had permanent service prior to joining.</P>
      <P>Different and distinct roles are assigned to these two bodies.</P>
      <P>The role of the First Line Reserve is to provide a pool of fully trained personnel available at short notice to augment Permanent Defence Force Units.</P>
      <P>In the case of the FCA, its role is mainly one of providing military security and, where circumstances require, support for the Permanent Defence Force in local unit areas.  A major re-organisation of the FCA took place just over a decade ago and further organisational developments have taken place since then such as changes in the officer rank structure.</P>
      <P>Amalgamation of the First Line Reserve and the FCA is not contemplated.</P>
      <P>During 1990 the total amount of the Defence Vote allocated to the FCA was about £18 million which was spent on pay, allowances, travelling and subsistence, food, clothing, purchase of vehicles and provision of training accommodation.</P>
      <P>Resources available within the limits of current financial constraints are used to best advantage to achieve a reasonable balance of expenditure &mdash; supply of new equipment and uniforms, continuation of training, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the issue of a new Working Dress for the FCA began and it is hoped <Col N="1124" /> to complete the issue to all members by the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the existing morale within the FCA, in effect the first line of reserve, the Minister's reply is deplorable. Is he aware of the transport problems? One battalion spread across these counties, comprising 700 men who hope to recruit women in future, has one transport vehicle capable of carrying 14 people.  Does the Minister not accept that if it was not for the goodwill of the officers who carry members in their private cars there would be great difficulty regarding training and security?  If the Government are not prepared to acknowledge the role of the FCA, and the work they do, and provide the resources for them they should consider seriously the future existence and role of the FCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate the Government's commitment to the development of the FCA.  In 1990, 20 new minibuses were purchased for the FCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that is not adequate.  They are not satisfied about that and they need some additional equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it reduced to those numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to morale, I am aware from my constituency that there is some dissatisfaction about annual training. This has gone on since 1983.  The FCA considers the training given is not adequate.  I will have that examined as a matter of some urgency to see how we might improve on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister giving a commitment to the House that two weeks' camp training will be initiated this year?  Will the training in July and August be two weeks rather than one week?  Does he consider the 20 new <Col N="1125" /> minibuses purchased to transport FCA personnel around the country are adequate?  Is he aware that many young FCA members have to hitch to their local centre and hitch home again at night? Does he accept that everything is being done to discourage people from enrolling in the FCA and that there is nothing in it at the moment to attract young people? What additional facilities does he intend to provide in FCA locations for the young women who will enrol in the FCA shortly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving absolutely no commitment about any additional training, nor have I said any such thing.  I said I would examine the matter very carefully.  The Deputy might talk to her former colleague who was Minister for Defence, Deputy Cooney, the man who terminated the second week in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has gone on since then. As regards morale, we have advertised for 200 women to join the FCA and there has been a very positive response.  We had more than 750 applications.  That does not seem to bear out what the Deputy said about the FCA.  People are very enthusiastic about being in the FCA at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in his and my home town of Kilrush women have been turned away because there are not facilities there to cater for them in the FCA?  That is commonplace. Of the 750 applicants for enrolment how many were turned away? Will the Minister explain how the £18 million was spent?  It is my belief that about £2 million was spent on the FCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The £18.2 million was spent as follows: Reserve Defence Force pay, £3.209 million; Permanent Defence Forces &mdash; the people who train FCA personnel&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware <Col N="1126" /> of that, and the Minister should know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Following the recent promotion of five officers to the rank of Brigadier-General there are no vacancies in that rank or above that.</P>
      <P>There are at present five vacancies in the rank of colonel and it is intended that a promotion board will be established in the near future to assess the merits of eligible officers who wish to be considered for promotion to fill these appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In filling these appointments, and in regard to the promotion board to be appointed, will the Minister consider including on the promotion board a representative of the officers' representative association, RACO?  Will the Minister agree that that would be a useful mechanism to get over any difficulties or reservations within the Defence Forces about the criteria employed by the promotion board in finally making a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard the Gleeson Commission recommended that the board for promotion to the rank of colonel should consist of the Assistant Chief of Staff, three colonels nominated by the Chief of Staff and a civilian nominated by me on the advice of the Civil Service Commission.  No decision has been taken yet about the composition of that board.  The last promotion board, which has just completed its work, had some discussion with the representative organisations.  I am not certain that it would be advisable or wise to have somebody from the association on the promotion board.  I will certainly keep the Deputy's views in mind.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that with approximately 1,000 personnel stationed in Collins Barracks, Cork the provision of a gymnasium is a <Col N="1131" /> facility that is urgently needed?  At present, as the Minister is aware, people have to travel across the city to other barracks and to other areas for physical training.

I appreciate there is a necessity for this type of facility in places such as Collins Barracks.  I propose to visit that premises fairly soon to see the situation at first hand.  However, I cannot hold out any hope that the work will be undertaken very soon having regard to limited resources and to the many pressing demands that have to be met.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that it is one of the essential requisites of a proper training camp that it would have a proper facility?  Can he indicate also if there are proposals to continue the reroofing programme or to do some work on window replacement.

Already some contracts have been entered into which have to be completed. I can assure the Deputy that as far as I am concerned I will examine the situation very carefully.

I would prefer to have the matter fully examined to see if there is anything we can do there as a matter of urgency. It would be wasting time and fooling people to put something out to tender if we were not prepared to go ahead with the work.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether, having regard to the substantial amount of fish poaching by foreign trawlers, a shift in the allocation of resources of his Department should be made from the Army to the Navy to enable additional fishery protection vessels to be purchased and manned.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The naval service has seven patrol vessels at its disposal for fishery surveillance duties, including two vessels which were acquired in 1988.  The vessels are fitted with modern communications and computerised information systems for use in fishery protection activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the EC approved progamme a contract has been placed for the acquisition of two CASA CN235 maritime patrol aircraft for the Air Corps for the purpose of aerial surveillance of fishery resources.  Pending the manufacture of these aircraft an existing <Col N="1136" /> CASA CN235 aircraft has been purchased for fishery surveillance and will be delivered in June 1991.</P>
    <P>An expansion of the existing Naval service fishery information system is also planned.  The cost of this expansion, together with the cost of aircraft, will be funded to the extent of 50 per cent by the EC over the period from 1991 to 1994.  I am satisfied that these arrangements will significantly enhance the overall efficiency of the fishery surveillance service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply shows extraordinary complacency about the present position.  Every year £150 million worth of Irish fish is plundered by Spanish trawlers.  Would the Minister not agree that the EC should be paying a much higher percentage of the cost?  At the moment they pay only 50 per cent towards capital costs while we have to pay all the running costs.  I am sure the Minister is aware that we get only 5 per cent of the Community catch while we are responsible for 25 per cent of Community policing.  Surely we should be getting a lot more funding from the EC.  Will the Minister undertake to make further representations to the EC for grants towards the running costs as well as the capital costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>An EC funding package was approved for member states in November 1989 for the purpose of improving fishery surveillance.  It is in accordance with these arrangements that a contract was recently placed for the purchase of the two new aircraft to which I referred. They will be delivered in early 1994, but in the meantime there will be immediate delivery of a CASA aircraft.  We have also undertaken a number of very important improvements in the provision of sophisticated data and a satellite communications network which is very effective in the drive against illegal activities. The strength of the Naval Service at the end of March was 990 personnel.  We have a very competent and efficient service which has been very effective in enforcing the fishery regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House if it is true that only two of our fishery protection vessels can be in operation at any given time and that there are not sufficient personnel within the Navy to operate all seven vessels together?  Secondly, can the Minister say what are the capabilities of the two CASA aircraft to be delivered in June in relation to hauling into Irish ports offending trawlers who are poaching our fish so that they can be prosecuted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is that type of misrepresentation that is undermining the work of the fishery protection services. All seven naval vessels are fully operational &mdash; they are the <i>Deirdre,</i> the <i>Emer,</i> the <i>Aoife,</i> the <i>Aisling,</i> the <i>Eithne</i> and the two new vessels which were purchased in 1989, the <i>Orla</i> and the <i>Ciara.</i>  Those vessels will also have a back-up service from the new CASA aircraft.  We will be getting one new CASA in June and not two, lest there be any misunderstanding about that.  We have ordered two CASA aircraft which will be ready about 1993-94.</P>
      <P>Overall I am satisfied that the service is providing excellent protection. Regarding the point raised by Deputy Garland, the Minister for the Marine recently raised at the EC Council of Fisheries meeting the activities of the Spanish vessels in particular.  That matter is being dealt with at Council level by the Minister for the Marine who deals with these matters. I am satisfied that the service is adequate and effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the greatest need in the area of fishery protection is for more sea protection vessels?  Our craft can do so much in the air but there is need for a sea vessel that can confront and, if necessary, arrest the offending trawler.  Accepting that we have seven naval vessels, are there plans to expand that fleet and add to what is the first line of defence of our fishery resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken very effective measures to control the activities of illegal boats fishing off our coastline. There has been a sizeable number of prosecutions and many convictions obtained.  I do not have the details but if the Deputy puts down a separate question I will supply full details of all the successful prosecutions and convictions by the Naval Service in this area.  I am quite satisfied that that service, with existing resources, is capable of dealing adequately with this matter.  With the back-up of the new surveillance craft the service will certainly be far more effective in pin-pointing these activities and moving quickly to put a stop to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if any of the seven vessels are out of commission at present for any reason?  Secondly, are there any restrictions in <Col N="1139" /> relation to the coastal areas they can patrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>They control the full economic zone which is 200 miles.  There is no restriction on their capabilities.  They are quite capable of covering the whole economic zone and all the fishing grounds. Naturally, from time to time, for various reasons, ships will have to be in dock for maintenance, refitting, re-equipping or whatever purpose.  While all the vessels are fully operational and fully staffed at present naturally there will be occasions when all of them will not be operating at the one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>How many vessels are on the waters today?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, but if the Deputy puts down that question I will get the information for him.  I assume they are all out or, if not, they are capable of being out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the present penalties in the event of a successful prosecution are grossly inadequate?  From my information the Spanish fishermen regard the fines imposed by the Irish authorities as part of their normal annual running costs. In that event will the Minister say what steps he is taking to increase the penalties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not come under my responsibility.  However, I can assure the Deputy that heavy fines have been imposed.  In many cases conviction means automatic confiscation of gear which is a very heavy penalty.  There is no shortage of legislation in that regard, but it is a matter the Deputy should take up with the Minister for the Marine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The old dry dock at the naval base is defunct and part of it is leased to Irish Steel Limited.  The docking of naval vessels is arranged by competitive tender from the Liffey Dockyards, Dublin, or the Cork Dockyards, Rushbrooke, who normally compete for the work.  The normal cost of dry docking and painting is in the region of £25,000 or £30,000, depending on the size of the vessel, and the annual expenditure on dry docking of naval vessels is, on average, about £100,000.  The cost of bringing the old dry dock back into operation would be very significant and, having regard to the number of vessels in use in the Naval Service, would be uneconomic.</P>

      <P>By virtue of the provisions of section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State only with a particular international United Nations Force.  No request from the United Nations for assistance of the type envisaged in the question has been received.  Any such request would be considered in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider introducing amending legislation which would change that stipulation and give freedom to the Government to initiate the kind of proposals which I suggested?  Recently in Iraq there has been a problem with the Kurds and there has also been the terrible tragedy in Bangladesh.  As the response of the Irish people has been so generous, will the Minister agree that our Army could make a very valuable contribution to providing relief in these areas if training was provided?  They have a limited function at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the changes in the legislation which the Deputy thinks are desirable are necessary or warranted; usually international assistance is arranged on a co-ordinated basis and this <Col N="1143" /> country has always responded promptly and generously.  Indeed, when we were requested by the United Nations to send a mission to the Iraq-Kuwait border, personnel were ready to go there within a matter of hours.</P>

Copies of the report of the working party were made available to senior management in the Department of Defence and the staff unions in late March and they were asked for their comments.  The working group consisted of officers of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Defence, as well as an officer on loan to the Department of Finance.

The national media talk about submissions and recommendations while the Minister has told us he is negotiating with the unions.  Be it a survey or a report, would he confirm, if whatever document is in <Col N="1146" /> circulation at present contains specific recommendations and if he intends to publish it at any stage?

      <P>On the occasion of my recent visit to South Lebanon during the period 16-20 March 1991 I visited all positions where Irish troops are serving as members of UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>Morale was uniformly high and the troops were discharging their duties with great confidence and efficiency.</P>
      <P>I met and spoke with almost the entire battalion of officers, non-commissioned officers and privates during my visit.  I was greatly impressed by their sense of commitment to the important work which they are undertaking in the cause of international peace.</P>
      <P>During the course of the visit I had discussions with the President of Lebanon, Mr. Hrawi, in Beirut and several high ranking officers of the Lebanese Army, including the General Commanding Officer, General Lahoud.  I also met the Muktar of Tibnin where the headquarters of Irish troops are located and other local representatives and received a number of deputations from local dignitaries.</P>

First, did he give any undertaking that, while he is Minister for Defence, he will visit the troops on an annual basis having regard to the recent break with tradition?  Second, did he give any undertaking to re-establish the annual naval visit to deliver armaments and supplies, which is of significance to the navy and military personnel stationed abroad?  Third, did he make any reference to the commitment given by his predecessor in office that the spokespersons of the other groups in the House would be afforded an opportunity at some stage to visit the troops in Lebanon?</P>

When one considers that 150,000 people have died in the last ten to 15 years in the Lebanon one begins to recognise the vital role being played by Irish personnel.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This mission refers to the Iraq-Kuwait border.  The United Nations Iraq-Kuwait observer mission was set up under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 689 of 9 April 1991.  The observer mission is stationed on the Iraq-Kuwait border.  The mandate of the mission is to monitor the demilitarised zone of approximately 200 kilometres in length, extending 10 kilometres inside Iraq and five kilometres inside Kuwait, from the Iraq-Kuwait border to deter violations of this border and to observe any hostile or potentially hostile action which might be mounted from Iraq or Kuwait.

      <P>I think the need to simplify the regulations has been acknowledged. I certainly would acknowledge this need. I have only recently come to deal with these matters and it appears that this aspect can be addressed on a continuous basis.  In fact, a new regulation will be signed tomorrow afternoon to set the new procedure in place for promotions.  It is desirable that important decisions like this are made.  While it would be desirable to have a streamlined regulation document, regulations can be amended or deleted from time to time.  Therefore, this will be an ongoing developing and changing process.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that since the introduction of the 1954 Defence Act the history of the regulations has been one of amendment, deletion and convolution and that only an expert &mdash; there are very few of these about &mdash; would know his way around these regulations?  Would he agree, also, at least in principle, that the time has come when matters relating to the Defence Forces should be dealt with by way of comonsense, good discipline and order and that there is no need for the formulation of a regulation every time something has to be done or some new exercise undertaken?</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given to me under Standing Order 20 (3) (a) and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Deenihan, the crisis faced by many national youth organisations because of the decrease in funding by the Government resulting in the loss of 50 jobs in the youth service; (2) Deputy Durkan, if the Minister for Agriculture and Food's attention has been drawn to the closure of Sallins meat processing plant at Sallins, County Kildare with the loss of more than 100 jobs and the impact this will have on the economy of the area; whether there are any plans to (a) revive the plant and (b) alleviate the causes of the closure; if the national slaughtering capacity is likely to be detrimentally affected; whether there appears to be a greater threat of monopoly now in the industry; if he will outline the measures he intends to take to protect the industry and the jobs involved; (3) Deputy McCormack, the apparent rundown of the larnród Éireann rail service from Dublin to Galway; (4) Deputy McEllistrim, the proposed closure of the Klopman industry, Tralee, and if the Minister for Industry and Commerce will do everything possible to ensure that it does not close in view of the fact that there are 480 jobs involved; (5) Deputy Gerry Reynolds, the long delay in the payment of headage and TB reactor grants to farmers; (6) Deputy T. Ahearn, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is aware of the devastating affect on the social and economic life in Clonmel that will result from the closure of the Digital factory causing a loss of 350 jobs and the steps he proposes to take regarding this matter; (7) Deputy Moynihan, the serious position facing the Irish tourist industry consequent to the serious fall off in American tourists coming to Ireland; (8) Deputy Owen, the escape <Col N="1170" /> last weekend of youths from Trinity House, Lusk, and the subsequent danger to the staff of the detention centre from debris being thrown by the youths onto staff from the rooftop; (9) Deputy G.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (3), lines 6 and 7, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still dealing with section 3 of the Bill and the import of this amendment is <Col N="1171" /> to delete subsection (3) (f).  I do not want to go over the same ground again because we have covered it in very great detail.  I seek invariably and repeatedly to delimit the powers of this Minister.  This Minister invariably and increasingly seeks to thwart that and drag unto himself more and more powers.  The specifics of this, the subsection which I seek to delete, would confer on the Minister the power to make regulations containing different provisions in relation to different local authorities.  It is very much linked to the previous amendment.  On the last occasion I was objecting to his power to make specific arrangements right down to the subsections for local authorities, to determine the colour of paint on one side of the street, if he was so minded.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that of course he will never use all this power that he is clutching to himself.  I quoted this morning ample evidence of predecessors in his own party who made very broad and sweeping commitments to the electorate in the past only to find afterwards they were hollow.  I am afraid the same thing could well be true in this case.  It is better to be safe than sorry.  I see no reason why this series of sweeping powers should be vested solely in the Minister and his officials.  I will not make the argument at length because we have exhausted the consistent view of this House on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the matter was terminated before the adjournment in relation to the previous amendment. There was one particular item that I should have mentioned.  In the planning legislation area one requires different <Col N="1172" /> provisions to deal with different local authorities because of differences in the planning law as it applies to different authorities.  One example is material change that attaches to planning in so far as the Schedules to the 1963 Act dealing with agricultural processes and agricultural activities, like buildings in an agricultural area, do not necessarily apply in an urban area.  There are differences attached even in planning law to the different types of authorities.  This is just an example.  There are also some differences in the context of the Abattoirs Act dealing with the functions of different local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>For example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are areas where a Minister needs to address himself specifically in a different way to different sized authorities and to different functions that they might have.  For that reason it is necessary to have the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that in the two examples the Minister has just cited in relation to the Planning Acts and the Abattoirs Act, the 1963 Planning Act does give the Minister the power to make regulations in respect of different authorities in the different Schedules of the 1963 Act and that equally the Abbatoirs Act gives the Minister the power to make regulations as they apply differently to different local authorities so that it is not necessary to put that into this Bill?  It is already provided for in relation to planning in the Planning Acts and in relation to abattoirs in the Abattoirs Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just different aspects of this legislation where we are restating things but it is good to do it in <Col N="1173" /> that way so that the local authority would be familiar with what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has evaded the question again.  I did not ask for examples from previous legislation.  I asked for examples that will be consequent on this legislation.  Why does the Minister need this specific power to enact the Local Government Bill?  What particular regulation will the Minister make that will apply in different ways to different local authorities?  Both the examples the Minister gave were different statutes that gave him those powers.  That is a fine way of doing it.  However, from the perspective of this side of the House we want to know specifically what the Minister is going to do.  If he will bring in primary legislation to do it, that is grand and we understand that.  What I object to is giving the Minister a catch-all power to act as he likes.  What does the Minister want this power for?  What element of this Bill, when it is enacted, will be applied differently to different local authorities? Let the Minister convince us that he needs this power, but let him not evade the question as he has done repeatedly in relation to the matter of clutching powers to himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to do something that will not apply generally throughout the whole range of local authorities, depending on their size and so on.  I mentioned before lunch that even in the simple area of expenses and chairman's allowances and things like that one has to specify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal circumstances it might not apply but if the occasion arises the Minister should have the residual power to enable him to specify in a particular area that it will be different in a certain local authority because of its size, its capacity or the functions the Minister contemplates carrying out.  That is a general provision that enables the Minister to do these things.  The Deputy is chasing a hare that is of no consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to catch up with it because the Minister is not stopping to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining it to the Deputy.  I am giving some examples from the past and examples of what might happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are chasing a hare, but the hare has retreated into its burrow and we want to try to entice him back out again.  All the examples that the Minister has cited so far are already provided for in existing legislation, or separately in this Bill.  Neither today nor yesterday, when we dealt with this section, did the Minister come up with a single example of a regulation or an order which it would be necessary for him to make under this section which is not already provided for. What I would like to know is can the Minister give us such an example or, better still, a couple of examples.  All the examples the Minister has given us are either already provided for in some section or other of the Bill specifically &mdash; councillors' expenses, twinning and all these important things &mdash; or the examples today in relation to planning, abattoirs and so on are provided for in separate legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister come back to this section and tell us what he wants it for? Can he give us a few examples of how he proposes to use this power?  There is no point in asking the House to give the Minister powers to make regulations unless we have some idea what he is going <Col N="1175" /> to use the power for.  I would certainly like to know that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a standard provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Give us one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a standard provision. It is in many other Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a standard provision and consequently it is there to be used if the Minister decides that he has to use that function in a residual way to control any situation.  He is only doing it in the wider public interest.  In any legislation there is often a general provision to enable things to happen.  That is why it is being put in there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference.  In specific legislation dealing with derelict sites or any other issue we know we are dealing with a confined area of activity and we would all have a fair idea of the kind of regulations the Minister would wish to make in such an area.  That is perfectly understandable, and it is perfectly understandable to have a general provision in a Bill such as that, but this is different.  This is a general provision that seeks to override what local authorities will be doing.  The Minister wants the section to be included in the Bill, in the form he has proposed, but so far all Opposition amendments have been rejected by the Minister, with one relatively minor exception and the rest of the amendments will meet the same fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should make a case for this section.  It is not good enough for him to say it is a general provision, that he might need it, that he would use it in the public interest, that he would not use it to make people pay water charges, and that he would not use it for this, that, or the other.  What is the intention?  For what will it be used?  To date, the Minister has not provided Members with a single <Col N="1176" /> example and I would like to hear some examples.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not hear examples.  It is not my intention to act in that way.  It is not necessary for me to set out one example, 20 examples, or 20,000 examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Try one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision is required to enable the Minister to deal with matters that may arise at some future time when he needs to act in the public interest.  The Minister will then have the provision to deal with these matters at that time without having to come back to the House in order to correct a matter and have Members baying that the matter should have been corrected in the first instance.  That is what the provision does. This is essential to enable the Minister to pursue the legislation properly and to make it work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said we were chasing a hare; I think the hare has just been cornered.  The Minister started off by trying to pretend that there were specific requirements for the provision.  Each of the four specific illustrations given by the Minister showed us that the provision was unrelated and unnecessary &mdash; they were either provided for specifically in sections of this Bill or were the subject of separate legislation in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has finally admitted that what he really wants is to have the power to do what he likes after the event.  The only veneer he puts on it is to say it has been done before.  That is a very poor reason.  We are talking about a fundamental piece of so-called reform &mdash; and those are the words used by the Minister &mdash; that will embrace two most important concepts, the principle of subsidiarity and the breaching of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule to really give powers to local communities and local authorities.  The Minister has finally admitted that he has no intention of taking any powers out of the Custom House, that he will keep to himself the final say on anything that <Col N="1177" /> might arise.  This provision is clear.  The Minister wants the final say in case anybody does something he does not like &mdash; that is what the provision boils down to. That is the reason we reject this section, and we are pressing our amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to weigh in and speak on the issue again.  I ask the Minister to consider the reasonable points and concerns expressed from this side of the House.  In an explanation a few moments ago the Minister used the words &ldquo;in order that the Minister can control&rdquo;.  That is the substance of the Bill, the Minister wants to control everything. Why should the Minister get involved in matters such as twinning, civic honours or publishing lists of councillors' expenses? Why does he want to get involved in that minutiae?  Why not leave some local discretion?  There is little enough of that. Why does the Minister want to control everything?  In light of the points made on this key section again and again yesterday and today, would the Minister not agree to think overnight about some moderating amendment on Report Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing an amendment that refers specifically to whether the Minister should have power to make different regulations for different authorities.  We should confine ourselves to that.  That is what the Chair sees to be the kernel of the matter under discussion.  We should confine ourselves to that, and we might make more headway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine myself to the amendment.  The Minister has now been invited on successive occasions to explain himself and to explain the provision he seeks.  He has been invited to give just one example to illustrate the need for this provision; one example that is not already provided for in other legislation or in some other Part of the Bill. The Minister has failed to give a single example to illustrate the necessity of the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> The Minister wants to be able to make regulations that can contain different provisions in relation to different local authorities.  That is what we want out of the Bill.  Why would the Minister want such a power?  Why would he want a power that would enable him to tell Mayo County Council they could do one thing and Dublin County Council or Dublin City Council that they would have to do another?  This is a very sinister provision; it is a provision that is wide open to abuse.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister is not above treating different local authorities in different ways.  For example, I recall the distribution of national lottery funds last year when it seemed to me that if all communities had done as well proportionately as Mayo County Council we would have less to complain about.  In the distribution of housing money, again it seems the Minister is aware of some need for housing in Mayo and a lesser need in the rest of the country.  The same applies to roads.  It would now appear that all roads lead west, and if a road is not on the Minister's route to Castlebar, then its chances of getting attention are fairly remote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister already has a fairly good record in making different financial provisions to different local authorities.  The next question that has to be asked is, what is the Minister going to do by way of order or regulation?  The nub of the matter is that the Minister wants the power to be able to make a regulation if, for example, after the next local elections a local county council, such as Wexford County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could make regulations for a council such as that when the composition of the council and the decisions they would make might not be to the liking of his party, that would be different from regulations he would make in regard to a more favoured county council &mdash; if there are any left after 27 June &mdash; in which his own party have a majority.  This provision allows the Minister to do that.  The provision is highly partisan.  It provides for no equity between local authorities.  It allows the Minister to do what he likes and to say to one county council &ldquo;You do this&rdquo; and to another county council &ldquo;You do that&rdquo;. Such a measure is highly irregular.  There is no precedent in any legislation for such a provision.</P>
      <P>I thought that perhaps the Minister &mdash; what was that phrase the quality newspaper used in relation to the Minister? yes, the Minister's &ldquo;superior knowledge&rdquo;&mdash; with his superior knowledge would explain the reason to those of us who apparently do not possess the same degree of knowledge and did not see. The Minister has not been able to tell us. He has offered no justification for it, and in the absence of a justification, we can only think the worst and ask that the provision be deleted.</P>

      <P>That was why I agreed to take Deputy Howlin's amendment; it can only be used and these regulations can only be made for the purposes of this legislation, so you cannot suggest it is going to be used in a way other than this legislation seeks to address.  The Deputy wants just one example but then I could be asked to give another one and there could be 20 or 30.  The accounts for certain local authorities are done differently from others and the accounts for Dublin Corporation are done in a certain way, different and separately from the way they are done in other counties.  Maybe the Minister, for the wider public interest, would require that they stay that way, or they might all go in the same direction and be formalised in the same way as Dublin Corporation's accounts are.  That has been even recommended by other Deputies on another occasion. One might wish to have all local authority accounts devised and promoted and published in a certain way, or one might wish that they should be different.  That is only one simple example, but to be able to do that you have to have the provision to enable you to do it.  You might wish to direct it in that way.  It is continuing a practice that is there in the 1955 Act.</P>

      <P>I am trying to read through the provisions of the 1955 Act. Are we talking about the Local Government Act, 1955, No. 9 of that year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking at the Local Government Act, 1955 and its provisions. It includes a whole range of provisions and they are quite specific.  The Bill is fairly broad in scope.  It does not focus on planning exclusively or on any one aspect we can argue about.  It is very <Col N="1181" /> sweeping legislation inasmuch as it touches on virtually every aspect of local administration.  In this section the Minister wants to clutch to himself a series of powers to make regulations, as he sees fit, that apply, as he sees fit, to local authorities differently, case by case as he sees fit, that can apply within a local boundary case by case so that what might apply on one side of a street might not apply on the other.  Repeatedly an amazing array of powers is being clutched by the Minister in relation to this.  The only vestige of a reason he has given for all this is that it is a provision that is in other enactments.  We need some time and we have asked for it and when the Minister throws out a Bill on the floor of the House we have not the time to go through its specific provisions.</P>
      <P>On the generality of the issues we are talking about, will the Minister not accept that the power he seeks to clutch to himself is much too all-encompassing and he has given no reason whatsoever for the powers he has?  We on this side of the House are not happy that he would not be minded to abuse these powers or use them in a way we would not agree with. He could give no guarantees that a successor of his would not abuse these powers.  They are far too broad, sweeping and all-encompassing to be put into an enactment like this.  I ask the Minister to think again on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting that. We have gone through it in some detail and pursued it as far as one could expect. Deputy Gilmore wants a specific example.  I have given him an example that I know will not satisfy him.  The provision is not new.  It allows the Minister only to make regulations with the purpose of this Bill in mind.  If the Deputy wants another example I can give it to him but I want to resist starting to go down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be necessary to have different types of annual reports attached to different sized authorities, as between a very large one and a very small one.  These areas come up on an ongoing basis.  The Minister should have this residual power <Col N="1182" /> to be able to deal with these matters.  I propose the matter be disposed of now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he has contradicted himself in offering that example.  The Bill makes no provision at all for financial provisions.  That is one of our criticisms of the Bill.  The Minister is saying he can make regulations only for matters which are comprehended by the Bill.  If the Bill does not comprehend financial provisions how does he propose to make regulations dealing with the accounting procedures and so on in various local authorities unless, as I suspect, the Minister intends to make regulations which go beyond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The requirement of this amendment is to delete section 3 (3) (c) which is that regulations or an order under this Bill may: &ldquo;provide for the giving of directions by the Minister (including directions amending or revoking any such directions)&rdquo;. It is the same case, the same arguments and I am weary of them.  It is another layer of powers given to the Minister to give directions as he sees fit, with no limit and to revoke directions as he sees fit.  It is totally wrong.  Again I ask the Minister at least to consider at this stage giving some semblance of democratic accountability and control before this Bill goes completely off the rails.  If section 3 goes through as envisaged by the Minister there is no question of calling this a local administration reform Bill.  It is simply a centralisation of power in the hands of the Minister of the day.  That is the long and short of it.</P>

      <P>To whom is the Minister referring in this subsection?  It should have occurred to those of us who have served on local authorities that the one person who may well be affected by this provision is the county manager.  It seems that the Minister wants enshrined in legislation the power to direct the county manager in any county to act in the way he desires.</P>
      <P>The role of the county manager in the affairs of local government is a very important one.  It was suggested this morning by a Deputy on this side of the House in a wide ranging contribution in which he touched upon many sections that it would be dangerous if the county manager was beholden to the Minister for his job.  That was in relation to possible renewal of his seven year contract, but this presents an even more direct challenge. There could be a conflict of interest between the desire of a local authority to do something and that of the Minister to prevent something being done.</P>
      <P>I thought the whole function of the Bill was to give local authorities and local communities the power to control their own affairs and destinies.  However, if the Minister is given the authority to direct a county manager to comply with his instructions then a county manager, or any official, will be placed in an invidious position and there certainly would be a conflict of interest.  The first loyalty of the county manager should surely be to the local authority he manages but this would appear to be in conflict with the requirement in this subsection that he comply with the directions of the Minister.</P>
      <P>This underscores the points we made <i>ad nauseam</i> that the pretence of devolving power is merely that, a sham.  The Minister is seeking to maintain to himself the power to control affairs at local level right down to streets and houses and now personnel.  It is necessary that these amendments be accepted if we are to have any semblance of local democracy once the Bill is enacted.</P>

      <P>I wish in the first instance to refer to subsection (8) which is the subject of amendment No. 23.  That subsection if one analyses it, is a very strange animal and an extremely dangerous provision. The position ought to be that when an Act of the Oireachtas gives a Minister the authority to do a particular <Col N="1193" /> thing the Minister should be obliged to stay within the extent of the power devolved to him.  It is bad enough that he is taking to himself an indecent and excessive power in the Bill but, leaving that aspect aside for the moment, what he is at in subsection (8) is both invidious and dangerous.</P>
      <P>He is giving himself the power to exceed the authority given to him by the Bill.  He is taking on the power in effect to overrule the Bill.  Why do I say this? The subsection states, &ldquo;and every act done pursuant to such a direction shall be deemed to be done under the authority of this Act&rdquo;.  It would not matter for one moment if he gives a direction which exceeds his power, because the subsection states that any act done shall be deemed to be done under the authority of the Act; therein lies the danger.  Any lawyer will say that when one sees the words, &ldquo;deemed to be done&rdquo; one should set off the alarm bells immediately because when you say that something is deemed to be something else, it means that it is not that at all, it is something quite different, otherwise you would not have to deem one thing to be another.</P>
      <P>If the Minister exceeds the power and authority he is taking onto himself in the Bill could he explain why this House should have to agree that the direction he would issue should be deemed to be done within the powers of this Bill when it is not?  Why on earth should the Minister seek that power?  Would it not be sufficient for his purpose to say that a person affected by a direction under this Bill shall comply with it and that it shall have effect accordingly?  If the Minister has done something <i>ultra vires</i> and this brings in the whole doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> acting beyond his powers, he should not have done it and he has no business doing it, and if he exceeds his powers, it should be challengeable in the courts.  Why should the Minister take <i>carte blanche</i> and put in a provision deeming something as lawful if he has exceeded his authority under this Bill?  That is what this provision means; if it does mean that it means nothing, and if it means nothing it should not be in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> I will deal briefly with the previous subsection.  I am sure the substance of it has been debated long and hard earlier but nonetheless I will comment on it.  It is far too wide a power for the Minister to seek to take onto himself that broad spectrum of being able to make certain orders and regulations under the Bill subject to control by the House.  We have debated many times this issue of positive resolution and the negative resolution.  I have been in this House many times, when the Fianna Fáil Party were on the other side of the House and argued long and bitterly about how undemocratic it was and how outrageous it was, but when they are in Government it is a different story.  Then they follow the parliamentary draftsmen when it suits them. They have less reason to support it now than they had when they were in Opposition because when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they had the opportunity, if they were mindful to do so, to put down annulling resolutions because they were allocated Private Members' time every week.  The Fine Gael Party have some opportunity of doing that too but the Labour Party, The Workers' Party, to say nothing of any independent Member, would have no opportunity of putting down an annulling resolution because the time span between allocations of time in Private Members' Time is so wide &mdash; perhaps once every term.  It looks fine on the face of it to some outsider who would not understand the workings of the Dáil or the opportunity for a Member or a party to get something down on the Order Paper but the reality is otherwise.  For all practical purposes, as far as the smaller parties are concerned, as a safeguard it means absolutely nothing; frankly we would prefer if the provision was not in the Bill at all because at least on the surface there would not appear to be a colour of fairness and democracy about matters.  This gives the Bill a colour which it does not warrant in reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking away the democratic rights of elected Members to call into question orders that he makes from the Custom House, laws that he makes <Col N="1195" /> in the Custom House, which are not subject to review in this House.  In subsection (8) he is taking upon himself the very grandiose power of overruling an Act of the Oireachtas and setting at naught the elimination of those very wide powers being devolved to him under this Bill. Not content with the exercise of those powers he is saying that even if he exceeds these powers it will be deemed to be all right.  This is extremely dangerous and people should know what the Minister is about.  It is a dangerous precedent and should not have been included.  The House should not accept it.</P>

      <P>I remember being at a residents' meeting some time ago and I am sure many Members will have shared this experience.  An issue arose and the council members explained to the residents that we did not really have any decision in the matter because the decision was made by the county manager. One resident got up and said very forcibly that he elected us and not the county manager or the town clerk.  The public find it very difficult to understand the division of functions between the reserved functions of elected members and the executive functions of management. Very often the public are frustrated that the people they have elected, and those whom they will elect on 27 June, cannot make the decision on a whole range of matters because these decisions are effectively made by the manager.  I make that point because I fear subsection (8) will compound that problem because not only do we have the reserved functions of the council, the executive functions of the manager, we will now have an additional set of functions, the &ldquo;do as you are told functions&rdquo; which are being conferred under this section and where the Minister can direct the county manager to do something and the county manager will have to do it and will have the full authority of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give some examples where I believe this will cause problems. A couple of years ago a well publicised situation arose in the Dublin County <Col N="1196" /> Council area following a Supreme Court decision which awarded £2 million planning compensation to a developer called Brennan and McGowan for Grange Developments.  The county council were outraged that the ratepayers of County Dublin and taxpayers generally would have to pay out £2 million of public funds for a developer who had left many housing estates unfinished all over County Dublin and had one of the worst records anywhere in the country for unfinished housing estates, yet their claim for £2 million would have to be paid.  The county council took a decision at a council meeting to instruct the manager not to pay it.  It appeared for a day or so that the manager was going to comply with that decision, but then he was summoned by the Minister to the Custom House and was told to pay it.  Many of us were very critical of the manager at that time for having complied with the Minister's wishes.  If this Bill had been in place, the Minister would have issued a directive and the manager would have had to comply with it.</P>
    <P>The question this subsection raises is who will be directing the manager.  We have the problem already that managers tend to act very much independently of the elected members in many cases. Elected members may want to give a direction, the Minister may give a conflicting direction.  How does this square with section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955?</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the planning decisions let us use the example of a local authority passing a resolution under section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act giving a direction to a county manager to, for example, provide a travellers' halting site in a particular location.  If the Minister issues a direction under this section which conflicts with the direction of the council and directs the manager to put the halting site somewhere else, which direction will the manager have to comply with?  Will he have to comply with the direction he has been given by the elected members of his council or the direction given by the Minister?  There is a conflict here which <Col N="1197" /> is not reconciled anywhere in the Bill.  As I understand the section, no matter what the council may decide or what the wishes of a manager may be, the Minister can give a direction to the manager.</P>
    <P>In a recent case involving Dublin County Council there was a conflict between the elected members of the council and the manager over a temporary travellers' halting site in Mulhuddart where the manager wanted to proceed in one direction and the council wanted to proceed in a different direction. Will the Minister be able to give a direction to a manager in those circumstances? Conflict also arose recently in Cork over the jailing of householders for the non-payment of water charges. The manager decided to look for committal orders against a number of householders who had not paid water charges and the council, as I understand it, pursuant to section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act passed a motion directing the manager not to pursue that line of action.  The manager ignored that motion.  I understand there is considerable question as to whether the manager was correct in ignoring the direction of the council in that case.</P>
    <P>Under this section the Minister can give a direction to managers.  What will happen if the Minister gives a direction to a manager which is in direct conflict with the direction he has received from the elected council?  The Minister should explain this point which I regard as a recipe for chaos.  A county manager will not know from whom he has to take direction, the elected council or the Minister. As has been said earlier, because the Minister will now have the power to decide how long a manager can stay in office and whether or not his tenure of office should be renewed, it would be understandable if a county manager decided that the safest thing to do was what the Minister told him.  The proposal in this section is a reversal of local democracy. Not only will we have the existing problem of conflict between elected councils and appointed managers but we will have the additional problem of managers who, because of this legislation, <Col N="1198" /> will say, &ldquo;We have to do what we are told by the Minister because it says so in section 3 (8) of the Local Government Act, 1991.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As Deputy Howlin rightly said, we have been over this ground before.  However Deputy Taylor has added some fresh points to which I should like to respond.  Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24 involve the deletion of section 3 (7), (8) and (9).  These amendments are consequent on Deputy Howlin's amendment No. 13, which was defeated, in which he sought that all regulations and orders should be approved in draft. Deputy Taylor was concerned that the provisions might be dangerous.  I should like to point out to him that similar provisions appear in a number of Acts relating to local government.  I shall give some examples.  Section 64 of the Abattoirs Act, 1988 and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;section 15 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, use the same terminology, &ldquo;shall be deemed to be done under the authority of the Act and shall have effect accordingly&rdquo;. There is also a reference to this provision in section 11 of the Local Government Act, 1941, and section 20 of the 1939 agricultural grants Act.  I cannot remember any of those provisions causing undue stress in their application.  They are very rarely used, if at all.  These provisions are simply a necessary safeguard given to the Minister who has responsibility for the overall supervision of the local government system.  They have never caused any difficulty in the past and I cannot imagine that they will cause any difficulty in the future.  Section 11 of the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, provides that all and any directions of the Minister relating to national roads must be complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised in regard to the person who would be involved.  This is defined in the 1937 Interpretation Act <Col N="1199" /> and covers a corporate body of any kind as well as an individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What individual has the Minister in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be an individual or a corporate body, the local authority or the county manager.  In practice, directions are given to the local authority and they have to be complied with by the manager or the council, as appropriate. There are very few examples of the issue of this kind of directive.  I understand that they usually apply to a county secretary in relation to, say, technical amendments which would have to be put in place for a polling scheme following a boundary extension.  If a boundary extension was granted for an urban district council certain readjustments may have to be made in so far as the polling scheme is concerned to the administrative area.  On occasion, directions have to be given to the county secretary in that regard.  This is where the individual would be involved.  In normal circumstances it would be the corporate body as distinct from the individual who would be involved.  However, the &ldquo;person&rdquo; covers both.</P>
      <P>I know it will be of little comfort to Deputy Taylor to say that one can have a different attitude depending on the side of the House one is on but apart from that this provision has stood the test of time.  No examples come to mind of where this provision was abused or misued in any way.  It is a useful safeguard and one would have to accept that it should be included in this type of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the answer is &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;.  That is what the Minister is implying.  The 1955 Act gives to local councillors the very important reserved power of directing the city or county manager to do anything that is legal.  It is one of the few powers they have.  There is a provision here under subsection (8) whereby a Minister can give a direction which is at variance or in conflict with a valid direction of the elected council under the 1955 City and County Managers Act.  Which of the directions will be the superior direction?  Will it be the ministerial direction under this Bill or will it be the council direction under the 1955 Act?</P>

Under section 4 of the City and County Managers Act the council can direct the manager to build a road according to a certain line.  I am using a case in point where I myself moved a section 4 motion to change the line of a road because, in my view, the original line would have unnecessarily inconvenienced many people.  Let us say the council decide to change the line of a road to go behind a housing estate rather than in front of it.  Can a ministerial direction under this subsection insist on the manager keeping to the original line?</P>

The Minister calls them residual powers, but they are very extensive residual powers.  I did not put down any amendments to subsections (7), (8) and (9) because I accepted that they were routine expressions.  What are not routine however, are the powers expressed in the Bill.  Elsewhere in the Bill the Minister can give directions of all sorts.  Deputy Taylor has quoted a case where the Minister can actually deem existing law to be overruled.  I quoted the last subsection of section 40 which is another instance where the Minister can make an order or regulation overruling even an existing statute.  Now, under subsection (8), is the Minister saying categorically that he cannot give a direction which overrides a valid section 4 direction of the elected council?</P>

      <P>Please allow me to make this point.  Supposing the Castlebar Urban District Council ordered the manager, under section 4, to build a ring road around Castlebar, would it be valid under this subsection for the Minister to direct him not to do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear about the matter.  Subsequent to such a decision being taken the Minister might not provide the funds to build the road, that would be an entirely different matter.  As for making a decision because of a wish to do something, a local authority can do so if they so wish.  Of course, that does not necessarily mean that it will happen. Does that settle the matter, Deputy Mitchell?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with something that would not cause the Minister to have to give money.  I wish to talk about that part of section 3 dealing with the famous section 4 motions.  Will section 3 (8) give the Minister authority to overrule a council decision on the matter of a section 4 motion?</P>
      <P>In the Minister's Second Stage speech he said that the idea was to make the granting of section 4 motion's more difficult but that they could not be eliminated because of the necessity for elected members to have that right.  I agree with the Minister's views on that issue.  The issue was raised first by Deputy Mitchell from the point of not giving full authority to the Executive.  If this new section becomes part of the Bill will the Minister have authority to overrule in a case in which the Executive does not implement the section 4 wishes of a council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with several practical cases in my experience as a member of a local authority, Galway County Council, <Col N="1206" /> within the past year or two in which the county manager did not implement section 4 motions as passed by the council. However, in the Minister's own county of Mayo, the county manager does implement the section 4 applications as passed by the council.  According to the new Bill, will the Minister have authority to overrule when a manager does not accept the wishes of the members as regards section 4 applications, or does section 3 (8) give the Minister authority to uphold the decision of elected councillors in the passing of legitimate section 4 applications?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in so far as the implementation of section 4 motions is concerned.  I am taking the general view. While I do not know the details of the way in which Galway County Council conduct their business in relation to section 4 motions, I do know that section 4 motions are put through that council for certain matters but on occasions it has been intimated to me that the county manager did not implement them. However, I always understood &mdash; and Deputies may correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that the manager had indicated that he had received legal advice that he should not do so.  If a manager receives legal advice that he or she should not pursue a certain matter in a certain way in relation to section 4 motions there is an opportunity for the aggrieved person <Col N="1208" /> to pursue the matter in another form.  I am not about to go into that issue now, I do not think that the committee should go into it.  I certainly hope that no Member is suggesting that the Minister should be involved in the issuing of directions about planning matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the reverse, I think. That is the issue that Opposition Members have been trying to address.  I wish to re-focus on the nub of the issue, that is, the Minister's power under this subsection to circumvent the decision of elected members.  It is clear that the Minister has very strong and broad general powers to make directions and to give instructions under section 3 (8).  Under that subsection a body, person, or corporate entity is obliged to obey that direction. As my colleague, Deputy Taylor has indicated, even when the direction supersedes legal authority it may be deemed to be lawful.</P>
      <P>Several hypothetical questions have been put about the issue of conflicting orders, we have not received a satisfactory answer.  I pose yet another question. Suppose the Minister initiated a procedure and under this provision gave direction to every local authority to construct a halting site.  If a local authority decided that in their area a halting site would not be suitable because there was already one in an adjoining area and so gave direction to the manager not to build a halting site.  In such a conflict which order would be the superior?  Would the superior order be that of the elected members to the manager or would it be the instruction of the Minister under section 3 (8)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot give such a direction in that manner under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section?  Can I tease out the answer finally?  Twice the Minister has said that that is not possible, but it is not clear what is possible.  Would the Minister please explain what particular regulations and powers would <Col N="1209" /> devolve on the Minister under the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer can be stated in one simple sentence.  It is not a purpose of this Bill, and the Minister cannot therefore issue a direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pursue with the Minister an example that would clearly arise under the terms of the Bill.  Dublin County Council propose to build a sewer at Carrickmines Valley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants it built, if I remember correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The sewer will connect the Carrickmines Valley sewerage system to the Shanganagh sewage treatment works.  It will go through the functional area of Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  The point at which it will go through the functional area of Dún Laoghaire Corporation is the Loughlinstown Ecology Park.  Obviously, that will create a stink.  The Minister could give a direction under the Bill as part of the reorganisation of Dublin that responsibility for the laying of the sewer pipes be transferred from Dún Laoghaire Corporation to Dublin County Council and to the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area committee.  He can give such a direction under this Bill.  Sewers will be a matter for Dublin County Council.  Suppose Dún Laoghaire Borough Council then, who are still in existence, instruct their manager, by a section 4 motion, to reroute the line of the sewer pipe or refuse to allow it to come through the Loughlinstown Ecology park, and to resolve this issue the Minister then says &mdash; because he can do it for any part of a functional area and so on: &ldquo;As sewers are a matter now for the area committee I am giving a direction that the sewer goes through the ecology park&rdquo;, which is going to win, the section 4 decision of <Col N="1210" /> the borough council, which is a perfectly valid decision, or the Minister's decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the purposes of this Bill in section 5, for example, for the local authority to carry out a survey with respect to the local community.  Let us say that by a section 4 resolution Mayo County Council direct the manager to carry out a survey as to the feasability of having a travellers' halting site at a location in or near Castlebar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Or Headford, and if the manager does not like the idea and wants to squash it from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, he then issues a directive.  That comes directly within the ambit of this Bill.  It is specifically given in section 5.  As the manager says, if a section 4 motion is valid it is lawful and binding as a statutory power. The Minister's directive under subsection <Col N="1211" /> (8) would purport to be the same.  It comes within the ambit of the Bill specifically in section 5 (2) (c), and then the Minister would be left with the rather embarrassing situation of having two perfectly valid contradictory obligations in law.</P>

Directions in so far as they comply with this Bill can only be given where there is a specific provision for this in the relevant section of this Bill or for the purposes of the Bill.  All the hypothetical cases that have been trotted out have nothing to do with this Bill.  The Deputies are talking about other Acts from which they might like to have such a power removed from the Minister, but they have nothing to do with this Bill.

I have made my position clear on this issue on a number of occasions relating to the matter before the House now, to Ballybay Meat Exports Limited, or to angel dust.

    <P>Since 1989 there have been no fewer than 90 parliamentary questions answered by five Ministers.  In addition, <Col N="1214" /> the group's affairs were discussed at length and in depth when the Dáil was recalled last August to consider the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990.  It can hardly be claimed, therefore, that this House has not had sufficient time or opportunity to consider the affairs of this group.  In reply to some of these questions I have outlined in detail the regulatory and control procedures in the beef sector. I would now like again to place on the record of this House the scope and operations of the regulatory and control procedures affecting payments under the European market support system.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, with reference to State agencies involved in the Common Agricultural Policy control system, the Department of Agriculture and Food is the agency primarily responsible for application of the Common Agricultural Policy regulations here.  The customs authorities also have an important role as regards import and export control.  This system has been in place since our accession to the European Community. It is the system which has been operated by all Governments in this State since 1973.</P>
    <P>As far as the role of the Department of Agriculture and Food is concerned, a total of over £660 million of Community funds paid by the Department of Agriculture and Food each year in respect of the beef industry involves many thousands of individual transactions.  About 400 of the Department's staff are engaged in the control and monitoring of the operation giving rise to these payments and in administering the systems generally at headquarters, at 42 meat export plants and associated cold stores, at 32 public cold stores and at export points.  Veterinary inspectors and staff in a number of agricultural officer grades are employed by the Department supervising all operations at meat export plants.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the wide range of Community regulations which are applied. The Community regulations applicable to the cattle and beef sector are many and complex.  They include provisions on export refunds &mdash; that is subsidies to third countries; intervention buying &mdash; that is <Col N="1215" /> beef bought up on behalf of the European Community; intervention sales and aids to private storage &mdash; that is where private traders are paid to keep the product off the market for specified periods.  In its application of the system the Department follow explicit standards laid down in European Community Regulations as well as rules of practice agreed with the European Commission and with other member states.  This applies in particular to infringements and irregularities and suspected cases of both &mdash; an area in which the Department maintain close liaison with the European Commission. I will come back to illustrate that further to ensure that there can be no shadow of doubt or suspicion from anyone in this House as to the controls we put in place and our exemplary standards in so doing.</P>
    <P>Whenever an irregularity is suspected an investigation is immediately set in train in accordance with explicit standard procedures.  If imports or exports are involved, this investigation is carried out in close co-operation with the customs authorities.  Where it is established that an irregularity has occurred, which has resulted in FEOGA funds being incorrectly paid, the Department recover the amount from the trader or from the securities held against the operator or, where necessary, initiate civil proceedings to recover it.</P>
    <P>Should suspected fraud arise in instances where there is reason to believe there is misrepresentation with fraudulent intent, the practice is to refer the matter to the Garda Síochána for investigation. Where such an investigation produces evidence of an offence, the Garda refer the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions who decides whether a prosecution is warranted.</P>
    <P>The Department's administration of the Common Agricultural Policy regime is subject to numerous independent checks.  These are carried out by the European Court of Auditors and by the European Commission's audit services in addition to the audits carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General and <Col N="1216" /> the Department's own internal audit unit.</P>
    <P>On the role of the customs authorities, exporters' entitlements to the payment of refund subsidies are determined by the type and quantity of goods being exported.  It is the function of customs to certify that the particulars declared by exporters in the relevant customs documentation are correct.  The certified documentation is then forwarded to the Department of Agriculture and Food as the paying agency.  Where declarations are made customs, as part of their normal function, carry out regular spot checks on the goods being brought under customs control, while under customs control and at the point of exit from the country. These controls are carried out routinely throughout the country at meat plants and at cold stores and customs have a full-time presence at ports approved for the export of live cattle.</P>
    <P>Where an irregularity comes to light, or is suspected in relation to particulars declared by customs or to customs, an investigation is carried out by local customs staff, augmented where necessary by staff from the customs investigation branch and assisted, where appropriate, by staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Such an investigation may involve close surveillance of the activities of the firm, the thawing, weighing and physical examination of individual cartons and consignments of beef, checks on weights of cattle and audit of a firm's commercial record.  Where an investigation discloses evidence of an irregularity, the matter is reported to the Department of Agriculture and Food as the paying agency.  In addition to these regular checks and investigations, customs also carry out an annual audit on the commercial and financial records of a selected number of CAP traders.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately described these controls in some detail because I want to assert to this House that these controls work well.  The facts speak for themselves. Ireland has consistently been among the member states with the lowest proportion of disallowances of CAP expenditure.  In fact, in the years 1986, <Col N="1217" /> 1987 and 1988 &mdash; the last years for which official figures from the European Community are available &mdash; Ireland actually had the lowest proportion of CAP expenditure disallowed in each year of 12 member states, despite the attempt being made constantly in this House to give the impression that either the official controls or otherwise put us at a level akin almost to condoning criminality, if not being party to it.</P>
    <P>In these three years Ireland's percentage of disallowances ranged from 0.24 per cent to 0.32 per cent of CAP expenditure in Ireland.  In absolute and relative terms, these figures are minuscule when compared with a total amount of CAP expenditure in Ireland, which is of the order of £1 billion a year</P>
    <P>Ireland's performance is checked and audited by the EC institutions and compares more than favourably with figures of 4 per cent to 5 per cent in some other countries.  I must emphasise that this record is what has emerged from the checking and auditing activities of the EC institutions.  They are not my figures; they are European Community figures.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to the results achieved by the high regulatory control system.  Our system has functioned satisfactorily over the years.  Irregularities have been uncovered of course, and firm, decisive and important action has been taken in all cases.  Here again, the figures speak for themselves.  In addition to regular rejection of products ineligible for intervention, the Department have clawed back £5.5 million approximately in respect of export refunds and £0.5 million in respect of the aids to private storage schemes.  To place these amounts disallowed in context, let me remind the House that CAP expenditure in Ireland is of the order of £1 billion a year.</P>
    <P>I should now indicate that arising from the special investigation by my Department and the customs into the 1988 APS scheme, in co-operation with the Commission &mdash; and I referred to this matter in the House a while back &mdash; financial penalties totalling £3.6 million have been imposed on the firms involved.  This system, established initially as long ago <Col N="1218" /> as 1973, has been the subject of constant re-evaluation and upgrading not least by this Government or by the extra stringent controls that we put in place with the establishment of a separate intervention unit within the Department in October 1990.  In addition, in January of this year with the full vigorous endorsement of Government, I launched a special action control inquiry system in the Department in support of the local control officers. Under this system, control inquiry teams inquire into Common Agricultural Policy control procedures on an unannounced basis and make an immediate report to headquarters.</P>
    <P>Follow-up action is the responsibility of the relevant division and includes the application of penalties, disallowances and referrals to the Garda where necessary. So far, nine such inquiries have taken place this year, including four in the meat sector, and a further 16 are planned for the remainder of the year.  I would stress, in regard to the control inquiry teams, that their work is in support of the local control officer.</P>
    <P>A point I wish to make crystal clear at this stage is that all of these irregularities were discovered by the Irish control system.  They were not brought to light by the media or other outside interests. Of course the successful operation of this complicated regime largely depends on the professionalism and integrity of all the officials involved.  Let me formally put it on the record of this House that I have the highest regard for the commitment and dedication to duty of all the staff concerned in discharging this complicated work.  Indeed, since becoming Minister I have consistently let it be known that only the continual maintenance of such a high level of commitment and dedication would be acceptable.  From the veterinary and agricultural officers at local level to the administrative staff making final payments, the highest standards of duty are maintained and it is absolutely essential to reject out of hand any snide innuendoes to the contrary.  I should also make it clear that in this I include customs <Col N="1219" /> officials at every level whose co-operation with my Department can only be described as exemplary.  Any slur on the general character and good name of our national officials, particularly from any Member of this House, is to be totally deplored.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this point to say that the case involving the Waterford plant of AIBP referred to in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme of 13 May 1991 &mdash; the House will be aware that other allegations referred to a plant outside our jurisdiction &mdash; is a classic example of efficient and effective controls in operation. Here the customs authority in the course of a routine check uncovered irregularities which occurred in 1986, before I became Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I can tell the House that inquiries continued vigorously in 1987 when I was Minister and resulted in a finiancial penalty of almost £1.1 million being imposed on and paid by AIBP.  Moreover, this matter was referred to the Garda authorities as soon as the investigations were completed and the file was passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions in January 1988.</P>
    <P>While it is not the practice to make statements to the House about specific Garda investigations except in singular instances where the circumstances are so essential that such a course is deemed to be warranted, in the particular circumstances obtaining in this instance I can inform the House that the Garda authorities have indicated that in 1988 the Department of Agriculture referred to the Garda allegations concerning suspected over-declarations in weights of meat prepared for export by a certain company on behalf of Anglo-Irish Beef Processors (International) Ltd.  The allegations related to the period immediately before December 1986.  An investigation file which had been prepared by the customs and excise special investigations branch was subsequently made available to the Garda and a detailed and thorough investigation was conducted by the Garda.  The investigation was very timeconsuming because of the complexity of <Col N="1220" /> the subject matter involved.  A file on the matter was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions in January of this year and his directions are awaited.</P>
    <P>The Garda have, of course, viewed last Monday night's &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme and the question as to whether further Garda investigations might be warranted arising out of the contents of this programme is a matter for professional Garda assessment in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Another matter which was referred to on Monday Night's programme was the alleged misuse of certain stamps in connection with the export of meat.  Incidents of such misuse which were alleged to have occurred in 1983 were investigated by the Garda, and arising from that investigation a prosecution was brought and a person was convicted in 1987 of uttering a forged document. A two-year suspended sentence and a substantial fine was imposed.</P>
    <P>Before I rebut some of the more objectionable allegations in the programme I wish to put on record the background against which my Department were given to understand that this programme was being made.  On 23 April 1991 a researcher acting on behalf of Granada Television sought my Department's assistance on a programme &mdash; and here I quote &mdash;&ldquo;on the beef industry in Europe&rdquo;.  My Department co-operated by providing written responses to no less than 52 questions put forward by the researcher.  I will, at the first opportunity, place before this House not only the 52 questions that were submitted to my Department but also the 52 answers that were given by my Department, lest there be any doubt as to our bona fides and total and utter consistency in this area. The questions asked bore no relationship to the content of the programme which turned out to be not a programme on the beef industry in Europe but an undermining of the Common Agricultural Policy and much more.</P>
    <P>I should add that the visual presentation of that programme was in very poor taste and indeed offensive to many viewers.  Just picture what the reaction <Col N="1221" /> would be if an Irish television company presented a programme on the meat industry in Britain and, as part of their visual effects, presented on a meat hook, side by side with a person under alleged investigation, the Prime Minister of Britain.  What are we expected to think of the status and intention of a programme presented in such an offensive, outrageous manner not only to the people directly concerned but to our nation?  Are we in this House expected to give credence to that kind of offensive, outrageous presentation by people who would allege that we have much to answer for?  I want to ask everyone concerned in the preparation, presentation and research of that programme to make available to me as Minister, to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice &mdash; and RTE authority will be asked to look into the matter &mdash; all the information. I would ask that a witness come forward and make themselves available. We can have full disclosure on the matter and there will be no innuendo or implications that suit some people in this House who have little regard for democracy. We are going to uphold democratic standards here.</P>

      <P>Members of this House, by their utterances and conduct yesterday, have given unwarranted credence to a programme which was in many vital respects untrue and which cannot but have damaged the reputation of this country and particularly the meat industry. My purpose here today or any day is not to defend the record of any individual company.  Rather is it to rebut the insidious allegations made in the programme against the controlling authorities of the country and, in so far as they could spread the net, the Government of this nation.</P>
      <P>Firstly and most fundamentally, the allegations that in recent years Goodman companies were being considered as the principal target of a major European investigation and that this investigation was not carried out after assurances from the Irish authorities that they had a wide-ranging investigation of Goodman in hand.  That allegation is without any basis.  At no stage have the Irish authorities impeded any investigations by any institution of the European Community, on the contrary the Irish authorities have always given the fullest co-operation in carrying out all investigations by European Community institutions.</P>
      <P>The programme implied that various irregular and illegal practices, incorrect weighing, the use of bogus stamps, the refreezing and reboxing of old beef, would in some way be &ldquo;squared&rdquo; through influence the company might be able to bring to bear on officials or politicians. That had no basis whatsoever and I totally and utterly reject and repudiate it. I am entitled to ask this House to join me in that rejection and repudiation unless anyone in the House can bring forward a scintilla of evidence to the contrary.</P>

      <P>Is the statement of one or two former employees of contract companies to be taken as fact?  Is it not significant that neither of the gentlemen interviewed ever brought their suspicions or information to official notice either here or in Northern Ireland, as far as I am aware from contacts with Northern Ireland?  There was no unreasonable delay in involving the Garda authorities in the irregularities observed in Waterford in December 1986.  The final Customs report to my Department was transmitted in October 1987 and, following examination, it was concluded that the papers should be put in the hands of the Garda authorities, which was done in February 1988.  That cannot be said to be an unreasonable delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also categorically reject out of hand the charge that there was collusion between the Customs authorities and <Col N="1224" /> AIBP in limiting the extent of the irregularities discovered at the Waterford plant of AIBP; this is totally without foundation and is a scurrilous attack on public officials.  My Department have never been in any doubt about my attitude to ensuring that irregularities do not occur in the beef &mdash; or any other &mdash; sector.  The same applies to the Government because the strength of controls we put in place has been as a consequence of the Government's decision on proposals I introduced. Our controls are effective in this regard but, of course, I have never suggested that irregularities do not surface from time to time in the meat trade or that it has not been necessary to impose penalties as a consequence of the findings of diligent investigations.  This, incidentally, does not apply exclusively to any particular company and certainly not to any particular country, particularly this country, whose record I have given to the House.</P>
    <P>Penalties for irregularities are determined after consultation with the Commission and in full agreement with it.  In the event that the Commission is not satisfied with the outcome of an investigation by the national authorities, it disallows or withholds payment.  I am glad to inform the House that the level of disallowance under those procedures for Ireland for 1987 and 1988 is the lowest in the European Community.  Such penalties invariably result from internal checks by supervisory authorities and the Customs in the case of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of disclosure in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme arose precisely from such inquiries and while the events complained of took place in 1986, before I was Minister for Agriculture, I can tell the House that we have now pursued the matter diligently and I have referred to the penalties imposed.  While the Government have fully implemented the regulatory and control system in operation in the meat industry and regard it as fully adequate and comprehensive, nevertheless rather than allow any shadow, hint or sniff of doubt to persist in the public mind &mdash; which some people in this House would like to <Col N="1225" /> spread &mdash; we will arrange in the Dáil next week for the establishment of a judicial public inquiry.  Accordingly, we will bring an appropriate motion before the Dáil for this purpose.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;resolves that a judicial public inquiry be initiated into the allegations of law breaking and fraud contained in the `World in Action' programme on Goodman International.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The public inquiry which has just been announced has been wrung from a reluctant Government.  They had no wish to have such an inquiry; indeed the demeanour of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the House yesterday gave no indication of a willingness to institute a public inquiry.  In fact, when a question was raised by me suggesting that the interests of the Government and the Taoiseach would be served by an open public debate on the matter, the Taoiseach responded by saying it was a despicable allegation.  He went on to threaten the Fine Gael Party and Front Bench with what he described as &ldquo;a reply in kind&rdquo; if we pursued our call for a full public statement in the matter.  However, we did pursue our call for a full public statement on the matter and for the establishment of a judicial inquiry.  I am glad that the threats made do not seem to be in the minds of those concerned, I am also glad that the Fine Gael proposal for a judicial public inquiry &mdash; a proposal which has been accepted by other parties as well &mdash; has been accepted eventually by the Government parties.</P>

      <P>It took time and it proves that we can achieve things in this House.  I am glad, as a parliamentarian, that Dáil Éireann has the capacity to change the Government's mind on this <Col N="1226" /> matter, it is an advance for which we can all take our share of credit.</P>
      <P>There are a number of proposals before the House for the establishment of a public inquiry.  The programme in question raised serious questions about the enforcement of law in Ireland; it raised questions as to whether there is equality before the law for all citizens in Ireland; it raised questions about Ireland's compliance with EC law; it alleged fraud; it implied that there had been cover-ups and even contained suggestions of improper political influence. All these matters need to be cleared up once and for all and I hope that the public inquiry will do this.  We will be insisting that the terms of reference of the public inquiry are adequate to ensure that each and every one of those matters is adequately and definitively dealt with.</P>
      <P>There is an even more cogent argument for a judicial public inquiry.  The television programme, if left unanswered, would do appalling damage to the prospects for the creation of jobs here.  We will not preserve jobs in our food industry unless we can assure consumers all over the world of the quality of Irish food and the reliability of Irish brand names and brand marks.  Thousands of jobs depend on this.  The programme suggested that assurances about Irish food quality &mdash; and even quality brands placed on our food &mdash; could not be trusted.</P>
      <P>It is vital that we re-establish the confidence which has been damaged by the programme and the only way this can be done is by showing now that we are prepared to have open judicial inquiry into these highly damaging allegations, and &mdash; this is important also with regard to the terms of reference and Fine Gael will insist upon this &mdash; that we are prepared to act on the conclusions of that judicial inquiry.  It is not sufficient that there should simply be an inquiry and a report; there must be recommendations and an indication in advance from the Government of their preparedness to accept and act upon whatever recommendations emerge from the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> The inquiry must deal with two separate matters.  At the outset it must deal with the serious and general allegations made against the Goodman Group.  If these allegations are true, they amount to allegations of fraud on a grand scale. Secondly, the programme contained a different category of allegations and these were about the enforcement of law in Ireland.  There are suggestions that the Customs service, recommended a criminal investigation but that the file did not reach the fraud squad office for 18 months.  There were also suggestions that a major European investigation into the matter was averted because an Irish Government investigation was supposed to be taking place.</P>
    <P>I believe, and I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Food has accepted this, that a public judicial inquiry is the only way both categories of allegations can be dealt with &mdash; the allegations against one company and the general allegations. Both must be dealt with in one proceeding and be seen to be dealt with. It might have been argued by some that a private action by Mr. Goodman against the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme would have been sufficient but it would not have been because it would have dealt with the allegations against the Goodman group only and not the allegations with regard to the adequacy of the arrangments here in general.  Furthermore, a private action by Mr. Goodman against the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme would have taken place in a British court but in my view this matter is so serious for this country that it must be seen to be dealt with by the Irish authorities in Ireland and quickly.  Therefore, there is no option but to hold a judicial inquiry.  Failure to undertake such an inquiry would have done untold harm and undermined the credibility of all efforts we are making to brand Irish food in a credible fashion.</P>
    <P>It will be said by some that we should not institute public inquiries because someone on a television programme made allegations.  People will say &mdash; I use words which were first used by a former British Prime Minister &mdash; that we should <Col N="1228" /> not allow &ldquo;trial by television&rdquo;.  I agree that trial by television is not in itself desirable and that one should only come to conclusions about criminal accusations when both sides have had an opportunity to state their view and have been crossexamined. I agree with the principle that an accused person is always innocent until proved guilty.  I also believe &mdash; let me say this with some seriousness &mdash; that parliamentary privilege should not, except in the most extreme circumstances, be used as a cover for the making of charges of criminal activity.  If we are to avoid trial by television, and a situation where people feel they have no option but to make such accusations under the cover of parliamentary privilege, we must be seen to have other means to deal with the matter adequately and quickly.  Those means in this case clearly involve the holding of a public judicial inquiry.</P>
    <P>The best way to avoid a succession of trials by television is to have once and for all a full scale inquiry conducted by those who would do it in accordance with the proper norms of judicial investigation. By subjecting all allegations, and those making them, to public judicial scrutiny in this way we will ensure that allegations in this matter will only be made in future that can be substantiated.  Likewise, if we want to avoid the making of allegations of crime in the Dáil we must show that such allegations will be thoroughly dealt with elsewhere.  I note that Mr. Goodman has said that he would welcome such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I have said that I was somewhat suspicious of the attitude of the principal party in the Government in this matter in view of the exchanges yesterday.  I am glad, however, that their attitude changed overnight and that they are now prepared to hold an inquiry.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious matter which needs to be investigated in this inquiry from the point of views of our tax system.  We hear many complaints here that the tax burden is too heavy.  Many people in the PAYE sector feel that they are carrying an unduly heavy tax burden and that others are getting away with <Col N="1229" /> paying less than their fair share through legitimate or illegitimate tax avoidance devices.</P>
    <P>A very serious allegation was made on the programme with regard to taxation. It was alleged that under-the-table payments were being made to employees of the Goodman Group at a rate of £3 million per year.  Presumably, these payments were made in a way that the payment of income tax was avoided.  At his press conference yesterday Mr. Goodman said this matter was first brought to his attention last August when the examiner was appointed.  He also said that meetings followed with the Revenue Commissioners after which, to quote Mr. Goodman, &ldquo;everything was regularised&rdquo;.  What does this mean? Ordinary individuals who evade tax cannot simply go to the Revenue Commissioners, have a few meetings with them and then have &ldquo;everything regularised&rdquo;. This is not available to me, or to any other taxpayer.  Is it possible to have things quietly regularised if one is a big company but not possible if one is a small company or a private individual? Do we have equality before the law with regard to tax matters?  This matter must be sorted out in this public inquiry, otherwise those on PAYE will feel that there is one tax law for the rich and another for everybody else.</P>
    <P>One of the issues of concern in the current intergovernmental conference on the new treaty governing the European Community is the suggestion that the European Community be given the power to directly enforce its laws and should be able to supersede the activities of member states in that matter.  We get huge sums of money from the European Community, not just for agriculture but for virtually all important activities involving the improvement of our infrastructure. If there is any suggestion that the country is unable to enforce European Community law or ensure that European Community regulations are fully and effectively policed that will gravely damage our ability to get money from Brussels for the whole range of activities which are currently supported <Col N="1230" /> by the European Community.  It is extremely important therefore for our case for structural, social as well as agricultural funding that we be able to demonstrate through this public inquiry that we have absolutely foolproof systems in place for the investigation of any allegations made.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in the speech of the Minister for Agriculture and Food that I want to deplore and that is his attempt to blacken the programme-makers of &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo;.  It is appropriate that the House should recall that &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; is one of those programmes which campaigned vigorously for the release of the Birmingham Six long before many of us on both sides of this House took any interest in the case.</P>

      <P>There is no basis for suggesting that the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme is in any way &ldquo;anti-Irish&rdquo;.  In fact it has a very good and proud record in the case of the Birmingham Six of taking up an unpopular case in its own country and by so doing defending Irish interests.  There should be no suggestion in this House that the programme was motivated in any way by sentiments of an anti-Irish nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme has a good record and I regret that the Minister when making his case had to make such imputations against the programme makers.  I note that neither of the gentlemen interviewed, according to the Minister, has brought the information in their possession to the prosecuting authorities before now.  That is a serious matter and I hope the investigation to be announced will inquire why that is the case.  The people who made allegations on television and did not make them to the appropriate authorities should be asked &mdash; and I am confident will be asked &mdash; why they did not do that.  That is another reason for having a judicial inquiry.  I believe also that this judicial inquiry should ask why the Fianna Fáil Government decided to re-establish export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq in 1987, <Col N="1231" /> a totally inexplicable decision on any grounds and a decision that has been proved to be extremely mistaken.  It is extremely important, if this judicial inquiry is to clear up all matters in regard to this, that it clears up that issue also.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Department of Agriculture and Food should publish all prosecutions they undertake. Any secrecy in this matter is potentially damaging.  I understand that this company is far from being the only company that has been the subject of successful investigations; I understand three other companies have been investigated and prosecuted.  Therefore, the inquiry should not be seen as one sided, and we should indicate that as a result of this inquiry all fraud by whomsoever commits it, will be pursued vigorously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Government have accepted the spirit of our motion and that we are going to have a judicial inquiry.  In doing so, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has stolen some of my best lines, but nevertheless I will say what I have to say.</P>
      <P>The Government's motion was an affront to the public and to the judicial system in this country.  To suggest the allegations on Monday's programme &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; remain unanswered and that we abide by the existing control systems of the meat industry in the Department of Agriculture and Food is not acceptable.  The charges made by the former employee of Goodman International, Mr. Patrick McGuinness, and the circumstantial evidence presented by ITN, have got to be investigated and the proper way to do it is by judicial inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our international image as a country that produces and sells top class meat has been seriously tarnished.  The damage to our meat industry in Britain and at home <Col N="1232" /> must be considerable, and only time will tell how much damage has been done. In fact, Monday's programme will have repercussions right around the world and our international competitors will exploit the contents of the programme to the maximum.  If we do not put our house in order, our customers and our competitors will do it for us.</P>
    <P>Last August when we were discussing the Companies (No. 2) Bill in this House I said kind things about Mr. Larry Goodman and I was assailed on all sides for saying them.  What I said, I said on the evidence before us at that time, and it is my experience that he is and has been the best operator in the beef industry in this country.  At the end of that statement I said, but this was not reported: &ldquo;If there are criminal charges to be answered, let them be answered but let us judge people on what they have attained and according to the law of the land.&rdquo;  I was saying that if somebody had broken the law let them pay for it.  I do not make any apologies for what I said.  I do not make excuses, I said it, it was the truth as I saw it and I hope it is still true, but obviously Monday night's programme has thrown up serious doubts about the whole operation of that company.  That is why a judicial inquiry is so necessary.  Let us have the matter out in the open and see who is right and who is wrong.</P>
    <P>Initially yesterday morning I put out a statement saying there should be a judicial inquiry because the only really satisfactory result I have seen of an inquiry into an incident where there was contradiction and irregularities was the Whiddy Island disaster 12 or 13 years ago.  A judicial inquiry into the incident and the vested interests involved who had lied and concocted stories were exposed for what they were.  It was a wonderful example of democracy in action and I hope that this judicial inquiry, which obviously we are going to have, will do likewise so that the villains can be exposed and the innocent can go about their work. As Deputy Bruton said, everybody in the beef industry is now being blackened and we must get away from that.  Obviously <Col N="1233" /> there are some guilty people but there are many innocent people.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to say that we breached European Community regulations less frequently than any other country.  The smear will remain until we take action.  Over the years there have been persistent allegations of malpractice in the operation of meat plants.  It was prevalent in my days in the Department of Agriculture, but the big problem was to get somebody to come forward and admit to it.  However, this programme was televisied last Monday night and this is why the Minister has to act and why I welcome his statement that he will act. Now, for the first time that I can remember, a former employee of a meat company has come out and illustrated how the system was being abused.</P>
    <P>Our Government's reaction is awaited at home and within the EC.  Inaction will be disastrous.  Let us show the world that we mean business and let us give our detractors their answer.  Irish beef is the best in the world and its reputation must be protected.  We already have considerable difficulty selling our meat because of the BSE disease and angel dust abuse.  The meat industry probably have yet to feel the full impact of these two problems.  The problem with Angel Dust is only being highlighted now and we had the revelations of last Monday night's programme.  When will the full effects of these revelations be felt?  It may be months but we have a considerable problem.</P>
    <P>We badly need to show that we are determined to sell only the best quality beef and that we are determined to stop abuses of European Community regulations. By not having a judicial inquiry we would have the worst of all world's &mdash; kangaroo courts and trial by television. In fairness to the public and those who stand accused of flouting the law, we have a duty to see that the allegations are investigated and if they are substantiated that blame is properly apportioned.</P>
    <P>All Irish meat plant operations stand indicted by this programme.  The programme makers have, as Deputy Bruton <Col N="1234" /> pointed out, a very high reputation.  The contents of the programme came across as being authentic.  That is why the matter is so serious and why we put down this motion.  McGuinness came across as someone who was telling the truth.  This is why the programme has such serious implications for this country and our beef trade.  Mr. Ruddy, who it is now said was not an employee of the Goodman Group, also made very serious allegations about the reboxing of 13 year old meat and selling it as fresh for human consumption.  These are very serious allegations.</P>
    <P>Parts of the programme were repulsive. I agree with the Minister that the cartoons of the Taoiseach were not proper; they were highly improper.  The dramatisation of certain parts of the programme were unsavoury and one could justifiably say that the programme had an anti-Irish slant and that an effort was made to damage our beef industry.  I think that is fair comment.</P>
    <P>The perception is that big money is being made by unscrupulous operators protected by people in high places.  I do not agree that this is the case.  It is in everybody's interest that the true position be clarified.  I said that this morning on radio, and I repeat it here.  I am not given to make false accusations or cheap jibes. While many people would associate Mr. Goodman, the principal involved in the programme in question, with the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party, I do not say that that is necessarily the case.  I have always found Mr. Goodman to be a reputable person to deal with.  I did not see any malicious political intent in his attitude or operations.  I believe that the 1987 launch of the great new food processing industry, which included the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, was a genuine effort to get our food industry off the ground and that there was a mutual benefit in it &mdash; the Government wanted to see more jobs created and felt that Mr. Goodman was the best person to create those jobs, and in return, Mr. Goodman would get very generous grants.  This was a perfectly natural arrangement and I would not make any accusations about impropriety. <Col N="1235" /> I believe it was a regular business arrangement between a company and the Government.  Unfortunately, it did not work out.  I am sure my colleague Deputy Connaughton, will have much to say about this.  I do not think people should make insinuations when they cannot back them up or prove them.  I do not have any reason to make insinuations or to accuse anyone.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to talk down the beef industry, but action is needed to restore our image at home and abroad. The Government motion, which now no longer exists, was sterile.  Not only did it not address the problem, but it showed the Government did not appreciate the seriousness of this issue.  If I have any admonishing words to express about the Government from the Opposition benches they are on what the Taoiseach said yesterday; by implication, he said there were people on this front bench who were guilty of fraudulent activity.</P>

We are doing something we should probably have done three or four years ago.</P>

      <P>What surprised me yesterday was that the Government did not seem to realise the impact of the programme shown on Monday evening.  It is regrettable that the Government had to be dragged screaming into this debate and obviously did not make the decision the Minister outlined to the House until the very last minute, and then very reluctantly. As I said, perhaps it is better late than never that we are having this judicial inquiry because this country needs it and our standing in the European Community demands that it be carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>We tabled an amendment to the Government motion which does not address the problem we are facing.  Our amendment states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann demands a sworn judicial inquiry with the power to procure documents, to summon witnesses and to make any and all recommendations it sees fit, into the allegations made by the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo;<Col N="1238" /> programme transmitted on Monday, 13 May.</P>
    <P>In the immediate aftermath of the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme, my colleague, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, issued the following statement on behalf of the Labour Party which I intend to read into the record of the House because it sums up very effectively our position on this whole affair.  It states:</P>
    <P>The litany of irregularities and relationships uncovered by last night's &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; investigation into the management of Anglo-Irish Beef Processors demands the most serious and far-reaching response.</P>
    <P>This programme performed a valuable public service, and the allegations made in the course of the programme will be convincing to many who have tried to investigate the affairs of this company in the past, in the public interest.  The questions that need to be answered fall into two categories &mdash; those that need to be answered by the company and those that must be answered by the political system.</P>
    <P>In the former category, strong allegations were made by the programme of falsified documents and accounts and official stamps; allegations of strong attempts by company management to obstruct legitimate investigation; allegations of the illegal use by the company of official stamps; and allegations of a host of dishonest and dangerous practices, including improper slaughtering methods, reboxing of old and probably poisonous beef to present it as fresh, altering weights to maximise subsidies, and &ldquo;under-the-table&rdquo; payments to virtually all employees.</P>
    <P>Where the political system is concerned, the questions are even more serious. Allegations were made that routine tipoffs were received by the company of any investigations, that although criminal proceedings were recommended by customs officials the relevant file was withheld from the fraud squad for 18 months, that an agreement operated between <Col N="1239" /> management and the company and someone in the customs service would ensure that every investigation had the right outcome, that the company always operated on the basis that it believed it had the right connections in the right places which could limit any investigation and that the European Commission was persuaded to draw back from a major investigation of the company after it had received false assurances that the Irish Government were already conducting a major investigation. Most seriously of all, it was alleged that the Government were fully aware of the views of the customs officials about extensive wrong doing at the time it was assisting the Goodman organisation in its extensive self-promotion and preparing to commit further large sums of public money to the expansion of that company.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that when the Labour Party first revealed some of these irregularities which have now been so exposed, the party was strongly attacked by both Mr. Goodman outside this House and the Taoiseach, and several days elapsed before the Minister for Agriculture and Food was forced to reveal the truth of our assertions at the time.</P>
    <P>Then, and several times since, we have called for a sworn judicial inquiry into this whole affair with power to obtain documents and to compel witnesses.  I do not see how the Government can justifiably refuse that request, which they obviously have not done now.  In fact, in most other countries allegations of the kind made, unless they could be immediately and comprehensively rebutted, would inevitably lead to ministerial resignations at least.</P>
    <P>What we are debating here tonight is essentially the same thing that we debated in this House last August, the future of the Irish beef industry.  There have been attempts in this House and outside it to question the motivation of the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; team and the programme which exposed so much wrong doing.</P>
    <P>I do not ever remember the Taoiseach or any of his colleagues questioning the <Col N="1240" /> motivation of the same &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; team after any of the three programmes they made about the Birmingham Six, and I cannot understand why he should choose to do so now.  For my own part, I want to put on the record my belief that this programme was made with no other motivation than to try to get at the truth of a scandal which has been brushed under the carpet in Ireland for far too long.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we had a full discussion on this issue here last August. We did not have a full discussion on the Government side last August, and most of the facts in relation to the Goodman problems would not have been revealed by the Government if they could have avoided doing so.</P>
    <P>It is the scandal, and not the uncovering of the scandal, that has done so much damage to the reputation of our beef industry both nationally and internationally. If British customers are less willing to buy Irish beef today than they were last Friday, it is not the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme that is to blame &mdash; it is those who have perpetrated the things that &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; uncovered, and those in authority who have done nothing about it.</P>
    <P>We have to accept the duty of ending the scandal, and we will not accomplish that by banal and dishonest attacks on those who have made the programme.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential to our fundamental economic interests that we address this issue as a scandal and that we address the basic question of what we need to do to root out those people who have turned our beef industry into an object of scandal and disgrace.</P>
    <P>That is why I have to say now &mdash; and I say it with care &mdash; that the Government bear a huge responsibility in this whole matter.  I believe they have neglected that responsibility in the most shameful and irresponsible way.</P>
    <P>At the behest of the Government, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has put before us tonight a motion which lacks all credibility.  It lacked credibility before the Minister's statement and, in <Col N="1241" /> view of the Minister's conclusion, it certainly lacks total credibility.  Even if it is passed unamended it will only make the situation worse without a sworn inquiry.</P>
    <P>There is virtually nobody in this country other than, perhaps, Mr. Goodman or his senior management who believe that the regulatory and control procedures for the Irish beef industry are satisfactory.  If the Government had produced a motion which even expressed some concern about the allegations made and which undertook to review the procedures, then perhaps one would be more sympathetic about the difficulties which the Government are facing.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, over the last number of years there has been an attempt at whitewash in relation to the beef industry. This motion itself is part of the cover up because at all times the Government have known far more than they have been prepared to tell us.  The same applied last August.  It is pointless for them to huff and puff that they never covered anything up or that they have no case to answer when they are prepared to vote for a motion like this.  If they are seriously putting their reputation on the line, then the Minister should withdraw the motion and let the judicial inquiry take its course.</P>
    <P>One has to question why the change of heart at the last minute.  I do not like speaking about absent friends, but I wonder yet again have the Progressive Democrats put down the line that they will not support the motion unless there is a judicial inquiry.  My own suspicions tell me that is the reason the Government have caved into the requests by the Opposition parties first made last August, and now agreed by all the Opposition parties, for a sworn judicial inquiry.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what happened during the day between the Government parties.  Why the late change?  Why no script from the Minister?  Why was nothing prepared in advance?  Why the late change of heart for the sworn judicial inquiry?  The Government must know, and everybody in this country knows, that the regulatory procedures for the Irish beef industry, not just for Mr. Goodman but for the whole of the Irish <Col N="1242" /> beef industry, leave a lot to be desired. The irregularities, if one wants to call them irregularities, amount to criminal activity.  That is what it is.  There are no two ways of putting it, and it should be stopped and stamped out once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food have over the years refused to reveal any detail of the investigation they carried out into individual companies on the spurious grounds that they did not want to affect the competitive position of these companies.  Not only has there been a failure to investigate thoroughly, but the entire ethos of the Government in this area has been one of complacency &mdash; and I regret to have to say that &mdash; since they discovered these problems back in 1987.  Because of that complacency about control, because they were unwilling to take action, the Government must stand accused of this cover up of illegal and improper activities in the beef industry since the day they took office.  History will judge the motivation behind that.  In the final analysis, any damage done to the future prospects of the Irish beef industry, to farmers, to the workers and to consumers must be laid at the door of the Government.</P>
    <P>We have never received &mdash; though perhaps we will in the course of the judicial inquiry &mdash; any satisfactory explanation of why the Government extended such favourable treatment to Larry Goodman in the middle of 1987, within weeks of their return to office.  All we know is that favourable treatment was extended to him against the best advice available to the Government at that time and that the decisions made by the Government have proved to be disastrous in terms of the beef industry.</P>
    <P>Two important decisions were made in 1987 by the then Fianna Fáil Government. The first has been discussed in this House, that was the decision to grant a virtual monopoly of export credit insurance to Mr. Goodman's company. The second involved a commitment by the State to invest £30 million in a grandiose scheme for the development of the <Col N="1243" /> beef industry being undertaken by Goodman International, and to help to secure a further £30 million from the EC's Agricultural Fund.</P>
    <P>It may be worth recalling some of the details of the project outlined in that famous press conference on 18 June 1987, the video film of which was subsequently used all over the world by Mr. Goodman's public relations experts to sell Goodman and their beef.</P>
    <P>There was to be £20 million for a new processing facility in Louth; £5 million was to be spent on the group's activity in Ballymun, Carlow and Waterford factories. A new high technology plant employing 140 people was to be built in Tuam on the site of the old sugar factory and new factories were to be developed on greenfield sites in Cork or Kerry.  All told, the projects were to employ 1,150 people and, in the words of the Minister for Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, they were to put the Irish meat industry in the first division of meat processing.  We all know what happened.  I do not accept Deputy Deasy's explanation about the close association because when people are that close and there are problems, the problems are all over the place.</P>
    <P>We all know how meaningless those promises turned out to be.  We do not know and we have never been told why the Government decided to embark on that course of action and why they applied so much pressure to ensure that it happened.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm to the House that the advice available to the Government when the export credit insurance was reinstated was that it should not have been reinstated to the Goodman company.</P>
    <P>These questions are important.  It becomes far more important now that we are being told by a reputable investigative team that almost precisely at the moment when the press conference was being held, the Garda Fraud Squard was being asked by the Department of Agriculture and Food to investigate serious irregularities in Goodman's Waterford and Ballymun Plants.  According to my information the situation is even more <Col N="1244" /> peculiar.  I am told that a memorandum went from the Department to the fraud squad in June 1987 asking for the investigation. In Civil Service parlance, it was a CYA file.  I shall not explain that because of the restrictions on parliamentary language.  It was sent from the Department to the fraud squad in June 1987.</P>
    <P>The essential matters to be inquired into by the fraud squad were, in the case of the Waterford plant, the false altering of weights on cartons, both before the Customs investigation and during it, and the inclusion of beef trimmings in the cartons to maximise the weight; and in the case of the Ballymun plant, the false altering of case weights on documentation.</P>
    <P>After that memorandum there was a deafening silence from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I understand reliably that the fraud squad made innumerable requests for the Department's file &mdash; a file which included every detail of the Department's investigations &mdash; but all of these requests were ignored until December 1988.  In the end, the fraud squad got the file no more than two or three weeks before the Department wrote to Anglo Irish Beef Processors informing them of the penalties that had been decided upon in the case of Waterford. For reasons that are far from clear no investigation in fact appears to have been carried out by the fraud squad in relation to the Waterford plant, although a file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions's office in respect of the Ballymun allegations in December of last year or January of this year.</P>
    <P>The famous letter from the Department to AIBP, outlining penalties in respect of Waterford is, of course, at this stage a matter of public record.  It is also a matter of public record that the Minister for Agriculture and Food initially attempted to deny its existence, thereby making it all the more difficult for us to take seriously anything he might have to say about rigorous controls.</P>
    <P>Of course, at the time that news of the <Col N="1245" /> major irregularities in Waterford emerged, it was revealed &mdash; despite the reluctance of the Minister &mdash; that the Goodman organisation were to be penalised to the extent of just over £1 million.</P>
    <P>Mr. Goodman at the time blamed the whole affair on a subcontractor, a Mr. Marks, who traded under the name Daltina, and announced that he was commencing legal proceedings against Mr. Marks.  In the last couple of days Mr. Goodman has announced that not only did he pursue those proceedings, but he also won a judgment in the High Court agianst Daltina, thereby vindicating his stance at the time.  That was a most interesting case, and I shall give the House some details of it.</P>
    <P>I have established that Mr. Goodman did enter a claim against Daltina for £904, 184 in the High Court.  On 14 May last year &mdash; almost a year ago on the day &mdash; Mr. Goodman secured a judgement against Daltina, as a result of the complete non-appearance of the defendant. That judgment was not for the amount claimed, but for an amount to be determined by a judge at a hearing to be held subsequently.  Surprise, surprise, despite the lapse of a year, that hearing has never taken place, and as a result no damages have ever been assessed, according to High Court records, checked this afternoon. Mr. Goodman might have got his judgment, but it has not cost Mr. Marks one penny.  A cynic might well smell a rat in that case yet again.</P>
    <P>The House will also be delighted to know that Mr. Goodman would not have been able to write off any penalties incurred on him against the profits from his business.  If he succeeds in persuading the Revenue Commissioners, however, that he had to suffer the loss of nearly £1 milion because of an uncollected judgment in the High Court he will be able to write off the cost of all those penalties against taxation of his profits.</P>
    <P>It will also be remembered that at the time of the Waterford irregularities, and as a result of them, up to £20 million in bank guarantees were withheld by the Department.  Without the Department's approval Mr. Goodman has been unable <Col N="1246" /> ever since to secure release from those guarantees.  However, I understand &mdash; and perhaps the Minister will comment on this &mdash; that approval has been given to release the bank guarantees, perhaps, according to my information, as part of the overall deal of last autumn.  Apparently, the Department's enthusiasm for Mr. Goodman continues unabated.</P>
    <P>But Waterford and Ballymun were not all that the Department knew about irregularities in the Goodman empire at the time it was busily assisting in the international promotion of Mr. Goodman. For example, I have discovered that very much earlier in the eighties &mdash; and the Minister has admitted to this &mdash; before the Minister even came into office, counterfeit stamps were intercepted in Cork by the Customs authorities.  These stamps were duplicates of South African customs stamps and were on their way to the AIBP plant in Cahir when they were intercepted.  The only possible purpose of such stamps is to enable documents to be falsely stamped in order to convey the impression that meat had been received in South Africa, thereby qualifying that meat &mdash; on a totally illegal basis &mdash; for EC subsidies.  This was known to the Department and the Minister &mdash; there is no way it could have been hidden from them since it featured to a minor extent in the prosecution of one Mr. Nobby Quinn &mdash; and it makes the Department's enthusiasm for Mr. Goodman all the harder to understand.</P>
    <P>Mr. Goodman at his press conference last night referred to various tax schemes in operation for the employees of his company.  He referred to them as &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; schemes, and advised the media that they had been brought to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners and that the situation was now fully regularised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton went on at length in saying that perhaps the taxation arrangements one can arrive at depend upon one's status.</P>
    <P>I understand that what happened in this case is that following intensive <Col N="1247" /> negotiations with the Revenue Commissioners the Commissioners agreed not to take proceedings against Mr. Goodman or his company in respect of large scale tax evasion practices going back over many years.  In return, Goodman International paid the Revenue Commissioners £4 million in respect of all outstanding liabilities and penalties. That, I am told, is by far the largest settlement of its kind in the history of this State.  Quite frankly, I find it very difficult to understand how anyone can effectively admit to tax evasion on that scale and still escape scot-free from any kind of prosecution.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the figures, if he has them from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I now come to a question I feel should be put on the record of the House.  I have been told by a number of sources that Mr. Goodman has been guaranteed immunity from civil prosecution as part of his settlement with the banks and from criminal prosecution.  We all know that the only people who can give immunity from criminal prosecution are the Government as a whole.  I should like to know &mdash; and perhaps the Minister would be so kind as to put it on the record of the House &mdash; if that immunity has been given, why it was given, when it was given and on what basis it was given.  In view of the facts I have outlined, it would strike me as being a crazy decision if that is what has been decided.</P>
    <P>As I said in the House last August, the reality of the Goodman affair will not go away.  As a good test of the strength of democracy, perhaps the House has taken steps this evening that will go some way towards putting this dreadful saga to bed, if that is possible.  The Irish beef industry will continue to be under threat until we, as democratically elected representatives of the people of this country, convince the world that we have cleaned up our act in relation to that industry.</P>
    <P>I do not take any pleasure in attacking the Government, in attacking Mr. Goodman, or in attacking the beef industry.  I would be much happier to be able to stand up in the House as a rural Deputy <Col N="1248" /> and defend the beef industry.  God knows, given the unemployment in Ireland, the unemployment figures released in the past few days, and the closures that have occurred right across the country, we need jobs.  We need a thriving beef sector.  We need the jobs and we need the outlets for what is basically a world-class premium product.  Our farmers, in particular, have been let down badly in the past couple of years in the way that all of this happened.  They have been treated most unfairly and have been shortchanged by the reputation of the industry that the Government have allowed to grow.</P>
    <P>I only hope that it is not too late.  I hope that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will pursue with vigour, and with all the resources available to him and his Department, and with the other resources of this States, this judicial inquiry as quickly as possible.  The country needs to be reassured in relation to the industry.</P>
    <P>Again, I was completely amazed that the Government did not realise the seriousness of the implications of the allegations made on Monday night.  Perhaps it is a matter of complacency; perhaps the Government have switched off from such problems.  But these problems will not go away.  They have to be faced up to.  They may be unpleasant, but it is better for everybody that the unpleasantness is dealt with now rather than allow it to continue for years.  The industry needs to be cleaned up.</P>
    <P>My colleague who raised the matter for the first time in the House, the former Deputy Barry Desmond, who is now a member of the European Parliament, should feel vindicated in relation to his statement made in the House.  The chances are that if those statements had not been made we would never have been the letters that subsequently had to be put on the public record.  It is a sad day when letters have to be procured from agents of the State when they are available to people in senior positions but are not worked upon.  It is a very sad day for all of us that we have to come down to a <Col N="1249" /> sworn public judicial inquiry.  It is essential that we protect this vital industry. There is absolutely no consistency in what the Minister is about to do when we call a vote on this matter.  There is no consistency in saying everything is in order and then saying a sworn public judicial inquiry will be set up.  If he wants consistency let him withdraw his motion and get on with the public sworn judicial inquiry.</P>

      <P>I have not seen this programme.  I want to speak only about what I know about and what I spoke about in the Dáil on Thursday, 9 March 1989.  I spoke in the Dáil on a number of issues in regard to the overlapping of political and commercial interests.  I referred to repeated rumours of attempts by political figures to interfere with the efforts of Customs officials and agricultural officers to stamp out illegal practices in some meat plants around the country.  I then referred to an incident which occurred on the previous Saturday when a frozen meat plant owned by EIRFREEZE on the North Wall was shut down by a Department of Agriculture and Food inspector on Saturday, 4 March.  EIRFREEZE are a subsidiary of Food Industries who are 68 per cent owned by the Goodman company.  I said my information was that the plant was closed down because of very serious illegal activities by a team acting on behalf of one of the Goodman companies changing labels on meat, and that labels were being changed in different parts of the country by a team moving about to do this job.  My understanding was that this team were down in the plant in the North Wall on Saturday evening changing labels.  I had been given detailed information well before this about the manner in which labels are changed, the use of angle grinders to cut off the old label and the blast freezing process after the replacement of the new label.  I made that statement and ended by saying I hoped all the Department inspectors would get a free hand to investigate whatever they had to investigate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the following day the whole Goodman PR company came out in force calling me a fringe TD looking for cheap publicity and saying I was seriously damaging the reputation of Goodman International and the whole meat industry, the EIRFREEZE plant had not been shut <Col N="1251" /> down and what I was saying was wrong, it was never shut down at any stage.  Larry Goodman himself later called on me to retract the false statements and I was told the irresponsible abuse of the privilege of the Dáil is an opportunistic pursuit of cheap publicity and is indefensible.  I was told the utterly false charges made were of a most serious nature and the prestige of the Dáil had been used to give a semblance of credibility to seriously damaging statements.</P>
    <P>I pursued that and eventually on 26 October 1989 I was told a summons had been issued by the District Court in respect of the incident at EIRFREEZE and the matter was now <i>sub judice.</i>  I continued to pursue it throughout early 1990 with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the District Court and was eventually told it would come to court on Monday, 30 July 1990.  I was in the court on 30 July 1990 and there was quite a farcical procedure.  The Department of Agriculture and Food and the prosecuting counsel seemed very reluctant to pursue the charges with any vigour. Most of the time was spent haggling outside the court.  Following a deal the Department withdrew one charge against EIRFREEZE and two charges against Anglo Irish Beef Processors and in return the defence counsel pleaded guilty to the two remaining charges.</P>
    <P>What happened vindicated everything I said in the Dáil in March 1989.  The EIRFREEZE plant was shut down on the Saturday night and the whole plant was investigated and checked by the Department inspector on the following Monday, 6 March, and the inspector specifically said he shut the plant down on Saturday night.  The inspectors took away 63 carcases on which they found false labels.  They stated this was done illegally and that the labels were CU2 which indicated the meat was from steers of good conformation and of low fat, in other words a high quality product, which was at variance with the original grading by the Department official.  All this was stated in court.  The EIRFREEZE people had now admitted and pleaded <Col N="1252" /> guilty to what the Goodman company called &ldquo;utterly false charges of the most serious nature&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that the prosecuting counsel or the Department of Agriculture and Food did not, however, pursue the issue of fraud and forgery against the company as the judge seemed to expect.  Justice Smithwick asked at one stage if this was not forgery with intent to deceive the customer and the counsel replied, &ldquo;there is nothing about this in the charges before us&rdquo;.  The judge simply said &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;, because the charges before him were only of a technical nature.  The technicality was that this forgery was carried out without the presence of a Department inspector. Those were the only two charges and since they were of a technical nature in that the inspector was not present, the plant people were fined £200 on each charge.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech here this evening said that where fraud is suspected the Garda are notified and they decide if prosecution for fraud is warranted.  I want to know why the Garda were not informed of the fraud and forgery on this occasion.  Secondly, the Minister said that audits of firms's commercial and financial records are carried out.  That is another procedure they go through.  Was any audit of the commercial and financial records of this company or any of the companies associated with Anglo Irish Beef Processors, EIRFREEZE or any of those companies carried out?  How do we ensure that label changing like that is not carried on illegally again despite all our controls?  All we want to know is how these procedures can be ended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has already taken an extraordinary turn.  The motion before the House from the Government bears no relationship at all to the amendment that has since been moved.  If the Government had confidence in the regulatory and control procedures in the meat industry there would be no need for a judicial public sworn inquiry.  I welcome that belated conversion.  I presume we are going to have to wait for our friends <Col N="1253" /> in the media to tell us precisely at what point the Progressive Democrats wrested that sensible commitment from the Government.  Nonetheless it is important that this House is apparently to decide that such a judicial public sworn inquiry will take place.  It is also important in that the Minister indicate to the House precisely the scope of that tribunal of inquiry.  Will they have power to send for people and documents?  Will witnesses appearing before them have immunity? Will they have the same privileges they would have in court?  One of the real issues that has kept the lid on the entire can of worms over the last number of years is the fear people have that it is as much as their career is worth if they come forward.  Deputy Deasy or Deputy Bruton asked why the employees of the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme said what they said and why they did not come forward to the Garda earlier.  I am afraid the reason is they believed it would have been a worthless exercise.  We have precedents for the most extraordinary information, suspicions and allegations being bruited about and no action being taken.</P>
      <P>There is a difference between this particular occasion and the occasion last August when the Dáil was recalled, in extraordinary circumstances for the first time in 14 years, when the future of our major conglomerate in this industry was at risk.  What is at risk in our debate this evening is Ireland's representation as a trading nation.  The fact that Goodman is such a large scale player on the European stage, together with the serious allegations in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme, plus the very recent experience of a number of international banks, threatens this company's credibility in our most important markets.  It is almost unbelievable that confronted with this prospect the full extent of the Government's response is to reject the Opposition demands for a tribunal of inquiry and to ask this House to reaffirm the motion I have referred to until the related intervention of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me put in context, a Cheann Comhairle, what is at stake in this debate. <Col N="1254" /> The cattle and beef sector accounts for 36 per cent of gross agricultural output and contributes almost 10 per cent to GDP.  When export refunds are included, export earnings amount to 7 per cent of total exports.  Some progress has been made towards increasing value added exports in recent years in as much as the export of cattle on the hoof has been reduced from 46 per cent of the total destined for export in 1969 to just over 10 per cent in 1989.  The scale of the beef industry is, therefore, very significant, sustaining almost 100,000 farmers in the production of cattle and employing an estimated 5,000 workers in meat processing. That is the context of this debate and that is what is being put at risk unless we can finally put these allegations to bed.</P>
    <P>In the debate on 28 August 1990 I put on the record of this House, <i>inter alia,</i> the following matters which inevitably form the background to our debate this evening and which have prompted The Workers' Party amendment.  First, I revealed the question of the missing £20 million which showed that Mr. Goodman was acting as a money broker at the same time as he was facing financial collapse. Secondly, there was the fact that Mr. Goodman had improperly drawn down some of the special package of section 84 loans, which were made available for the development of the industry, and had used some of those moneys to fund speculative ventures abroad, which had nothing to do with the purposes for which they were authorised.  Thirdly, there was the fact that one third of the £120 million worth of sanctioned export credit insurance benefits to Iraq originated outside of the State.  Fourthly, I put on the record that the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990, was the product of negotiation between the Taoiseach and a small group of Ministers but only represented Mr. Goodman's third preference, since his intervention with the Taoiseach, seeking a rescue package the details of which I outlined in that debate. Most worrying of all was that the Revenue Commissioners felt constrainted to <Col N="1255" /> turn a blind eye to the type of remuneration packages being paid to Goodman executives, and to the incorrect PRSI and PAYE returns in respect of a great many Goodman employees, many of them doing work for the Goodman operation under service contracts.  I put on the record of the House these and a number of additional charges passed on to me by persons who were sick of the official indifference to the climate of fraudulent practices that characterised the Goodman Group: people who were sick of the recurrent excuse: &ldquo;Sure they are all at it, and the meat business is a tough business&rdquo;. Because of Mr. Goodman's clout, people who were competitors in the industry found themselves squeezed out of their due entitlements, under the export credit insurance scheme.  On a subsequent debate on the Estimate for Agriculture on 25 October 1990 I instanced and named the particular case of Hal-al, a company with 17 per cent of the beef kill as compared with Goodman's 35 per cent and I showed how they were a victim of political favouritism.</P>
    <P>Hal-al had successfully won substantial markets in Iraq in 1987.  Under the 1987-88 newly restored export credit insurance scheme they had been granted their share of the benefit.  What happened?  Mr. Goodman on hearing about his new competitor in Iraq immediately intervened with the Taoiseach who caused the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day, Deputy Albert Reynolds, to get in touch with the chief executive of Hal-al and tell him he was sorry the whole thing was an error.  I gave the name of the official who made the telephone call.  Furthermore, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, knows a great deal more about this than I do. He has it all chapter and verse.  I find it extraordinary that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is party to a decision in Government to effectively legally indemnify Mr. Goodman as a result of the deal he struck with the four banks.</P>
    <P>Against this background together with the experience during the examiner process and the matters now revived in the <Col N="1256" />&ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme, the question for Government is this: why have there never been substantial prosecutions? I know the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows the full extent of the scandalous treatment of Hal-al which was almost forced out of this country. Hal-al considered, before that change of Government, closing their plants and withdrawing from Ireland. What concern for jobs in that kind of situation?</P>
    <P>The charges highlighted in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme are remarkably similar to the detailed brief made available to my colleague, Deputy Pat McCartan, in December 1987.  I can make that document available to the press; I have it here with me.  Some of the details were made available to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, at the time.  I refer observers to the Official Report of 28 February 1988.  Despite the detail, the professionalism and the manifest inside information contained in that document, no action resulted.  The difference now in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme detailing essentially the same flavour of institutionalised wrongdoing for the twin purposes of increasing quantities and improving the quality of meats exported, is that on this occasion Mr. Goodman's practices stand condemned out of the mouths of his own employees. Once again, Mr. Goodman tells us he is flabbergasted and in carefully chosen phrases, enters the ritual denials of routinely &mdash; a word he used repeatedly &mdash; using forged stamps, regarding meat and so forth.  What is the evidence to date?</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring has referred to the situation involving Mr. Goodman's former employee Mr. Nobby Quinn.  We know that the envelopes in question were opened on their way in from England by Customs and Excise officials who discovered forged stamps.  Mr. Goodman says he has no knowledge of forged stamps.  Mr. Quinn was arraigned before the courts on two charges; first, intent to defraud and, second, falsification of documents.  What happened?  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, the intent to defraud <Col N="1257" /> was bargained and withdrawn in favour of a conviction for falsification of documents for which this gentleman got two years suspended sentence.  Now he re-emerges in the guise of Classic Meats &mdash; a problem that the Minister for Industry and Commerce still has not disposed of.  We found out through the Fair Trade Commission inquiry that, of course, Mr. Goodman controls Classic Meats despite the denials.</P>
    <P>In Waterford a not dissimilar practice was uncovered where Mr. Marks, to whom Deputy Spring referred, has a notorious track record in the industry. Anybody who wants to look at the practice in Viking Meats or in Benburb Meats knows exactly about Mr. Marks' track record and yet, the situation is, as Deputy Spring outlined it, that Mr. Goodman had nothing to do with it, he was just a sub-contractor.  Now Mr. McGuinness has come out and said that there was a high level plan to obstruct the investigation at Waterford in the Goodman organisation, now Daltina.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla referred to the entire production line which was in existence in Nenagh, designed for taking stamps from frozen carcases and restamping and repackaging them. Another dispute which started from the use of a surplus milk quota involved Bailieboro Co-op, owned by Food Industries, sending out cheques in the night to people who did not exist and ultimately this led to the resignation of a president of the IFA and of a former Chairman of ERAD.  It was typical that Mr. Goodman should claim on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; last evening that a contract worker hid in the cold storage area because, he implied, he was afraid of a social welfare inquiry; in other words that he was on the dole.  I am not surprised at that.  A great many of his workers were on the dole and a great many of them were being paid under the counter.  I have here on official Anglo-Irish Beef Processors paper, provided to me today, details of under-the-counter payments made to various employees and the distinction drawn between moneys put through the books and the total moneys paid.  For example, <Col N="1258" /> the total money paid to the half dozen workers in this case amounted to £8,280, and there is a corresponding invoice made out to a fictional haulier for precisely the same amount of money for the same period.  In other words, the workers are paid under the counter, an invoice is made out to an imaginary haulier for exactly the same amount and no questions are asked.  I have another list detailing smaller payments to a large number of workers.  In this case the amount paid is £3,278.  Again the corresponding invoice is made out to a haulier.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing that went on and that the dogs in the streets are barking about.  Yet the Minister came in here with his schizophrenic script, which apparently was written before Deputy O'Malley got his pound of flesh, if that is not an inappropriate metaphor to use in this circumstance, and started rhyming off how effective the control procedures and mechanisms in the industry are.</P>
    <P>Mr. Goodman used his political clout to contrive that more than 90 per cent of the benefit of the export credit insurance scheme was captured by his group.  When it emerged that only £82 million worth of cover in 1987-88 was exported from Ireland his executives gave detailed, off-the-record briefings to journalists and explained why only £82 million out of £120 million was taken up.  It now turns out that the off-the-record briefings were false.  We know that one-third of the meat in question originated outside this State. We also know that in the Finance Act the Government made a special arrangement to enable Mr. Goodman to avail of high coupon finance for the schemes that I referred to earlier.  Since this finance could only be drawn down as working capital and since at least some of it was used outside the State to fund speculative ventures that had nothing to do with the development of agriculture or the reasons for which it was authorised, I would ask the Minister why was there never any prosecution.  Surely this is tantamount to tax evasion.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce answered a question that I put down to him in the House saying it <Col N="1259" /> was a matter not for him but for the Revenue Commissioners.  Since the banks, under the section 84 system, get the tax breaks and since the moneys were improperly drawn down, it seems there is <i>a priori</i> a question of tax evasion and that prosecutions ought to have been initiated but they have not been so initiated.</P>
    <P>The four major banks involved, Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, Algamene Bank, Commerz Bank and Bank of Indosuez, had misrepresented to them the financial soundness of this group of companies days before 29 August when the examiner was appointed.  Have the Government no regard to the damage done to our reputation internationally as a result of this kind of action?  Why was no action taken, since it is illegal to knowingly trade while insolvent?  That misrepresentation of the financial position of a major company not just in Ireland but on the European stage did a great deal more damage to the credibility and reputation of this country than all the Deputies in this House for which Mr. Goodman has such disdain.  Indeed it is remarkable to note that in his most recent press conference Mr. Goodman suddenly admitted that the Members in this House representing the people who elected us have a right to be interested in this matter.  That is a major conversion for Mr. Goodman.  I hope it does not signify that he intends to depart the scene soon.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that no legal action on any substantive issue has been taken by the Government.  That is what I would like to see the Minister for Agriculture and Food address.  We have the word of Mr. McGuinness that senior executives in the Goodman organisation considered themselves invincible and no wonder, because they were invincible.  They had friends in high places.  The shady dealings in which they were involved in an institutionalised way need never come to light as far as they were concerned.  As one public official put it to me, the whole ethos was &ldquo;do not interfere, do not make trouble, this man is doing a great job&rdquo;. If the social pressures were not enough <Col N="1260" /> there was also the belief that Mr. Goodman had friends in high places.  As the same official said, if you hoped to be promoted the last thing you wanted to do was start shouting foul at Larry Goodman.</P>
    <P>Mr. Goodman is also well known for his generosity in rewarding what he considered to be loyalty.  Unfortunately his largesse seems to have been aimed at more than his own staff.  I have in my possession a list of some of the recipients of Mr. Goodman's generosity at Christmas 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will not go through the entire list.  The list shows an astonishingly large number of recipients of gifts to customs personnel at Greenore, Carrickarnon, Dundalk, Waterford and Dublin.  The list also includes a substantial number of personnel in the Department of Agriculture and Food, including some agricultural officers employed at cold stores, some vets and a handful of personnel in the Department of Industry and Commerce. The list also shows that personnel in the Northern Ireland Customs and the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture also received gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that any of those who received gifts did anything irregular in return, although I am advised that the acceptance of such gifts is not the normal practice in the Civil Service and may be in breach of regulations.  I also accept that the gifts may have been relatively minor in value in most cases.  However, I believe very strongly that the practice of public servants accepting gifts from a commercial organisation which they may be responsible for monitoring, and in respect of which they may have to detect <Col N="1261" /> and report irregularities and even prosecute offences, is very unwise to say the least.  At best it can be said that it does not create an atmosphere which encourages vigilance; at worst it creates an unacceptably cosy relationship which encourages turning the blind eye to unacceptable practices.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that Goodman operations have been subjected to a lesser degree of customs inspections than other commercial operations, especially in regard to container loads going North, and that he has been able to virtually secure the closing off of the port of Greenore to other people when he was exporting meat.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that there was an extraordinary incident in 1988 which would have been normally expected to lead to immediate prosecution, but in respect of which no action was taken.  My information is that in 1988 a container load of boneless beef left a Goodman plant near Wexford.  The lorry, carrying 500 sides of beef, crossed by ferry to Britain, travelled up the mainland and crossed to Northern Ireland at Larne.  The lorry was intercepted by our customs officers on an unapproved road near Castleblayney on its way back to the Republic.  The driver, whose name I have, explained to the customs officers that he was on his way to a Goodman plant near Enniskillen, but had got lost.</P>
    <P>It was of course ludicrous to suggest that anyone would transport a container of meat from Wexford to Northern Ireland via Britain.  The customs officers concluded that they had intercepted a `carousel' operation.  This is a scam whereby meat is exported, on which export refunds are paid, secretly imported and then re-exported to claim yet more export refunds.  To the astonishment of the customs officers, no action was taken against any of those involved. I have the name of the lorry driver, which I am prepared to give the Minister privately. It might answer some of his importuning to me privately since I first raised the matter in the House.  I should <Col N="1262" /> like the Minister to tell us why no action has been taken.</P>
    <P>I regret that it took a British television programme to cause a judicial inquiry to be set up.  Why was no similar programme done by our own television station?  My information is that some of the employees interviewed in that programme were also interviewed for a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme and that, although an affidavit was sworn validating their case, someone decided it should not go out.  It is regrettable that it took a British television programme to bring the company and the Government to heel in the interests of farmers, jobs in the meat factories, our reputation as a trading country internationally and, finally, to clean up the act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with as many points as possible during the time available to me.  I want to remind the House that the fact that I may not deal with each and every individual allegation is not to be interpreted or represented as being confirmation of the allegation or evidence of the fact that I, my Department or a member of Government, is not ready to address these issues.  Clearly, in the time available, such an interpretation would be wrong and unreasonable.</P>
      <P>A number of issues have been referred to, in particular I should like to mention one which occurred outside this jurisdiction, namely, the reboxing of rotten meat &mdash; as it has been described.  Those events &mdash; let us have a common understanding in relation to this &mdash; occurred outside this jurisdiction and it may well be that the sworn public inquiry may be in a position to extend its range of competence outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said &mdash; and I endorse his remarks &mdash; that it is important that no allegations are made which are not capable of being substantiated outside the House and that anything said here should not seek the cloak of privilege. Quite a number of things have been said here this evening which must be recorded as matters of very considerable significance under the terms of the sworn <Col N="1263" /> public inquiry when it is established; a motion to this effect will be brought before the Dáil next week.  I hope that Deputies with their constitutional responsibilities, as is the case with the Government, will furnish all information they have, be available with all such information to enable the sworn public inquiry to have a full and complete examiniation, which is what everybody wants, and to have, as has been said in the House, a final determination of these matters.  I, too, want to see these matters conclusively and finally resolved although, of course, there may be some people who will never want to be satisfied that the matters have been resolved.</P>

      <P>Very well, I will be specific.  As Minister for Agriculture and Food I will be called on to give an explanation of my conduct in relation to a charge made in this House yesterday.  I was accused by Deputy McCartan yesterday of &ldquo;covering up every time&rdquo;.  I said that the remark should be withdrawn, that it was a disgrace and should not be on the record as I had never covered up anything and never would.  Deputy McCartan then said: &ldquo;Everybody in the Department knows about it but you, Minister, you do not want to know&rdquo;.  He went on: &ldquo;I have the evidence and we will produce it&rdquo;.  Let Deputy McCartan now &mdash; or before the inquiry &mdash; produce the evidence which he alleged he had yesterday that I have covered up every time.  If he cannot do that he should have the basic decency to withdraw the allegation.</P>

If he has the evidence let him produce it.  If he does not have it let him, as a Member of an <Col N="1264" /> elected Parliament which is a very important institution of the State, at least uphold basic standards of decency and integrity.</P>

      <P>I want to assure Deputy John Bruton that the Government want to see every possible relevant matter which arose on the programme dealt with.  We have no difficulties with Deputy John Bruton's amendment.  We will make immediate arrangements to try to get terms of reference which will cover it.  However, I cannot imagine that it will extend to matters which Deputy Bruton mentioned in passing, such as equality before the law in relation to tax matters, which would hardly be appropriate.  If Deputy Garrett FitzGerald thinks we should have a sworn public inquiry into all those matters, it will become a very wide-ranging issue indeed.</P>

      <P>As suggested by Deputy Bruton, I would invite those Members of the House who have made specific allegations this evening and who claim they have evidence to back up their allegations to make it available to the inquiry which is about to be set up.  I hope they will find themselves in a position to make the evidence available and perhaps persuade their sources to come forward as well.  It is of vital importance that this be done, otherwise the innuendos, the hints, the suggestions and the veiled implications will remain.  Now is the time to clarify the issues.  I am sure that both Deputy Spring and Deputy Rabbitte who raised a number of matters will avail of the opportunity to do this.</P>
      <P>Let me deal with some of the charges made against the Government as distinct from the allegations made against the company.  I would like to reassure Deputy Spring that there is no question of complacency on our part.  We are not prepared to give the impression that we are going to pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry to be set up later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring suggested that the Government promised immunity from criminal prosecution.  I want to say to him that it is my information that there is no basis for making such a suggestion.  The Government have not promised anyone immunity from criminal prosecution. Nevertheless, if Deputy Spring has evidence to suggest that someone acting on our behalf promised this let him bring it forward.</P>

Having said that, let me acknowledge also, as a Deputy said, that we seem to be reluctant to introduce a sworn public inquiry into this matter.  Let me say yes, that we were indeed somewhat relucant to introduce a sworn public inquiry.  I want to say openly and frankly why we were reluctant to do so.  The reason had nothing to do with what the sworn inquiry would disclose, because we have nothing to hide, but in the first instance the experience of sworn public inquiries has often shown that the result is very different from the expectation; second, the length of time it takes is very considerable; third, though this is not of important in these circumstances, the cost is an issue but over and above <Col N="1270" /> the most important reason is from the point of view of actual prosecutions.  I must let it be known that immediately a public sworn inquiry starts, a stay is put on all criminal prosecutions and on any actions that would be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the matters I have referred to which are now in the hand of the Garda Síochána, that is, if there is to be immunity from any consequences of giving evidence.  That is the reason, and that alone, that we were reluctant to initiate a sworn public inquiry.  Our reluctance is not on the basis of having a full and total disclosure to finally prove that this matter is totally, utterly and competently controlled by this Government and our officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Since I am sharing time with Deputy FitzGerald I will be very brief.  I suppose at this stage it is very apt to be talking about ethics in politics and about high standards in high places.  We hear often of cynicism on the part of the public in relation to politics and politicians and I suggest that we as politicians should not add to that by suggesting we are all under suspicion. I want to make two points.  First I have seen Ministers travelling around the country, often at great inconvenience to themselves, to open factories and to attend hospital meetings.  If a souvenir is presented to them I do not think they should be expected to go to the nearest jeweller to know whether it is gold or make believe gold.  If we put a limit of £200 on gifts before they have to be declared, it will mean that Ministers will be inundated with extremely valuable gifts.  It may be different when it comes to national and international gifts but the least we can do is to allow a Minister who travels the country serving the nation as best he can is to have whatever souvenir he has received because most of these gifts have a personal rather than an intrinsic value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I unashamedly say that political parties should be funded by the State.  I am tired of going to meetings, not alone asking the supporters to vote for me, to canvass for me but to put their hands in their pockets to keep the party going.  The slogan &ldquo;funding democracy&rdquo; is something we should bear in mind at all stages because only when there is an absence of democracy, as in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East and such places we realise what a privilege it is to have democracy.  There is nothing wrong with a political party getting funds to stay in existence.  However, I have very strong <Col N="1272" /> views about the waste of moneys at election time and in the absence of any such provision in the Bill let me say it is about time we brought in some form of regulation on canvassing outside polling booths and on the erection of posters. This should be reviewed because we are living in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support strongly the proposals contained in the Bill, but I would urge that they be taken further in order to provide the fullest reassurance to the public that our political and governmental system is free from any element of or suspicion of financial corruption or undue influence by interests in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reassurance is not, I feel, adequately provided for by the terms of the proposed legislation on gifts, which seems to envisage only gifts received by Ministers when actually in office.  Moreover, I have the impression that the provisions of the Bill, while in their present form, are appropriate to gifts of articles to Ministers &mdash; in respect of the treatment of which I should say I applied in my own case a somewhat higher figure than here proposed, based in the absence of any specified limit on the figure insurance companies employ in requiring specific declarations of individual items for insurance purposes &mdash; and do not seem to be really designed to cover cases involving financial favours that might be received by a corrupt Minister.  To ensure that the latter type of transaction is adequately covered it would, I think, be necessary to include provisions for disclosure of Ministers' assets, liabilities, and income and possibly also of their spouses and dependent children, without which verification of disclosure of gifts would be ineffective.  This would necessitate the inclusion of additional sections to require such a disclosure by Ministers on their appointment, during their period in office and for a number of years thereafter, possibly five.  Moreover it should be provided that this disclosure be made in confidence to a monitoring group or commission, comprising such persons as the Comptroller and Auditor General, <Col N="1273" /> the Ombudsman and a judge of the High Court rather than to the Secretary to the Government.  This Commission should have the power to investigate any allegation that might be made and if they found that an improper gift or payment had been made, but only in that event, to make the relevant information public. Only through such a procedure will members of Governments be protected from rumours and allegations of corruption and the public be reassured that no such misconduct has taken place.</P>

      <P>The provision for a £1,000 ceiling on contributions to political parties and candidates by persons or bodies seems to me to be defective in that, subject to correction, it does not seem to cover adequately the possible case of a large concern, comprising &mdash; as is often the case &mdash; a multiplicity of companies.  If each of these gave £1,000 to a party the total contribution a major <Col N="1274" /> concern could lawfully make under this Part of the Bill, could be very large, and if that were linked to an administrative act or other measure designed to favour that concern it could constitute a significant act of financial corruption.</P>
      <P>Either this Part should be more tightly drafted or &mdash; and this I would strongly support in its own right &mdash; the permitted sum should be reduced to a fraction of the proposed figure, and all but a small minority of the financing of political parties and elections, should be financed by the electorate as a whole through adequate Exchequer payments rather than as at present by individual persons or companies.  The setting aside of a sum of the order of 0.01 per cent of GNP. which at present would mean around £2.25 million annually, distributed between the parties <i>pro rata</i> with their share of support, would finance our political system in a manner that would eliminate the possibility of parties policies or Governments actions being influenced by or being thought to be influenced by private financial contributions.</P>
      <P>A similar sum on the occasion of a general election, with appropriately smaller sums for other elections, especially if linked with the reintroduction of limits on spending at election time, as existed up to 30 years ago, but at realistic levels, would eliminate the need for parties to seek financial support from individuals or companies in order to finance their campaigns.  Moreover, such a provision would release the energies of political parties from almost perpetual fund raising to undertake more constructive political work, including a greater input into policy formulation.</P>
      <P>I should like to reject the views put forward recently by the chairman of the Progressive Democrats on this issue.  I hope and believe they are not shared by the Members of that party in the Oireachtas.  His reference to contributions to this debate as coming from &ldquo;bankrupt parties&rdquo; which &ldquo;had all the air of children planning to rob a sweet shop&rdquo; was childish and unworthy of the serious level at which this matter has been discussed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> The suggestion that the provision of adequate Exchequer funding to free political parties from dependence on contributions from the private sector was &ldquo;a deliberate attempt to undermine the constitutional guarantees of free speech, freedom of associations and equality&rdquo; was perverse to the point of palpable absurdity.  His statement that &ldquo;State funding suited the corrupt&rdquo; stood truth on its head.  I am glad that in the absence of Mr. McDowell from this House this matter has been debated in a considered and dignified way.  I hope this Bill will start a process that will free our politics from even a suspicion of corruption.</P>
    <P>Over a period of 70 years this State has been singularly, even if, perhaps inevitably, not totally, free of corruption in public life.  Which of us, if challenged, could name even six politicians whom we suspect, however unworthily, of corrupt acts, during these seven decades?  Of how many other modern States is that true? Apart from Scandinavia where this is true I would have difficulty naming any other modern State.</P>
    <P>Let us now take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that this remarkable record neither deteriorates nor is believed by our people to have deteriorated. By supporting this Bill and making whatever adjustments to it as may be needed on Committee Stage, we will be doing justice to the record of public life in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the Bill is very badly drafted and shows a great deal of confusion.  It would appear from section 4, which deals with gifts to office holders, that while a gift <Col N="1276" /> cannot be made to an office holder it can be made to his spouse.  It is recognised in a later section of the Bill that benefits or services at less than their Commercial value can be given for the benefit of office holders.  This provision is excluded from section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Time does not permit me to go into this point in detail but section 7 seems to be totally confused and unworkable.  It is fine to talk about laudable objectives and concepts, but it is another matter to translate them into legal reality and make them stick.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the registration of the interests of individual politicians. I am emphatically opposed to the thinking behind this proposal.  I do not understand why politicians should be singled out as a group.  This is possibly unconstitutional in a country which has a written Constitution.  In the debate last night some backbenchers on this side of the House suggested that this provision might discourage people from entering politics.  I do not think that this is true but it could have a more pernicious result. If I had time I would outline how a person could avoid the provisions in section 14 (1) straightaway.  People will seek to avoid and evade this legislation.  I predict that if this legislation were to go on the Statute Book it would be honoured more in the breach than in the observance from day one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a small tightly knit community. The main argument put forward by speakers on the other side of the House seems to be that if we pass this legislation <Col N="1277" /> we will raise the public perception of politicians.  I think the opposite would be the case.  If we have legislation on the Statute Book which is directed specifically at politicians and it is allowed to fall into disuse or is obviously avoided, as this legislation would be, either by legal or illegal means, then the public perception of politicians will be lowered rather than raised.  The public perception of politicians depends on their performance in this House, particularly in Government. I recall that the public perception of politicians during 1982-87 was at an all time low.  The party in Government in 1982 were elected on the basis of controlling public expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No charade about faulty draftsmanship or statements like &ldquo;We do it differently&rdquo; will hide from these principles.  In ten or 12 minutes Deputy O'Dea and every other Member will be asked to give a Second Reading to this Bill.  This involves the acceptance of principles.  If there are faults in the drafting and amendments are needed we can address those issues on Committee Stage.  Deputies should not seek to hide the issues.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address the Chair on this important issue.  My time is at a premium and I will keep going.</P>
      <P>There are three fundamental issues in this Bill and I want to put them to the House for consideration by each Member.  If anyone has difficulty with them or objects to any one of them in a fundamental way, let them argue against them.  We should not confuse the issue and talk about the words used &mdash; the drafting and how the sections are not constructed properly.  I am not a legislative draftsman; but we have the mechanism to amend the wording if we want to enact these principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three principles in the Bill are simple.  The first focuses on gifts to office holders in this State; by office holders I mean Ministers, Ministers of State and the Attorney General.  The Bill seeks in essence to provide that gifts in excess of £200 should be the property of the State. We are not talking about tokens or small gifts; we are talking about very substantial gifts which Members have received in the past.  We are talking about gifts worth tens of thousands of pounds <Col N="1280" /> which are reputed to have been given to senior office holders in this land.  That did cause public disquiet.  It did cause public concern, and let nobody deny that.  What we want is a mechanism which exists in most civilised countries, that people do not, by virtue of their office, expect to receive and retain fabulous gifts.  I put this forward as a principle.  The House can take it or leave it on that basis at 8.30 p.m. and we can deal with the mechanism for putting that into effect if the principle is accepted on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The second principle is also a simple one &mdash; that there would be a register of financial interests of each Member of this House and of the other House.  We had a long debate on another issue earlier today, and clearly it is important that the public should know if Members of this House have financial involvements in companies.  If those same companies are being debated by this House, or if legislation that impacts on those companies is being debated by this House or the other House, is it not right, is it not the norm that people would have a right to expect to know if there are linkages between those companies and individual Members discussing that issue either directly on the Floor of this House or on subcommittees of this House?</P>
    <P>It is in all our interests that the register of interests would be put into place. Anyone would think it was an alien idea, a foreign concept.  We have spent an entire day on the Local Government Bill and we are returning to it now.  Members of county councils are required to register their interests.  Is it not farcical that members of a county council have to register their interest in case a planning application would come into conflict with their duties as a county councillor, but we can sit here and enact legislation, often specific legislation, that deals with particular companies, businesses, enterprises or market sectors, and nobody asks us if we are directors of the company, advisers to the company, if we have any benefit or financial interests for ourselves or our families or our spouses in relation to that company?  I do not think that is an outrageous suggestion; I think it is a <Col N="1281" /> simple, ordinary suggestion that would be accepted as the norm in most democratic countries.</P>
    <P>What is the third terrible principle that has to be rejected as the most awful Bill we have ever had to deal with?  Probably the one that strikes home hardest, that is, the declaration of income of political parties.  I know that would be a terrible Bill to enact, God help us.  We might have to put on the public record who is funding the parties.  For my party, we publish an annual account, and the money that comes into our party is a matter of public record.  That practice should be followed by other parties in the State.  The third principle that we put into this Bill is the requirement that Financial contributions in excess of £1,000 would have to be registered and visible and accounted for, and notified to a registrar who would have to publish annual accounts.</P>
    <P>They are the three simple principles we put forward and I am amazed that anybody in this House would have difficulties with those fundamental principles.</P>

      <P>When we put this Bill forward we did not say it was excellently drafted, that it had no flaws, but I must say that sufficient effort went into it to expect a reasoned response from the Minister for Finance.  He did not give us that.  It was interesting that he addressed the main issues in the Bill by simply saying that they were not appropriate to statute, that they would be more appropriate to regulations of the House.  In his contribution last week, on 7 May, the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;The Deputy's party&rdquo;&mdash; he referred to me &mdash;&ldquo;has already raised this matter in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges&rdquo;. This is the interesting bit&mdash;&ldquo;Due to other parties' need to consult and consider the matter further, there has been little progress on the proposals as yet&rdquo;.  Never a truer word was said by the Minister, because he has buried it twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the representative of my party on <Col N="1282" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Twice I brought detailed proposals to the committee, meeting in private and in secret so that nobody is able to look over our shoulders, and I put the proposals, the enactment of this Bill, before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. What happened?  The Minister's party nearly had a seizure, Fine Gael nearly had a second seizure, and between the two of them they had to consult first with the party Whips.  The party Whips then were notified that they needed a discussion on this important measure, they had to consult.  The consultations took a year.  I reckoned there was enough consultation in a year so I put it on the agenda again for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It went back and they are still consulting and the Minister said last week &mdash; a year and a half later &mdash; that he understood the matter remains on the agenda and should the Deputy wish it can be raised again at an appropriate time.  We should live so long. Frankly, I know the Minister has a good sense of humour and I accept a good joke, but in reality he has no more intention of putting these provisions into rules of the House than he has of enacting them into legislation.  He wants them buried, but he wants them buried privately.</P>
    <P>Last week, my colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, speaking on this Bill, made a new proposal to the Minister.  In his speech on 14 May he suggested that the Labour Party would withdraw this Bill, if we got agreement of the House on these four conditions: that gifts to senior office holders together with the issues of Members' financial interests would be referred for consideration to a subcommittee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; that that sub-committee would be representative of every group in the House; that it would meet in public session like any <i>ad hoc</i> or informal subcommittee of the House; and that the Minister for Finance would agree to commence discussions with representatives of other political parties on the issue of funding political parties with a view to drawing up guidelines which <Col N="1283" /> ultimately may be encompassed in legislative reform.</P>
    <P>We have been patient.  We have gone through the procedures of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We have drafted a Bill and discussed it here.  Even at this late hour, we, in the Labour Party, sought to give some chance of establishing codes of ethics in this House and in the other House that might begin the process of raising the esteem that we as elected Members have among the general public.</P>

      <P>I apologise.  I am looking for reaction from this side of the House because they are the people who will have the majority in two or three minutes time. Let me say this in response to the Taoiseach &mdash; and I know I should not be drawn.  There is a code.  If one listens to people at any public meeting there is <Col N="1284" /> always one who says &ldquo;how about you?&rdquo; If one is talking about cruelty to children, they say, &ldquo;how about cruelty to animals?&rdquo; If one says a pothole should be filled, they say &ldquo;how about the wall you should be building?&rdquo;  There is always something else we should be doing.  Let us address the issue before us.  Let us address it now, and for once, let us not look back four years to somebody else who was responsible. The time is now, the vote is shortly and this is the issue.  Do we want standards in public life?  God knows the last two days have taken their toll on an already well dented public image of politicians in this country.  Do we want standards or not?  In the words of the bard, it is put up or shut up time.  The Government should either support the principles we are putting forward by way of legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, let me say that in a very detailed contribution last night my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, indicated that we are certainly not putting ourselves forward as having any monopoly on virtue.  The vast majority of Deputies in this House &mdash; 99.9 per cent &mdash; have absolutely nothing to fear from these proposals.  That is why they should march in supporting them in two minutes' time.  The issues are matters of principle. The detail can be enacted later, it is time now to decide.  The parties in Government can take a second decisive step tonight by accepting the modest proposals, moral proposals, just proposals, put forward by the Labour Party.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Government Bill, 1991: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 22:</P>
    <P>In page 8, lines 29 to 34, to delete subsection (7).</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Howlin.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that the points the Minister made in reply to my comments on subsection (8) satisfy my reservations although I noted the points he made.  The first point was that this format of words has been used before &mdash; he quoted a number of examples &mdash; but that is not the point.  We are introducing new legislation today and the question is not whether it has been used before but whether it is an appropriate format or if it is entirely appropriate that the Minister should take the power to override the Bill.  The fact that this format has been included in other legislation is neither here nor there and in no way validates its <Col N="1297" /> use from here on if it is not right in the first place.</P>
      <P>The next point was that it has not caused any difficulty to date.  I do not know what kind of answer that is.  Perhaps the reason it never caused any difficulty before was that the citizens' rights were overruled and taken away by the abstruse wording of such a subsection, but that is not necessarily a good or healthy thing.  It is a serious matter when the Oireachtas devolves powers to a member of the Executive, that is to say a Minister.  I concede that this is something that has to be done, but why should the Minister not be required to operate within the limits of the powers devolved to him by the the Oireachtas?  Why does he seek to go beyond that?</P>
      <P>What would be wrong with the subsection if it said &ldquo;a person affected by a direction under the Bill shall comply therewith and it shall effect accordingly&rdquo;? That would give the Minister freedom to operate as appropriate within the limits of the power devolved to him under the Bill.  Why does he seek more than that? Why does he go on to say that if he exceeds his power it will not matter because it shall be deemed to have been done under the authority of the Bill?  For the life of me I cannot see how the fact that it never caused any difficulty before can be an answer.  It may well be that on a previous occasion a Minister exceeded his powers under an Act and did something which would have been <i>ultra vires</i> had it not been for this deeming provision.</P>
      <P>It could be that when a person sought a remedy because the Minister had acted <i>ultra vires,</i> he was advised he could not proceed as this provision was in the legislation, and perhaps that is the reason it never caused any difficulty on any previous occasion.  It just is not good enough at all to make such a provision.  The Minister should be well satisfied and content with the powers given in this Bill and he should stay within them and not seek blanket power which in effect amounts to an over-riding of the powers devolved to him under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to a different point altogether <Col N="1298" />&mdash; and I have asked the Minister to comment of this &mdash; the wording is a bit strange in another respect.  &ldquo;A person affected by a direction under this Act shall comply therewith...&rdquo;&mdash;that is a rather strange way of putting it and I wonder what is the reason for that?  It seems to be that the purport of that is to cast the net rather wide.  One would have thought that the normal way of wording it would be something like this: &ldquo;A person who is given a direction under this Act shall comply with it&rdquo;, in other words when the Minister gives a direction to a person &mdash; although I accept the Minister's point that it could be a county council, a county manager or a corporate body &mdash; the person is obliged to comply with it.  I would understand if it was worded like that.  &ldquo;Affected&rdquo; is an odd word to use.  When you think about it, that could apply to a person who was not given the direction and who was quite outside the procedures altogether.  It could be that the Minister issues a direction to one person but it could affect five other people, to whom it was not addressed in the first place.  It could affect them even though they were not given the direction.  The way the section is worded, a third, or fourth party could find themselves in a strange position as a result of this.  I wonder why that is so and what situation the Minister had in mind when he produced a section worded like that.  Should he not simply say that a person who is given a direction under this Act shall comply with it?  I would like to know the answer because I think it calls for an explanation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor made all those points previously and I responded to them.  If a Minister does not reply by quoting precedents or similar situations that occur in other legislation, then he is pursued by Members of the House for not doing so.  When the Minister goes to the trouble of searching out similar wording in previous legislation and uses it, then it seems to be found that it should not have been done in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to say that in the drafting of these matters, the draftsman finds a certain formula of words that are suitable to deal with a particular set of circumstances, and I presume that over a continuing period of years, the draftsman recognises that if a certain formula of words achieves the results that were intended in the first instance, and if it has gone without challenge and no reason put forward for a challenge, then he obviously transmits it into further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>He devises it in such a way that there can be no challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is so, but it makes the point that although the Deputy does not think it is right, it does not mean that it was not right in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am questioning it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is saying that even if it was right in previous legislation, now it is time to change it, but the converse of that is that if it was all right for 50 years or so, it is good enough to be transported into this legislation in a similar way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister seek more power than that devolved to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That has to be the difference between the Minister and the Deputy and that is usually the reason for divisions subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is legitimate to say that citizens' rights are being taken away; I do not think there is any evidence to substantiate or support that.  The wording is used in aforementioned legislation and should anybody feel that a direction given to any person is not in order or that the Minister has acted improperly, then, as the Deputy knows, the options are open to the offended parties to take steps that are open to them, including, of course, <Col N="1300" /> an application for a judicial review which can be made with the minimum of notice and the minimum of fuss.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, this is required to enable what is proposed by way of reform to be put in place and it is also a direction that can only be given where there is that specific provision in a specific section of the Bill.  It is narrowed down in that regard and it has to be for the purpose of the Act and not for other matters to which Deputies might wish to address themselves under other legislation. I think that is fair enough.  Consequently I cannot accept the amendment.  I think we have given fair and considerable time to it, and perhaps we could move on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What about my second point with regard to the wording of the section?  Subsection (8) reads: &ldquo;A person affected by a direction under this Act shall comply therewith....&rdquo; What is the implication of the word &ldquo;affected&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy regard this as an important matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been considering this and I have asked that we might make a concession in that regard, I will put it to you in this fashion and if it satisfies the House and the House is agreeable, we could agree it; if not we will have to go in the other direction.  I would be prepared to accept the following in lieu of subsection (8):</P>
      <P>A person to whom a direction is given under this Act shall comply therewith....</P>
      <P>It might remove what seems to offend Deputy Taylor, although personally I do not think it will make that much difference, but if we can get agreement on that without the necessity of pursuing the amendment, I will be happy to do so, if the House is agreeable.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister <Col N="1301" /> to go a little further and insert the following words before &ldquo;he shall comply therewith&rdquo;&ldquo;provided it does not conflict with a valid direction by a local authority under section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do that because that stretches the meaning of what we are seeking to achieve and draws in other matters.  Directions can only be given for a purpose of the Act.  There is no hidden meaning in the existing version.  As far as I am concerned I am happy to accept a simpler form now if the House is agreeable. I now ask Deputy Mitchell if he would consider it?</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that an amendment which I proposed to section 4 has been ruled out of order. Section 4 deals with the repeal and revocation of previous legislation.  In the Schedule there are 22 Acts which are being repealed by the Bill.  They range from the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act, 1840 to the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>One thing that disappointed Members on this side of the House, and many commentators outside, was the extent to which the Bill completely ignored the question of local authority finance.  There is no provision in the Bill in respect of local authority finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one attempt I made to address the question of local authority finance was in the form of an amendment which would have repealed the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 which gave rise to water and service charges being made by local authorities.  They are very controversial charges which have not been accepted by the public.  They have been consistently resisted.  An <Col N="1305" /> active campaign of opposition to service charges continues throughout the country and in many parts it has led to great difficulties.  In some cases it has led to householders having their water supply cut off.  I recall the case of one householder in my constituency whose water supply was turned off in November 1988 and was not restored until last July when an order was obtained in the High Court to switch it back on.</P>
    <P>In the course of the last couple of weeks four householders in Cork have been jailed for non-payment of water charges and in other parts of the country people have been brought to court and forced into paying water charges by various means taken by local authorities.</P>
    <P>All but two local authorities, Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council, have water charges.  It is fair to say that the public do not consider water charges to be a fair system of raising finance for local authorities.  Householders who are paying water charges still consider them to be a form of double taxation and I suspect many councillors, including some of those who voted to impose water charges, are unhappy about them.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised that section 4 did not contain a proposal to repeal the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 because a number of specific promises were made by the Minister, and by a number of other Ministers, that this legislation would be repealed.  In 1985 the present Minister for Energy, then director of elections for the Fianna Fáil Party for the local elections, wrote to the Combined Residents Association and the National Association of Tenants Organisations. Fianna Fáil's manifesto stated that when returned to Government they would legislate to abolish water charges and would repeal the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act. 1983. There was no sign of that happening.  In 1987 Fianna Fáil were elected to Government and there was still no sign of the repeal.  In fact, at the 1987 general election Fianna Fáil repeated that promise in writing to the National Association of Tenants Organisations and a number of other bodies.  It comes as a surprise to <Col N="1306" /> me, therefore, that in this Bill there is no sign of a repeal of the 1983 Act and my attempt to have that Act repealed by way of amendment has been ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain to the House how section 4 can deal with the repeal of 23 different local government Acts when there is no repeal of the most controversial local government Act the country has seen in the past ten years. The Government promised they would repeal that legislation which is a source of controversy throughout the country. In the past three weeks alone people have been jailed under its provisions.  The Government owe the House an explanation for that and I should like to hear the Minister's explanation.  Will he go to the people in the 1991 local elections and say that although water charges were wrong in 1985, they are fine now because the Minister is in Government?  The Minister, and his party colleagues, will certainly be asked many questions about that issue in the next six or seven weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have amendments tabled.  While it is probably true that this side of the House has enjoyed more of the time available, the fact that I have tabled 163 amendments to the Bill would account for that.  The repeal section of the Bill is an important one.  It tries to bring into order many ancillary pieces of legislation.  The Labour Party sought to add to those enactments to be repealed the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983.  That was done <Col N="1307" /> in the sure knowledge that the Minister would have no objection to such a proposal, given that his party made such firm and clear commitments in that regard, the commitments in writing being made under the signature of the previous Fianna Fáil spokesman on the Environment, Deputy Molloy, now Minister for Energy.</P>
      <P>The 1985 manifesto <i>Power Back to the People, the Fianna Fáil Alternative</i>, states clearly that Fianna Fáil on return to Government would repeal that provision. More recently, a member of the European Parliament, Paddy Lalor, who was national director of elections for Fianna Fáil during the election campaign of February 1987, wrote to many organisations &mdash; and I have a copy of the letter to the general secretary of the National Association of Tenants Organisations &mdash; stating that Fianna Fáil were committed to the revocation of the 1983 legislation that gave power to levy local charges. The Minister's party have been very vociferous throughout the country in all those years &mdash; and 1987 is not so long ago.</P>
      <P>In relation to this matter Fianna Fáil have clear policy and written commitments. Frankly, the issue impacts on all of the commitments made by the Minister in the House.  What store can be put on ministerial commitments when they really mean nothing?  Was it in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> that the Queen of Hearts said: &ldquo;It means what I say it means, no more and no less?&rdquo;  There is a certain Alice in Wonderland attitude about the provision and about the serious and fundamental lack in the Bill, the issue of the funding of local authorities.  If any councillor, or member of a local authority, was asked what was the most fundamental question relating to local authorities at present, without doubt he or she would answer that it was that of lack of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have some statutory powers but they have no funding to do even those things that they are obliged by statute to do.  As a result, the roads are in a shocking state, housing programmes <Col N="1308" /> have virtually ceased and only now has housing maintenance commenced, although in the past couple of years, since the commitment was made by the Minister's party, many of the workers who maintain the housing stock, many of the workers who maintain the county roads, and thousands of other local authority employees have been sacked.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a case to answer.  He and his party went to the electorate with that commitment in 1985 and again in 1987.  It is now time that he was called to task on this fundamental issue, and there is no time better than the present.  I voiced that view very forcibly and very trenchantly to the Minister.  The House deserves a reply.  If Opposition Members cannot move those amendments, why will the Minister not in all honour accept the inclusion of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 among those enactments to be repealed under the Bill?</P>
    <P>I seek your guidance, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, at this stage.  I am desperately anxious, as are other Members on this side of the House, to address this fundamental issue.  It is clear that amendment No. 26 in my name is out of order because it puts a potential charge on the State.  There are amendments to amendments on the floor of the House already. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is it in order for me, or, indeed, Deputy Gilmore, to state in our amendments that, for example, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act be repealed and that it to be resolved that a wealth tax be enacted to produce the same amount of money to nullify the negative effect in financial terms on the Exchequer?  That could not be argued to put a potential charge on the State.  Members on this side of the House do not want the State to lose any money.  We want to knock down the insidious charge that the Minister and his party fought so valiantly against for many years until the Minister occupied the exalted position he now occupies.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I seek your help and guidance on the way I could put the amendment, or some variation of it, in order.  The Minister may <Col N="1309" /> well, on mature reflection, want to be of assistance and follow through on a commitment that he and his party colleagues repeated for so many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am sorry the Bill before us does not deal with the question of local government funding.  As I said earlier, no local government reform has any significant meaning unless local authorities have discretion as regards spending the money and raising it.  The Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, was supported by the Labour Party and ourselves.  That is not to say it is not capable of amendment or withdrawal and improvement &mdash; it is.  In fact, the principal concern people have, which Deputy Gilmore mentioned, is the element of double taxation.  While the local charges give some local discretion to local councils to raise funds, the perception among many people is that when the domestic rates were abolished in 1978 they paid for it by very much increased levels of income tax and VAT; they more than paid for reductions in rates and car tax.  Even if the Fianna Fáil party and Deputy Molloy, who was then in the Fianna Fáil Party and is now in the Progressive Democrats, had not so blatantly promised in 1985 to repeal the provisions of the 1983 Act and if Fianna Fáil had not so blatantly done so again in 1987 they might well ask what Labour are at because it was a Labour Minister who introduced this Act, but they had no case because on two occasions they went to the public saying they were going to repeal that decision.  Certainly I wish to see that provision repealed in an Act which would amend considerably the arrangements in relation to funding for <Col N="1311" /> local authorities and which would have as its principal feature that any local charges would be a direct claim against a person's income tax or a direct, equal and simultaneous reduction in the level of central taxation.  Otherwise you would have the legitimate complaint that for many people service charges mean double taxation.</P>
      <P>The other side of that coin is that many people who used to pay some form of tax when they paid domestic or agricultural rates and who have been relieved of those rates and pay no other tax have now been relieved from contributing altogether and that contribution has been loaded on to the PAYE sector.  Frequently we come across cases, we get letters and we know instances of a small shopkeeper who pays rates.  He has merely a small shop along a road where the vast bulk of the premises are owned by a landlord who has those dwellings in flats, earns a considerable income from them and makes no contribution. The abolition of rates should never have been extended to other than the principal private residences of the people concerned.  It should not have been extended to cover houses that were yielding an income or second or holiday homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one big gap in this Bill is its failure to address the question of local government funding which is a very central need in local government reform.  The omission of that point led my party to refuse to participate in what we saw as a charade, an all-party committee on local government reform whose terms of reference would have excluded the question of local government funding, yet my colleagues in the Labour Party and The Workers' Party who had these amendments down were willing to participate in that committee which we see as a charade. I think that view is borne out now by the fact that in the absence of a committee the Government appointed what they call a committee of experts who themselves were excluded by their terms of reference from looking at the question of funding but because of the weight of representations to them on the subject <Col N="1312" /> managed to include a little chapter dabbling in the funding question and have now sought some expert papers in this general area.  As I said on Second Stage or in my first contribution on Committee Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

After the passage of this Bill the Minister will have more extensive power to direct particular elements of expenditure in certain parts of a local authority.  We know the Minister is going to call the tune even more precisely than he has ever been able to call it in the past.  I would have loved to see section 4 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act repealed and in the Bill before us the central question of local government funding addressed, and no serious local government reform is possible without that.  I repeat that until the charges on the principal private residences of individuals are claimable or offsetable against central taxation and particularly against income tax, there will be a just case to answer for those individuals who feel they are being doubly taxed.  To what extent I would have supported the amendments tabled by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Gilmore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government and this House have lost a unique opportunity to deal with the question of funding and the whole reform of local government.  It is galling to hear Deputy Mitchell here tonight somehow or other putting the responsibility on and pointing the finger at the Labour Party and The Workers' Party.  His party, with all their experience of representation under various councils, have seen the problems.  They had 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the vote in their areas and know the difficulties involved in the running of local authorities.  Like all the other parties in this House they had a unique opportunity to look at all aspects of it.  I regret to say they washed their hands of their responsibility to bring meaningful local government to the <Col N="1313" /> people.  They took the easy option and the people are aware of that.</P>
      <P>A mechanism will have to be introduced to repeal this section on the basis of the commitments given by Fianna Fáil and by various Ministers throughout the years that adequate funding will be made available to the local authorities to ensure they can function to the people's satisfaction. The county councils throughout the country have a majority of Fianna Fáil councillors on the basis of that commitment. I regret that when the opportunity was afforded to the Minister and the Government to put into effect what they are saying they did not avail of it. The ordinary people ask how they can trust politicians when they say one thing and do something else.  As we have seen tonight, letter after letter is sent to representative organisations; promises are made: &ldquo;Vote for us and we will deliver.&rdquo; They did not deliver.  We have seen local authorities fall asunder because of the lack of commitment.  We are saying that now is an ideal opportunity to do something about it.  We in Opposition do not have the opportunity to do anything but the Minister has and we ask him to give a commitment.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about this legislation because we will not have an opportunity to discuss the relevant sections.  I hope that on 27 June I will be re-elected to a new Fingal County Council &mdash; I will have an identity crisis when I am elected to the Fingal County Council or whatever it is &mdash; and many more Labour councillors too.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned because this legislation, and this section in particular, will have a devastating effect on the ordinary people in that part of the county.  Apart from the rates support grant which has been reduced significantly over the last few years, 25 per cent of the revenue from the new Fingal area is secured from the commercial sector, and that is the maximum amount <Col N="1314" /> of revenue we can get.  The new Fingal area will consist of 55 per cent of the existing council area, but we will have only 25 per cent of the revenue.  This will create a major problem for the ordinary people of the new Fingal council.  How do we come up with that finance given that the area extends in the north from Balbriggan, Skerries, Lusk, Rush, Donabate, Swords, Mulhuddart, Howth, Portmarnock, Malahide and out to Lucan.  The Minister does not want to repeal that section because of funding. He has given no commitment in this Bill that extra funding would be made available to offset the problems I have identified here this evening.</P>
      <P>This is a major problem.  How will it be resolved?  If the rate support grant is not to be changed substantially, the mechanism is there for the local councillors to impose service charges and water charges.  That is the reason the Minister does not want to deal with it, notwithstanding his commitment.</P>
      <P>We are talking about equity and justice here.  The people of County Dublin and of the corporation area do not pay water charges because the Labour Party and The Workers' Party were to the forefront in making that a political issue.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors supported us, but that mechanism is still there.  That is the reason we in the Labour Party, and The Workers' Party, want to see that section repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to funding local authorities this section will have major implications. I would ask the Minister to take on board what I have said.  I am deeply concerned, and I am surprised, that my colleague the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, who is well aware of the needs of the people of Fingal could sit at the Cabinet table and allow this legislation to go through when he knows the effect it is having on the ordinary people. I attended a meeting with him only a fortnight ago where the business people of Swords, Skerries, Howth and Malahide said they were going to take the legislation to the Supreme Court because of increases of 100 per cent to 400 per <Col N="1315" /> cent in the commercial rate.  On the basis of the figures I have given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's contribution reflects the frustration felt by elected councillors, particularly when promises given by a Government when in Opposition are not fulfilled when they get into office &mdash; I am referring to the promise given in 1985 and the person who gave that commitment in 1985 is now a Minister in another political party, but is part of the present Government &mdash; and there is complete and utter disregard for the truth, for the promises to the electorate and for the justification of political parties and what they stand for.  This is travesty of justice.  Those of us who were involved in the legislation originally foolishly accepted it as a temporary measure, and the Minister agrees that it was foolish of us in Government to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Just because Deputy Spring is away at the moment the Deputy should not take liberties like that in his absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We were foolish to believe that it would be temporary because when people like the Minister come along temporaries become permanents, except in the area of staffing where temporaries <Col N="1316" /> remain temporaries forever.  The reality is that if the Minister accepted Deputy Taylor's suggestion on Report Stage he could put down an amendment to repeal the 1983 Act.</P>
      <P>The problem I see is slightly different from that outlined by my colleague from the new Fingal council.  In South Tipperary we have corporations, three urban councils and a county council.  People in the county council area, in county areas, shopkeepers in country areas and shopkeepers in towns which are not part of urban councils, were all paying service charges and people living in urban authority areas or corporations were exempt because up to then their rating structure included an element of funding for sanitary services.  Obviously there were good, justifiable reasons for introducing an element of justice throughout the charging system for sanitary services, water and sewerage.</P>
      <P>One could accept that the 1983 legislation was temporary on the understanding that there would be proper and adequate funding for local authorities, but as I have said, we were foolish to accept that.  We have since been promised by all and sundry, particularly from the Government side, that they would repeal that legislation.  The amendments ruled out of order tonight would have facilitated the Government in honouring their commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further problem I have identified in this area is that many changes have been made by county managers at Estimates time.  These people have availed of the 1983 legislation to increase charges and bring in major and irrevocable changes in the system.  We had originally identified in the 1983 legislation that certain sectors would be exempt from these charges on the basis that they belonged to the social welfare category, and we had taken into account inability to pay.  Since then managers in many counties, including my own, have brought in a further change, identifying the income of a family.  I mentioned this in my Second Stage contribution to this Bill.  Even if a person is on the lowest possible income such as supplementary welfare and their total <Col N="1317" /> income is more than £100 irrespective of the demands on that money, they would be excluded from the waiver scheme that was put into operation as a softening effect for the 1983 measure.  There are now different categories of people paying different charges for the same product.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts that some charge should be imposed but because there is an anomaly in the legislation and various county managers, assistant managers and town clerks throughout the country interpret the measure in a different way, some people in the same county pay more for the same supply of water from the same mountain.  For example, the residents in the Tipperary Urban Council area pay a different charge for the water from the Galtee mountains than their colleagues living half a mile away in Bansha who receive the same supply of water from the same mountain.  That is anomalous legislation, no matter who brought it in, and we should go home and recap on what we are saying to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest, this is an unpopular system of revenue collection by local authorities.  It would be possible for a person to take a council to court, by way of a Supreme Court or a High Court test case, because some areas do not pay these charges and in some counties different areas pay different charges.  Obviously this legislation is not in accordance with the Constitution because it is unfair and its administration is unfair.  People find there is a double taxation system. Some people are forced to stand up for justice and find themselves imprisoned while others secretly want to pay their fines because politically it is embarrassing for the Government.  Perhaps the Minister would accept the suggestion of Deputy Mervyn Taylor who gave his advice from a good legal background.  We want to be helpful to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister's colleague, Deputy Molloy, the Minister for Energy, and also one of the Ministers who promised to abolish this measure, is not in the House.  We want to facilitate the Government in abolishing the measure and then we can all stand up on the hustings outside the chapel gates and tell <Col N="1318" /> the people the truth, that we urged the Minister to live up to the promise he made when in Opposition.  That is a legitimate request, and I can see no other reason for debating the legislation at this hour of the night.  We will certainly assist the Minister and will participate in any committee that will address the problem of how local authorities should be financed. We should not have to depend on the rates from small shopkeepers throughout the country to fund local authorities or to come with cap in hand to the Minister for money.  Half the time we go home with our cap empty because the Minister pleads inability to provide funds.  Therefore I suggest that he seriously take on board the suggestions we are making on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>The committee on local government reform would not have been permitted by the terms of reference to address the question of funding, and I think even Deputy Howlin would admit that.  Consequently what Deputy Ryan has said about Fine Gael missing an opportunity to take part in the all-party committee does not stand up because the question of funding was not included in the terms of reference.  I believe &mdash; this is only a matter of judgment &mdash; that had the Labour Party and The Workers' Party adopted the same approach as Fine Gael we would have had an all-party committee on local government reform, the question of funding would be on the table and we would not have this draconian Bill before us.

      <P>Deputy Ryan made the point, which has to be faced up to by all of us, including you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the status of politicians is at a very low ebb; tragically &mdash; and unfortunately &mdash; we are regarded as a lesser form of life and when one analyses that one has to come to the conclusion that we have only ourselves to blame for having that low reputation.  It is what we do and the way we go about things; this is a very good example.  The commitments given by Fianna Fáil have already been referred to, but they warrant mentioning again.  I have this document &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Paddy Lalor, MEP&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is no laughing matter, I will read only one sentence from it: &ldquo;In relation to local changes Fianna Fáil are committed to the revocation of the 1983 legislation&rdquo;.  How can the Minister sit there?  Is he not squirming in his seat?  I am sure that the Minister is a man of his word but would he like it to be said of him that his word it not his bond?  The Minister should do what he said he would do all those years ago.  He should stand up proudly in this House and say that his word is his bond and that even though he is late, at least he will do it now.  This is the sort of thing that brings the whole profession of politician into disrepute, it <Col N="1322" /> is why we are regarded the way we are. Nobody believes anything that a politician says anymore.  Can you blame them?  People are not that stupid, they know how to assess an honest decision. We have laughed and joked in the House but it is sad to reflect on it.  The Minister brought in a Local Government Reform Bill which, quite frankly, is pathetic. Moneys are needed to repair corporation and council houses and indeed to build new ones but what is in the Bill?  Platitudes about consulting the local community, about promoting interest and involvement in local government affairs and platitudes about promoting surveys and studies in relation to the local community. If he came to my constituency &mdash; any constituency &mdash; and saw how people live in local authority estates he might change his mind.  Fianna Fáil say that the Bill will promote interest and involvement in local government affairs but I would give a lot to bring the Minister round some of the corporation estates in Tallaght and remind him of what was said in 1983.  It would be a very interesting and worthwhile exercise.</P>
      <P>I remember Fianna Fáil and the Minister in Opposition ranting and raving and banging on the table, talking at great length about the £5 gin and tonic in the bar.  Deputy Flynn exercised the full flow of his oratory, I remember all that. Where is it now when it counts?  He is sitting there now where the power rests. The question of financing local authorities is a very simple issue which boils down to a simple question.  I see these things in simple terms; it is not a question of the form in which we pass the Bill, it is whether they will keep their word and do what they promised to do in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, is not here; the people in the Progressive Democrats are highminded, the breath of fresh air in politics which will change everything and set new high-minded standards.  The Ministers, Deputies Molloy and O'Malley proved that they can get things done; they certainly proved it today as they were the tail wagging the dog in relation to the <Col N="1323" /> judicial inquiry.  We know where that came from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I am addressing the section.  The Minister, Deputy Molloy, gave a commitment that he would repeal the Act.  Maybe he did not have the power to do that, but I am illustrating the point that he and his PD colleague have power, which was proved today when they told the Taoiseach to set up a judicial inquiry or that they would not support the motion.  In the same way they could ask for the 1983 Act to be repealed or the present Bill would not go through but maybe they would not get the same kind of kudos as they will get from the judicial inquiry, out of which they will do very well in publicity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I intend to be brief because I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter.  It seems that everyone in the House agrees that the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983, which introduced water charges should be repealed.  The Fianna Fáil Party suggested this as far back as 1985 and repeated it in 1987. Indeed, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, when director of elections for Fianna Fáil is on record as suggesting this and he is a man who, when he puts his foot down, tends to get his way.  It would be very welcome if he got his way on this. I hope I do not disrupt our good relations with the Labour Party when I say they were in Government when that legislation was introduced.  They are now in favour of repealing that Act.  I understand from what Deputy Ferris said that at the time they thought it was going to be a temporary measure.</P>

      <P>There is agreement that service charges should be abolished and I would like to know whether the Minister proposes to do this and meet the promise made repeatedly by his party since 1985. In an effort to facilitate him, if he would lke to sleep on the matter overnight, I propose, since my amendment has been ruled out of order, to try to table a new amendment tomorrow on Report Stage which would have the same effect.  It has been said that the amendment would <Col N="1325" /> have imposed a charge on the Exchequer but the Minister now has an opportunity to come clean.

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House probably knows, the Sallins meat processing factory which was upgraded about five or six years ago, was one of our most modern and efficient meat slaughtering plants in Ireland.  The people of the area, the employees, the management and all those associated with the plant were of the opinion that it was well capable of surviving for the foreseeable future. Therefore, it came as a great shock to the people of the area when on 3 April last notice was given to the employees that the plant would be closed with the loss of more than 100 jobs.  The closure of this plant will have a number of serious consequences unless action is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> The closure of the plant will have a devastating effect on the local economy, with a consequential detrimental effect on the national economy.  Some weeks ago I put down a question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the closure, and he replied that this was a matter for the owners of the plant.  I accept that the owners are responsible for the running of the plant, ensuring that it stays in operation, etc. but the letter issued to the union representatives on 3 April stated:</P>
    <P>You will appreciate that in view of the protracted period of &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; at the group's factory in Sallins and with no prospect of a resumption of work in the foreseeable future there is an obligation on the group to decide on a course of action for the factory and employees.</P>
    <P>Any decision on the future of the factory must have regard to the generally depressed state of the markets for beef in third countries, the aftermath of the Gulf War and BSE scares. All of these factors combine to make beef slaughtering for third countries very difficult and this situation is likely to continue.  Consequently the group is not in a position to resume operations at the Sallins factory and in accordance with the redundancy payments Acts 1967-84 has decided to make the workforce redundant.</P>
    <P>That was soul destroying for the employees at the plant and the people in that general area.  We in County Kildare lost a similar plant at Leixlip some years ago and this, on the heels of that, is a huge blow to the local economy.  More important, the factors outlined by the group chief executive in that letter to the unions at that time refer to the Gulf War, the difficulty in selling to third countries and the BSE scare.  The Minister has responsibility for the latter.  There would not be a scare detrimental to the selling of our products in countries outside Ireland if the necessary action had been taken.  I can accept the Gulf War was a problem, but the other factors should not have arisen having regard to the fact that the plant had been modernised.  All the <Col N="1334" /> work necessary to ensure continued employment and slaughtering at the plant had been carried out.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the alleged overcapacity in regard to slaughtering.  I would remind the Minister, however, that only a couple of years ago a huge PR operation was launched when further slaughtering facilities were being provided at other centres throughout the country.  That is all very fine.  What is peculiar is that in County Kildare we have lost two plants.  The last plant to close was a very efficient one and there was no reason why it should close if the marketing factors had been carefully monitored and the necessary remedial action had been taken by the Department.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister said previously, in reply to parliamentary questions, that that was a matter for the owners, there is also a responsibility on the Minister, and his Department, to examine the possibility of reviving the plant and ensuring continued employment in the area.  He should examine the possibility of eliminating the difficulties that have arisen in the marketplace to ensure that other plants do not suffer the same problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions regarding operations at meat premises are entirely commercial matters for the individual firms concerned.</P>
      <P>News regarding the closure of the Hibernia Meats, Sallins, slaughtering plant broke on Tuesday, 7 May 1991.  The reasons given by the company for the closure were a decline in export sales as a result of the Gulf War and the BSE scare, which adversely affected third country markets such as Iraq and Iran in autumn 1990.  Hibernia were heavily engaged in exporting to these markets whenever that was possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further contributing factor to the closure is the seasonal nature of cattle supplies at meat export plants.  Supplies of finished cattle are seasonally low at this time of the year and slaughterings normally decline to a half or less of the level reached in the late autumn.  Meat <Col N="1335" /> factory employment accordingly peaks in the autumn and eases in the following spring.</P>
    <P>The Hibernia Group had a relatively small share of the national kill and the closure of the plant will not have a significant effect on the national slaughtering capacity.  Accordingly, the threat of a monopoly in the meat industry does not arise in this instance.</P>
    <P>I understand that the company intend to keep their other beef processing plant at Athy, County Kildare in operation.</P>
    <P>My functions in relation to controlling the operation of meat plants are to ensure compliance with the health standards set out in the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 and the various EC Directives and Regulations and to enforce controls and operations benefiting from the Common Agricultural Policy.  I do not have a commercial role.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the Irish beef sector, and indeed the beef industry in other EC countries, has been undergoing a particularly difficult period. There has been heavy reliance on intervention support to prevent a major collapse in market prices.  A crucial factor in supporting prices has been the availability of safety-net intervention which was negotiated by the Minister for Agriculture and Food during the last review of the beef regime in 1989.</P>
    <P>Community intervention stocks of beef as at 28 February 1991 are estimated at 680,000 tonnes of which Ireland accounted for 218,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, however, our future must be secured on the market. Industry, farmers and the Department each have a role to play.</P>
    <P>My Department's target is to improve the overall trading framework under which the meat industry operates.  This has been adversely affected by seasonality in our natural grass-based beef production.  Accordingly, my Department are encouraging a shift in emphasis from commodity trading on a largely seasonal basis in favour of expanding year-round trade in value-added products for the continental EC market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> CBF and producers have drawn up a five-year development plan in consultation with the industry for an intensive marketing effort within the Community.  As a measure of support for that plan the Exchequer grant-in-aid to CBF has been doubled in 1991 to £1.5 million.  Grant assistance to firms will of course continue to be targeted at addedvalue production.</P>

      <P>The closure of the Digital plant in Clonmel is a massive blow and will have devastating effects on the social and economic life of the town. Since the first scare that the factory might close, we lived in hope for two months that the factory would be saved.  The news yesterday that 350 jobs will be lost to Clonmel in the long term, has left the entire area in a state of shock.</P>
      <P>The alarming consequences of yesterday's decision are that up to £12 million will be lost in wages and other service jobs to Clonmel.  This is happening to a town with 2,000 people already on the unemployment register.</P>
      <P>The people of Clonmel find little comfort in the phased closure of the plant.  I resent a reported statement by a spokesperson for the IDA who said, &ldquo;the reality of life is that all the workers in Clonmel could have been put on the dole queue. There is no definite threat to the factory&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I find this statement alarming, coming from the very body to which we must now entrust our future.  The plain fact is that 350 jobs will ultimately be lost to Clonmel and the closure means one thing only &mdash; the lengthening of the dole queue.  I ask, how could the IDA find any consolation in such an announcement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> The Minister too praised Digital on their phased closure and on consolidating the Galway plant.  I must point out that for Clonmel; the departure of Digital, now or in 12 months time will be painful and harsh and will have disastrous consequences for the town.</P>
    <P>There is only one way forward now, and that is for the Minister and the IDA to place Clonmel as top priority for a replacement industry.  No words of confidence from the IDA about finding such an industry will convince me that the economic life of Clonmel will not suffer a far reaching blow, until I actually see a new industry in progress and employment provided.</P>
    <P>I hope I have impressed on the Minister how deeply the town of Clonmel is affected by yesterday's announcement. Every effort was made by the county council, Clonmel Corporation and the Chamber of Commerce to save the plant. Unfortunately, they failed.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to inform the House of what he proposes for the future of the workforce.  Their reputation and ability must be sterling assets in seeking an alternative industry.  I request the Minister to meet a deputation of the workers to discuss an immediate replacement plant for Clonmel, suitable to the skills and expertise of the present workforce.</P>
    <P>This vacuum must be filled without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Therese Ahearn for allowing me to share her valuable time.  If anything, she has understated the case, because the blow is devastating to a constituency represented by all of us, including Deputy Davern and yourself, a Cheann Comhairle.  The implications of what has happened cannot be emphasised sufficiently for the Minister.  The implications for a town and a county that have suffered from 24 per cent unemployment in the past two years cannot be overstated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister needs to make a commitment that he will not allow the final phasing out of the factory to take place until he and the IDA have put in place a <Col N="1338" /> suitable replacement industry that can take up some of the unemployed people who will lose their jobs as a result of the redundancy programme.  As soon as possible there should be a meeting with the statutory bodies, the Lord Mayor, my colleague.  Alderman Lyons, the chairman of the council, the manager, and all the other agencies who have worked so hard to convince the company that the operation was viable, efficient and productive, and made profits.  There is no justification for a company that collected £7 million of taxpayers' money to set up in Ireland having done what they have done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to say that we all have a deep sense of shock and resentment that the Digital plant has gone.  However, I should like to thank Digital for the tremendous investment they made in Clonmel over many years and in the training they provided of personnel and staff.  Their efforts for the past two months, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, to prevent the closure have at least succeeded in delaying it for one year.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important to note that the company will help to try to find a replacement industry in the sale of that factory. In the context of another industry coming into the area it will be essential to have the commitment of the workforce loaded by the people for whom they worked.</P>
      <P>We are not looking at what is happening today with any bitterness.  We are looking with confidence-the confidence I know Digital have in the workforce &mdash; to an assured future for the highly trained workforce in a replacement industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When it first became known in February that Digital Equipment Corporation were considering the closure of their facility in Clonmel, both myself and the IDA made extensive <Col N="1339" /> efforts to avert the closure.  Therefore, I was relieved to hear yesterday that Digital were to retain their manufacturing operation at Clonmel for an extended period so that every effort could be made to find a new business for the plant.</P>
      <P>The minicomputer industry worldwide is facing considerable difficulties at present, and most of the major players in this industry have found it necessary to consolidate, and to increase their manufacturing efficiency.  It was with regret that I learned that because of such difficulties Digital have decided to consolidate all hardware manufacturing operations to the Digital facility in Ballybrit, Galway.  This decision was taken as part of the company's review of their manufacturing capacity worldwide, which has resulted in capacity reductions in both the USA and elsewhere in Europe.  Fortunately the number of immediate redundancies in Clonmel will be limited to between 30 and 50.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the impact on the economic and social fabric of Clonmel will, through the combined efforts of the IDA and the company, be kept to a minimum. Digital will maintain some of their manufacturing operations in Clonmel, employing between 100 and 120 people, for an extended period.  During that time, the company have agreed to work closely with the IDA to find an alternative business for the plant.  The quality and reputation of the workforce in Clonmel, the quality of the plant, and the co-operation of Digital should make it possible to find a new owner for the factory in the shortest possible timeframe.</P>
      <P>Digital will also provide advice and assistance through outplacement services for any employee who may wish to find employment outside the company, perhaps wishing to remain in the Clonmel area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reassured by the fact that Digital Equipment Corporation have invested heavily &mdash; more than $1.5 billion &mdash; from their own financial resources in new product development and consolidation over the past 18 months.  In response to major market changes in the computer industry <Col N="1340" /> the corporation are restructuring their worldwide business to focus on growth areas within the sector, particularly UNIX systems, network management systems, desktops and PCs.  In addition, they are undertaking a major geographic development of their market, particularly into Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Digital Equipment Corporation first established a manufacturing facility in Ireland in 1971.  Since then, the company have shown a high degree of commitment to Ireland through expansion and the addition of high skill design and development functions.  The workforce have proved themselves to be a significant contributor to the success of the corporation. I am confident that this commitment by Digital will extend to their effort to minimise the impact of the closure in Clonmel, and that with the combined efforts of Digital and the IDA, a replacement industry will be found in the shortest possible time frame.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give one minute of my time to Deputy Deenihan. I thank you for allowing me to raise the matter of the Klopman factory in Tralee during the adjournment debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Klopman International is a polycotton industrial firm in Tralee that exports product to a sister factory in Italy.  Klopman produces 55 per cent of the polycotton of Europe.  They have announced a major rationalisation of their European polycotton operations, both in Ireland and in Italy.  The company have been affected by the increasing levels of fabrics being imported from low cost countries and by the dumping of polycotton on EC countries from India, Pakistan and Mexico, which countries are selling polycotton on the European market at a cost less than they are selling it in their own countries.  That has resulted in fewer sales and depressed prices for Tralee Klopman. Sales from outside the EC are regulated by the Multi Fabrics Agreement &mdash; MFA, as it is known.  That regulation lays <Col N="1341" /> down import controls to the EC from those countries.</P>
    <P>One of the countries exporting to Europe, India, sent their quota to Europe in two months and they are exporting to Europe via other countries &mdash; getting in by the back door.  Klopman, with the suport of the Confederation of Irish Industry, have complained to the EC about these irregularities and the dumping of fabric on the EC market by India, Pakistan and Mexico.</P>
    <P>The Tralee plant employs 494 people. A decision will be made very soon on its future.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, to use his good offices and influence to try to ensure that Klopman Tralee do not close.  When the GATT negotiations take place, I ask the Minister to try to ensure the control and proper monitoring of the importation of polycotton into Europe.  I request the Minister to get in touch with the Confederation of Irish Industry and to press them to get on to the EC in relation to the dumping of polycotton on the EC.</P>
    <P>The closure of Klopman would be a disaster for Tralee, increasing the number of unemployed and seriously affecting the economy of Tralee town. Tralee and surrounding areas are suffering greatly from unemployment, and it is very important to save the Klopman industry for County Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McEllistrim for allowing me one minute of his time.  I remind the Minister that Tralee is now one of the unemployment blackspots in the country.  At the moment the unemployment figures for Tralee and the surrounding region stand at 4,080, an increase of 966 over this time last year which represents an increase of 23 per cent.  Klopman's closure would intensify this depression and, if it resulted in a large number of redundancies that would add to the problem.  I request the Minister to involve his Department and the IDA as much as possible in the negotiations between the unions and management in an effort to keep the number of redundancies to a minimum and so ensure the <Col N="1342" /> future viability of the plant for the sake of the economy in Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been keeping myself informed of the situation affecting Klopman International Limited, and I share the Deputy's concern at recent developments in relation to the Tralee operation.  I would, however, like to point out to Deputy McEllistrim that closure of the Tralee plant has not been proposed.  What the parent company, Dominion Textiles Inc., Canada, have announced is the implementation of a major rationalisation of their European operations in both Italy and Ireland, which admittedly will result in job losses in Tralee.  The House will realise, of course, that in the case of any enterprise a decision of this type is a matter essentially for the owners and management of that enterprise.</P>
      <P>In March 1989, Dominion Textiles Inc. purchased the former Burlington industries plants at Tralee and Gillogue, County Clare.  Since the purchase, the Tralee plant has operated as Klopman International Limited employing 494 people at present in the production of polycotton fabrics for the work wear and leisure wear markets.  The former Burlington dyeing plant at Gillogue has remained idle since 1985.</P>
      <P>Over the last two years Klopman have being experiencing very difficult trading conditions caused by recession in the UK market and competition from low cost sources, principally India, which has resulted in depressed prices in Europe for the company's product.  This has led to the company's recent announcement of their rationalisation programme.  The reduction in output at the group's Italian plant will result in the loss of some 300 jobs there.  I understand management are seeking a reduction in the working week in Tralee from seven to five days which will result in about 115 redundancies and some reduction in earnings for the remaining workforce due to loss of shift allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the adverse impact both economically and socially of the proposed rationalisation plan in the <Col N="1343" /> Tralee area.  I can understand the disappointment of those affected and I sympathise with them.  However, management insist that the implementation of their rationalisation plan is vitally necessary in order to maintain a viable operation in Tralee and I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the company must react to the market situation. Moreover, it is important that necessary corrective action is taken now since delay could lead to the necessity for more drastic action at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I am particularly concerned that official strike notice has been served on the company.  While I can understand the frustration of the employees concerned at this difficult time, industrial action would not be helpful in the context of the parent company's review of the Tralee operation and I would appeal to the employees and to the unions concerned not to damage the future prospects of the company and the plant by going on strike within the next day or two as is apparently proposed.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, a major factor giving rise to the company's current difficulties is the increase in imports from low cost sources.  This is a consequence of the ongoing liberalisation of trade in textiles in the context of the multifibres arrangement which governs international trade in this area.  Notwithstanding this, my Department have had ongoing contacts with the company to ensure that all possible protective trade measures were applied to assist them.  We have had limited success in this area but, of course, the Deputy will appreciate that decisions in relation to the introduction of trade measures are taken on the basis of strict economic criteria which must be agreed at EC level and I must regrettably say that other member states, in particular in this case the UK and Italy, have not always shared our concerns in the matter.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the multilateral system for trade in textiles is currently under review in the context of the negotiations on the Uruguay Round and a commitment has already been given for <Col N="1344" /> the eventual integration of trade in textiles into GATT on the basis of strengthened GATT rules and disciplines.  The position adopted by the Community, which is supported by Ireland, is that integration should take place smoothly in order to create confidence and predictability, which is important for business both in importing and exporting countries.  I can assure the House that Ireland attaches particular importance to the need for the strengthening of GATT rules and disciplines in relation to selective safeguard mechanisms, anti-dumping measures, subsidies, etc., which would allow for a system of genuinely fair trade.  We maintain that the duration for the phasing out of existing restrictions should depend on the extent to which these GATT rules and disciplines are strengthened.</P>
    <P>To return to the current difficulties faced by Klopman International Limited, I can assure Deputies that I am keeping in very close touch with developments. Both the IDA and my Department will continue to keep in regular contact with the company to assist them, as far as possible, in dealing with their present difficulties in an effort to secure their future viability and to keep job losses to a minimum.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I propose to call on the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Deenihan, Deputy Gerry Reynolds, Deputy Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>, Deputy Alien and Deputy Cotter.  Each Deputy is entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and each statement will be followed immediately by a two minute reply by the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <P>The criteria used in the proposal to the EC to reclassify less <Col N="1345" /> severely handicapped areas to more severely handicapped status were (a) land quality; (b) low farm income, that is family farm income for farm worker not exceeding 40 per cent of the national average family farm income; and (c) high dependence on agriculture, that is more than 40 per cent of the working population engaged in farming.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister here tonight whether those criteria will be changed when the appeals tribunal are set up so that areas that were not included in the last proposal will be brought in. Unless the criteria are changed there is no chance that large tracts of north Kerry, for example, and other parts of the country, will be included.  Will the brief the Minister is giving to the appeals tribunal include a change in the criteria as they exist at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The reclassification proposals sent to the EC consisted of two parts.  In one part all existing mountain sheep grazing areas were proposed for reclassification to less severely handicapped status on the basis of the five criteria used for designation of new areas. These are laid down by the EC for member states and are expressed either in absolute terms or geared to national agriculture and demographic statistics. We have no discretion in proposing changes to them other than changes to reflect significant shifts in land use and population trends over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the proposals sent to the EC was to reclassify less severely handicapped areas to more severely handicapped status and the further national criteria used were (a) land quality (b) low farm income, that is family farm income for farm worker not exceeding 40 per cent of the national average family farm income and (c) high dependence on agriculture, that is more than 40 per cent of the working population engaged in farming.  It will be open to the appeals body to review these national criteria in marginal areas and make recommendations to the Minister in <Col N="1346" /> relation, for example, to income thresholds having regard to the cost implications and availability of the necessary credits under the Structural Funds.  In the last analysis, approval of national reclassification criteria and proposals is a matter for the EC Commission.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the situation in my county and its disadvantaged areas where a large number of headage grants have not been paid. The Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food promised these headage grants would be paid prior to Christmas.  I have on my files details of over 100 cases of farmers in Sligo and Leitrim who have received no headage payment as yet.  This is a despicable action by the Government and it shows their insensitivity towards farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  I am extremely angry because the farmers' income limit has been reduced considerably over the last number of years and they need headage payments to survive.  The Government did not provide these headage payments when they should have provided them at Christmas.</P>
      <P>I would also like to take up the matter of the TB reactor grants.  Efforts have been made for a long number of years to get rid of the problem of TB and a great deal of money has been spent trying to do so.  I have a number of constituents who are waiting in excess of nine months for payment ofTB reactor grants.  This is a despicable action by the Government. Today I was speaking with departmental officials who informed me that the money is not available to pay reactor grants.  I would be grateful if the Minister could have this money made available immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there has been no unreasonable delay in making payments under the 1990 livestock headage and premium schemes. The present position is that a total of around £245 million has now been paid in respect of about 318,000 applications under these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cases remaining unpaid are those <Col N="1347" /> on which queries of one kind or another have arisen and the payments cannot be processed further until the applicants concerned supply the additional information which has been requested by my Department.</P>
    <P>There is no long delay in the payment of TB reactor grants to affected farmers. The time scale for reactor grant payments is governed by a number of factors namely (i) the receipt of evidence of slaughter of the reactor from the meat export premises, (ii) certification that cleansing and disinfection of the affected holding has taken place if required, (iii) the herdowner has to produce a tax reference number if the grants exceed £500 and a current tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners when the grants are in excess of £10,000.  Any time lag in the receipt of the necessary documentation will result in delay in grant payment.  Payment of reactor grants may only be made where the conditions set down for payment are satisfied in all respects.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I could shorten this two minute contribution to two seconds by asking a simple question, when, but I had better observe protocol.  The Abattoirs Act came into operation on 22 June 1989. Carlow County Council, being very obedient to the laws of the land, appointed a vet on the basis that the funds would be received because they could charge for the services.  Nothing happened, and last year the council spent £30,000 towards the payment of the vet and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 17 May 19901 put down a question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, asking when the regulations would be introduced.  Following a long answer he concluded by saying that: &ldquo;Further regulations are at present being finalised and are expected to come into operation in the near future&rdquo;.  Again nothing happened so I raised it on the Adjournment on 5 December 1990.  This time the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1348" /> and Food, Deputy Walsh, took up the cudgels and having given much information, which I had known in advance, concluded by saying: &ldquo;By highlighting the matter the Deputy has helped expedite the regulations&rdquo;.  Now we are back to the anniversary of 17 May, almost exactly to the day, when I am asking the question again: when will the regulations come into operation?  If the Minister is having difficulties &mdash; as he seems to be &mdash; I would ask him to either withdraw the Abattoirs Act or else compensate Carlow County Council for obeying a foolish rule which the Government introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

      <P>The provisions of the Abattoirs Act which provide for the collection of fees by local authorities in respect of veterinary examination of animals in domestic abattoirs will be commenced shortly when regulations providing for the veterinary examination and health marking of fit meat are finalised.  These regulations are in the final stages of preparation and I hope to introduce them shortly.  The delay has been due to the technical complexity requiring translation of detailed technical procedures into the correct legal form.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the delay has caused difficulty for the local authorities but it is hoped that this issue can be finalised very soon.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that we should be burning the midnight oil tonight to discuss the issue of Irish Steel. At present we are in the throes of the worst unemployment situation in this century.  Cork has not escaped and has a 10.4 per cent increase in unemployment figures in the last 12 months.  The Minister gave me a reply recently in the House to a question regarding Irish Steel.  I would ask the Minister to give us up-to-date information on the situation there.  This industry is vital to the interests of Cork which has suffered many setbacks in the past.  I hope that everything possible will be done to ensure the survival of Irish Steel.  I would ask the Minister to say what is happening in relation to the rationalisation programme, which is <Col N="1349" /> another word for job losses.  Perhaps he could also tell us the present stage of the negotiations which are taking place with the foreign interests which are often quoted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the Dail on 24 April last, efforts to find a suitable partner for Irish Steel are continuing but there have been no significant new developments in the matter recently. Contacts are continuing with the former Korf organisation, which is now owned by Metallgesellschaft, with a view to determining whether that group are now prepared &mdash; since their take over &mdash; to make a serious proposal.  Obviously I would be very interested to hear that because Metallgesellschaft is a major company.  There are no further developments regarding North Star or Ispat at present.  The possibility of any interest by a Japanese steel firm is being pursued currently.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear that my primary concern is to seek to ensure the future viability of the company and its workforce. In my reply here on 24 April I said:</P>
      <P>It is incumbent upon me to use my judgment to try to ensure that whoever buys Irish Steel is the best possible person &mdash; or company &mdash; from the point of view of the country and the workforce and the continued viability of the company well into the future... I would say to those who are frustrated that it is in their own interest that we try to get it right rather than just get rid of it.</P>
      <P>Which is what is being urged on me.</P>
      <P>I have had detailed discussions concerning the future of Irish Steel with both representatives of the workforce of the company and the board and management of the company in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations between management and unions in the company are at an early stage regarding a package of rationalisation measures including proposals for 96 voluntary redundancies.  It is in the interest of the company that these <Col N="1350" /> negotiations be brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.  This should improve the competitiveness of Irish Steel which is trading at present in a very difficult international environment. Unfortunately, the company is likely to return to a loss for the current year to end June.  This follows two years of modest profits.</P>

      <P>We will now hear a two minute statement from Deputy Cotter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to discuss with the Minister the failure of the Government to do anything constructive to achieve lower insurance costs especially for hard pressed motorists.</P>
      <P>The Government should admit that they have failed the electorate regarding liability insurance.  The insurance companies have failed also in their responsibilities to their clients.  The Government have made a number of changes in various areas, for example, in court procedures, but to no avail.  Insurance costs have continued to soar and already this year insurance companies have increased premiums by between 5 per cent and 13 per cent from already very high threshold levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that a Government task force be set up to take urgent steps to tackle this disgraceful situation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice should use their considerable power to drive down considerable costs.  The task force should see to it that a number of steps are implemented; first, that the Road Traffic Act is rigorously applied thus improving driving standards generally; second, that insurance companies co-operate with the <Col N="1351" /> Garda in rooting out fraud which is costing the insurance companies large sums of money each year; third, that insurance companies make a strong effort to reduce the cost of administration which is higher in Ireland than in other countries; fourthly, that uninsured driving be cut out &mdash; if that was achieved it would mean a saving of up to £30 million per year &mdash; and, fifthly, that an ethos of honesty be created through heavy media advertising or some such effort.  We need a rigorous and thorough approach.  If such approach was taken, insurance costs would come down and we would save the insurance companies millions of pounds.  In turn, the reduction in cost should be passed on to the hard pressed motorists, industrialists and everybody who relies on liability insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy of what I have said in this House on a number of occasions over recent months, that is that the price of insurance, particularly motor insurance, is substantially dependent on the frequency of claims and the cost of settling those claims.  Unhappily, in this country that frequency and that cost are abnormally high.  It may have something to do with what the Deputy said about the ethos of our approach to insurance and to claims but unhappily, I do not think media advertising will change that ethos. If it could be done that easily I am sure it would have been done by now.  If anything, unfortunately, the position is getting worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the question of fraud and I am glad he did.  I was delighted to find that a prolonged major fraud in which one individual has had II successful claims in the courts in Cork over the last eight years has at least been <Col N="1352" /> uncovered.  His latest attempt at a fraudulent claim has been dismissed by a judge there, together with five other fraudulent claims that were taken together.  This is a much more widespread practice than people realise, and I am glad the Deputy has adverted to it.</P>
    <P>I have for some time past been most concerned at the high cost of motor insurance and have been active in seeking ways of achieving reductions.  To this end an inter-ministerial group, comprising of the Ministers for Justice and the Environment, the Attorney General and myself, are at present examining ways and means of improving the environment for motor insurance in particular.  This group are focusing on strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation, amendments to the Road Traffic Acts designed to reduce the motor accident rate, suggestions to improve the cost and availability of motor insurance and improvements and alternatives to the courts system for the resolution of per sonal injury claims.  I am hopeful that this will result in a number of positive proposals which can be implemented ini the very early future.  I would add however, that Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs.  Consumers must play their part by increased awareness of the need for safety.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the high level of uninsured driving which is a major contributor to the cost for those who do insure their cars.  The interministerial group which I have mentioned has con up with certain proposals of a fairly drastic nature, but nonetheless a nature that I think is necessary, which we hope to put before the Government for agreement within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.05 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 May 1991.</P>

      <P>Controls applicable to fishing by beamer trawlers in Irish fishing waters are set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3094/86.  In this regulation specific restrictions are imposed on the operation of beam trawlers.  These restrictions which are set out in Article 9 (2) &mdash; (5) include a prohibition on the use of beam trawls within 12 miles of the coasts of Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Beam trawling, which is a particularly effective means of fishing certain species such as sole and plaice, involves, because of the techniques used, the scraping of the sea bed.  A recent EC Commission report prepared by the Scientific and Technical Committee for Fisheries reiterated its earlier advice that there was no evidence to suggest that effects of beam trawling on the sea bed were adverse for commerically important fish species.</P>
      <P>The report recognised that further research was needed into the effects on the sea bed benthos of all sea-bed fishing gears and not only beam trawls.  Such research should consider both short and long term effects on the benthos.</P>
      <P>I am, nevertheless, somewhat concerned about the potential risk to stocks from widespread beam trawling activities and it is my intention in the management of fleet development in the next five years to give greater priority to fishing methods which have a more positive impact on conservation generally.</P>

      <P>As both bridges mentioned are located on regional roads, responsibility for the proposed projects rests with the local authority, Kildare County Council. The cost of such works normally falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department for such roads and details do not have to be submitted to the Department for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discretionary grants allocated to Kildare County Council in 1991 total <Col N="1162" /> £1,868,000, including a supplementary grant of £500,000 for improvement works of the special needs of the county.  The determination of priorities in the expenditures of these grants is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>Special grants are occasionally made available to local authorities for projects on non-national roads.  Limited funds are available for the provision of such grants and there are a number of meritorious projects awaiting this form of assistance.</P>
    <P>The local authority's consultants have prepared a preliminary design and a cost estimate of £624,000 for a scheme involving improvements to Bond Bridge and the nearby railway bridge and the improvement of the immediate approach roads.  The authority have requested a special road grant for this scheme, but I am not in a position to accede to this request in 1991.</P>
    <P>In February 1989 proposals were received in my Department from the local authority for the construction of a relief road at Celbridge.  The proposed scheme would cost an estimated £1.3 million and would include a new crossing of the River Liffey.  In March 1989, my Department wrote to the local authority drawing attention to the normal method of financing such works and informing them that there were no funds available from which a special grant could be provided.</P>

      <P>On 30 September 1988 the person concerned applied for a road freight carrier's licence.  Every applicant for such a licence must satisfy the EC requirements of good repute, appropriate financial standing and professional competence.  To satisfy the professional competence requirement, an applicant must be the holder of a certificate of competence or employ a transport manager who is the holder of such a certificate to continuously and effectively manage his haulage business.</P>
      <P>The applicant was fully informed on a number of occasions of the necessary requirements to complete his application. Since these were not produced since the date of application, it was decided to treat the application as lapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, the applicant claims to have been a haulier in the UK but did not produce a certificate of competence from the authorities there.  There is no <Col N="1168" /> provision in the legislation whereby the person named could be granted a certificate of competence on this basis. However, the applicant could satisfy the competence requirement by employing a transport manager who holds a certificate of competence or by obtaining an Irish certificate of competence through passing the appropriate examination conducted by the Chartered Institute of Transport.</P>
    <P>I cannot grant a road freight carrier's licence until he makes a new application satisfying the necessary requirements outlined above.</P>

      <P>The franchising function under the Radio and Television Act, 1988, is the prerogative of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The Carlow-Kildare station was granted an extension of their original franchise area by the commission, following which they submitted proposals for potential locations (including Redgap), on which to site a transmitter.</P>
      <P>The ministerial function of issuing a licence in respect of such services is essentially of a technical nature, under which a radio frequency and other technical parameters relating to transmitter characteristics are assigned to the commission for the benefit of the service being franchised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an examination of the proposed sites, the commission decided the site at Redgap was not compatible with its overall plans for the independent radio sector.  The alternative site proposed by the station however, at Cupidstown Hill, is acceptable and I am glad to advise that a frequency (97.5 MHz) has now been assigned to north Kildare and a licence <Col N="1169" /> has been issued to the IRTC in respect of a transmitter at this site.</P>
