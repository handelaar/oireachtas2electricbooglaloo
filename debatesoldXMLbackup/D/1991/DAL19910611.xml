    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5 June, accompanied by the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour and Tourism, Transport and Communications, I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss economic and social developments in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic <Col N="1316" /> and Social Progress.</i> On 6 June, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and myself met the presidents and representatives of the IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme in the context of the programme to discuss developments affecting the farm industry.  On the same date, accompanied by the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce and Labour, I met representatives of the CII, FIE and the CIF to discuss economic and social developments in the context of the programme.  Copies of the joint statements which issued after these meetings have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The meeting with the ICTU reviewed the progress made generally in implementing commitments under the programme and discussed the employment and unemployment situation.  I announced a series of measures which would help in that regard including: (a) a new Community Employment Development Programme in the 12 pilot areas under the Area-Based Response to Unemployment; (b) an increased intake of 2,500 into social employment schemes this year; (c) an increase by 1,000 a year in the number of apprenticeships; (d) the establishment of crèche facilities for working parents and the necessary training of staff in the 12 pilot areas under the Area-Based Response to Unemployment with a view to the initiation of a national system; (e) a new marketing initiative in tourism; (f) a review of industrial policy; (g) new International Financial Services Centre projects and services; and (h) the exploration by commercial State-sponsored bodies of the potential for new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICTU and the Government reiterated their commitment to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and their determination to ensure that it was not undermined in any way.  It was agreed that a special Task Force on Employment of senior executives from the public and private sectors be established under the Central Review Committee to monitor the job situation under the programme and to explore all possibilities for new job creation.  I propose to meet the chairmen <Col N="1317" /> and chief executives of commercial State bodies very shortly.</P>
    <P>At the meeting with the farming bodies the position arising from the recent EC price decision was reviewed and the potential threat from the forthcoming CAP reform proposals discussed.  It was agreed that proposals put forward by the farming bodies to alleviate the position in relation to farm incomes would be discussed further by them with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It was also agreed that when the CAP reform proposals are received from the European Commission they would be discussed between the Minister and the farming bodies and that a further meeting under the programme would take place with the Minister and myself to discuss the appropriate response to the Commission's reform proposals.  I avail, of course, of every opportunity of emphasising to my colleagues in the European Council the vital and unique importance of the farm industry to our economy.</P>
    <P>At the meeting with the employer organisations the position in relation to employment and unemployment was reviewed.  They stressed that in their view there were now positive indications of recovery in the economy and in employment.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Employment, which will be chaired by the secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, will comprise the secretaries of the Departments of Finance, Labour and Industry and Commerce, the chief executives of Aer Rianta, the ESB, Telecom Éireann, IDA and CTT, senior business executives from the CII, FIE, CIF and ICOS and representatives of the ICTU.  The first meeting of the task force will take place on Monday next, 17 June.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Area-Based Response to Unemployment, six local companies &mdash; Coolock-Darndale, southwest Wexford, west Waterford, southwest Kerry, Cork north city and Finglas &mdash; have been established on an interim basis pending finalisation of the necessary statutory procedures and meetings of <Col N="1318" /> these companies have taken place.  A seventh company, Dundalk, has met informally and its first formal meeting is scheduled for 19 June.  In Ballymun and Dublin inner city some nominations are awaited and meetings will be fixed when these are received.  In the remaining areas &mdash; Tallaght, Limerick city and north Mayo &mdash; consultations are still on-going with the local communities.  Staff appointments, which will be funded by the Central Review Committee, are a matter for the local companies.  To assist the local companies, the Central Review Committee co-ordinating team arranged for the placing of advertisements for managers in each of the selected areas. The local companies will make their selections from the applications received.</P>
    <P>The number of persons unemployed in Dublin as at 31 May 1990, was 70,307 and as at 31 May 1991 was 78,694.  The Area-Based Response Programme includes five of the long term unemployment black-spot areas in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of extra jobs that will be created from the various initiatives. The Government particularly welcome the fall of 4,500 in the May live register figures which confirms the downward trend already evident in April when, but for the temporary addition to the live registrar because of the ESB strike and the Waterford Crystal short-time working, the live register would have declined also by 4,500.</P>
    <P>All of the social partners have reaffirmed their full commitment to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which ensures the maintenance of a low-inflation competitive economy as the basis for an increase in economic growth and employment as the international trading climate continues to improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, having regard to the discussions he has outlined in some detail and bearing in mind the crisis in unemployment on the one hand and the fact that the Government's budgetary figures are now seriously adrift, if he proposes in <Col N="1319" /> response to these new factors to introduce a supplementary budget this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept the statement by the Deputy that the budget figures are adrift, and there are no plans at this stage for anything of the nature suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the paucity of the measures described by the Taoiseach, and which, by his own admission and that of many other people, will not produce any significant increase in jobs, does the Taoiseach not concede that the Government projections in relation to the budget of January this year do not relate to what the figures and likely to be and that some change in Government finances is now necessary if employment is to be created?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I do not accept the Deputy's statement in regard to paucity of measures.  The measures we have outlined are comprehensive and are so regarded by the social partners.  With the measures already in place they will make an impact on the employment and unemployment situation.  The Deputy will recall that the IDA target for this year is 20,000 jobs, and quite recently the IDA have confirmed that they are still optimistic about achieving that target. With the comprehensive approach of the Government every possible effort will be made to tackle unemployment by the provision of jobs, primarily in the private sector.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, by its operations, will result in the recruitment of a considerable number of personnel to the public sector, though the Deputy knows full well that it is not our philosophy to create jobs in the public sector for the sake of creating jobs.  I accept that it does seem that the unemployment figures this year will be higher than those on which the unemployment payments were based at budget time, but it is much too early yet to say whether that will cause an overrun on the budget because there are may other factors to be taken into account in the total budgetary arithmetic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely what additional jobs will be undertaken by the task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to deal with that question.  My main objective for the task force will be to concentrate on the elimination of impediments to job creation, new projects and developments generally.  I am sure the Deputy will have heard me say on a number of occasions recently that inherent in our system are a number of inbuilt impediments to development and job creating projects. Those impediments go right across the board.  One I have mentioned is that Government Departments, in pursuance of their own particular briefs, are sometimes not conscious of the need to facilitate development where possible.  In many other areas there are specific inhibitions to development, impediments that either delay or totally obstruct development projects.  I want the team, which will be a very expert team with a comprehensive range of knowledge and experience, to consider that particular aspect in depth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Department of Finance agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach explain the way in which the measures he has announced amount to anything more than scratching the surface?  How do a hoped-for 2,500 part-time jobs under the social employment scheme, 1,000 apprenticeships, or an untried development and community development project, constitute any solution to the dimensions of the unemployment crisis? At what point will the Government cease to consider the level of unemployment as a problem and consider it to be a crisis for which real measures will have to be taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are taking real measures &mdash;&ldquo;positive steps&rdquo;, <Col N="1321" /> to use the Deputy's phrase.  There is the programme itself, which has a battery of policies directed to unemployment and the creation of employment.  I remind the Deputy that under the previous programme, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; about which he was not very enthusiastic at the time &mdash; the Government did create 70,000 extra new jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary task of the Government in a free enterprise economy is to create the conditions.  I believe the Government have done that; in fact, the trade unions agree that the Government have created the proper economic environment &mdash; low inflation rates, comparatively low interest rates and a favourable balance of payments &mdash; under which the private sector can perform and produce jobs.  Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, particularly because <Col N="1322" /> of the recession in the UK and the United States and the uncertainty created by the Gulf War in the earlier part of this year, the private sector has not yet this year produced the volume of jobs that we would wish.  However, in conversations with me, they indicated they are confident there will be an upturn in job creation, which is already evident from their order books and other indicators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that more task forces and more reviews of industrial performance are the last things we need?  I pursued the publication of the second triennial report of industrial performance for one year; it was finally published a year too late.  No effective action has been taken on it.  We have a plethora of detailed analyses of industrial performance, virtually all of which concluded by giving the same range of options: we are not getting value for money in terms of industrial policy, we need to develop an indigenous sector; that is where the Government should act, rather than wait for yet another review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are not waiting for another review.  These measures announced are for now, they are to be implemented immediately.  I do not completely disagree with the Deputy about the value of reviews of one kind or another, but they do have their function, particularly when they are good, analytical reviews.  The Deputy referred to indigenous industry.  The examination that the Minister for Industry and Commerce now proposes to carry out will be directed specifically at indigenous industry, it will not be another Telesis.  It will examine indigenous industry to see why that is not developing, growing and providing the jobs we need.</P>

I intend no discourtesy to the Leader of the main Opposition party, Deputy John Bruton, but as the Chair said earlier, I feel he considers he has an obligation to call Deputies in the order in which their questions appear on the Order Paper.  If Deputy Shatter gives way to his leader, I should be happy to call Deputy Bruton.</P>

      <P>Unemployment stood at 215,000 in May 1990 but now stands at 260,000 if one takes into account those on pre-retirement schemes and credits, would the Taoiseach not agree that that is a disastrous performance and that there is a very real jobs crisis?  Would he not also agree that a recycling of the contents in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in the announcement he made after meeting the ICTU last week, does not address the problem and that major new initiatives are required to tackle what is a growing crisis that will otherwise inevitably result in an unemployment level of 300,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>No, I do not agree.  It is easy to make such sweeping type of generalisation criticisms, but the Government have to deal with reality.  The matter has been discussed in detail in constructive dialogue with the social partners, particularly with congress, who are just as concerned about unemployment as Deputy Shatter is or as the Government are.</P>

The position has to be <Col N="1324" /> analysed in a co-operative way with the social partners and between us we decide what can be done to alleviate the problem. That is what has been done and what the Government are doing.  I do not like to speculate on such matters, but I am prepared to say that the Deputy's estimate of 300,000 unemployed by the end of the year is widely off the mark.</P>

Does he know that he has been likened by a number of congress members to Rip van Winkle, sleep-walking through an unemployment crisis that he does not recognise?  The most recent statistics available from the Confederation of Irish Industry show that job advertisements in the national newspapers were down by 26 per cent in May 1991 compared with 1990, which indicated that we are into a growing recession and into a growing jobs crisis and that things are getting worse, not better.

Would he not agree that in this and in many other respects he is out of touch with reality?  Would the Taoiseach further tell me if, as he now accepts, the average figure of 228,000 unemployed in the budgetary assumptions is to be exceeded, what is the Government's current budgetary assumption for the average level of unemployment for the year?  Furthermore, in regard to a statement about the removal of impediments to employment, would the Taoiseach not agree that each of the last four budgets introduced by his Government have actually increased the impediments to employment through deepening the poverty trap faced by many families with children where the breadwinner either wishes to go to work or to increase his take-home pay?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the collapse of the figures <Col N="1337" /> for the number of house completions during the four years he has been in office is an indictment of his policy?

In 1987, 15,376 private houses were completed but that figure rose to 18,536 in 1990.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the country will not face water shortages again this summer; the steps he has taken since last year to ensure an adequate water supply for each local authority area; the amount of money allocated for water provision and augmentation since last summer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The water shortage difficulties that affected a number of areas throughout the country during 1990 were due primarily to the low rainfall during that year.  My Department are in close contact with local authorities with a view to developing proposals that will provide a greater guarantee of supply to consumers.</P>
      <P>During 1990, £31 million was spent by my Department in providing new and improved water supply schemes throughout the country.  I also approved contract documents for schemes to go to tender valued at £46 million.  In addition, I approved tenders valued at £33 million for schemes to go to construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the current year I have allocated grants totalling £36 million to fund <Col N="1340" /> the major schemes construction programme. I have also allocated £1.47 million for water schemes under the small schemes programme.</P>
    <P>Over the longer term, the environment action programme announced the Government's decision to spend up to £300 million between now and the year 2000 on new and improved water supply schemes.  Implementation of this programme will greatly improve both the quality and security of water supply to communities around the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister is not going to claim responsibility for the deterioration of the weather which will result in an improvement in water supplies, can he assure the House notwithstanding the sanctioning of the moneys to which he referred in his reply &mdash; some of the schemes will not be given effect until the year 2000 &mdash; that we will not see a repeat of severe water shortages in a number of urban areas?  Is that what he is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that water shortages were experienced in a number of areas during 1990, most notably in Dublin.  The water level at the reservoir at Roundwood was at its lowest for many years and in an effort to increase supplies, water was supplied from Ballymore Eustace and Leixlip.  Water levels are back to normal at present but the position has to be monitored very carefully. As the Deputy is aware, work is in progress on a major augmentation scheme at Ballymore Eustace. Additional supplies will be made available as a result.  We expect to be in a position to monitor the position with a view to averting water shortages, if at all possible, this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask my question in another way.  Is the Minister aware that people living in third and fourth floor flats <Col N="1341" /> in inner city areas had not a water supply for most of the working day during the past year?  In the light of all the information available to him, can he now tell the House there will be no water shortages in Dublin this summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot guarantee that. The Deputy will recognise that what I say is reasonable and will agree that very substantial moneys have been made available and approved by me in order to try to improve the situation.  There is no shortage of money in so far as making available these supplies which would increase the volume of water for Dublin. I am pursuing the matter as quickly as I can.  There is a good monitoring system in place and the water management programmes will, I think, be adequate to deal with the situation this year but as the Deputy has said, the level of rainfall in May was down very substantially on previous years and this was not good for the water supply.  However, supplies are back to normal for this time but we are certainly taking very close note of the position.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the estimated total number of inhabited dwellings in the State which are still without (a) bathrooms and (b) indoor toilets; the number of these which are local authority owned and privately owned; and if, in the case of privately owned dwellings, he will outline the steps he proposes to take to ensure that all homes in the State have bathrooms and indoor toilets before the end of this century.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> stated that there are about 6,500 rented local authority dwellings which still lack <Col N="1342" /> bathroom facilities &mdash; some 2,500 of which also lack an indoor toilet &mdash; and announced the introduction of a new sub-programme backed by a special provision of £2 million in 1991 to assist local authorities to progressively eliminate this deficiency in their housing stock.</P>
      <P>In regard to the housing stock generally, preliminary results of the 1990 survey of the housing stock indicate a very significant improvement in the position regarding these facilities over the past ten years.  The plan indicates that summary results of the survey will be published later in the year.  The 1991 census of population will provide the usual ten yearly definitive figures.</P>
      <P>The provision of bathroom facilities in private houses occupied by elderly or disabled persons can be assisted under the disabled persons grants scheme and the task force for the elderly.  Under the new scheme of improvements in lieu of local authority housing, local authorities may also provide these facilities.  Furthermore, the revised loan and income limits for local authority house improvement loans, announced in the plan, will help occupiers of private housing to provide these facilities.</P>
      <P>As more information on the nature of the residual deficiency in these facilities becomes available, I will be reviewing the need for additional measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not acknowledge that it is estimated there are up to 25,000 households still without bathroom and indoor toilet facilities in the last decade of the 20th century?  Does he further acknowledge that his Government abolished grants to assist people to provide bathroom and toilet facilities for themselves?  Would he agree that the time has long since passed to reintroduce these grants to provide these very basic facilities so that before the end of this century every dwelling will have the basic facilities of a bathroom and an indoor toilet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to see that target reached.  I know that in the past the Deputy has concentrated his <Col N="1343" /> remarks on these matters to the deficiencies in local authority housing but now he has switched the emphasis to private housing stock.  The only information I can give him in that regard is that a limited survey carried out in 1980 whan about 23,000 units are inspected showed that 19.5 per cent of the houses surveyed had no fixed bath or shower. However, in a survey carried out in 1990, and as I have said it was limited, that figure was reduced to some 8 per cent of houses without fixed bathroom or shower facilities.  Obviously, a very big improvement has taken place in the housing stock over that period.  We are now trying to get an analysis of the tenure of houses, that is a breakdown of the number of local authority houses as against the number of private sector houses.  When that information comes to hand, I will be happy to make it available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Good progress has been made.  With the allocation of more money for the remedial works scheme and the introduction of a new sub programme to provide bathroom and toilet facilities in local authority dwellings we can look forward to seeing the matter disposed of finally in a reasonably short period.  I think the Deputy would agree with me on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept, given the point he has been making about the allocation of resources to provide money for the provision of bathroom facilities, that if the moneys provided this year, are repeated in future years it will mean that people in local authority dwellings will have to do without bathroom facilities and indoor toilets for up to 16 years?  Would he not accept that at the present level of expenditure it would take at least 16 years to eliminate the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that for the following reasons.  It is, as the Deputy knows, the responsibility of the local <Col N="1344" /> authorities themselves to provide money to deal with this matter from their own maintenance and management resources in so far as local authority tenants are concerned.  An additional £16 million will be provided under the remedial scheme and this money can also be used to provide sanitary services.  On top of that, as a further assistance, £2 million has been provided specifically for the provision of bathroom facilities.  When one considers that, together with the increases in loans and the availability of both secured and unsecured loans of up to £3,000, we can look forward within a short period of years to disposing of this problem, which I agree needs attention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if he and the Government were seriously concerned about the housing crisis and the conditions in which people have to live in existing dwellings they would provide the money for these basic facilities?  Would he agree also that the raw materials needed to execute the work are all available at home so this would give him a great opportunity to create some jobs, which are urgently needed, while providing these basic facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would certainly create some jobs.  However, I would make the point that the disabled person's grant scheme and the moneys provided under the task force for the elderly, run by the health boards throughout the country, together with the £16 million for remedial works and the allocation of £2 million for the specific sub-programme to provide bathroom facilities for local authority houses and the increase in the limits for secured and unsecured loans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the total number of deaths in 1988, 1989 and 1990 arising from road accidents where a person was over the drink driving limits; and if he will outline the steps he proposes to take to remedy the situation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought in the first part of the question is not available. However, the number of persons killed between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. is generally accepted as providing an indicator of alcohol related deaths.  On that basis, it is estimated that alcohol is probably a factor in about 30 per cent of all road deaths.  Detailed information in relation to road accidents in 1988 and 1989 is given in the annual report <i>Road Accident Facts Ireland</i>, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library.  The report for 1990 will be available later this year.</P>
      <P>I intend to propose amendments to the Road Traffic Acts with a view to applying a more stringent blood alcohol limit and introducing other measures related to drink and driving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can rest assured that he will have the support of this side of the House for the measures he will propose.  Would he indicate what his proposals in the new legislation will be for reducing the blood alcohol limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the <Col N="1346" /> Deputy say that he will support any measures that would be contemplated in an amendment to the Road Traffic Acts. We hope to be able to introduce the amending legislation in the autumn.  An interesting statistic is that 35.8 per cent of the 460 road deaths in 1989 occurred between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. We draw our assumptions from that kind of statistic and I think we are fairly accurate in that regard.  We are contemplating reducing the limit of the level of alcohol in the blood to something similar to what is current in many EC member states, that is 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it does not matter very much what the limit is if the law is not enforced? Good enforcement steps were taken over last Christmas especially but can the Minister say what steps he proposes to take to ensure that the road traffic legislation is enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was quite a big improvement last year, particularly at Christmas, which was brought about by better enforcement of existing limits.  In the first quarter of 1991 there has been a reduction of 28 per cent in the number of road deaths compared with the same period in 1990.  We do not have the final figures for May but it is suggested that the favourable trend will continue.  It is all due to enforcement and we look forward to continued support from the gardaí in pursuance of our objective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's main responsibility as regards the directive is to ensure that <Col N="1347" /> land based activities, including effluent discharges from industry and sewage treatment, are compatible with the maintenance of the water quality standards required by the directive.  Local authorities adjoining designated areas take account of the directive when licensing discharges to waters or to sewers and in planning waste water treatment and disposal.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Water, Sanitary and other Local Services, 1989-1993, taking account of relevant environmental and economic factors, recognises the importance of a satisfactory accommodation between sewerage services and fishery developments. The programme also acknowledges that in some shellfish growing areas, improvements in water quality are needed to eliminate sewage contamination and promote acquaculture. Schemes in Tralee and Wexford harbours are included in the programme to this end.  Further schemes are included in the draft ENVIREG Operational Programme which is awaiting EC Commission approval.</P>
    <P>The Environment Action Programme has stated the Government's decision to eliminate untreated discharges of sewage from major coastal towns by the year 2000 at a cost of up to £400 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  I can say positively that I have met the county managers on a number of occasions and I have discussed the financial performance of the local authorities under their control in the context of Government policy.  Some of those discussions were wide ranging and adverted to revenue performance in certain areas in a general way.  I am not denying that.  The Deputy might be referring to the fact that the managers' association launched a publicity campaign in September 1988 regarding service charge collection.  The introduction of that campaign was not subject to my approval or to the approval of the Department.  The Department were not consulted in any way and the Minister had no involvement in that campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister support the publicity campaign by the city and county managers to which he referred and the campaign which followed by some city and county managers of pursuing the collection of water charges to the point of putting householders in jail? In view of the Taoiseach's statement yesterday, have the Government abandoned their commitment to repeal the legislation which allowed the imposition of water charges in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of legislation is a matter for the statutory body charged with that responsibility. The Minister has in no way indicated to managers or to their association that they should do anything in this matter.  I am concerned that they act properly in the performance of their functions.  They have done so quite well over the past few years, particularly when one considers that their accumulated deficit in 1987 was <Col N="1351" /> over £80 million.  The deficit of local authorities is now about £40 million.  They have improved their performance quite dramatically and this has led to a much better system of management in the local authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>It is the intention to provide a motorway on the N1 from Dublin to <Col N="1355" /> the Border.  Priority has been given to the development of the following strategic sections of the route:</P>
      <P>The Dunleer by-pass will be 10.25 kms long and will by-pass Dunleer from Monasterboice to Capoge bridge.  The main contract for construction of the scheme was signed in February, 1991 and work is in progress.  It is expected that the road will be open to traffic in autumn 1993 at a cost of £24 million (1989 prices).</P>
      <P>The Balbriggan by-pass will involve 12 km of new route from south of Balrothery to north of Gormanstown.  Dublin County Council are preparing a motorway order scheme for the route under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974.  Construction is scheduled for the period 1993-1996 at a cost of £30 million (1989 prices).</P>
      <P>The scheme for the Dundalk by-pass involves the construction of a 10.5 km by-pass to the west of Dundalk with a link to the existing N1 at Ballymascanlon. Construction is scheduled for the period 1993-1997 at a cost of £26 million (1989 prices).</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we left this at the point where we had just voted on a Fine Gael amendment dealing with the circumstances in which a warship might not be exempt from the provisions of this Bill.  Section 4 has two parts.  One is the general part providing that the Bill shall not apply to any warship or any ship used for the time being by the government of any country for purposes other than commercial purposes.  The second part proposes that if the Minister is satisfied that such an exemption would not result in an increased risk of pollution he can make regulations exempting certain classes of ships from compliance with this Bill.  Fundamentally I object to that section of the Bill because we have in this State traditionally valued our neutral status, a status that has been under a certain amount of pressure in recent times from people who believe that in order to be good, modern Europeans we should in some way adopt a warlike attitude to our neighbours and to the world generally.  That is not a view I would share.  We are still a neutral country.  Our Navy is not very large, and some would say in terms of protecting our coastline and protecting the commercial and fishing interests &mdash; which we should be protecting &mdash; it needs to be enlarged. Certainly we are not in the league of <Col N="1424" /> having warships or of having ships which might be used in a war.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about here is exempting warships of other countries, which would include submarines and so on.  The Minister confirmed on previous occasions that the activity of submarines, particularly in the Irish Sea, poses a threat to fishing and commercial vessels.  Not very long ago we saw a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; documentary which raised the terrifying prospect of these submarines, in some circumstances, being out of control, that their commanders, because of their isolation, might not necessarily always act in the most rational manner.  There is a very dangerous threat to our environment, to fishing interests and so on as a result of the activities of these ships.</P>
      <P>I do not see the justification for the exemption of warships from this Bill.  This Bill is about sea pollution and is designed to prevent pollution occurring in the first place.  Our beaches will not distinguish between the oil from a warship or from a commercial vessel.  I do not think warships should be exempted from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am concerned also about subsection (2) which would give the Minister the power to make regulations which would exempt other classes of vessels from the terms of the Bill.  That gives rise to a situation which would undermine the whole purpose of the Bill, which is to protect our seas and our coastline from pollution by ships.  The Bill is undermined if the Minister has the power to make regulations which exempt certain classes of ships.</P>
      <P>I am opposing the section.  I would like to hear the Minister's justification for including this section in the Bill in the first place.  I do not see any justification for a neutral country incorporating a section dealing with warships into a Bill on sea pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now calling Deputy G. O'Sullivan.  As far as I can recollect, we had a fair amount of warfare on amendment No. 7a.  Even <Col N="1425" /> though a few days have elapsed, repetition is not encouraged.  However, we may have to refresh our memories on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that we do refresh our memories because it is a very important section.  I withdrew my amendment for the simple reason that I thought I might confuse the issue.  I fully support my colleagues in opposing the section.  I fail to understand why there should be an exemption for any type of ship.  It is fair to say that some of the naval ships which are being exempted would be antiquated, and I am sure the House would agree that we have had cases of naval ships which were not-seaworthy. There have been instances throughout the world where naval ships have created problems.  For some peculiar reason &mdash; we are all anxious to hear what the Minister has to say on this &mdash; vessels of all navies are being exempt under this Bill.</P>
      <P>When this Bill came before the House we were very enthusiastic about it because for the first time we felt this country was getting its act together and that we would have an input into preserving the environment, our marine life and the seas around our coast.  We are an island nation and it is very important that all aspects of pollution be addressed. Having looked at the exemption, I cannot see any particular reason anyone should include that section in the Bill.  The only conclusion I have been able to come to was that perhaps some of the nations which were involved in MARPOL up to now, had fairly large naval forces and it might have been very expensive for them if their naval ships had to comply with the regulations laid down under the MARPOL Convention.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's response to our opposition to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having examined the Bill and the various types of pollution from ships we have seen since the Bill was first laid before the House, I fail to see any reason an exemption should be made for any type of craft, whether it be a naval vessel or a commercial vessel; the same rules and <Col N="1426" /> regulations should be adhered to by all. Some naval vessels are antiquated.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the Bill make provision for sewage disposal and so on. There may be a cost factor involved if commercial firms and Governments have to comply with the regulations laid down in this Bill and if the ships were to be modernised in such a way as to dispose of sewage inland as distinct from dumping it at sea.</P>
    <P>I oppose the section for the reasons I have given.  I do not see any reason a particular ship, irrespective of whether it is flying a naval flag or any other type of flag, should be exempt from the stringent and tough regulations governing our seas. We have come to realise that the seas are one of our main resources.  This Bill gave us an opportunity to have some input into international legislation.  What the Minister has put before us is, to a large extent, a copy of another Bill in another place.  I would say at this stage that we should be independent and not go down the road of other nations.  I will have to wait for the Minister's response but at present I have no alternative but to oppose the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues with regard to the unacceptability of this section.  The Minister in response to amendment No. 7a, said that because it was part of the MARPOL Convention there were certain boundaries or parameters we had to be part of.  I take that point.  However, when the section focuses on ships and warships in wartime, then we have to be careful and we have to be particularly fearful.  The point has been made already that we are not a warlike nation or a military nation and we have a high regard for our neutral position.  If our waters were used by warships, as of now, that would mean those warships were in Irish waters and presumably inside a neutral zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most alarming point about this is that while the Convention prohibits the dumping of noxious liquid substances, sewage and garbage, particularly plastic, no reference is made to nuclear effluent. <Col N="1427" /> When we think of submarines and warships we think of nuclear submarines and nuclear warships.  I think most people throughout the world welcome the progress made in regard to the dismantling of both long and short-range land nuclear weapons.  However, Governments have not concentrated on the deadly and subversive nuclear warships which sail the seas at present, a practice most ordinary people are unaware of.  There is an urgent need for this section to be removed from the Bill as long as that practice continues.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this House or outside needs to be educated about the long term consequences of nuclear and radiation effluent.  Unfortunately many warships still carry nuclear warheads. Therefore, it is very important that the most deadly pollution of all should be subject to the terms of this Sea Pollution Bill which attempts to keep the seas around Ireland free from pollution.</P>
    <P>In view of the drastic implications of nuclear warships and submarines and the fact that they have not been dealt with in any disarmament process, these vessels should not be exempt from the provisions of this Bill.  If a referendum was held tomorrow I believe people would endorse our nuclear-free status.  We will be totally ignoring our nuclear free status if we include a section in this Bill which will allow for the risk of dumping from nuclear warships and submarines.  We are opposed to this section and I ask the Minister to support us in our opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Gilmore, I did not seek to amend this section as I believe it is totally incapable of being amended and therefore I am opposed to it.  I think I spoke on the section on the previous occasion when the Bill was debated.  I will not detain the House very long as I would only be repeating what other Deputies have said but I should like to make a further point which has not been made so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason the Minister has given for the inclusion of this section in the Bill is that this is what is provided for under the MARPOL Convention.  We can, if <Col N="1428" /> we so wish, go beyond the MARPOL Convention.  We would be quite within our rights in laying down regulations regarding the passage of ships in our territorial waters.  We should try to set higher standards and not just accept the standards laid down by MARPOL which in this instance are minimalist.  This Convention goes back many years and obviously pressure was brought to bear by certain nations at the MARPOL conference to water down this clause as much as possible.  This is exactly what has happened.</P>
    <P>It is a nonsense to exclude warships from the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister should try to convene another MARPOL Convention so as to amend the original MARPOL agreement and include warships.  We want all nations to accept that pollution from warships whether their own warships or warships from other countries, is unacceptable.  As a neutral country, a special obligation rests on us to be ahead of the pack in this instance and not to follow other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion we discussed the Bill we had an extensive debate on this section.  At that time the amendment tabled by me was defeated.  That amendment sought to provide an exemption for warships during times of war.  Like my colleagues, I am opposed to this section which seeks to give a free run to all types of warships to use our territorial waters.</P>
      <P>I think we all agree that the Naval Service, as an arm of the State, should give the best possible example in the prevention of pollution.  I am sure navy personnel would be very happy to be included within the terms of the Sea Pollution Bill.  I have no doubt that the navy cause very little if any, pollution and it would be in the interests of the community generally if they were not given special status over and above the business community, the fishing community or the operators of any other type of vessel at sea.  This is one of the reasons I believe the navy should be included within the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> I want to refer to the more serious problem posed by warships from countries such as England, Russia, France and the United States which constantly carry out manoeuvres around our coast.  As Deputy Barnes said, most of these vessels are nuclear-powered submarines.  It would be totally unacceptable for us to pass a Sea Pollution Bill which did not impose restrictions on these vessels. Deputy Garland referred to the terms of the MARPOL Convention.  I agree with the points made by the Deputy in this regard.  The MARPOL Convention has been signed by many countries and as a sovereign State we are not limited to the terms of that Convention; we can go a step further and introduce more restrictive legislation than the MARPOL Convention suggests.</P>
    <P>This is why I ask the Minister to go further at this stage and not merely say, as he did on Second Stage, that the Bill implements the MARPOL Convention. As the House of Parliament of a sovereign State, this House has the ability to introduce legislation over and above the terms of the MARPOL Convention. Over the past number of years the Government have sought to convince the public that they are seriously concerned about pollution and our environment.  If they are serious about pollution and preventing pollution, including the most serious and horrific pollution of all, nuclear pollution, then they have an ideal opportunity to date to show that they have been sincere in their repeated expressions by removing this section from the Bill.  This section does not in any way enhance the Bill but detracts substantially from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important not to lose sight of what we are trying to do here.  We are trying to legislate in such a way that the MARPOL Convention becomes effective so far as Ireland is concerned.  There are five annexes to that Convention, as the House knows from the Second Stage debate, and various countries have subscribed to various annexes.  The concerns expressed by the Deputies today are serious and <Col N="1430" /> deserve serious consideration.  However, there is a touch of the alarmist about it. We must reflect that we want to get <i>en rapport</i> with 58 countries that have already subscribed to the MARPOL Convention, and this legislation enables us to do so.  We will then be part of that team which is attacking pollution under the five headings that attach to the five annexes.</P>
      <P>I am not offering an excuse but simply explaining the position.  The Legislatures of 58 countries have seen to it that those countries have subscribed to the MARPOL Convention.  I will mention some of them &mdash; it is important to mention those that might have similar status to ourselves as regards the nuclear problem. For example, Sweden found no problem in subscribing to the Convention, nor did Switzerland and Finland. I mention only those few because of their known attitude towards nuclear power and neutral status.</P>
      <P>I explained already that the question of admission of warships into Irish territorial waters is not relevant to this Bill. That question would have to be legislated for under a different framework and under the competence of a different Minister, namely, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We cannot add to the MARPOL Convention or take from it. The curate's egg is there, and some people regard only part of it as being good, but we take the whole egg or we take nothing at all.  I do not believe that we are doing damage to the thrust and purpose of the Bill by subscribing to the Convention.</P>
      <P>I may have read into the record of the House Article 3 (3) of the MARPOL Convention.  Subsection (1) as it is drafted reflects the terms of that Article which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Convention shall not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.  However, each Party shall ensure by the adoption of appropriate measures not impairing the operations <Col N="1431" /> or operational capabilities of such ships owned or operated by it, that such ships act in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practicable, with the present Convention.</P>
    <P>We also mentioned the Intervention Convention. Article 1 (a) of that Convention states: &ldquo;However, no measure shall be taken under the present Convention against any warship or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.&rdquo;  It is the belief of 58 countries that this Convention in no way damages their position with regard to nuclear power, nor has it inhibited them from making any other regulations.  It is important for us to get into this league, and we can only do so on the terms I have proposed.</P>
    <P>I want to make three further points. There is an internationally accepted principle that no State may exercise jurisdiction through its laws over the warships of another State.  This subsection simply reflects that principle.  Ireland may not exercise jurisdiction over warships of another country in the same way that another country cannot exercise jurisdiction over our ships.</P>
    <P>Second, the subsection does not change in any respect the well known policy, expressed by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Ministers in this House and elsewhere, on nuclear powered vessels or vessels carrying nuclear weapons.  I stressed this at length in my Second Stage speech and I will repeat it.  It is the policy of the Government not to grant permission to nuclear powered vessels or to vessels carrying nuclear weapons to enter Irish ports.  Foreign naval vessels are entitled under international law to transit the territorial waters of another State in exercise of a right of innocent passage.</P>
    <P>Third, if warships were not exempted from the scope of international conventions, such as MARPOL, very few States would become party to them and we would not have global agreement &mdash; this is the point I am trying to make, we <Col N="1432" /> want to join the team &mdash; on issues which have global implications as far as pollution is concerned.  For that reason I stand by the wording of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that we are spending quite some time on this section and that is good because it is probably the most controversial section in the Bill. There is general agreement across the House on the desirability of this State getting on board as far as the MARPOL Convention is concerned.  The Minister's reply is somewhat disingenuous.  He listed three countries, one of which, Switzerland, has no territorial waters at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It has ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it has no territorial waters.  Apart from its own vessels, it will not have to worry about policing its territorial waters in respect of the naval vessels of other States.  The Minister also mentioned Finland and Sweden.  It does not follow that because those three countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned only three out of 58 countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking that into account.  There is nothing in the MARPOL Convention that requires this State to incorporate this exemption into the Bill.  Secondly, the exemption the Minister is proposing to build into this Bill goes far beyond the MARPOL agreement and Article 3 (3) of that agreement. Article 3 (3), as I interpret it, was intended for those countries who have large navies, such as the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and so on, whose military and naval services exercise a lot of clout, and for understandable reasons &mdash; but not necessarily reasons I would agree with, those countries would want to exempt their naval vessels from the terms of the MARPOL Convention. As I understand it, that is what Article 3 (3) of the MARPOL Convention is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 3 (3), which the Minister read into the record, also goes beyond the <Col N="1433" /> exemption.  It goes on to state that those ships are required to act in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practicable, with the present convention. Here the Minister proposes a simple exemption, without any qualification, for warships and naval vessels.  Nothing in the MARPOL agreement obliges this State to incorporate that exemption in the Bill.  I should like the Minister to deal with that issue.  Ireland could still be a party to MARPOL without the exemption for warships that the Minister proposes to include in the Bill.  That is the bottom line; Ireland would not be prevented from being a party to the MARPOL agreement if section 4 were deleted.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that it was Government policy that visiting naval vessels should not carry nuclear weapons. This State has no way of enforcing that. There is a gentlemen's agreement under which the Government of this country make it known to Governments of other countries that naval vessels visiting our ports should not carry nuclear weapons, but there is absolutely no way of enforcing that.  Ireland has no way of knowing whether or not naval vessels of other States visiting our ports carry nuclear weapons, for the very simple reason that other States have pointedly refused to state whether or not they do carry nuclear weapons.  It has been confirmed repeatedly in the House that Governments and naval authorities of other States will not confirm whether a vessel is carrying nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>There is a major loophole in the Bill, which is essentially about protecting our seas and waters.  Some States might wish to carry toxic materials, for example, through our waters.  We may well become directly involved in that matter, because as is well known now, the Government have plans to locate a toxic waste incinerator in Derry and, as is also known, there is not sufficient production of toxic waste on this island to make a toxic waste incinerator viable.  It is therefore highly likely that toxic waste will have to be imported into Derry, if that is to be the location for the toxic waste incinerator. <Col N="1434" /> Fair enough, that issue could be controlled under the Bill, but what does the Government do if a country decides to carry its toxic waste, or any other hazardous material, on what it terms a &ldquo;naval vessel&rdquo;?  Some states very quickly change the status of a vessel from being a normal commercial vessel to being a naval vessel, and they may well do so to circumvent some of the provisions in the MARPOL agreement.  The issue of Sellafield is one of the old chestnuts in the House, and we all have a bash at it periodically.  It is now known that the THORP reprocessing plant is due to come into operation in 1992.  That reprocessing plant will bring nuclear waste from as far away as Japan, travelling in vessels through the Irish Sea. The caverns for the burial of reprocessed nuclear waste are to be constructed under the sea at Sellafield, which, again, will encourage the transport of nuclear waste through the Irish Sea to Sellafield.  A country could carry that waste on a naval vessel or it might carry it on a vessel that belongs to a class that has been exempted by the Minister under section 4 (2).</P>
    <P>Section 4 undermines what this country and the Minister are attempting to do, which is to protect our seas, to become a party to the MARPOL agreement and to make sure that no pollution arises from ships.  The inclusion of section 4 is not necessary for Ireland to become a party to the MARPOL agreement.  Article 3 (3) of the MARPOL agreement was intended primarily for countries that have major navies and warships, not for countries like Ireland, which does not have a major navy, which has no warship, and which is, so far anyway, a neutral State.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go over old ground, but I do think that the issue can be teased out in a little more detail, following the Minister's response.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the removal of this section would not deny Ireland the right to be a party to the MARPOL Convention. Surely, on behalf of our own nation, we should aspire to the highest level.  I took the Minister to mean that Ireland had to go along with 58 other countries and be part of the gang.  He <Col N="1435" /> said that perhaps on another occasion and in other legislation different regulations could be made, but if the parameters of the Convention are so rigid as to prevent Ireland from making an independent decision and not allow warships within our waters, then surely those different regulations might be found to be in contravention of the agreement?  if indeed there is a way of making regulations under any other guise, then surely the Sea Pollution Bill is the legislation into which such a prohibition should be introduced?</P>
      <P>We can be grateful to the people and the &ldquo;people power&rdquo; of the 1960s and the 1970s, when the idea of a nuclear plant in this country was toyed with and they decided that Ireland did not want any part of nuclear plants.  I am thankful that the people made that decision and that they were listened to.  Sweden, which has served and does serve us as a model in other ways, is now trying to dismantle a nuclear plant.  It recognises, after incidents such as the Chernobyl disaster, the incredibly dangerous long term implications of any leakage of nuclear effluent, or radiation.  Such knowledge was gained very painfully.</P>
      <P>A great number of the 58 countries became party to the Convention before the real dangers of radiation and nuclear effluent, with all their desparate consequences, become fully known, and I suggest that some of those countries might not have as clearly been part of the Convention had they had the knowledge that we now possess.  We have the privilege of having learned by coming in late.  We should act on the knowledge gained and on the opinion of our people about the dangers of nuclear radiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to speak on the claims made by Deputy Gilmore.  Is section 4 included in the Bill to allow Ireland to become a member of the MARPOL Convention or does that inclusion merely mean we are in agreement with the 58 other countries?  Would the removal of this dangerous section mean that Ireland could not be party to the Convention, that somehow we would <Col N="1436" /> be put outside its boundaries?  If not, there is absolutely no good reason to include the section, and many good and serious reasons have been given for not accepting it.</P>

      <P>Because the guillotine is being imposed at 7 p.m. we will be unable to discuss this important aspect of the Bill.  The Minister said that we must not lose sight of the objective of the Bill. We have not lost sight of it.  We have been very helpful about this.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that we have regulations governing nuclear arms ships coming into our ports &mdash; we all subscribe to them &mdash; however, we do not have any control over navies who pollute our waters.  There seems to be a contradiction here, perhaps I am missing the point.  We should have the same control in relation to pollution as we have over nuclear vessels coming into our ports.</P>
      <P>The Minister may have missed a golden opportunity to take a courageous stand on this issue.  While it may be appropriate to use parts of other legislation to our best advantage, we should look independently at things and consider what we as an island nation can do to protect our environment. We could have done that by deleting that section of the Bill.  Section 4 (1) of the Bill says:</P>
      <P>This Act shall not apply to any warship or to any ship for the time being used by the government of any country for purposes other than commercial purposes.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to Article 3 of the MARPOL Convention where it says that the Convention shall not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.  The Minister should at least take that section of the MARPOL Convention on board.  The Convention went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, each Party shall ensure by the adoption of appropriate measures not imparing the operations or operational capabilities of such ships owned or operated by it, that such ships act <Col N="1437" /> in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practical, with the present convention.</P>
    <P>That is not included in the Bill.  I would like the Minister to look at that aspect and see if he could include it in section 4 (1).</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this Act shall not apply to any warship.  That is not what the MARPOL agreement says.  It says a lot more.  The Minister has indicated that he is not prepared to change the section.  I am aggrieved that we will not be able to discuss this on Report Stage.  It is grossly unfair to use the guillotine on this important Bill when we could be here for another hour arguing this point.  It is vital to tease out the Bill to the very last.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have taken a courageous stand if he had included the sections in the MARPOL Convention to which I referred.  This would go some way towards controlling naval vessels coming into our ports.  The Minister knows as well as I that unless things are in writing we could be caught out another time.</P>
    <P>This is our first serious Bill on pollution and the marine environment.  This should be the best Bill we can bring forward.  We are not doing justice to the people who framed the Bill and to the people who contributed by imposing a guillotine and we are not doing justice to the country in relation to pollution.  We are opposing the section but I would ask the Minister to at the very least take on the suggestions I have made and give us something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disturbed by the Minister's reasons for <Col N="1439" /> being unable to accept the recommendation from this side of the House. The Minister said that many of the 58 members who signed the MARPOL Convention had to do so.  That sort of comment is extremely serious.  One wonders about the other 58 members who actually signed the MARPOL Convention. Why would they not want their country, their warships and their navies to be included in a Sea Pollution Bill? What was their hidden agenda if they would not be happy to include that section? That raises fundamentally serious questions.  What sovereign government would impose obligations on ordinary persons but exempt themselves?  There is something very strange there and I hope the Minister will elaborate on it.  That is a greater reason that we should be prepared to go the full distance and remove this section.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to three countries which had no difficulty with signing the Convention &mdash; Switzerland, Sweden and Finland.  I presume the reason the Minister referred to them is because they are neutral.  Switzerland is a land bound country so the effect of the MARPOL Convention on it is minimal.  They do not have waters or a marine environment to protect and, therefore, they would not consider this a matter of major concern.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Barnes has already pointed out, Sweden and Finland operate nuclear plants but are anxious to close many of them.  They do not have the same concern in relation to nuclear effluent or pollution as our people.  The Government should reflect the attitude and views of the people who greatly fear nuclear effluent and the damage it can cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the right of innocent passage of various warships in our territorial waters.  They do have a right of innocent passage but, as Deputy Gilmore said, commercial ships are changed overnight by governments to become part of their naval fleets to accommodate specific types of activity. We should be very seriously concerned about this given our location where major traffic in the north Atlantic travels across <Col N="1440" /> our territorial waters.  Members in this House should not be afraid to legislate, as strongly as possible, to protect our marine environment.  We have a major interest in this because we are an island nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reasons for not agreeing to the withdrawal of this section are not convincing, if anything they create more fears and concern on this side of the House.  I ask him to reconsider this and not to blindly follow the other member states who signed the MARPOL Convention. As the Minister said, some of them have refused to recognise that the Convention applies to their own warships and if the Convention insists on including them, these countries will not sign it. Why did they not agree to accept the Convention?  Why are they fearful of having something imposed on them when they are quite willing to impose it on the private sector?  The Minister should explain this to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot have an <i>à la carte</i> MARPOL Convention, pick out one bit which you like and leave out another bit you dislike.  When you accede to the Convention it means acceding to the whole Convention.  I read Article 3 (3) earlier to the House.  The latter part states that each party shall ensure, by the adoption of appropriate measures not impairing the operations or operational capabilities of such ships owned or operated by it, that such ships act in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practicable, with the present Convention. As I said, when you accede to the MARPOL Convention you accede to the second part of the paragraph, which was mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes mentioned other approaches with regard to the specific point made about warships. I said that this would have to be dealt with in a different way as it has nothing to do with the MARPOL Convention.  If we want to pursue legislation in this regard, I pointed out it would have to be legislated for under a different framework by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I urge the House to pass this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 4, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very simple amendment and all the related amendments are the same: they are basically to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in a number of sections in an effort to strengthen the Bill.  As we have mentioned earlier, the intention is to provide the maximum possible protection of the sea and our coastlines from pollution.  These sections deal with the making of regulations by the Minister. The formulation of words used at present enable the Minister to make regulations but would not require him to, for example, make regulations dealing with the discharge of oil and other substances. It is heavily dependent on the will of the Minister to make those regulations.  I have no doubt that the present Minister would make the regulation but it may well be that a future incumbent would be less committed to protecting the sea from pollution than the present Minister and therefore the regulations would not be made.  That is the import of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I join in proposing that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; be substituted by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is important that the definite aspect of the Bill be stressed and this change of wording gives us an opportunity to do so.  This is a technical matter but it has implications because it brings into focus our determination to ensure that regulations &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be made.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Gilmore that the present Minister will bring in legislation but there is a certain amount of vagueness that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would eliminate and I hope the Minister will agree that it should replace &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I wish to reiterate the same point the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is much more definite. I should not anticipate what the Minister will say but even if the Minister and the draftspersons believe that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is adequate on this occasion, I think the people who read the legislation would see that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; carries a much more serious intent.  It would also be a witness of how seriously this House, and indeed the people take the problem of pollution and the adherence to the regulations in this Bill.  A lack of definition might give some people the idea that the intent of the Bill was not actually defined as we know the Minister intends it to be.  I join my colleagues in saying that we acknowledge the serious intent of the Minister in this <Col N="1445" /> area but we believe our amendment adds weight to the intent, which is necessary.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendments in the names of Deputies Gilmore, G. O'Sullivan and Taylor-Quinn. It is quite apparent that we must give this Bill teeth and we must give this Minister quite clear directions and take away discretion from the Minister in these matters.  These are important matters and the Bill should quite clearly set out that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do these things, and for that reason I am supporting these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I think the House should realise that a discretionary role for the Minister is essential in this case. It is important to point out that the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;, the future indicative instead of the subjunctive case does not impose any time limit and there is no point in thinking of the amendments as bringing about a time limit.  The regulations will contain what is necessary in the Irish context for the full compliance with and enforcement of the MARPOL Convention.  I make the further point that the regulations when made initially are laid on the table of the Houses of the Oireachtas and any amendment in the future to those regulations must also follow the same procedure, so there is a full democratic view of the regulations and the provision made for dealing with them.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister shall by regulation require all ships travelling through Irish waters carrying oil, oily mixture, noxious substance, harmful substance, sewage or garbage, to notify the relevant authority of its passage and destination.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment complements that of the Minister.  Subsection (5) of this section states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by regulations require the notification at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed, by the master or owner of a ship carrying an prescribed substance and of any intent to load or unload any such substance in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This needs to be expended in the manner provided for in my amendment.  It is very important that we should state our claim that any movement of traffic through our waters should be supervised by our port authorities.  In the past few years there have been several incidents, particularly off the south and southwest coasts, involving large ships which were in trouble.  Alarm was expressed from many quarters as to the possibility of marine pollution.  This area is one of the busiest shipping lanes in Europe.  It was with this in mind that I put down the amendment. Many cargoes pass through our waters <Col N="1447" /> which we know nothing about.  Only when a ship is in trouble do we find out what it is carrying.  We are supposed to have regulations about the freight carried on overflights; the same should apply to ships using our waters.  There should be an obligation to tell us what they are carrying in their holds.  The Minister should have no reservations about this. His amendment indicates that he is thinking along those lines.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy O'Sullivan's purpose in suggesting this amendment. Section 23 (5) covers substantively the details of the amendment.  There is merit in Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion to expand the provisions.  That would mean seeking information at all ports of call from the port of a ship's departure to its destination.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 25 states:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (5) (a), line 43, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and of its passage and destination while in the State and such other information relating to the ship and its cargo as may be prescribed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That meets Deputy O'Sullivan's request for information on the ship's passage and destination in relation to section 10 and it empowers the Minister to seek any further information in relation to a ship or its cargo if he thinks it would be of benefit to himself, his Department and the State.  I appreciate Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment and I suggest that the extra demands for some further information incorporated in my amendment should stand.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 33 to 40, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>Section 10 enables the Minister to make regulations prohibiting the discharge of oil and other substances from ships into the sea.  Section 11 deals with certain circumstances in which regulations under section 10 would not apply.  Some of those circumstances are perfectly understandable. Paragraph (a) deals with the exceptions where the safety of the ship or of lives at sea would be at stake.  Paragraph (c) deals with the discharge of substances into the sea for the purpose of minimising damage from pollution.  I can understand those exemptions.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) is very unfortunate because it will make it impossible to enforce the regulations.  It states that the regulations will not apply in circumstances where the oil, noxious substances and so on have been discharged, provided that all reasonable steps have been taken after the occurrence of the damage or, as the case may be, the discovery of the discharge, to prevent or minimise the discharge and the owner or the master did not act with intent to cause damage or recklessly.  We must consider the question of enforcement.  Let us say that a ship is discovered somewhere off the west coast which is discharging some substance into the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made regulations dealing with that matter.  When he attempts to enforce those regulations, to recover the cost of anti-pollution measures or the clean up operation, the master of that ship can say that as soon as he discovered the oil was going into the sea he took all reasonable steps to limit the damage.  He can say that he did not discharge the oil into the sea with intent to cause damage and that he did not act <Col N="1449" /> recklessly.  Who is to deny that?  The crew of the ship?  Hardly.  In such a case the condition of the ship, the training of the crew, whether they understood the safety measures and knew the regulations they were supposed to comply with, does not come into it at all.</P>
    <P>I find this a strange paragraph in the Bill.  It will have the effect of undermining the regulations the Minister proposes to make.  If we were to have a normal Report Stage I would be asking the Minister to have a second look at this because it will undermine the whole intent of the Bill and make it virtually impossible to enforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Taylor-Quinn was attempting in her Bill is similar to what Deputy Gilmore wants.  It should be defined much more clearly than it is at the moment.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn wanted to ensure that in no way would the responsibility be left with the ship or crew that had committed a polluting offence.  The more we study the wording in paragraph (b) the more we see how open to manipulation it is.  As Deputy Gilmore pointed out, and as we know to our cost, very often the pollution and the harm take place at a time and in a place where there is no objective witness and one would have to question the accuracy of evidence given by the crew that they took all measures to minimise the discharge upon discovering it.  There could be a whole set of circumstances, including carelessness, lack of understanding of the regulations, failure to ensure that the cargo itself was safeguarded in the very best environmental conditions etc.  How do we know that the cargo is so safeguarded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been very lucky.  All of us here have paid tribute to the Minister and the experts in the Department on delivering us from the effects of some disastrous accidents which could have resulted in heavy and widespread pollution. Because such accidents can happen it is all the more necessary to leave no room for ships and crews to make excuses or claims about something that we ourselves cannot investigate and <Col N="1450" /> we may not be able to find out if the regulations had been adhered to before such accidents occurred.  Cases could be made, particularly by cargo lines that have a lot of money to fight such cases. In that dreadful <i>Exxon Valdez</i> disaster which is even now polluting some of the cleanest seas in the hemisphere, in order to get across to the <i>Exxon Valdez</i>, its crew and its owners the seriousness of what that cargo did in polluting the waters, a fine of $200 million was levied. One of the reasons was that it was possible to prove carelessness and recklessness in that case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment is much clearer than Deputy Taylor-Quinn's in that it asks for the deletion of the whole subsection.  What we are attempting is not to give any grounds for that type of difficulty to prove a case where there is no witness other than the offending ship and its crew.  I know my party would support the deletion of the whole subsection so that there would be no loopholes that ships causing that kind of damage would use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  From what Deputy Barnes has said, it appears she is inclined to prefer Deputy Gilmore's amendment to that of her colleague, Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  I think she is correct in that.  This subsection should be removed entirely from the Bill.  I know accidents happen and if a ship is damaged there will tend to be a discharge of the cargo of bunker oil or whatever it is carrying. Nevertheless the courts are reasonable and I do not think the defence would require such a clause to be in the Bill.  I think any court would accept the evidence of a master of a ship.  It would be up to the master of a ship to convince the court that he took all reasonable steps.  I nevertheless think that in a case like that the master should be prosecuted in the normal way under this Bill and that he should be required to give a reasonable explanation.  If he gave that explanation I have no doubt the courts would be quite happy to find him not guilty.  It is far better to delete this and leave the finding <Col N="1451" /> at the discretion of the courts.  This subsection has all the appearance of the good defence clause in the Water Pollution Bill.  This is exactly the same kind of thing.  It could be a loophole for evading responsibility by irresponsible ship owners.</P>
      <P>While I am on my feet I would like to make a point of order regarding the manner in which this legislation is going through the House.  I think we would all agree that while this Bill is urgent it is not a matter of day-to-day urgency.  It has been before the House for the past year but the Whips have decided to take the remainder of Committee Stage and Report Stage today.  There was no representative of the Green Party at the Whips' meeting so I have no idea what the House has in mind.  Perhaps the Minister or someone from the major parties here can tell us whether we are going to have Report Stage of this Bill, or are we going to continue with Committee Stage and have a guillotine at 7 p.m. and have no Report Stage?  Last week and the week before that we had the same thing.  We had Report Stage following immediately on Committee Stage.  At this stage really the major parties in this House are saying we do not want Report Stage of Bills. That is the message I am getting.  I would have thought the whole purpose of Report Stage is to have it a week or perhaps two weeks after Committee Stage to enable the Minister consider the amendments put forward by the Opposition and possibly accept them on Report Stage or bring in his own amendments.  I would appreciate comments from other Deputies present on this.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes to delete paragraph (b).  I support the amendment.  I believe firmly this is a rather dangerous provision to leave in the Bill and it is necessary that it be deleted completely.  In fairness to the Minister, in framing the Bill and that paragraph, probably he took into consideration the facts that would surround an incident of the nature envisaged in the paragraph and made allowance for people to act in a reasonable manner.  I have no qualms at that approach but, unfortunately for us in this country and other countries on the European scene, we do not deal with reasonable people. Shipping is a cut-throat business.  According to some of the stories we have heard the sky is the limit in regard to what shipping lines and ship owners will do. They do not pay their crews a decent wage in some instances.  They operate under a flag of convenience and they simply do not care about law and order on the seas or in territorial waters.  Once given a loophole in this instance they would dirve a coach and four through it. They would see in this type of legislation a weakness which they would exploit to the full.  I have to agree with Deputy Gilmore.  The deletion of the paragraph would be the best road to travel in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I take on board what the Minister has said.  Any reasonable person would allow for securing the safety of a ship or of any crew member but in present day commercial shipping business there are ruthless people who will do what they wish out of sight of land and out of jurisdiction of naval and harbour authorities. Whereas the legislation as framed is good in itself, if we are serious about trying to stamp out pollution, either accidental or deliberate, we have no alternative but to delete that paragraph and let the courts decide.  I am sure the Minister and his inspectors will have a very reasonable approach to matters as outlined in the <Col N="1453" /> paragraph which could arise in regard to a ship in our territorial waters.  Taken on balance that paragraph could, should and must be deleted completely for fear of abuse of the system of ruthless people in the shipping business at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the section in context.  The provisions of the paragraph proposed to be deleted are based on provisions which I will read in a moment of Regulation 11 entitled &ldquo;Exceptions in International Conference on Marine Pollution 1973&rdquo;.  The provisions are based on similar provisions in the regulations comprising Annex I which deals with oil; Annex II noxious liquid substances; Annex IV sewage; and Annex V garbage. Deletion of the paragraph could mean, say, an Irish registered vessel operating in any place in territorial waters or outside them or any vessel in our own territorial waters could be found in trouble even though they were the innocent party. That is what the MARPOL people were thinking of when they were putting the Convention together; they would be classified as offender, even though in a particular incident they were the innocent party.  It struck me as the discussion was taking place here that very recently in Waterford mines laid during the 1939-45 war were caught in nets there.  I am very pleased to say nothing happened, but if a boat had been damaged and was pouring oil into the sea at that point, without this section 11 which parallels the regulation, that person would be in a position of being guilty.  That is not the type of incident MARPOL are trying to get at.  MARPOL are trying to get at the polluters.  In the normal way all discharges would be investigated by an inspector with a view to prosecution, of course, and subsequent decisions would be taken on the basis of the findings and the advice of that inspector.  We are doing no violence to the MARPOL Convention in putting in section 11.</P>
      <P>I will read for the House Regulation 11 which refers to exceptions:</P>
      <P>Regulations 9 and 10 of this Annex shall not apply to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> (a)  the discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of a ship or saving life at sea; or</P>
    <P>(b)  the discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture resulting from damage to a ship or its equipment:</P>
    <P>(i)  provided that all reasonable precautions are being taken after the occurrence of the damage or discovery of the discharge for the purpose of preventing or minimizing the discharge; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  except if the owner or the Master acted either with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; or</P>
    <P>(c)  the discharge into the sea of substances containing oil, approved by the administration when being used for the purpose of combating specific pollution incidents in order to minimise the damage from pollution.  Any such discharge shall be subject to the approval of any Government in whose jurisdiction it is contemplated the discharge will occur.</P>
    <P>I have read that to place in the context of the MARPOL Convention section 11 of the Bill.  For that reason I would like to adhere to the terms of section 11.</P>

    <P>In page 10, subsection (3), line 35, <Col N="1455" /> after &ldquo;provided&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having regard to such person's ability to pay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment I have one intention in mind, that is the ability of a person to pay.  This is related to the owners of fishing vessels and so on who may find it difficult to pay for certain facilities in the port from which they operate depending on certain conditions. It is no secret that some fishermen find themselves in dire circumstances due to various factors whether it is fishing quotas or weather conditions and that they would experience extreme hardship if certain charges were laid down.  This is an appeal to the Minister to look sympathetically at cases of this nature. Owners of fishing vessels and, perhaps, other users of the port may have to tie up their boats for long periods at the harbour and draw the dole, yet under the regulations laid down would have to pay certain fees demanded by the harbour authority for services rendered.  The Minister would probably be sympathetic to people caught in such circumstances. We have had appeals previously from the fishing groups whose boats and ships have been damaged.  It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to include this amendment in the Bill.  The vast majority of shipping groups using the facilities would have the ability to pay and I have no doubt they would pay willingly.  This is one aspect of the problems which caught my attention.  I am aware from various questions I have put down to the Minister in the past couple of months that some people find it extremely difficult to make ends meet taking into account weather conditions and various regulations governing their trade and their duty.  I would ask the Minister to consider including that addition to the Bill.  If the Minister gives me some assurance that harbour authorities would take into consideration that aspect and that they would be flexible, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I understand the thrust of the Deputy's suggestion but I would like <Col N="1456" /> to make a few comments on it.  I think it would be impractical and almost impossible to implement it.  It is not the ship's master or the crew but the owners of these ships that would be responsible.  It is very significant that only about 20 per cent of our total imports and exports combined are carried in Irish ships so that we have coming into our ports and harbours a huge volume of foreign shipping. Over the last couple of years we have been trying to reduce that number as much as possible.  We have had a substantial increase in tonnage.  It is as well for the House to take cognisance of the fact that only 20 per cent of our imports and exports are carried in Irish ships. These charges are just and equitable. There is a problem in this regard: to charge them directly for the services might tend to encourage them to empty out their waste on the high seas or, at least, outside the territorial waters.  Our thinking at present is that the charge should be included in the ordinary port charges so that every ship that comes in will be responsible for the payment incorporated in the port charges.  Therefore, their will be no encouragement to a ship to save money by not discharging the waste in the port because it is already paying for the service which is being provided for all ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point which is a relevant one.  I accept totally what he has said about inclusive port charges.  However, the Minister side-stepped the point I raised about our own fishing vessels which would still be liable to a charge of this nature.  I understand the thrust of the Minister's argument.  I accept what he has said about foreign ships coming in and having a port charge which would be an all-inclusive cost and which would discourage them from discharging outside of land.  I would again ask the Minister to look seriously at the small operator.  In fairness, the man who uses the yacht, the punt or whatever the case may be, is liable also for charges and rightly so because if he uses the sea he should contribute to the protection of the <Col N="1457" /> environment.  I would like to emphasise that I am talking about the owner-operator of the small fishing vessel who would be liable for these charges and who would have to pay them in any event.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister if the relevant authority would take into consideration the circumstances of the person who may have two or three people employed as crew members and who may find it very difficult to make ends meet.  I am asking that he be flexible regarding this charge and say that the harbour authority should take into consideration the person's ability to pay such a charge.  If the Minister can give me an assurance that will be done I would be happy with it.  He has not said that; he has side-stepped it nice and easily.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the remaining 80 per cent, which is what the amendment is about.  These are mainly foreign-owned vessels, many of which fly flags of convenience and are manned by undertrained and underpaid crews from third countries.  Many examples show that very often these crews do not even understand the safety instructions on board some of those vessels.  The <i>Scandinavian Star</i> was a prime example of a ship manned by a crew from a third country who were undertrained and where the safety regulations were not being complied with.  There is gross exploitation at sea where owners and operators crew their ships with very underpaid personnel.</P>

    <P>Section 14 deals with the equipment of ships and correctly seeks to ensure that ships are properly fitted and operated and comply with the various requirements. However, a very critical element is left out of this &mdash; the crew.  No matter how well a ship is fitted out or how good its <Col N="1460" /> equipment is, if you end up with a badly trained, underpaid and very often overworked crew, you run the risk of accidents, pollution and the regulations which are to be made under this Bill not being complied with.</P>
    <P>I submit that many of the vessels now operating in European waters and some of the vessels trading with this country are manned by undertrained, underpaid and overworked crews from third countries and that some ships operate under flags of convenience.  It is a very serious omission from the Bill that no account is being taken of the crews.  I do not wish to trouble you again, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with the issue I raised at the very beginning but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment which seeks to ensure that ships are crewed by properly trained personnel.  I am sure the Minister would agree that many ships which fly flags of convenience and which are not crewed by properly trained personnel, contributed greatly to the difficulties experienced by our excellent shipping line which was operated by dedicated and committed crews, of whom we can be very proud. Hopefully, these people will eventually be rewarded and looked after properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, tell me that I am not speaking to the amendment, I want to say that the points raised by Deputy Gilmore, and Deputy O'Sullivan also referred to this issue, in regard to cut throat competition are very relevant.  Many of the ships carrying cargo are manned by crews who <Col N="1461" /> are not properly trained.  This is not the fault of the crew; these people usually come from countries where they have very little say in the kind of training or jobs they get.  There have been some horrifying accidents at sea where even the crews were put at danger because of a lack of communication &mdash; they may not understand the language spoken on the ship or the safety regulations.</P>
    <P>We would be striking a blow in favour of high standards by including the words proposed in Deputy Gilmore's amendment in the Bill.  We would also be acknowledging the difficult, claustrophobic and at times dangerous work undertaken by crews on ships.  It is appalling to think that the owners of ships can employ people who are not properly trained.  The Minister should accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment as he understands what he is trying to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore should be complimented on bringing this amendment before us.  Whereas the section covers the equipment, construction and fitting out of a ship, it completely ignores its crewing.  As has been outlined already, there are people involved in the shipping business who are completely and utterly ruthless and cut corners to make a profit.  Some people refuse to acknowledge the legislation already in place regarding pollution, controls, disposal of rubbish and so on.  I have no doubt that the masters of some ships, if they believed it would save half an hour or an hour on a turn-about, would have no hesitation in dumping their garbage overboard.  This is a cut-throat business, and unfortunately we have no control over it.  The Minister may say that 58 nations have signed the MARPOL agreement but I wonder how many of those nations have laid down conditions for the crews of their ships.  I would say quite a number of them have very suspect crews on board their ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section covers ships registered in the State.  I agree that there should be provision whereby the crew must be fully trained to operate a ship and all its equipment such as anti-pollution devices, <Col N="1462" /> emergency devices and so on.  Very often in the case of airline or shipping accidents we are told that they result from human error.  Such accidents can be very costly to the company involved but also as regards pollution of the environment.  The amendment states clearly that the personnel of ships registered in the State should be fully trained.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken into consideration the various mechanisms on our ships, some of which are at present antiquated. We should set out regulations with which ship owners would have to comply.  Deputy Gilmore is proposing in his amendment that the crew be fully trained.  Obviously the master has to have qualifications to steer a ship, but the crew should also be qualified.  I would ask the Minister to consider the amendment in the light in which it has been put down. It is not intended as a trap but as a complementary measure to the section.  It proposes that the crew members be fully trained to operate the ship's equipment.</P>

      <P>In the interests of speed I will not make a lengthy contribution on this amendment.  I just want to say that I support it.

I am not casting stones at any particular Deputy, but we should try to expedite matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in total agreement with the contributions which concentrated on the importance of trained personnel on ships.  Various accidents have been referred to, but I can go back a little further.  I was in Belfast on the night the ship went down between Stranraer and Larne.  Belfast is a city in which people know a good deal about ships.  I remember going into a place of refreshment in Chichester Street where a worker from the shipyards commented that it is extraordinary the risks they take with your life and mine.  That is what the contributions here have been all about.  It was found on that occasion that the captain of the ship did not want to take out the ship but was forced to do so by the owners. <Col N="1463" /> He could have refused but did not, and a lot of lives were lost, including some of the ministers in the government at the time.</P>
      <P>While I agree fully with the sentiments expressed here, it is not appropriate under a Sea Pollution Bill to make regulations on the level of training for crews. I will make a distinction between international and Irish conditions.  Internationally the crewing of ships is governed by two separate international conventions, the Merchant Shipping Minimum Standards Convention, 1976, the ILO Convention No. 147, and the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978.  On the Irish level, Irish registered ships are required to comply with regulations on the training of ships' officers and ratings by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, and the Merchant Shipping (Certification of Seamen) Act, 1979.  Irish shipowners are recommended to carry on board safe manning certificates issued by the Marine Survey Office of the Department of the Marine. In deciding the manning level the Marine Survey Office take into account all the relevant circumstances of the ship and the voyages in which it engages, and applies the principles contained in the International Maritime Organisation's convention, the one I mentioned already, on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, and also the IMO's resolution A 48 (XII.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also carry out port State control inspections of foreign merchant ships visiting our ports to ensure that they comply with the standards laid down in the various conventions such as MARPOL which we are dealing with here.  Others include the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, the ILO 147 which I already mentioned, and the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, which I also mentioned.  There are other international conventions.  The port State control is a very important and effect method of examining visiting ships and finding out if there are defects in them.  Normally <Col N="1464" /> safe manning certificates are accepted as evidence that a ship is safely manned.  As I have said, I agree with the sentiments expressed in the contributions, but this is not the appropriate place to deal with that aspect of the shipping business.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate other than to say that we are agreed on the principles involved here. The reason this amendment is down as an amendment to the Sea Pollution Bill is that pollution from ships can be caused by negligence on the part of a crew.  There is a link between crewing and pollution, and it is important that that link is established in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 deals with the survey of a ship that belongs to a country that is party to the MARPOL Convention.  It makes no provision for a ship that is registered in a country not party to the MARPOL Convention.  Reference has already been made to the extent of abuse that is occurring whereby ships are being registered <Col N="1465" /> in third countries and flying flags of convenience, thereby circumventing the requirements of the MARPOL Convention. Even though the owner of a ship may be a citizen of a country that is party to the MARPOL Convention and to all intents and purposes the ship is a ship of that country, because it is registered in a third country it is able to flout the regulations of the MARPOL Convention. Some effort should be made to try to enforce MARPOL standards on countries that are not party to MARPOL and on ships registered in those countries. I recognise it is an international problem but some attempt should be made to try to foreclose on such abuse and the circumvention of the Convention.</P>

      <P>Again, I have to agree with my colleague.  Unfortunately, there are those in the shipping business who would without any shadow of doubt use the loophole available.  They have done so before and they will continue to do so for as long as they are able to.  They will register boats in third countries in order to flout any regulations laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious the Minister has no control over the problem and that it will have to be tackled both at international level and from the European point of view.  At issue are our waters which are part of the European Continent and, as such, it is necessary that the issue be raised in that forum in a very forceful manner.  Such abuse has gone on for too long, apparently with no control.  Those behind it are raking in huge profits and would use a loophole to increase their profits without giving any consideration to the environment. It is time the EC forcefully controlled the way that people can flout the law and abuse a resource that is held so dear by us all and that the House has spent many hours trying to protect. Unscrupulous people in the shipping business would do whatever they wished so long as it brought in a profit.  Perhaps I have a hang-up about ship owners, but I know people who have been used and abused by them.  I agree with my colleague, as I have said, and I support his amendment.  I know the Minister has very <Col N="1466" /> little control or power in this regard but it is a matter that should be considered.</P>

      <P>I take into consideration the comments Deputy O'Sullivan has just made.  I commend Deputy Gilmore for raising the issue again.

If so, is there any way Ireland can support those moves?</P>

      <P>The section is one for members of the club, so to speak &mdash; the club of 58; it is to be hoped 59 in the very near future &mdash; countries that accede to the MARPOL Convention.  It is based on the three MARPOL annexes that provide for the issue of certificates following survey of a ship &mdash; Annex I, oil pollution prevention certificate; Annex II, pollution prevention certificate for the carriage of noxious liquid substances in bulk. Annex IV, sewage pollution prevention certificate.  Those certificates are intended as a privilege to ships registered in states that are party to the MARPOL Convention.  Such ships could be at sea for a lengthy period and their certificates due for renewal.  Ships registered in a state which is not party to the Convention could not be given a certificate because such certificates issue from the MARPOL Convention.</P>
      <P>Section 18 should not be confused with section 17, which empowers the Minister to make regulations requiring ships registered in a state that is or is not a party to the Convention to be surveyed, inspected, or tested for compliance with MARPOL requirements.  Section 18, the amendment of which we are discussing, is an intra-club procedure, while section 17 covers countries that are outside the Convention.</P>

      <P>The amendment returns to one of the most fundamental issues debated in discussion on the Bill, which is to ensure that the regulations as drawn up be as definite as possible and the people who administer them be as skilled as possible. The amendment attempts to ensure that section 19 is more clearly defined.  The point of the amendment is that while the inspections would naturally be carried out under the direction of the Minister they should be carried out under regulations as drawn up by the Minister.  Not only would a survey of a ship be completed, it would be completed within all the regulations drawn up by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;directions&rdquo; may seem a little vague.  This is an attempt to strengthen the Bill, to strengthen what the surveyor or inspector of ships has to undertake with regard to such inspection and to ensure that such inspections are reinforced by regulations of the Minister.

      <P>I do not wish to reenter the debate we had with the Minister over the past couple of hours about the harbour master.  The Minister has not come quite far enough to meet my objections. Unless the harbour master can have dual control of his harbour and of the shipping coming into the harbour, I cannot accept the Minister's amendment. Under this, a person still directs a harbour master to take certain action. Everyone will agree that the harbour master will have the confidence of the people he represents and is fully qualified. The loophole to which we referred weeks ago is still there.  Someone could be directed to direct the harbour master to bring in a ship and that could be in breach of the harbour masters' powers. If the Minister could appoint the harbour master as an inspector we would accept the amendment.  If the harbour master disagreed with an inspector as to whether a ship could come in, the inspector could override him and he has the power to <Col N="1470" /> direct the harbour master to bring in the ship.  It is a pity the Minister did not produce an amendment to appoint a harbour master as an inspector.  I am voicing the concern of my party and the concern of a number of harbour authorities throughout the country who can see a weakness in this legislation, a weakness that the Minister has admittedly tried to plug.  I would ask the Minister to go a little further and accept that a harbour master can be appointed as an inspector. In that case I would accept the Minister's amendment.  In the unlikely event of there being a clash in relation to a ship I must stick to my point that the entire section should be deleted unless the Minister is prepared to accept our suggestion. Unfortunately we will not be able to debate this on Report Stage because it has to be dealt with before 7 o'clock.  I would be happy if the Minister would meet me more than half way and agree that a harbour master can be appointed an inspector.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (5), between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) preventing the entry of any nuclear-capable ship into the State;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lateness of the hour causes me to agree to take amendments Nos. 26 and 27 together because, while they are related, they deal with different aspects of the nuclear problem.  Amendment No. 26 deals with giving the Minister the right to make regulations which will prevent the entry to an Irish port of harbour of any nuclear capable ship.  The Minister said earlier that it is Government policy not to permit entry to our ports of any vessel carrying nuclear weapons.  As I understand it, it means that the Government have make it know that we do not wish to have ships with nuclear weapons on board visiting our ports.  However, there is no way of telling whether naval vessels visiting Irish ports are carrying nuclear weapons because the naval authorities and the governments of those countries <Col N="1472" /> will not declare whether they are carrying them.</P>
    <P>In October 1990 Greenpeace produced a very interesting report which showed that in the period between 1982-90 one dozen nuclear capable ships visiting Irish ports and that half of those were officially inspected and geared to carry nuclear weapons before leaving their home ports. If those vessels were cleared to carry nuclear weapons, presumably they were carrying them when they left their home ports.  What became of the nuclear weapons before they visited the Irish port?  It is reasonable to assume that the nuclear weapons were still on board.  The report produced by Greenpeace showed that if a vessel is nuclear capable, it is reasonable to assume that it is carrying nuclear weapons.  Because of the technology, costs and so on involved, the naval authorities concerned do not send out nuclear capable ships unless they are carrying nuclear weapons; that is the whole purpose of having nuclear capable ships in the first place.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to identify nuclear capable ships and to prevent them entering Irish ports.  When a naval vessel visits an Irish port it may well cause a great deal of interest and speculation as to whether it is carrying nuclear weapons.  Many naval vessels do not carry nuclear weapons but, according to the report to which I referred &mdash; and which, curiously, has not been contradicted by our Government or that of any other State &mdash; Greenpeace concluded it is safe to assume that a nuclear capable ship is carrying nuclear weapons.  Therefore, the Minister should be able to make regulations under this Bill which would prevent entry to an Irish port of a nuclear capable ship because of the assumption that it is carrying nuclear weapons and because of the evidence produced by Greenpeace in regard to the years 1982-90.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) preventing all ships carrying <Col N="1473" /> nuclear materials or capable of carrying such materials or whose power is derived from such energy.</P>
    <P>When I was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1986-87 I found it embarrassing at times to greet naval personnel from the United States, the USSR, Holland, West Germany and other countries.  Usually there was a demonstration on the dockside when a naval ship capable of carrying nuclear weapons came into port.  This country has a very good reputation for being hospitable and making visitors feel very welcome.  I tried to be as hospitable as I could but, at the same time, I tried to impress on those visitors that they were entering Cork city, a nuclear free zone. It was embarrassing at times trying to get that message across because the naval personnel did not accept it.  Their modern weaponry was part of their equipment and they did not have any hang-ups about coming into any port.  I tried to explain that this nation did not welcome such weaponry and nuclear armed ships in our waters.</P>
    <P>The Government were also very forceful in this regard but there is no way of monitoring the system and that is why I tabled my amendment.  A nuclear accident probably causes the worst pollution of all because the effects could last for centuries.  Oil pollution is bad enough but at least its effects wear off in time.  The effects of a nuclear accident could be felt for centuries.  Ships or aeroplanes carrying nuclear weapons seeking entry into our territory should be subject to the conditions specified.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider accepting the amendments which have been put down with the best interests of the country at heart. I think they are reasonable amendments and should not present the Government with any problems.  The country is considered to have nuclear free status but unless we have control over what ships enter our waters or ports, or airspace for that matter, we are wasting our time implementing this legislation.  We could mention the disposal of sewage and garbage but that is insignificant in comparison with the damage caused by <Col N="1474" /> nuclear waste.  As Deputy Gilmore said, we had better not discuss Sellafield because if we were to do so we would be here all night.  We should make it clear to all concerned that we will not allow entry to nuclear powered ships or ships carrying nuclear weapons.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important sections of the Bill.  We cannot let this occasion pass without asking the Minister, once again, to ensure that no ship, submarine or hovercraft carrying any nuclear explosive device or any nuclear waste is allowed enter our territorial waters.  Reference has already been made to the many years it takes for plastic to dissolve but with regard to nuclear waste scientists and researchers are speaking in terms of thousands of years before such waste is no longer radioactive.  Therefore, we are talking about the most dangerous substance known to man.  As I said previously, we welcome the moves towards nuclear disarmament and the fact that countries are moving away from nuclear energy. However, we do not have any information on the number of vessels carrying nuclear waste with the result that the waters are constantly at risk.</P>
      <P>I wish to commend the Taoiseach for declaring our seas and waters a safe haven for whales, seals and dolphins.</P>

      <P>We are debating four amendments here.  Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 in the name of Deputy Gilmore <Col N="1475" /> are probably the best or, alternatively, amendment No. 28a in the name of Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  What we are trying to do here is make sure that ships with nuclear capability or carrying nuclear waste are covered.  With respect to Deputy O'Sullivan, I do not think the amendments in his name would do this. Earlier in the debate we dealt at length with the problem of ships with nuclear capability entering our ports.  As Deputy Gilmore said, Greenpeace have presented ample evidence, which has not been refuted, that ships with nuclear capability, and indeed ships carrying nuclear weapons, have entered our ports in the past.  We do not want any vessel carrying nuclear weapons to enter our ports under any circumstances but unfortunately, this is likely to happen unless one of the amendments is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to indicate to the House that I regard this as a very important matter and to reiterate the Government's policy on it.  Our policy, as the House well knows, is to refuse entry to any visiting naval vessel carrying nuclear weapons and, second, to refuse entry if it forms parts of a naval exercise.  I realise that the report quoted by Deputy Gilmore was a very important one with regard to American ships and I have great sympathy with the distinguished former Lord Mayor of Cork who had to take out his geiger counter in City Hall.  Greenpeace said there was a probability that a nuclear certified vessel gained entry. That is as far as they went.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying is that there is a strong and firm two-pronged Government policy which I have outlined to the House, that that is sufficient and is as far as we can go in this regard.  MARPOL deals with pollution of the sea.  I agree with Deputy Barnes when she says that pollution caused by nuclear waste or by nuclear powered vessels is the most deadly of all.  We have in place a firm policy on this matter.  The Greenpeace document mentioned by Deputy Gilmore was put together with great care with the <Col N="1476" /> aid of the legislation which governs access to information in the United States. There was no categorical statement, <i>à tout court</i> statement, that nuclear weapons had been carried on board visiting vessels nor was there a full conclusion that vessels formed part of a naval exercise. A good deal of the argument is circumstantial but the Minister for Foreign Affairs is taking cognisance of the report supplied to him.  I am happy to tell the House that the Government adhere firmly to the two pronged policy which I have just mentioned.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, being strongly of the belief that the viability plan of An Post has social and economic implications which are unacceptable, would damage the social fabric of rural life, <Col N="1477" /> increase the isolation of individuals and disadvantaged groups in both urban and rural areas, would have unacceptable consequences for the range and standard of postal services in that it would in particular close down more than 500 post offices and downgrade 23 company offices in provincial towns, make 1,500 staff redundant and replace doorstep delivery with 200,000 roadside post boxes in urban and rural areas, demands that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications use his powers under section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, to instruct An Post to withdraw their viability plan and provide an alternative in compliance with the social and household requirements of the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, and with the approval of the House, I would like to share my time with Deputies Flanagan, Bradford, Hogan and Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny).</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>We in this country deserve the highest European standards in all aspects of life, whether we live in an urban or rural environment.  We are lucky in our quality of life which many of us take for granted and do not fully appreciate. &ldquo;Far away fields are green&rdquo; is an old adage and often it is only after a spell outside the country that we realize just how good life is at home.</P>
      <P>A job is important, vitally important, but so also are communications and services which contribute to the quality of life.  Availability of good education, a house, a car or a good public transport system, places of entertainment, the doctor and the hospital not too far away, low crime rate, multichannel TV, the phone, are all important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard and range of postal services is also, of course, an important element of the quality of life.  In many places the local post office is the focal <Col N="1478" /> point of the community, whether in urban or rural areas, and the services it provides are particularly important to the disadvantaged in society, the less well off, the social welfare recipient, the unemployed, the elderly, the lonely and women.</P>
    <P>Of course, An Post have problems. Nothing said in this debate should attempt to obscure the reality or minimise the enormity of these problems.  The viability plan spells it out.</P>
    <P>An Post faces a serious financial crisis requiring immediate action if the company is to become financially viable, withstand the competitive pressures threatening its survival, and finance an investment programme without which business development and growth will be impossible to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaking in this House on 7 February said:</P>
    <P>An Post are suffering unsustainable financial losses and there is need for urgent action to restore the company to profitability.  The crisis cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I agree.  An Post are haemorrhaging almost daily.  The problem must be tackled with urgency.</P>
    <P>There are, however, unacceptable prices which I for one am not prepared to pay.  I am not prepared to damage the social fabric of rural life.  I am not prepared to threaten the quality of our life by a diminution of the range and standard of our postal services.  I am not prepared to increase the isolation of individuals and disadvantaged groups in society by depriving them of a service which makes difficult conditions a bit more tolerable and reassuring.  I am not prepared to see doorstep delivery replaced by roadside postboxes in both urban and rural areas where the security and confidentiality of the mail is suspect, where the boxes will be liable to vandalism and where the human face of An Post, so important to the old, the sick, the handicapped and the lonely, symbolised by the postman at the door step, will disappear.  I am not prepared to tolerate that.  I am not prepared to accept <Col N="1479" /> that 1,500 more should be thrown on the unemployment scrap heap to join the 254,000 already there &mdash; the largest number every in the history of the State, a cancer in our society and a monstrous indictment of those who are responsible for it and who uncaringly accept it and who refuse even to acknowledge it as a crisis.</P>
    <P>There have to be, and there are, alternatives. For this reason &mdash; and, of course, the imminence of the local government elections &mdash; the Minister asked NESC to conduct a study: &ldquo;of the socio-economic implications for rural communities of An Post's proposals for the closure of 550 sub-post offices and the provision of 200,000 roadside letter boxes, including an examination of alternative possibilities for increased revenue at the sub-post offices, hardship alleviating measures and other options.&rdquo;  One may ask why they were asked to consider the implications of the provision of roadside post boxes for rural communities only.  Was it to disguise the fact that the implications for many urban dwellers are almost certainly equally unacceptable?</P>
    <P>The decision to refer two of the proposals to NESC is welcome, though those whose jobs are threatened and those whose promotions may be affected by the proposed downgrading in 48 company staffed offices, may wonder why they were not included.  And as the attendance at the protest meetings organised by concerned bodies clearly illustrates a very large proportion of the population of those provincial towns affected are also asking why the effect on their economy, morale, standing and infrastructure are not also matters for investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced initially that NESC has been asked to do the study themselves and he confirmed that in his Dáil reply to me on 28 February. However, when asked again by me on 20 March to state the terms of reference he had given to NESC, the Minister was economical with the truth.  He failed to disclose that NESC had refused to carry out the study.  The council said that the study was not the sort of thing the council <Col N="1480" /> did or were equipped to do.  Their role was to deal with principles and they were prepared to help on that level.</P>
    <P>Implicit in the decision of NESC to &ldquo;decline the invitation&rdquo; was their refusal to be used by the Minister to carry the can for unpopular decisions and to postpone such decisions until after the local government elections.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, did not disclose any of this to the Dáil at the time, concentrating instead on the principles and the willingness of NESC to co-operate. We know the truth only because a spokesman for NESC disclosed it to the media.  The principles which NESC propose as applicable to the study to be carried out by consultants are important. The principle of transparency requiring the separate identification of the commercial and social functions of An Post with the financial cost of pursuing the relevant social objectives explicitly identified in the accounts is crucial.  The council apparently have also recommended that current public expenditure should not increase in real terms in the period up to 1993.  Therefore if a case is made for subsidisation of social objectives the cost of such subsidies will have to be met within those current expenditure restraints.  The recommendation relates to co-ordinated planning of rural development and the giving of a high priority to the provision of appropriate communication facilities and social services geared to the needs of people living in remote areas.</P>
    <P>The principles outlined by NESC and the drawing up of an alternative plan in compliance with the social and household requirements of the 1983 Act are compatible. An Post can be efficient and solvent and fulfil its social obligations, but to do so: the network must be maintained and the strategic location of post offices improved; the offices must have a full range of new and improved services; and computerisation is essential.</P>
    <P>Discussions between An Post and the Department of Social Welfare on the development of An Post's counter services to offer a more flexible and extensive range of payment facilities to all <Col N="1481" /> social welfare clients should be encouraged. Advantage should be taken of the Department's willingness to invest jointly with An Post in the automation of its counter services.  Overtures from Telecom Éireann to involve themselves in this field should be repulsed.</P>
    <P>Last year the Department of Finance paid agency fees of £12.6 million to An Post.  Further business between the National Treasury Development Agency and An Post should be encouraged.  An Post should investigate obtaining business currently being transacted by building societies.  Computerisation would enable An Post to provide such services as motor taxation, driving licences, ESB payments, services for other semi-State and local authorities, etc.</P>
    <P>To gain maximum advantage of the new opportunities offered will require, of course, the closest co-operation of management and staff.  There should be no excuse for inefficiency and antiquated working methods and practices, for recent levels of unacceptable overtime payments nor for a situation where, according to the Consumer Association of Ireland, our postal service is one of the most expensive and slowest in Europe. According to those figures it is the third most expensive in 13 countries surveyed and also the third slowest.</P>
    <P>Since my original motion was tabled and the Minister's initial rejection of the proposal that he should use his powers under section 110 of the 1983 Act, he has responded to the pressure that the social and household requirements of that Act be taken into consideration.  He deserves credit for that.  Many times since he inherited the Communications portfolio from his precedessor, Deputy Burke, he must have wondered about this inheritance.</P>
    <P>After all, it was his predecessor who instructed An Post in the early part of 1990 to tackle all the problems of the single comprehensive package.  It was he who told An Post to ignore the social implications.  It was his predecessor who allowed the proposals for restructuring of An Post to lie in his Department from <Col N="1482" /> November 1990 until the present Minister took over in February last.  The same Minister, Deputy Burke, bequeathed to the present Minister proposals for the time-charging of telephone calls and a broadcasting Act now clearly coming apart at the seams.  With friends like that, who needs enemies?  I have some sympathy for the Minister &mdash; but only some. He was after all a member of the Government responsible for these decisions.  He sat in Cabinet when these decisions were being taken.</P>
    <P>It was this Minister who said in the House on 28 February, within days of his realisation of the enormity of the hot potato he has been bequeathed, &ldquo;I have indicated to NESC I wish to have the study completed, if possible, within six months&rdquo;&mdash; well on the other side of the local government elections.  I am not cynical by nature but I have learned a thing or two since my election to this House.  Good news has a habit of being facilitated but bad news delayed in the run-up to elections.</P>
    <P>I will listen to the Minister and Fianna Fáil backbenchers with more than usual interest in this debate.  There is an issue of credibility involved.  Many Fianna Fáil Deputies have opposed proposals in the viability plan in the most trenchant terms at local meetings, at council meetings and in the local press.  Now is the testing time for their sincerity.</P>
    <P>This motion provides the opportunity for the cynics as well as the idealists to ensure that proposals which are socially, economically and politically unacceptable will not be implemented.  I have pleasure in moving the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The viability plan proposed by An Post will be detrimental to the entire social fabric of rural Ireland. The high-handed and arrogant manner in which the proposals were put forward leaves a lot to be desired.  Over the past couple of years many sub-post offices in rural Ireland have already been closed at the stoke of a pen and the lack of notice to those running the offices, together with a refusal on the part of both An Post and <Col N="1483" /> the responsibile Minister to meet deputations from local communities, underlines a clear lack of commitment on the part of the Government towards the welfare of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>This plan represents a dangerous policy when placed in the overall context of State respect for rural areas.  The closure of rural post offices is even more horrific when set against the sad background of a general withdrawal of services in rural Ireland.  The management of An Post clearly do not recognise the importance of the post office.  The post office is often the only State office servicing the rural community as a form of information centre.  The action by An Post indicates that most post offices in villages in rural Ireland are on the agenda for the chop. We in Fine Gael are totally opposed to an emerging pattern of blanket closures throughout the country in a cavalier and high-handed manner.  It is important to remember that there is a difference between the closures of banks, building societies and their sub-offices in towns and villages throughout Ireland and the closure of a post office.</P>
      <P>The post office is a state institution in an area, and An Post should not be allowed to discontinue operating offices in rural areas simply because such an office may not be returning a handsome profit.  Social Welfare recipients, the old, the disadvantaged, those living alone are those who are going to lose in this callous shake-up.  The installation of a security-questionable green box at the end of a country lane is no substitute for the role and function carried out above and beyond the call of duty by the village postman for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural areas all over the country are being denuded of people.  There are no jobs to hold the youth at home and public services have decreased instead of improved over the past number of years. Villages and small towns have lost their Garda stations, schools, bus service, banks and railway stations; now they are to lose the post office and postal services <Col N="1484" /> overnight.  At the same time we are hearing, on an almost weekly basis, commitments on the part of Government and various Ministers to breathe new life into rural Ireland, but there is absolutely nothing to show in terms of progress on the ground.  Bandied about fancy phrases such as &ldquo;integrated rural development&rdquo; funded in the main from the European Community will be meaningless if the heart and soul is to be pulled out of rural Ireland in the name of &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;technological development&rdquo;.  The Minister and the Government must take particular note of the fact that social considerations far outweigh the economic argument.</P>
    <P>In the past, in the Dáil, when addressing the closure of individual post offices, the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Michael Woods, pointed to the introduction of computerised facilities which would develop more modern methods of payment of social welfare benefits such as direct transfer by electronic means into bank or post office accounts.  I ask the Government, what advantage will these ultra modern technological facilities be to the people of rural Ireland to whom the post office and the postal service represent an important institution.  The logic of Government policy to date indicates that there is no place in modern Ireland for the rural post office.  If this is the case the death knell has already tolled for life beyond Newlands Cross.  I urge all sides of the House to support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Forgive me for being repetitive but the feelings which I will express have to be quite similar to the feelings of all my colleagues and indeed all Members of Dáil Éireann.  That fact that tens of thousands of people have packed halls throughout our country to express their total opposition to the viability plan of An Post speaks for itself. Those hundreds of thousands of people who have signed a public petition calling on the plan to be withdrawn and calling on the Minister to ensure its withdrawal also speaks volumes.  I sincerely hope that the Minister, his colleagues in Government and, more important, his colleagues <Col N="1485" /> on the Fianna Fáil backbenches will take note of that.</P>
      <P>The first issue I must mention is the question of the 1,500 jobs.  Adding 1,500 more to the dole queues at a time of unprecedented unemployment is entirely unacceptable.  The Taoiseach and the Government continue to claim that there is no unemployment crisis.  I was amazed to hear the Taoiseach say again yesterday that a crisis did not exist.  Unfortunately, the hundreds of thousands of people whose only weekly income is a social welfare cheque know differently.  We in this House must ensure that 1,500 people will not be added to that dole queue.</P>
      <P>The Government's <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> mentions the need to develop and retain life in rural Ireland.  It also mentions the need to ensure that the State sector is increasingly used as a mechanism for job creation.  It is ironic that both of these aspirations fly totally in the face of An Post's viability plan.  With that in mind the Minister should not need any consultant's report or the report of any group such as NESC to know that the viability plan should be cast aside.  The people of Ireland are not waiting to hear what the Minister has to say in six months time.  They want to hear him reject this plan tonight.</P>
      <P>The other issue which concerns me has to be the closure of the 500 rural post offices and the decimation that would cause in rural Ireland.  The rural post office is the heart beat of the rural community. If we take away the rural post office we will destroy life in many rural communities.  The rural post office is more than a place where stamps are bought and sold.  It is the centre of activity in many of our small communities.  It is a meeting place, a social place and is of vital importance to the people in each and every small community in rural Ireland.  It must be preserved and we in this House must seek its preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural postman or postwoman is much more than the person who delivers a letter to the door.  He or she is a friend and confidant to everybody.  More important, to many people, they are is the only visitor in the day or, perhaps, in the week. <Col N="1486" /> They provide a necessary social service. We must stand by those people who perform their important tasks so diligently and with such dedication and who have done so down through the years.  Coming from the constituency Cork-East, it would be very remiss of me if I did not mention a post office which, six months ago, nobody knew of but which everybody knows of now.  I see the Minister smiling and I hope he will have good news for me.  I refer to Bartlemy post office. The cause of Bartlemy is no longer a local issue, it is now a national cause.  The people of that locality who on January last saw their post office shut down are now demanding that it be reopened.  They are demanding that the Minister use the powers he has under the 1983 Act to make the decision to reopen that post office.  It is no wonder that almost every candidate in the local elections in the Mallow electoral area, including members of the Minister's own party and, more significantly, including a member of the Minister's own parliamentary party, have publicly and in writing condemned the Minister's failure to meet with the people of Bartlemy to discuss the closure of their post office and, we hope, its reopening.  On no less than 28 occasions the people of that area have made a direct request to the Minister to meet with him to discuss their own crisis.  The Minister has refused to do so and I hope he will give me tonight an indication that he will do so.  More important, I hope he will give me the news tonight that he will use the powers he has to reopen the post office of Bartlemy in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise here this evening that the problems of An Post are not just rural ones.  There are many post offices in urban areas that are also under threat from the viability plan.  Many people in urban areas are very worried about the quality and efficiency of the service they will have as a result of this plan being implemented. There are many people working in rural and urban sub-post offices who are worried about their employment if this plan is sanctioned by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> The viability plan proposed by An Post, and agreed to date by Minister Brennan, is totally unacceptable to this side of the House.  It is unacceptable for the reasons pointed out by previous speakers.  Also it is a further example of the decimation of rural services by this Government particularly since 1989.  We have seen the closure of Teagasc offices, the neglect of our county roads, the closure of Garda stations, and now the closure of post offices.  How much more must the people of rural Ireland put up with from this Government?</P>
    <P>The post office in rural areas is the single most important hub of communication for many people in isolated rural areas.  It is the only means of contact for many people.  It is the information centre which our colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, spoke so freely about particularly in relation to unemployment exchanges.  For many old people in particular their way of getting information is when they draw the old age pension.  For people collecting children's allowance it may be the only means of communication they have.  It is essential to maintain a proper network of post offices.  It is also essential for An Post to modernise itself to meet the challenges of other financial institutions and provide a wider range of services in order to improve its viability for the future.  Nobody disputes that and we would welcome An Post making strides in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications pointed out on many occasions that no closures of post offices would take place until his consultants had reported.  I regret to say that this is not the case as was proved recently in my constituency of County Kilkenny in relation to Woodsgift Post Office.  That post office was closed just because the premises have been sold and An Post have failed to sanction an agency for those premises.  Some people in that case will be six miles from the nearest post office and that is certainly something that must not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Will it be the same for other post offices in urban and rural areas after the local elections or will it be the same for other <Col N="1488" /> rural services in my own area like Coon, Lacken and Dunnamaggan, to name but a few?  An Post can become more efficient.  Every one of us knows that finance has always been found to provide essential services for semi-State companies. The best example of that is CIE. We have seen that service subsidised to the tune of over £100 million because it is providing a mainly urban service and the number of people who would cry out and vote against this Government in a local election if anything happened to that service would have to be seen to be believed.  Similar services are essential in rural Ireland.  The post office network is an essential service, must be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister here this evening not to be cynical about this motion but to come clean and tell everybody in this House and the people in rural and urban Ireland what his plan is following the local elections, so that tonight we will now this Government's plans and the people can decide in two weeks' time whether they are happy with the viability plan put forward by An Post.</P>

      <P>Nor voices of the sweeter birds</P>
      <P>Above the wailing of the rain.</P>
      <P>With apologies to Francis Ledwidge, in this modern age and in the present crisis facing rural Ireland he would have added:</P>
      <P>Nor shall he know when post has come</P>
      <P>To fill that green box at his gate,</P>
      <P>Nor shall he hear the postman's knock</P>
      <P>Such is indeed the rustic's fate.</P>
      <P>That sums up much of what we are talking about tonight.  I am talking about rural Ireland and life in Ireland where the postman and post office have served extremely well.  If we want to delve into more poetry we could quote most of Goldsmith's <i>The Deserted Village</i> because in his time, 250 years ago, he saw the decline of life in Ireland.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> Ill fares the land to hast'ning ills a prey,</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates, and men</P>
    <P>decay</P>
    <P>But a bold peasantry, their country's</P>
    <P>pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroy'd, can never be</P>
    <P>supplied.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are talking about a decline, apart from the loss of 1,500 jobs at a time when we have, we hope, reached the pinnacle of unemployment.  Fifteen hundred jobs mean a great deal to the people involved and it is a terrible slap in the face to so many people who have served the post office and the people so well to see their jobs wiped out as a way of solving a financial problem.</P>
    <P>The fact that 500 post offices are targeted is indefensible.  If it was a reasonable number I am sure a few post offices would not be missed or their closure cause a major crisis, but 500 is overdoing it.  These post offices have served well and the Members who have already spoken have outlined what they have done.  I have a great objection to these green monsters that are supposed to sprout up all over the countryside and in the city. If we are becoming aware of the environment, and the slogan is to grow green, this is standing green on its head, and whether it is balanced in city or country, it will do nothing for either the appearance or the efficiency of the place.</P>
    <P>It has been said that people will be passing these green boxes several times a day, but it is not a service.  How often do you come out in a rainstorm to see if the post has arrived?  How often do you look into the box hoping your examination results have arrived?  It depends on what you are waiting for.  I suppose if you are waiting for bills the sooner the boxes go up the better because you can refuse to look into them, but if you are looking for news these boxes are as welcome, as some wit said, and as useful as a lighthouse in a bog.  That makes them very efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for allowing me to share their time.  Over the past six months or so Government and <Col N="1490" /> Opposition Deputies alike have attended meetings throughout the country and we have seen politicians of all parties unite in their opposition to An Post's management plans.  I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of my colleagues across the Floor.  They have stated on those occasions that they opposed these plans, but tomorrow at 8.30 p.m. will be the moment of truth.  I hope they will be as true to their word then as they were when they vociferously campaigned to oppose this plan.</P>
      <P>I approach this debate from two perspectives; first, the Article in the Constitution says we must cherish all children of the nation equally; and second, the legislation which established An Post put an onus on them to provide for their social obligations to the community.  In those terms the proposal we are discussing tonight to dismantle much of the social service An Post offer is regrettable. It would be a very retrograde step to dismantle the postal services An Post provide when the EC Commission is at present discussing, admittedly at a very early stage, the possibility of finance being available to support the network An Post provide at present.  It would be very sad if, two years down the road, we find money coming on stream which we cannot avail of because we have dismantled and withdrawn the very excellent service currently provided in rural areas.</P>
      <P>A fundamental argument which surpasses the interests of An Post workers is the viability plan for rural Ireland.  My fundamental belief that £1 of taxpayers' money from rural Ireland is as valuable to the Exchequer as £1 of Dublin 4 taxpayers' money.  Because of that there is an onus on this Government to ensure that the 32p stamp delivers a letter to the doorstep of an individual in rural Ireland as it will continue to deliver that service to the resident in Dublin 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we allow the An Post proposal to pass without making a stand we can say goodbye forever to a way of life which is unique in European terms where they are reaping the social consequences of urbanisation and urbanised population. <Col N="1491" /> We have something in rural Ireland and Irish community life that is unique in the European context and which we must preserve.  The battleground of An Post is symptomatic of a broader battle that must be fought to save what is now unique in European terms and is recognised by the European Commission as unique.  It would be very regrettable if, in the coming months, we were to dismantle a service and later find that had we been less hasty that service could have had EC support.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after Dáil Éireann, and substitute &ldquo;noting that</P>
      <P>(a)  at the initiative of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, talks are now in progress between management and unions about the future of An Post,</P>
      <P>(b)  the predicted losses of An Post in 1992 will, without corrective action, be £14 million, and accumulated losses by end 1992 will be £31 million,</P>
      <P>(c)  the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications has appointed consultants recommended by the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) to carry out a socio-economic study of the implications for rural communities of An Post's proposals in regard to sub-post offices and roadside letter boxes and also to consider proposing new sources of business for sub-post offices,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> (d)  An Post has deferred implementation of its proposals to regrade some of its own post offices until the company has had full consultation with relevant bodies from the towns concerned and considered how their concerns may be accommodated within the company's requirement to become financially viable, and</P>
    <P>(e)  following a request from the Minister, the Board of An Post decided to rescind its decision to withdraw from the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme,</P>
    <P>supports the Minister's efforts to have management and unions negotiate and agree proposals which will return the post office to at least break even as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Deputies are already aware of the financial problems being experienced by An Post and the proposals drawn up by the company to restore it to financial health. However, at this point, I would like to outline in some detail, the seriousness of the situation, as presented to me by the company.</P>
    <P>An Post lost £3.6 million in 1989 and almost £10 million last year after modest profits in 1987 and 1988.  The company's budget shows a loss of up to £7 million for this year and £14 million for 1992. Unless remedial measures are taken An Post's accumulated losses by end 1992 will be £31 million.  The main reasons for An Post's problems are increasing operational costs, particularly staffing costs, low mail volume growth and competition from modern telecommunications services and couriers. Pay costs alone account now for almost 80 per cent of An Post's total costs.  An Post's costs increased by 16.7 per cent compared with an increase of only 10.3 per cent in revenue in the period 1987-90. A 6 per cent pay increase has been awarded under the conciliation and arbitration scheme which would cost An Post a total of £7.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>An Post has considered this difficult <Col N="1493" /> situation in great detail and has put forward proposals to address the situation with the objective of returning the company to financial health.  The programme which the company announced has the target of achieving £24 million savings by 1995.  The proposals drawn up by the company cover a wide range of issues. The details of the proposals are well documented at this stage and as the proposals are now the subject of discussion between An Post and the unions I do not propose to comment in detail.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful if I set out for the House the initiatives which I have taken since these proposals were published.</P>
    <P>I had detailed discussions with An Post about their recovery proposals.  I was concerned about the impact of An Post's proposals on sub-post offices and roadside letterboxes on the aged, infirm and people living alone and I appointed NESC-recommended consultants to carry out a study on my behalf.  They have also been asked to consider proposing new sources of business for sub-post offices.  I can assure the House that there is no question of the Government agreeing to the unwarranted dismantling of the postal network.</P>
    <P>In addition, I know that there has been concern at local level about An Post's proposal to regrade some 50 of its post offices.  The position is that An Post have deferred implementation of this proposal until full consultation has taken place with local interests from the towns involved and considered how their concerns may be accommodated within the company's requirement to become financially viable.</P>
    <P>I have devoted considerable time and effort in preparing the ground for An Post-union negotiations.  I met the various unions representing An Post's staff and following rather protracted discussions involving the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a formula for management-union negotiations was agreed. At my request An Post decided to rescind their decision to withdraw from the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>The result of all these efforts is that <Col N="1494" /> management-union negotiations have recently commenced.  I appeal to both sides to get involved in real constructive dialogue and to refrain from action that would further damage the future of the post office.  As the House is aware, we have well-tried and tested industrial relations machinery and the fullest use should be made of that machinery to process this problem to a speedy solution. Disruption of services will serve nobody's interest.  In particular &mdash; I know Members will be pleased to hear this &mdash; I should tell the House that An Post have now informed me that it is their clear objective that job reductions will be of a voluntary nature.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the Fine Gael motion. It demands a level of service but unfortunately gives absolutely no indication as to how the cost of these services are to be met.  It is simply a list of demands with no price tag.  It is, of course, always open to Oppositions to put down motions supporting additional spending and easy options.  It is particularly tempting for them to do this at election times.  I had hoped that those days were behind us all and that this kind of popularity seeking and financial irresponsibility would have given way to constructive proposals from the Opposition.</P>

      <P>The amendment from The Workers' Party calling for additional capital investment requires brief comment. Over the past five years £43 million has been invested by An Post and it is proposed to invest a further £64 million over the next five years.  I accept that An Post could do with even further capital investment and I will give every assistance practicable to an Post in this area.</P>
      <P>However, additional capital investment means, among other things, more automation.  More automation can have a consequent negative effect on employment in the post office.  I wonder why The Workers' Party amendment did not follow through the logic of their proposal in this manner &mdash; could it be to do with elections?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now let me outline to the House the up-to-date position regarding An Post.  Talks have now commenced between unions and management on An Post's plan.  Let me state quite clearly that the plan is a series of proposals. These proposals are not carved in stone. Any alternative proposals put forward by the trade union movement or anyone else will receive full consideration and can become part of the negotiation process. In fact, as I have said on many occasions &mdash; and I want to spell it out here again this evening &mdash; all proposals are negotiable provided that they have the objective of returning An Post to at least break even without State subsidy.  This has to be the bottom line for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions that the EC will provide an instant magic solution are, I am afraid, very wide of the mark.  The EC Green Paper on Postal Services is due to be published towards the end of the month. It will contain a range of suggestions, some of which may, in the long term, benefit An Post, particularly on the investment side.  On the other hand, other suggestions in the that paper may have substantial negative effects on An Post, for example, proposals for increased competition.  Realistically, <Col N="1496" /> therefore, An Post must find a solution to their problems by operating on factors which they can control themselves, that is, a combination of revenue increases and cost reductions.</P>
    <P>A programme of full consultation between representatives of the towns concerned and An Post about the company's regarding proposals is well under way.  Already representatives of some ten towns have met the company and further groups will be met in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report is proceeding speedily.  They are already deeply involved in data collection.  In addition, they have had detailed discussions with my Department, the Department of Social Welfare and An Post.  A steering group, chaired by my Department is monitoring progress.</P>
    <P>An Post have to gear themselves to cope with the challenges of the rapidly changing postal sector.  They need a major capital investment programme. They must develop new products.  They must address their cost base.  They will need creativity and imagination.  In particular they will need goodwill from management and unions to turn the Irish postal service around, and that is something we would all wish.</P>
    <P>I am today, in this debate, urging both sides to set aside any hostile or confrontational approach.  I have great respect, and always have had great respect, for the dedicated workforce of the Post Office.  I know they will consider responding this evening to the plea from me to look at the issues in a spirit of goodwill and see how together we can negotiate a solution to the difficulty with the objective of bringing the Post Office back to break even.  That is my objective and I know it is the objective of the workforce for whom I have a very deep respect.</P>
    <P>An Post cannot afford to enter a period of disruption of services, which would have a devastating impact on the consumer and on business.  Any disruption now would be a devastating blow for business which is struggling to create more employment.  All the industrial relations machinery of the State is available so that <Col N="1497" /> both sides can continue dialogue and find an agreed solution which will secure the long term viability of the postal service.</P>

I was trenchantly opposed to that proposal several months ago, and I can assure Deputy Currie, through the Chair, that I am as trenchantly opposed to it tonight as I was then. There was not a whimper from the Opposition benches about the viability plan when it was first published.  The Fianna Fáil backbenchers about whom Deputy Currie spoke were the first people to declare their deep concern about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is that we have trenchantly opposed the plan and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a further historic truth which has to be addressed.  Unfortunately this relates to the management of An Post.  It is an absolutely true and hard economic fact that An Post have failed over the years to adapt to changing circumstances, changing times and changing demands.  They failed to computerise, to market their products adequately, to diversify into a demand-led marketplace or to utilise their 1,900 or so outlets, four more than their closest competitors, the commercial banks and the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that, of course, is history, the overtime bill of An Post which is in excess of £21 million per annum, the vast majority of which is in the Dublin region, is not history.  I respect the right of every individual in the workforce to seek to take home as much as he possibly can to his family, but I also believe in equality and fair treatment for all.  At a time when their overtime bill was running at £21 million per annum, the management of An Post came up with the idea to close 550 sub-post offices which would save a meagre £2.1 million, regrade district offices which would save £3 million and erect letter boxes at a cost of £6.7 million. However, the plan failed to address the positive aspects of how An Post could expand their role in Irish society for their own economic gain.  I am sorry to have to say that An Post choose instead to tear the heart out of rural Ireland, to rob provincial towns of their focal point and in the process take the pride away from many provincial towns.  This attempt to reduce the level of service in provincial towns and rural Ireland is being done at a time when the Minister for Agriculture and Food is attempting to introduce an <Col N="1499" /> innovative rural development programme. I could not tolerate such a proposal by An Post.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to say that there is a niche for An Post in the marketplace.  An Post could diversify into areas such as motor taxation, driving licences, parking fines, driving tests, certain payments for semi-State companies, tourist information and payment of ESB bills.  It is unfortunate, to say the least, that An Post singularly failed to put forward even one decent, concrete positive proposal in their viability plan which would address the problems they are facing.  An Post are facing problems.  They have to be brought into the 21st century but, unfortunately, over the past number of years An Post have not addressed the problems of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a single automated exchange.  If An Post do not go down this road then other companies in the private sector will continue to grow at the expense of An Post.  It is time An Post took on the private couriers on level terms and went into the marketplace with them to find out why they are failing while other companies have succeeded. Mail traffic for An Post only grew by 1.5 per cent per annum from 1987-90.  While technological factors such as fax machines may have accounted for a certain amount of this, it is absolutely true to say that private couriers have continued to bite away at An Post's business and their natural marketplace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The first day of January 1984 was a day of fundamental change for An Post in that the postal service which was part of a Government Department in a sheltered context assumed the status of a commercial semi-State body. In other words, from being a service industry, a non-market organisation, where efficiency and profit were subordinate considerations, it faced overnight, as it were, the hard commercial realities of being a semi-State body.  That change required change in turn &mdash; change in developing new business and change in being more cost conscious.  Despite their present very serious financial problems on the positive side, An Post continue to be a valuable national asset.  Its network is unique in the country in terms of its spread and its contact with the people.  As we speak serious financial problems are dominant.  Basically An Post have failed to live up to the hopes <Col N="1502" /> placed in them and have failed to grow to meet the demands of their commercial mandate.  The company therefore now need reform and renewal, and it is entirely reasonable that they be reviewed from top to bottom.</P>
      <P>Change is necessary and, as the Minister pointed out in his opening remarks, both management and unions recognise this.  I, as a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored bodies to which the parties gave evidence, know well there is an open attitude to change from both sides.  From the Government viewpoint, as the Minister pointed out, there is no question of an unwarranted dismantling of An Post.  The Government have no intention of making a quick, short term, rash jump at the problems of An Post.  Indeed the Minister's record is there to be seen.  He has invested a huge amount of time and skill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in facilitating progress between the parties.  He has restored, by this instruction, the conciliation scheme in An Post.  This has been very important machinery over many decades both in the Post Office and elsewhere.  It has proved to be resilient, effective and orderly.  It places a joint responsibility on management and worker representatives to work out solutions to their problems.  In other words, responsibility rests where it properly belongs, with the key stakeholders who have most to gain and indeed most to lose.  The challenge facing them &mdash; they have succeeded many times in doing so jointly &mdash; is to find workable and lasting solutions to their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no problem with the appointment of consultants in relation to the sub-post offices or indeed with the breathing space that has been given for the regrading of head and district post offices.  Indeed I look forward very much to the proposals of the consultants in relation to new business. This is where management seem to have failed in particular, in not having enough business to ensure the growth of <Col N="1503" /> the organisation and to secure their future adequately.  The record in that respect is particularly disappointing.  The proposals of a detached group such as the consultants, in terms of ideas for new business, should be studied very carefully by all concerned.</P>
    <P>More change is clearly necessary.  The problems are of such gravity that change must be addressed.  Automation is a requirement in organisations across the board.  There has been a dramatic change in organisational life, particularly in the commercial sector, over the last ten years.  Not alone is automation necessary to address the problems facing the company but also to prevent further decline and the loss of more jobs.  The harsh commercial reality is that there is no room in the nineties for out-dated structures and attitudes, be they management, union or worker attitudes.  There is systematic institutional overtime in An Post and there are restrictive practices.  There is an urgent need to modernise, to meet the needs of customers in the first instance and, as I have said, to prevent further decline in the company.</P>
    <P>Competition is here to stay.  An Post are feeling the cold winds of competition in various parts of their business.  Only last week I read that the Commissioner for Competition at EC level referred to the possibility of further competition in postal services on the international front. Much play has been made of the proposals put forward by the company but these are only a set of proposals.  It is not, as the Minister pointed out, a plan carved in stone.  As somebody who has spent a good part of his life as an arbitrator in labour disputes and being close to industrial relations practice, I know that the very essence of industrial relations practice is flexibility: flexibility in discussions and eyeball to eyeball contact between the two sides.  The right forum now exists to advance discussions towards a solution to the problems of An Post.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a direct contribution, as indeed have the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; I pay tribute to that body &mdash; in bringing the parties face <Col N="1504" /> to face so that they will engage as quickly as possible in constructive and substantial negotiations.  That is the correct way to proceed.  Dáil Éireann is not the place to solve the problems of An Post.  The Minister has a facilitating role which he has played with success, but what is needed is face to face contact between the negotiators from both sides.  They are the key stakeholders, as I have said, and they have most to gain or lose.</P>
    <P>The management and trade union representatives, both experienced in inter-personal contact and in negotiations on pay and conditions, are now facing one another and should be left to do so.  After all they have a common objective, they both want to see An Post back on the financial rails.  They want the company to break even once again.  That is in the interests of all concerned and it is obviously in the interest of this House because of the functional responsibility of the Minister as shareholder in the company.</P>
    <P>In summary, the company have changed fundamentally from being a very protected organisation, as part of the Civil Service, that did not have to be concerned with profits and did not have to be cost-conscious in the way they need to be now.  The company are a national asset.  Obviously there is a commitment to see them return to financial viability. They need to grow, and I am sure I have the support of everybody in wishing them well in that regard.  Changes are necessary. As the previous speaker pointed out, automation and computerisation have not advanced quickly enough, nor has the removal of restrictive practices been brought about quickly enough.  The issue will not be solved by debate here. Therefore what is needed is an opportunity for the parties to be left to themselves, and that is now happening.  The consultants' reports will clearly contribute valuable ideas, but it will take a certain amount of time to do that.</P>
    <P>The historical position of An Post before they got their commercial mandate was that there was distrust and antagonism in the organisation.  There were outdated management structures which needed to be changed and which <Col N="1505" /> aggravated inter-personal relationships between the two sides.  The requirements of the commercial mandate mean that both parties have to address these problems. At the end of the day the primary responsibility for good industrial relations rests with management, but management alone cannot resolve the problem.  Industrial relations together with pay and conditions are a joint responsibility, particularly in a unionised organisation.  Therefore, there is a heavy responsibility on both sides to face some harsh decisions with a view to the longer-term security and commercial viability of the company.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I wish the company well.  I deplore the fact that this matter should enter the political arena in an electoral context because that is quite unsuitable and irrelevant to the requirements of An Post.  Both parties are sitting down together and we should let them bargain it out.  Let us wish them well in reaching agreement and returning the company to financial health.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion.  It is significant in many respects that the House has before it a motion that expresses concern at the downgrading of the postal services by virtue of the fact that An Post are trying to introduce a <Col N="1507" /> viability plan.  There is another significance as well, inasmuch as I detect a definite shift in the ideology of the Fine Gael Party.  Fine Gael are now calling on the Minister to intervene under section 110 of the Act.  I welcome that development which is a departure from points put forward by their leader in recent weeks. Indeed, any effort to deal with the unemployment problem is to be welcomed. The call of Fine Gael for the State to intervene is very much welcomed by this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I very much regret that neither the mover of the motion nor the Fianna Fáil Government indicated the way in which it was intended to deal with the amendment put forward by The Workers' Party.  If the motion is to be successful then their amendment does need to be taken on board, because if sufficient funding is not provided there will be a repetition of what happened since 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some indication should be given to lead us in a specific direction.</P>
      <P>A plan that proposes to shed 1,500 jobs in An Post and close down 550 sub-post offices has to be taken against the background of the number of jobs already lost in An Post and the 250,000 people already unemployed.  To date 1,100 jobs have been lost in An Post, but no mention has been made of that.  Prior to the viability plan the numbers had been reduced by 1,100 and 49 new jobs were created and absorbed by the staff of An Post, for which nobody gave them credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> Why is it necessary to introduce this viability plan?  At meetings held between various parties and the chief executive, Mr. Hynes, he left us in no doubt that bad management decisions had been taken. Deputy Hillery and Deputy O'Donoghue say it is necessary to modernise An Post. It is not acceptable to have a management who make bad decisions and then use the staff as a safety net to extract themselves from the mess they have created.  It is downright dishonest for An Post to suggest that while they accept they have made mistakes, the only way to solve their problems is to shed staff.  Already there have been disastrous effects resulting from the shedding of staff in An Post, which I shall come back to later on.</P>
    <P>The main problem arises from section 29 of the Act which proposes that a sum not exceeding £50 million would be available for capital works.  To date, only £7 million has been paid to An Post.  The Minister used another set of figures and he does this quite well.  Nonetheless, An Post has been underfunded from the very beginning.  I must confess to being part of a Government who introduced that legislation, but successive Governments have failed to provide sufficient funding for An Post.  As a result, despite all the cutbacks in staff &mdash; and 1,100 is a considerable number to shed &mdash; An Post failed to become viable.</P>
    <P>Added to that, An Post inherited an outdated fleet of vans, which cost quite a lot to replace.  Most of the post office buildings throughout the country were in a dilapidated state.  For instance, I worked in the post office in Cork in what was formerly a cold store: the main sorting office in Brian Boru Street in Cork was formerly a cold store.</P>
    <P>Another factor was the introduction of Sheriff Street sorting office, which has been much criticised of late.  The overtime worked by staff there has come under fire.  The type of mechanisation introduced there actually helped to slow down the sorting of parcels, inasmuch as it was clapped-out machinery that was <Col N="1509" /> imported.  In other words, from day one second-hand machinery was put into the new sorting office in Sheriff Street, and that helped in some measure to bring down the operation of An Post.</P>
    <P>I note with interest that Deputy Currie and Government members said that An Post would have to expand, but they all stopped short of mentioning the banking system.  The banking system is the only means of expansion included in the 1983 legislation.  Under that Act if the Post Office, now An Post, were to expand it would be through involvement in banking, particularly in the Giro system.  That begs a question: why have An Post been prevented from getting involved in that area?  There is a reluctance on the part of the right wing parties to allow them get involved in banking.  Do I take it that they do not want to offend their friends in the banking world?</P>
    <P>If An Post is to survive, then it is absolutely essential that they be allowed to expand into the banking area.  Mr. Tom Garvey, who was to be the chief executive of An Post but who subsequently went to Europe, had very definite plans as to how he would see it develop.  He foresaw the provision of a computer terminal at each sub-post office throughout the country.  That should have been done, and it could have been done at a very minimal cost.  It was not done, and as a result An Post fell behind.  Due to the growth of the credit union movement there is room for An Post to get involved with them by providing a banking service throughout the country.  That is an issue that has not been investigated.  Did the Minister put such ideas to the consultants as ways to make An Post viable without shedding staff and adding to the dole queues?</P>
    <P>The most damaging factor to An Post is set out in a leaflet which is a special briefing to members of the An Post superannuation scheme.  In three short years I shall be one of those beneficiaries and I shall be entitled to all these documents having served 30 years in An Post. <Col N="1510" /> Because the Minister did not accept the responsibility placed on him by the Act to fund pre-vesting date pensions, a debit of £126,284,000 has been imposed on An Post.  The Minister was to take up the pensions of people who had left the service prior to vesting day but that did not happen.  As a result, the amount due to An Post by the Minister in investment return to date is £54,484,000.  If that kind of money had been available to An Post I have no doubt we would not now be discussing this so-called viability plan.</P>
    <P>Already several Members have mentioned the effects of the viability plan on rural Ireland.  It is worth noting that it will have disastrous effects and will put An Post at a disadvantage in competing with those mentioned by Deputy Hillery, namely, the private couriers.  Does the House realise what an extension of the single post delivery service to all areas would mean?  It means that if there were a single delivery here in Dublin and if one leaves Leinster House to post a letter late on a Thursday night after the post had gone, then the letter would not be collected until the following morning when the delivery for Dublin city was on its way.  It is possible that a letter posted late on a Thursday night would not be received in the city of Dublin until the following Monday morning.  The same position would apply in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, or any of the other main urban areas.  This just cannot be tolerated.  How long would they survive in competition against underpaid people who are not organised, who are being exploited by the couriers?  In doing this the Government are cutting off another very important vein in the body of An Post.  That is not on.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to reduce the size of the Post Office network to 1,500 offices. Deputies Bradford and Hogan did not mention closures in their own areas.  I have no doubt that Deputy Wallace is familiar with the effect of the closure of Inniscarra Post Office.  Inniscarra is located on the northern route between <Col N="1511" /> Cork and Macroom.  The sub-post office there was closed down and as a result elderly people, pensioners, have to travel to either Blarney or Ballincollig and they do not have public transport available.  I could go down through a litany of things here and make a powerful case but I promised to share my time with Deputy Michael Higgins.  I have no doubt that he will say that we will support this motion and I hope that Fine Gael will take on board the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary at this stage to try to introduce a few simple definitions of language.  What is being debated here, the so-called viability plan by An Post management to be visited upon people, is neither economic, viable nor is it a plan.  As I listened to the speeches I noticed how some basics were slipping away.  Deputy Hillery referred to the Minister as a shareholder, and he is. The Minister is only in a secondary way a shareholder under the Bill.  In section 110 the Minister is the guarantor of the social provisions of the Bill and it is as a guarantor of the basis of the Bill that the Minister requires his authority.  The Minister is not in here as a shareholder to be ranked with any others.  That is why this matter belongs to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was being introduced it balanced certain aims very clearly.  The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, clearly made a contract with the public that certain services would remain intact.  What is at stake?  Management who have presided over from surplus to loss to increasing projected loss, who have given themselves rises in salary at the time that they have denied their obligations to pay arbitration awards to the people who are on the street delivering letters, produced a plan that is supposed to take the form of writ. Lest people think that I am a new convert to this cause, I had the privilege of speaking at the Communication Workers <Col N="1512" /> Union Conference when it was held earlier, before there was a smell of an election and before the suggestion could be made &ldquo;don't worry, people of Ireland, Fianna Fáil backbenchers will see you right in the end, with a nod and a wink, and so on&rdquo;.  The truth of the matter is that An Post management in their proposals do not meet their obligations under the Act.  In relation to the nature of postal services within any policy of communications is the right to post a letter and avail of a postal service a discretionary citizen's right, or is it a commercial act or service?  An Post are trying to tell us that the volume of mail which might emanate by way of commercial communication should be a criterion and should be so predominant in the thinking, that it would deny the right of a rural person to receive and send mail.  It is a fundamental distortion of every postal obligation in every civilised country.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of economic thinking and of viability, but absurdity broke out earlier today when I sat in this seat and heard that the economy was doing very well but that unemployment is likely to rise.  I have often spoken here about the kind of economics where the economy is well but the people do badly.  I have listened for years to people saying that we need a climate of investment, that we need a low inflation rate, that we need good facilities for investment and so forth and that after that will come all the jobs. Nobody wants to address the situation where the climate could not be better in terms of productivity levels, wage costs, low inflation, and aids to industry in this country of the same order as the expenditure on education, but that there are no jobs.  At the end of the Minister's speech there is a mantra-esque kind of reference, or a little prayer which says that An Post cannot afford to enter a period of disruption of services with devastating impact on the consumer and on business that is striving to provide more employment.  Would that it was.  It is the consistent opposition to State activity in <Col N="1513" /> the economy that has produced the scandal of unemployment.</P>
    <P>When An Post became a semi-State body, it is very interesting that their activities were not linked to other semi-State body activities.  Why could not parts of Government Departments activity be given to An Post as future business.  Who opposed the giving of banking services to An Post, that was considered so important that banking and bank giro are mentioned in section 87 of the Act specifically?  It was the idealogues who said that anything that had ever had a whiff of being owned by the State or the public must not be allowed to compete with something that might have made a profit.  The summary of what my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, said is very simple.  If it had been given a chance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What Deputy O'Sullivan said was that if it had been given a chance, An Post could have been a very viable entity.  Let us realise what is at stake in it.  It is a very interesting question. If someone was taking over as chief executive of An Post, would it not be very valuable to say that the staff, instead of being an overtime problem, were a resource in the company?  What has really excited the public mind is that they know what the post person does.  It was possible anywhere other than in a poor law country for different social services to be provided by the people who are calling every day on the elderly.  I will expound on that notion of the little box at the end of the lane.  There are many elderly people waiting for home help.  Will they get the home help to turn the key in the box to see if their basic entitlements are down <Col N="1514" /> at the end of the lane?  That is a kind of anti-worker thinking, that at one stage has to say &ldquo;we will not accept arbitration and conciliation, and we will go back to arbitration and conciliation when the Minister tells us&rdquo; and then we are told as well, that every proposal is flexible.  The An Post management statement of 6 February 1991 is fascinating.  In issuing the plan, the company stated that their financial position was so serious that all the elements of the plan must be implemented without delay.  Which is it? Deputy Hillery talked about flexibility being the basis of industrial relations. Trust is the basis of industrial relations. Which do An Post want &mdash; the document of February or the new flexibility which they are now adopting under pressure from the Minister?  Deputy O'Donoghue said there was not one decent, concrete proposal; if there is not, Opposition Members should vote against it and then we can all start again with good industrial relations, proper economic planning and development of the postal services.</P>

    <P>Asking questions in the Dáil is the only way of extracting information from a Minister on behalf of constituents.  Any attempt to withhold information is a very serious matter and is unacceptable in <Col N="1515" /> every respect.  The Minister has the relevant information on file in his Department in regard to a question tabled on 5 June and I ask for its disclosure.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed me in his reply that he was setting up an appeals system; I already knew that.  The Minister has examined the areas in question and has given his decision in relation to refusing their entry to the disadvantaged areas scheme.  We also know the Minister carried out a land survey and that officials from his Department spent at least three years compiling information in respect of the criteria laid down by the EC.  All this information in regard to population, the percentage of cereals and so on, is available in the Department.  We know from the leaked list last November, which was submitted to Brussels for approval and returned, that certain adjustments were made in respect of several DEDs in Wexford which we compared with the current official list.  It is further proof that the Department of Agriculture and Food have at their disposal the necessary information to answer the questions submitted to the Minister on 5 June.</P>
    <P>As far as an appeals system is concerned, it is essential to know against what you are appealing and why you were rejected in the first instance.  The Department have made a decision on the submissions but those affected must know the grounds on which those decisions were made.  In 1985 the farmers of Wexford &mdash; and other counties &mdash; were not worried about getting into disadvantaged areas but the situation is very different today because of the expected drop of 25 per cent for the year 1990-91 in farmers net incomes.  Reclassification is the only road to survival.  I call on the Minister to disclose this information; if not, he treats the House with contempt, it becomes irrelevant and so does the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the appeals in relation to DEDs are to have a reasonable chance of succeeding this information is fundamental <Col N="1516" /> to their case.  I appeal to the Minister for its disclosure.</P>

      <P>In regard to the proposals, of which I have a copy, there was much disappointment in many areas which were excluded.  When European approval was given the disappointment was even greater for many farmers throughout my county especially in 30 townlands which were excluded.  We understand these townlands were rejected by the EC.  If they had already been approved by the Irish Government why were they rejected by the EC?  For this reason I tabled specific parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food but I did not receive an appropriate response to my question although I was entitled to it.  Why does the Minister not come clean on this issue?  Surely he can see that the disadvantaged areas scheme is a divisive issue?  The Minister is not doing anything to arrest this division and it is incumbent on him to give reasons for excluding areas.</P>

      <P>The matter referred to by Deputy D'Arcy and Finucane concerns me and my constituents in East Cork.  In the north Cork area, for instance, at least 50 per cent of the original applicants for inclusion in the disadvantaged area have been excluded.</P>
      <P>If a farmer applies for a grant and is refused he is given a written reason for the refusal.  If a person applies for a medical card and is refused he or she is given a written reason for the refusal.  The same applies to a person looking for unemployment assistance.  It is only right and proper that applicants for the disadvantaged areas who have been refused, presumably under one of the criteria laid down by Brussels, should be told exactly why they have been refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be given the opportunity to explain further why I do not propoise to give details of the disadvantaged areas survey results on a townland basis.</P>
      <P>First, there is as indicated in my replies to recent questions, the issue of relevance. The designation of areas is not specifically determined on the basis of individual townlands or on the basis of individual district electoral divisions.  It is instead based on &ldquo;homogenous areas&rdquo; which may embrace entire DEDs, part DEDs or groups of townlands straddling a number of DEDs.  Indeed, it was in recognition of the fact that DED boundaries do not respect physical features and economic circumstances that the Government with which Deputy D'Arcy was associated introduced arrangements ten years ago to redraw boundaries on a part DED basis involving townlands rather than on the basis of entire DEDs which had previously been the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, there is the question of confidentiality. The survey forms were filled in and signed by farmers on the understanding common to all Government census work that the information was confidential.  Because of the high level of the sample taken, three out of four farmers in many townlands were surveyed and to give details of, say, income indicating that income levels in certain townlands in County Wexford were over four to five times the national average would be a clear breach of confidentiality and highlight facts which neither the farmers concerned nor their public representatives would wish to be published. It should be noted that the CSO do not publish data for individual townlands and the DED is the smallest area in respect of which data is published.  I do not intend to depart from established practice or <Col N="1518" /> from the stance taken by successive Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>Having said that, let me add that groups of farmers in DEDs and townlands not included in the new list of disadvantaged areas have a remedy now available to them which was not available in 1985 when, as the Deputy will be aware, the last extension was ratified.  I refer to the appeals panel which I have set up and which has started to function. I am happy to inform the House that next week advertisements will appear in the national press and local papers in the 15 counties involved in the extension.  These will give details of the appeal arrangements and where interested groups of farmers in areas outside the revised boundary may obtain the necessary forms to apply for inclusion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can understand Deputy D'Arcy's concern about Wexford which got no new areas admitted to the disadvantaged areas as a result of the 1980-85 survey when his party were in office. I am pleased to put on record that the new areas now being admitted in Wexford total 60,000 hectares and raise the percentage of the county designated from a mere 5 per cent to over 30 per cent.  In sporting parlance, he has put in a storming finish but I am afraid his effort has come too late and he has, I fear, overused the whip.  In fact, he has flogged a dead horse.</P>

      <P>The Tralee area is now one of the worst unemployment black spots in the country.  At present there are 3,474 people on the live register at Tralee Employment Exchange.  Its industrial base has been continuously eroded during the past ten years.  One of the major industries in the town, Klopman Limited, are now experiencing major difficulties because of competition from <Col N="1519" /> imports from countries outside the European Community.  Redundancies are inevitable but I hope closure can be averted.</P>
      <P>On 6 May Wabco Westinghouse had to lay off 35 of their 42 employees.  They manufacture railway signalling equipment and systems and have been supplying signalling equipment to Iarnród Éireann since 1980.  Iarnród Éireann have been their only customer throughout this period.  Since 1988, when the company were acquired by Ansaldo spa of Italy, a policy of establishing export markets has been pursued.  A commercial agreement was recently concluded with Ansaldo whereby Wabco Westinghouse will manufacture and supply harmonic detector equipment to GEC Alsthom for use in British Rail channel tunnel locomotives. Work on this order is due to commence in November this year.  At the end of March the company completed work on the west road contract for Iarnród Éireann.  Since the beginning of the year management have been discussing with the chief signal engineer his requirements for the next stage of resignalling work. This concerns the Malahide to Dundalk line.</P>
      <P>The company learned at the end of April that the board of Iarnród Éireann had deferred taking any decision on a new contract.  At a meeting on 9 May with the managing director of Iarnród Éireann, Mr. David Waters, he indicated that a decision may not be made for &ldquo;a couple of months&rdquo;.  The company had to lay off 35 of their 42 employees from 6 May.  The parent company are naturally concerned about the situation.  The signalling chief executive of Ansaldo is due to visit Ireland shortly and I am concerned that unless there is positive news on a new contract at that time a decision to close the company will be made.</P>
      <P>The signalling work proposed by Iarnród Éireann's signalling department will have to be done at some stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> Unfortunately, unless the decision to proceed is taken sooner rather than later, the work will have to be done abroad as Wabco Westinghouse are the only indigenous signalling company.  I was informed recently that Iarnród Éireann will defer a decision on their resignalling programme until a study on the cross-Border rail link has been completed. However, as this could take a number of months to complete the company could be forced to close in the meantime.</P>
    <P>On 22 April the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, was informed of the seriousness of the problem, but he has failed to respond positively.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Minister of State present in the House to ensure that funding for this resignalling project is approved immediately before Tralee loses one of its most successful industries and 42 people are left without jobs and a means of earning a decent living.  Several young families will be affected if the factory closes.  Last week one of their employees was married.  Another one is due to be married next week.  The workers are seeking positive and immediate action on the part of the Minister and the Government to ensure that the factory remains in production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned by the problems which Wabco Westinghouse are experiencing, and the resultant decision of the company to lay off 35 employees. However, I am advised that the company are taking the necessary steps to address their long term problems, and I am hopeful that these steps will have positive results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wabco Westinghouse have been providing valuable employment in Tralee since 1980, designing and manufacturing railway signalling systems.  During that time, the company's sole customer has been CIE and Irish Rail, and they have been completely dependent on contracts <Col N="1521" /> from them.  It is because of a drop in orders from Irish Rail that the current problems in the company have arisen.</P>
    <P>In 1988, Wabco Westinghouse were taken over when their parent company, American Standard, were purchased by Ansaldo Transporti spa.  Ansaldo are part of the Italian state holding group, IRI Finmeccanica, who employ approximately 500,000 people.  Ansaldo design, manufacture and provide integrated transportation systems including power supply, signalling, rolling stock and project management.</P>
    <P>At the time of the takeover there was doubt over the long term future of the Wabco facility.  The company had been set up to design and manufacture the signalling system for the DART railway system.  From a peak of 91 people in 1982 the company have reduced to their current level of 42 people.</P>
    <P>The company have recognised the dangers associated with their reliance on a single customer, and I understand that they have made a decision to develop a range of products for sale into the UK.  I understand that the company are at an advanced stage of discussions with a customer in the UK for the supply of a new product.  Delivery would be due to commence at the end of this year.  It is envisaged that this project could secure the long term future of the facility and provide opportunities for expansion.</P>
    <P>I also understand that Wabco Westinghouse's parent company, Ansaldo Transporti spa, are engaged in discussions with other potential customers in the UK.  I am hopeful that this process can lead to a much wider customer base for the company and will leave them less vulnerable in the future to the changing requirements of a single customer.</P>
    <P>If the current layoffs are to be addressed in the short term and the company allowed to develop new products, then they must find business to carry them over until the development of the new products is completed and they go into <Col N="1522" /> production.  I understand that the company have been discussing contract opportunities with Irish Rail.  However, this is a matter between the company and Irish Rail, and not one on which I should comment, except to say the accusation levelled by Deputy Deenihan against the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications was wide of the mark. I hope that the discussions can produce a recipe to allow the company overcome their problems.  I am confident that with the assistance of the Industrial Development Authority the company will be able to do this.  I am satisfied that the company and the Industrial Development Authority are taking all possible steps to address the present difficulties and I hope to see a satisfactory outcome.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Heroin Problem.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time on 2 May 1991 the Minister stated, as reported at column 1995 of the Official Report, that the view of the Garda concerning the heroin problem in Dublin was that there was some sign of increased activity but that it did not constitute a serious problem.  I find it very difficult to accept or understand that assessment because in the area of Dublin I represent, in particular the north inner city, heroin is definitely a serious problem.  There are two specific locations, one little more than a stone's throw from O'Connell Street and the other close to the Financial Services Centre, where heroin is openly available and on sale on the public streets.  There is an equally serious problem in many other parts of Dublin, for example, the main shopping district in Ballyfermot and the general south inner city area where the concentration appears to be on the Thomas Street district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the city councillors who represent these areas at the monthly meeting of Dublin City Council last night and they certainly regard the heroin problem as a major and serious one.  This leads <Col N="1523" /> me to believe that either the Minister or those advising him are out of touch with the extent of the problem on the ground or that we do not want to publicly admit that the problem is so serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated on 2 May 1991 at column 1990 of the Official Report that he could reassure the House that the problem of drugs was one which would continue to receive the highest priority. City councillors who represent many areas of Dublin city do not believe him. They say the Ballyfermot shopping district has virtually been taken over by the drug dealers and that despite many appeals for action nothing has happened. The councillors representing the south inner city have called for a special local Garda drug unit for their area but nothing has been done.  Increasingly it is my view that the heroin problem does not get a high priority, never mind the highest priority because it is a problem associated almost exclusively with disadvantaged urban working class areas.  If there were such a problem in an affluent middle class area of Dublin, there would be a massive Garda response, of that I have no doubt.</P>
    <P>In the early eighties, heroin was largely concentrated in the inner city areas. Today, heroin features in most urban working class parts of the city and suburbs. Heroin is directly related to much of the petty crime in the city.  The Minister says that the number of crimes committed has been reduced.  The fact is that day in and day out the crime of heroin dealing is going on unhindered, unrecorded and unrecognised in the Minister's crime statistics.  The Minister stated in columns 1995-96 of 2 May 1991: &ldquo;The position today is very different from that which prevailed in the early and mid-eighties when bigger quantities of heroin were being handled in a more organised manner by hardened criminals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the top heroin godfathers of the early eighties &mdash; a member of the Dunne family &mdash; was caught redhanded with almost £500,000 <Col N="1524" /> worth of heroin, charged with possession and with intent to supply, and returned for trial, and yet this matter has never been finalised?  Is the Minister aware that this same member of the Dunne family is still involved supplying heroin through the many contacts he made in the early eighties; that he is now based in Birmingham and that pushers travel to him and return with their heroin supply to wreak havoc on our communities?  Will the Minister say why no action has been taken to bring this individual to justice? He is not alone, other criminal elements from the early eighties are now based in London and other British cities and an increasing number of pushers travel to them for their deadly supplies.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do the following: first, publicly recognise and state that there is a very serious heroin problem in certain areas of Dublin city; second, set up special local Garda drug units in those areas because it is only by a combination of local knowledge and effective surveillance that the dealers can be dealt with.  There is still no such unit in the south inner city where the heroin problem first began and continues today; third, where special Garda units already exist, as in my own area, and they work very well, ensure that they have all the resources they require; and fourth, target those Irish sources of supply now operating from British cities.  I ask the Minister to give this matter his highest priority.</P>
    <P>Having referred specifically by name to certain parts of Dublin, I have to state that the vast majority of the local people are disgusted with what is going on and want it dealt with urgently.  I have not named any area that has not been referred to publicly elsewhere as I do not wish to stigmatise any community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that there is an upsurge in drug abuse in this country which is now reaching epidemic proportions has been dealt with <Col N="1525" /> by the Minister for Justice as recently as 2 May 1991, as Deputy Gregory has said, in reply to parliamentary questions on the subject from Deputies Mitchell and Durkan and again last week on 6 June in my reply to Deputy Barrett.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to reiterate what the Minister for Justice has already said but it is important to make the following essential points.  This issue was discussed in depth with the Garda authorities.  They report that drug dealing activities are taking place in certain parts of Dublin and that there has been an increase in the level of seizures in recent years.  I think Deputy Gregory would agree with that. The Garda say, however, that there is no question of the problem being of the scale which existed some years ago.  The Garda authorities also say that they have no evidence of any significant increase in heroin abuse in Dublin city or elsewhere in the country and they point out that the drug problem in this country is predominantly that of cannabis abuse.</P>
      <P>Having said that the Garda are keenly aware that there are some heroin dealing activities associated with certain areas of Dublin.  Specific measures have been taken by the Garda to counteract such activities and have resulted in a considerable number of detections of drug related offences.  These measures are continuing and the Garda are monitoring the situation very closely.  I am aware that one of today's papers carries a report of drug abuse problems in Ballyfermot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are aware that there is a problem in this area in relation to cannabis and morphine tablet abuse.  The area is receiving every attention from the Garda and members of the Drug Squad are being specifically assigned to assist with the problem.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the measures being taken are proving successful in that since the beginning of this year 50 people have been arrested, 40 of whom have been charged in relation to drug offences in the Ballyfermot area.  The House can be <Col N="1526" /> assured that this problem is being taken very seriously indeed, and that whatever further action may be required to tackle the problems in these areas will be taken.</P>
    <P>Todays' <i>Evening Press</i> referred to the article in the current issue of <i>The Garda Review</i> which reported that 100 plain clothes gardaí have been removed from the streets and that this has decimated the surveillance capacity of the Drugs Squad in particular.  The Garda authorities have informed me that the members concerned were reassigned to plain clothes duties about ten days ago and are being used to saturate areas with crime problems, particularly drugs.  This is in addition to the other measures to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that there is no complacency in the attitude of the Government or of the Garda towards the drug problem.  Dealing with this problem remains a very high priority, and is continuing to receive every attention from a law enforcement point of view.  All members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drug misuse in their operational area.  In addition, specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and at present small specialist units are in operation in Dublin's north inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Similar specialist units are set up on a temporary basis in other areas as required.  The strategies employed include intelligence gathering and analysis, surveillance, targeting and monitoring the activities of suspects, as well as routine investigations.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that these resources for dealing with the problem are adequate.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, vitally important to ensure that illicit drugs cannot be easily smuggled into this country and for this reason the Garda maintain a high level of on-going liaison with Interpol and with police and customs authorities throughout Europe, including the UK authorities. There is, of course, also a need <Col N="1527" /> to develop and co-ordinate effective measures against drugs on an international level, and this problem is being addressed at a number of fora in which representatives of our Department are actively involved.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Spring on 22 May 1991, gave details of the compensatory measures which will be taken by law enforcement agencies in member states to combat drug trafficking arising from the removal of internal frontiers in the European Community at the end of 1991.  There is nothing I can usefully add to that reply.</P>
    <P>I would point out that on the legislative side both the Minister for Justice and I have announced plans which will make a major contribution towards the fight against drugs.  Very shortly legislation will be published to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and money laundering.  I have no doubt that this legislation will be widely welcomed.  However, I would emphasise what has already been said in this House, that law enforcement on its own will never solve the drugs problem. This is an area in which the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for our young people is at least important as the Garda response.</P>
    <P>The need for a national drug strategy has been recognised by the Government. My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, recently launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  As chairman of the National Coordinating Committee for Drug Abuse I was pleased that together with the committee we produced this very important report for the Government.  Our intention is to tackle the drug problem on every front.  Realistic and achievable objectives have been set for the reduction both in the supply and demand for drugs. Deputy Gregory has made a number of important statements and he seems to <Col N="1528" /> have a great deal of information.  I suggest that if the Deputy has this information he make it available to the Minister for Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In liaison with Interpol and the various international agencies we will see to it that this situation is curtailed.  I have made it quite clear that everything possible is being done to ensure that the problem of drug abuse is tackled effectively.  I hope we can co-operate to control this dreaded problem.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this very important issue.  I hope for a positive reply from the Minister. A committee have been working hard for a decade or more for the establishment of a swimming pool in Cavan town.  The raising of this matter tonight is not a begging bowl attempt to get funds.  I <Col N="1529" /> am calling on the Minister to make a commitment to the people of Cavan who have themselves made a very serious commitment to the establishment of a facility which is available in most other counties.  To that end the people of Cavan have contributed no less than £280,000 in local subscriptions.  This fund is in place awaiting the Minister's approval of a grant to allow works to start.</P>
      <P>The hard working and dedicated committee have met the Minister on a number of occasions.  On 1 February 1990 a deputation met the Minister.  He pointed out that commitments for the financial year 1990 had already been made for the refurbishment of pools which had been allowed to fall into disrepair through the lack of viligance of the managing committees.  He indicated that in 1991 he hoped grant aid would be available.  On 14 November 1990 this dedicated committee accompanied by the county manager and the secretary of Cavan County Council again met the Minister.  He lauded their efforts and was prepared to be photographed with them outside this House.  He clearly indicated that grant aid would be made available in the forthcoming budget.  Seven months later we have not heard from him.  This is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The people have made their contribution and they have given a further commitment, which has not been given by many other groups, that the pool when established will be self-financing.  Large numbers of people daily and weekly use pools in Navan, Monaghan and Enniskillen because the facility is not available in their own county.  These journeys are organised by community groups and teachers at considerable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not seem to be aware of County Cavan's geographical location.  I would point out that it is an inland county far removed from the sea. We depend on a swimming pool to provide us with a facility which is naturally available in coastal counties.  The least the committee can expect is a positive <Col N="1530" /> response in view of the efforts they have made.</P>

      <P>I am well aware that the Cavan Swimming Pool Committee have raised a considerable amount of money towards the cost of a pool.  The present arrangements for the financing of new swimming pools provided by local authorities allow for a grant of up to 80 per cent of the approved cost.  However, before approving any project, we must consider the overall availability of capital.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1 million from national lottery surplus has been provided in my Department's Vote for 1991 for the provision and refurbishment of swimming pools.  The bulk of this allocation will be required to fund existing commitments on the swimming pools programme, leaving very limited funds available for new works which could start later this year.  I can assure the Deputy that the Cavan swimming pool project will be treated as sympathetically as possible, having regard to the limited funds available and the competing demand for those funds from other local authorities.</P>

    <P>The county council have estimated the cost at £38,000, requiring 1,600 lineal <Col N="1531" /> metres of water mains.  Limerick County Council submitted the project to the Department of Environment in 1990 and 1991 under the small capital schemes heading.  To date the Department of the Environment have refused to sanction the grant.  I urgently request the Minister for the Environment to approve the finance for Limerick County Council to have this much needed work carried out.</P>

      <P>Under the 1991 small schemes programme, grants totalling £3.3 million were allocated for small schemes for the abatement of pollution and the improvement of water supplies. Grants of £154,000 were allocated to schemes in Limerick city and county.</P>
      <P>In all, proposals for 482 schemes costing £19.5 million were submitted by local authorities.  As a result, only high priority schemes could be considered for funding in the current year.  The scheme approved in County Limerick &mdash; the Adare water supply &mdash; was number one on the council's list.  The Ballyhinnaught scheme was number six.  The schemes approved in the city were also top of the corporation's list.  All of the funds available at present for small schemes have been allocated.  I regret that further grants cannot, therefore, be allocated at this stage.  It is open to the council to resubmit it for consideration next year.</P>
      <P>In regard to all these schemes we go by the priority list submitted by the local authority.  We have to accept the views of the local authority as expressed in a list they prepare.</P>

      <P>This is a serious part of the business of the House which I consider to be as important as any other.  It gives an opportunity to Deputies to air grievances which are of importance to them. I am sick and tired of coming into the House at this hour of the night to find that Ministers with other briefs are answering questions.  The Minister has a prepared reply, not knowing what I am going to say.  It is a charade which makes the whole contribution meaningless.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board have £6.5 million in outstanding bills to contractors in their area.  A number of suppliers have been in contact with me expressing concern that their companies have difficulties because of the board's failure to pay their liabilities.  I am concerned that some companies who are suppliers of the Southern Health Board will suffer because of the board's failure.  Companies both small and large and small contractors are awaiting payment of outstanding bills.  A problem has arisen because of the total failure of the Minister adequately to fund the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's operation is in a shambles. They cannot pay their creditors.  They have legal obligations towards the people in their area which they are not meeting. Essential equipment in some of our hospitals is breaking down.  I would ask the Minister to give an immediate cash injection of at least £4 million to the Southern Health Board so that they can meet their obligations to their suppliers and the people they are supposed to give an adequate health service to.  They are failing in their obligations on all counts <Col N="1533" /> at present.  Even though the Minister met the chairman and chief executive of the board recently he has failed on a number of occasions to meet the elected members, and I regret that very much.  I would ask the Minister to immediately intervene to save companies in the area from potential job losses.</P>

As I have pointed out recently in this House the timing of issue of creditor's payments is then a matter for each individual board to decide.  The amount outstanding to creditors on any particular date is related to the timing of payments rather than indicating financial performance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has drawn the conclusion that a given level of held cheques represents a shortfall in the Southern Health Board's allocation.  I can only reiterate the commitments given by the Minister on 26 February last when he clearly stated the Government's position on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> The services in the current year will be maintained at not less than the 1990 approved levels.  To this end we have undertaken that costs of certain demand-led schemes will be identified in a separate subhead, relieving the boards of the need to make savings elsewhere should the schemes run over budget.  In addition, we are well down the road in supporting health boards and other agencies in implementing an enhanced value for money programme.  I regret that Deputy Allen left the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of the proposed sale of Merlin Park Hospital and lands was first floated at a Western Health Board meeting in December by Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, a member of the board.  I opposed it then and I oppose it now.  At a recent meeting of the health board a proposal to sell 74 acres of the grounds of Merlin Park was carried.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, visited Galway on 31 May and in an interview with Galway Bay FM said that Merlin Park Hospital would close eventually. Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, said that this was nonsense and that the hospital would not close.  Now, however, we have the first step in the move to sell Merlin Park Hospital and lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have news for the Minister and for Deputy Fahey.  No way will the people of Galway stand for this.  It was fortunate that this draft proposal was brought up during the local election campaign because candidates from all parties are getting the message at the doors: &ldquo;hands off the hospital units and grounds at Merlin Park.&rdquo;  So clear is the message in Galway that at a meeting of the Galway Borough Council last night there was unanimous support for a proposal to stop any attempt by the Western Health Board or the Minister to sell any part of the hospital or the 130 acres of the grounds of Merlin Park.  The motion last night was strongly supported by the <Col N="1535" /> Government party members of the council. Fortunately for us and for the people of Galway city and county the beautiful woodlands of Merlin Park are zoned open space and amenity in the recently adopted city development plan.  I can tell the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to forget this proposal to sell off this asset because this council or whoever is elected to the new borough council, will resist on behalf of the people of Galway any attempt to rezone this land for any other purpose except its current use.  It would be like selling off part of the Phoenix Park to sell off Merlin Park Hospital.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Health and the Western Health Board to show their concern by reopening the closed units in Merlin Park and bringing onstream again the 200 hospital beds lost there in the past three years thus alleviating the overcrowding and waiting lists at the university hospital in Galway.</P>
    <P>While I welcome Minister Connolly here, I very much regret the fact that Deputy Fahey, the Minister from the constituency, was unable to come into the Dáil tonight despite being able to go on Galway Bay FM today to speak about the motion I was bringing up here tonight.  I regret very much that he is not in the House now to hear the contribution I had to make as he is floating this idea of selling the lands at Merlin Park.  I can tell Deputy Fahey, if he is listening to this, that he will not get away with this because neither I nor the people of Galway will so allow him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter.  University College Hospital, Galway, is an extremely busy hospital providing acute hospital care to a large catchment area within the Western Health Board area.  I am particularly conscious of the exceptional demand for services which the hospital has been experiencing in recent months and I am anxious to do what I can to relieve the <Col N="1536" /> pressure on ward accommodation and back-up facilities as quickly a possible. The Western Health Board have recently made a number of proposals for improvement of ward accommodation, additional theatres, improved accident and emergency facilities and additional X-Ray requirements which they propose to finance through sale of land at Merlin Park.</P>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the board for the imaginative and resourceful manner in which they have approached the problem. During a recent visit to Galway I proposed, subject to the agreement of the board, the setting up of a joint working group of officers of the board and of my Department to examine the priority requirements at the hospital; to outline ways in which these requirements can be financed and to ensure that the developments proposed for the short and medium term will not jeopardise the long term development plans for the hospital.  My intention was that the group should convene immediately and report to me as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I am expecting a formal response from the board within the next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A new pilot project for the care of the elderly in County Mayo is in grave danger of collapse because the Western Health Board has only been allocated enough money by the Minister for Health to pay £25 per week towards each patient's maintenance.</P>
      <P>The new scheme is known as the boarding out scheme but should in fact be properly titled the boarding in scheme.  Under the scheme 60 elderly pensioners in County Mayo live in family situations with non-relatives.  The patients themselves contribute £40 each week from their old age pensions and the Western Health Board contributes £25 each.  The Western Health Board has not increased its subvention since January 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is a perfectly good scheme. I know four of the ladies who operate it.  They are conscientious and extremely caring.  They give a special quality of care <Col N="1537" /> which has a distinctive human and personal touch which one cannot get or indeed be expected to receive in welfare homes because of the high staff/patient ratio.  I have also spoken to some of the elderly residents who benefit from the scheme.  They value the feeling of family they enjoy in being integrated into domestic households for 7 days each week.</P>
    <P>To keep an elderly person in a health board welfare home costs a minimum of £200 per week.  Yet this scheme which caters for 60 patients, all of whom would be in the Sacred Heart Home, Castlebar or one of the welfare homes is supposed to operate on a mere £2.30 per day from the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>These ladies who operate the scheme are supposed to cook, wash, provide heat, transport to the doctor and other necessities for a mere pittance.  It simply cannot be done and I do not blame the individuals in question who have now decided because of economic reasons they simply cannot carry on with the scheme.  Unfortunately, the only option open for the elderly patients in such cases is to go into the already overcrowded homes run by the health board at a cost of £200 per week.</P>
    <P>It is a shortsighted, socially regressive and economically daft measure.  The Minister has the embryo of a good nationwide scheme but if people start pulling out from the scheme at pilot project stage then irreparable damage will be done to the concept.  There is no use in the Minister giving the House the pat reply that the Western Health Board gets its budget and has discretion as to how it allocates it.  The Western Health Board is literally on its uppers.  This week the female surgical ward in the new £15 million hospital in Castlebar is closed because of cutbacks. The gynaecological section closes next week.  The Western Health Board has not got the money.  It should get the money.  Otherwise the scheme will collapse.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion, without any disrespect to the Minister of State &mdash; and <Col N="1538" /> we cherish his versatility in this House &mdash; this slot here has been rostered for six weeks, and if the Minister could not be here the Minister of State at the Department of Health should have been here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Higgins, at present in the Western Health Board a boarding out scheme is operated in each of its three counties.  A full assessment is carried out on each patient and a careful assessment is carried out on each carer by the Geriatric Assessment Committee. This committee are multi-disciplinary. A public health nurse inspects the household prior to a placement and the fire officer and the Environment health officer also inspect the premises. Patients are placed for social reasons, for example, living in isolated areas, bad housing, lack of transport.</P>
      <P>Seventy three elderly people are in the scheme at present.  The public health nurse visits the household once a month and a senior public health nurse visits approximately every six months.  A grant of £25 per week is paid per patient to the carer.  In addition, it is recommended by the health board that the person being boarded out pays the carer half the OAP per week.  Therefore, the carer is receiving £53 in respect of each elderly person.</P>
      <P>The carers must arrange their own insurance cover; they may administer drugs under the supervision of a public health nurse.  Only single storey buildings are used in the scheme.  The health board guarantee to take back the person if their health or mental state deteriorates so that boarding out is no longer suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no regulations governing boarding out at present and the current arrangements have been developed by each health board to meet local situations. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, has provided for a scheme of boarding out.  Regulations under the Act will be made later this year which will: govern the standards of accommodation, care and welfare of people being boarded <Col N="1539" /> out; govern the amount of the contribution to the costs involved by the health board; provide for inspections and interviews with the persons being boarded out and any staff; and provide for the numbers to be accommodated in any household.  These regulations will harmonise the approach by the various health boards to the option of boarding out.</P>
    <P>The regulations will provide that the grant payable by a health board in respect of each person being boarded out shall be <Col N="1540" /> a sum not exceeding half of the maximum single rate of non-contributory old age pension.  At the new 1991 rates this would permit an increase of approximately £3 per week and further increases when social welfare rates are revised.  As stated earlier, this grant is in addition to the agreed sum paid by the elderly person to the householder.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board are happy with the scheme and plan to expand it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 June 1991.</P>

      <P>The rate support grant had its basis in the income from rates formerly applicable to dwellings and agricultural land and the amounts formerly paid in lieu of rates on Government property. That income varied from local authority to local authority, because of differences in valuation levels and in the rate poundages applied over the years.  The provision for the rate support grant in my Department's Vote for 1991 is £168.75 million.  This represents an increase of £6 million, or 3.7 per cent on the 1990 grant.

      <P>The Leixlip-Maynooth-Kilcock by-pass is scheduled to commence in 1991 at an estimated cost of £50 million, 1989 prices.  The by-pass will be 17.6 km in length and will involve the construction of 11 bridges.  There will be bridges at Courtown Road, Laragh Road, Threadstown Road, Rathcoffey Road, Celbridge Road and Leixlip Road; in addition there will be interchanges west of Lucan and at the Straffan Road, an accommodation bridge at Castletown, a pedestrian bridge at Cooldrinagh and a bridge over the Liffey.</P>
      <P>The work will be undertaken in two main civil engineering contracts.  One of these involves the Liffey bridge at Leixlip together with 5 km of road.  It is expected that tenders will be invited for this contract in September 1991 with work scheduled to commence in March 1992.  The second contract, which involves the balance of the civil engineering work, has been advertised and the closing date for the receipt of tenders was yesterday.  Subject to the evaluation of the tenders received, work on this contract is expected to commence next September. The work project is expected to be completed in early 1995.</P>

    <P>As stated in the plan for social housing, the full operation of the shared ownership system requires new legislation which is being prepared urgently.

I have authorised these authorities to complete 1,000 shared ownership transactions as part of that programme and each of them should now be in a position to deal with applications within their authorised number of transactions.  A high level of interest has been shown in this innovative form of tenure which will help those on lower incomes to achieve full home ownership in stages.</P>

Since then, I have again urged on housing authorities the need for a more <Col N="1363" /> determined effort in relation to this matter.  Housing authorities were directed to make, in conjunction with their latest assessment of housing needs, which includes the needs of travellers for houses, an assessment of the need for the provision of serviced halting sites at 31 March 1991.  The authorities have also been instructed that, as soon as these assessments have been completed, they should, as a matter of high priority, draw up clearly defined sets of proposals to meet the indentified needs.</P>
      <P>To ensure better monitoring of the overall accommodation programme, a system of quarterly reports on progress in the provision of accommodation for travellers has been instituted.</P>
      <P>Funding for the provision by local authorities of serviced caravan parks for travellers has been readily available.  The allocation for 1991 is £3 million and this level of assistance will be maintained and, if necessary, increased in the future.</P>
      <P>About 60 social workers are employed by local authorities and certain other bodies in connection with the accommodation of travellers.

      <P>I am aware of reports that cement sales have declined in the first quarter of this year.  However, the volume of cement sales is only one of a number of indicators of the level of construction activity.  My Department's own review of output in 1990 and the outlook for 1991 will be completed shortly and I am not prepared to speculate on the situation in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has highlighted a number of measures which will continue to stimulate activity in the construction sector. While it acknowledges that the principal vehicle for growth will continue to be the private sector, it also refers to major public investment programmes which have major significance for growth in the industry, including the operational programme on peripherality and the urban renewal scheme.  In this regard, I might mention that the 1991 public capital programme provisions affecting the construction industry are increased by 8.5 per cent over the out-turn for 1990.  The plan for social housing which I announced in February 1991 also contains a range of measures which will have the effect of boosting housing output.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for the years 1982/83 to 1986/87 the taxpayer was assessable to benefit-in-kind in the amount of £750 per annum for the use of a patrol car in his employment as a Fisheries Officer with the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>The exemption of the taxpayer from benefit-in-kind was negotiated and agreed during the income tax year 1990/91.  The treatment of back years is governed by the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  In circumstances such as this, the Income Tax Act, 1967, allows for a revision of the liability for the five preceding years only.  The only year in this period for which benefit-in-kind had been assessed on the taxpayer was 1985/86.  When this year was reviewed an overpayment of £262.50 arose.  This was offset against an underpayment of £105.10 for 1981/82 to 1984/85 and the balance was repaid on 27 May 1991.</P>

The assessments were not delivered because of an incorrect address.  Investigations to find the correct address established that a person of the same name lived at the address given in the question.  It is normal procedure for this type of information to be thoroughly investigated before being used in assessing tax.</P>

      <P>Some annuities on the land in question have already been reduced by 35 per cent and because of this the Land Commission have incurred a sizeable loss between the purchase and allotment prices of the land.  In the circumstances it is unlikely that any further reductions could be granted.  Nevertheless I am arranging for the annuities on the land to be reviewed.</P>

    <P>I am pleased to let the Deputy know that the number of patients on the waiting list for hip replacement surgery has decreased by nearly 14 per cent since July 1990.</P>
    <P>I should point out that these figures include both public and non-public patients treated in public hospitals.  Up to now, hospitals did not distinguish between public and non-public patients in maintaining waiting lists for hip replacement surgery and, therefore, it is not possible to give a breakdown as between the two categories.  With the revised eligibility arrangements, hospitals will, in future, be required to maintain separate waiting lists for public and private patients.</P>
    <P>Waiting times for hip replacement surgery vary from centre to centre and depending on the priority accorded to a particular case.  For these reasons, it is <Col N="1402" /> not possible to give a national average waiting time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>Holy Family school is a special national school for handicapped children recognised by my Department.  As such, my Department's responsibilities in respect of the school are similar to those attaching to any other school of this nature and relate to issues of management, staffing and funding.  The school operates under the normal board of management arrangement, the chairman of which is a member of the Brothers of Charity.  The school also benefits from the wider support services provided by the Brothers of Charity to handicapped children in the Galway area generally.</P>
      <P>The grants paid by my Department towards the operating costs of the school in the years in question were as follows: 1987, £158,000; 1988, £165,000; 1989, £179,000; and 1990, £183,000.  Enrolments at the school have declined rapidly in recent years and indications are that this trend is set to continue.  It appeared also that there were wider needs for children with special educational needs in the Galway area.</P>
      <P>In order to examine urgently both these wider needs and the specific position at Holy Family school in a co-ordinated way, a project team was established in March of this year comprising the relevant departmental inspectors and specialists in the field of special education, training and assessment in the Galway area.</P>
      <P>The findings of this group are at present being considered by my Department in conjunction with the relevant parties in the Galway area.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate to make further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 to 160, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Coláiste Móibhí consists of two leaving certificate classes attached to the Church of Ireland College of Education.  They replace the preparatory college of the same name which was closed in 1968 by my Department in consultation with the college authorities.  There were, and are, no statutes governing either the former preparatory colleges or the colleges of education; the latter operate under the rules for national schools.</P>
      <P>Because of this, matters pertaining to teacher training were formerly dealt with by my Department's primary branch. Following recent internal reorganisation, the colleges of education, including the juniorate known as Coláiste Móibhí which is administered as part of the Church of Ireland College of Education, now come under the remit of the third level section of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Church of Ireland College of Education, Coláiste Móibhí caters only for Protestant students and was established to assist in ensuring an <Col N="1411" /> adequate supply of teachers for service in non-Catholic primary schools.  There are currently 21 students in attendance, with a staff of three full-time teachers, and 12 part-timers, five of whom also lecture in the Church of Ireland College of Education.  Eight graduates of Coláiste Móibhí entered the Church of Ireland College of Education as a result of the 1990 open competition for school leavers.</P>
    <P>Coláiste Móibhí is a fee-paying boarding school, which provides a two-year leaving certificate course.  My Department have not approved a three-year course, nor is such a course in operation; occasionally a student may repeat a year if this is considered necessary.</P>
    <P>The future operation of Coláiste Móibhí is at present under discussion between my Department and the college authorities.</P>

      <P>In common with all major school building projects the proposed extension for Longwood vocational school has been reviewed on a regular basis in the context of demographic trends and projected short and long term enrolments.  The principal findings of the most recent review carried out by my Department in this regard are: (a) that there has been a substantial decline in enrolments at Longwood vocational school since 1980 &mdash; the present enrolment being 167 compared to 216 in 1982 (-23 per cent), (b) that the number of pupils leaving primary schools in the area in the short term, i.e., up to and including 1998, is expected to drop by 28 per cent, and (c) that birth statistics for County Meath for the period 1980-89 show a 30 per cent decline.</P>
      <P>In the light of these statistics my Department are considering what provisions should be made for the pupils of Longwood vocational school in the future.  Pending a decision in this regard it is not possible to give precise details such as a time scale for development at the school.</P>

      <P>Following his discharge from the Permanent Defence Force in 1987, the person concerned applied for a wound pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of an injury which he received while serving overseas with a United Nations Force.  His application was referred to the Army Pensions Board, which are the statutory body appointed under those Acts to investigate and report on such applications.  The board reported that, while the person was suffering from a disablement due to an injury attributable <Col N="1416" /> to his service, the degree of his disablement did not reach the required minimum of 20 per cent to qualify for a pension.  He was, however, awarded a gratuity in respect of his disablement, payment of which was made to him in April 1988.</P>
      <P>In September 1989, this person made a further application for a disability pension in respect of a number of medical conditions which he attributed to his overseas service with a United Nations Force.  However, the Army Pensions Board reported that none of the conditions was so attributable.  Consequently, he is not eligible for the award of a disability pension.</P>
