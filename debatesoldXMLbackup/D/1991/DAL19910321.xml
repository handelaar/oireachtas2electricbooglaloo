It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that business shall be interrupted at 7 p.m.; No. 9 shall be decided without debate; Nos. 10 and 11 shall be taken together for the purpose of debate and speakers shall be confined to five minutes each and the debate shall not exceed 30 minutes; the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 15, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare; and the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>I want to put on record that the 30 minutes time allocated to debate these matters is inadequate. May I also say I have only just received a copy of the Government's programme and it hardly leaves us time to consider our approach to the issues that the Government are proposing to deal with today.  Yesterday I received an amended copy of the Order of Business as I entered the Chamber.  I wonder if the Taoiseach could arrange for the Government Whip to try to get the Order of Business to us a bit earlier.</P>

      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's response and, indeed, the widespread concern about the implications of the Law Reform Commission's report, will the Taoiseach make time available in the coming session of the Dáil for a debate in this House and then, perhaps, we can make a response to the Law Reform Commission as suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not think that would be very productive.  What the Law Reform Commission envisage is that the consultation documents would now be available for discussion and that all those who are interested will make submissions in regard to it.  Then the Law Reform Commission will hold a seminar and only then will they come up with their final conclusions.  To hold a debate in this House at this stage would be premature.</P>

      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, I seek your guidance on a matter.  Earlier this month I put a question down to the Minister for Education about the health and well-being of the aminals in Dublin Zoo.  The reply was to the effect that this was not the responsibility if the Minister for Education.  I then put a question down to the Taoiseach.  I asked him if he would outline who has responsibility for the health and well-being of animals in the Dublin Zoo.  The answer I got was that it was not the responsibility of the Taoiseach. So, it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Education or of the Taoiseach. Would someone please tell me who is responsible for the health and well-being of the animals in Dublin Zoo?</P>

      <P>On a different matter, Sir, I want to ask the Taoiseach his intentions in regard to the appointment of a foreign affairs committee and a crime committee in view of the fact that on a previous occasion he suggested this matter might be pursued by negotiations through the Whips and that a letter I had written to him on the subject would be discussed in the forum?  Is the Taoiseach aware that is Minister of State has indicated that he cannot in fact deal with the matter because he has no instructions from the Taoiseach as to how to deal with it?  Would the Taoiseach agree that this is a matter that should be dealt with in good faith between the parties, and that if the Taoiseach suggests that that channel <Col N="1826" /> should be used that it should be capable of being used?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, without disrespect either to the Taoiseach or to the Minister of State for whom I have the utmost admiration, that I have heard this sort of thing before from the Taoiseach. He has told us on occasions like this that he intends to take a personal interest in the matter.  Could I have an indication from the Taoiseach as to whether we will have a decision on this matter before the end of this week, in other words, before the Easter recess?  Would the Taoiseach be prepared to discuss the matter, with me if necessary, in order to bring it to a conclusion before the end of this week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the following be adopted in substitution for Standing Order 30 of the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business&mdash;</P>
      <P>30.  (1) Leave to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration may be sought on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on which the Dáil sits if a member gives notice in writing to the Ceann Comhairle not less than 45 minutes before the opening of the sitting. Such notice shall state the matter which the member seeks to raise and may refer to the merits of or reasons for raising the matter in a manner which the Ceann Comhairle considers to be brief and concise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the Ceann Comhairle is satisfied that the notice complies with the requirements of this <Col N="1832" /> Standing Order, the member shall be called upon by the Ceann Comhairle at the commencement of Public Business, whereupon the member shall rise in his place and state that he requests leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration and shall state the notice given but may not elaborate thereon.</P>
    <P>(3)  If the Ceann Comhairle considers the motion to be one contemplated by this Standing Order, he shall thereupon desire the members who support the request to rise in their places.  If not less than twelve members rise accordingly, he shall give leave to make the motion, which shall be moved at 7 p.m. on a Tuesday or Wednesday, or 3.30 p.m. on a Thursday, or at such hour on the day on which the request is made as the Dáil may appoint.</P>
    <P>(4)  A matter submitted in pursuance of this Standing Order which fails to obtain the requisite support cannot during the following six months be again brought forward under this Standing Order.</P>
    <P>Motion 10 proposes amendments to Standing Order 30 in the light of difficulties which have been encountered on the Order of Business with the present operation of the Standing Order and the frequency with which this Standing Order has been invoked recently.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that this Standing Order is reserved for specific and important matters of public interest requiring urgent consideration and that this Standing Order was never intended as a mechanism for raising topical or current matters.  The rulings of the Chair under this Standing Order in the past have been carefully and consistently applied, as the statistics show.  Of the 50 requests made under this Standing Order since 1973, only five were successful, 32 have been made in the last two years and 11 in the last two months alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1833" /> In considering amendments to the operation of the Standing Order, detailed consideration between all parties took place both at the Working Group on Dáil Reform and at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The motion now before the House reflects the agreed outcome of these detailed discussions.</P>
    <P>The amendments submitted and circulated by The Workers' Party last night have been tabled at the last minute and too late to afford an opportunity for consideration by the working group and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Therefore, they are not acceptable in the light of the consensus already reached. Furthermore the proposal to allow one minute to state the notice given could lead to every application under this Standing Order lasting one minute and, therefore, a number of one minute statements on the Order of Business which is not intended in this amendment.  Indeed, I might mention that the original version of the motion has already been amended to include a proposal by The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on Dáil Reform, who meet on a regular basis and are currently examining other areas of Dáil reform, have given very detailed consideration to this matter.  The group have always striven to achieve unanimity in their proposals.  It is regretted that on this occasion we have two amendments tabled to a motion arising from detailed discussions by the group.</P>
    <P>I must re-emphasise that this Standing Order was introduced to cater for specific and important matters requiring urgent consideration and that the House must guard against its misuse.  The motion now proposed is designed to do this; while providing for the more orderly operation of the Standing Order it retains and protects its underlying principle.  It is hoped that opposition parties will respect this.</P>
    <P>In relation to Motion No. 11, the Government have endeavoured to meet the requests of the Opposition parties by, first, introducing a new statements procedure in grievance time.  The procedure has been under-utilised to date and the Government have examined ways in <Col N="1834" /> which changes could be made to meet the wishes of Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>This motion proposes amendments to the statements procedure by extending the total time allowed to members from 15 to 20 minutes and by extending the time for raising each matter from one to two minutes.  In addition, the Minister will now give an immediate response to each matter raised, thereby replacing the composite reply procedure which applied heretofore.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Members that this Government have extended the time allowed for adjournment debates to 50 minutes and increased the number of matters which may be raised to eight.  It is to be hoped that this response by the Government in providing additional time and facilitating Opposition parties by amending the procedure will be recognised and fully utilised by the Opposition parties, as was the original intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Any change that will improve the Standing Orders is welcome, but at the very top of the political agenda of all the items needing to be addressed, is that of parliamentary reform.  This Parliament has become something of a joke. It is impossible for Members to raise issues urgently.  In this respect I have to say that, over the years, one Government have been as bad as another.  Whereas the Government are effectively no more than a committee of this House, this House, instead of having the Government accountable to it, has become accountable to the Government and to government more widely.</P>
      <P>It is the considered view within the public service that this House is a nuisance, that somehow this House should be circumvented at every turn, that the first thing one should do when a Deputy asks a question is to seek to find some reason that one's Minister does not have to answer the question, to seek to circumvent Members' rights to come into this House and ask questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already the televising of Parliament clearly illustrates that this is a stuffy, staid House where it is practically impossible to raise urgent matters without giving all <Col N="1835" /> sorts of notice or having rulings on the notice given.  It appears that in other parliaments members can rise, ask questions, when a series of Ministers are there, prepared and briefed on the issues of the day and can reply.  That does not apply in this Parliament, not merely in the case of the present Government but it has not applied for some considerable time.  The whole question of the constitutional accountability of the Government to the Dáil specifically provided for is being circumvented by the way this House has tied itself up in knots.</P>
    <P>I particularly regret that the <i>sub judice</i> precedent is now being used even when matters are not <i>sub judice</i>.  For example, if a Garda investigation has begun in the case of somebody having referred a file to the Garda, that is now considered to be <i>sub judice;</i> everybody has rights; the Garda have rights; civil servants have rights; the Government have rights but, increasingly, this House has lost its rights. We have responsibilities but no authority.</P>
    <P>The latest national agreement, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> agreed with the social partners &mdash; comprising trade unions, business people and civil servants &mdash; decide on issues proper to this House &mdash; I cannot understand why an issue such as condoms should fall within the ambit of such a programme; however, I will not raise that here this morning.  It is not proper to the <i>programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Yet they decide to make recommendations on such issues while we cannot discuss them in this House. Increasingly the agenda on politics is being set out by the media.  Legislation is being enacted as much by judges as it is by this House.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with the serious problems facing this country &mdash; on which by and large, there is cross-party agreement, we must do so collectively.  For instance, in the Committee of Public Accounts we can work as a team and reach agreement by a uniformity of approach.  I contend that across this House probably there is a consensus on the major issues facing <Col N="1836" /> this country and on how they might be tackled, but we never get together to deal with them because we are all isolated in little blocks.  The formal, stuffy procedures of this House prevent Deputies from coming to terms with the important issues, as we see them, those of unemployment, emigration and the various other areas of legislation needing to be updated.</P>
    <P>We still do not have legislation to update the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General which date from 1986.  These changes, minuscule as they are, are at least a few inches in one direction in that they may assist in giving us more time for debate.  The whole stuffy control of what Members say in this House has gone beyond acceptability.  It is becoming increasingly irrelevant to raise matters in this House. I ask the Minister of State, who is the Government Chief Whip and who has a major role to play in this, to take a major step forward. I suggest that this House agree that the Ceann Comhairle call a Speakers conference which would report to this House, completely independent of any party here, on what needs to be done to update and modernise the powers of this House before we become a complete laughing stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the two amendments to Standing Orders.  Sometimes people are put off by a procedural debate. It is probably true that many Members would be unfamiliar with the Standing Orders of the House.  If I referred to <Col N="1837" /> Standing Order 30 or Standing Order 20 members would not instantly recognise them.  One of the positive effects of being a party Whip is that one becomes familiar with the mechanics that govern the House.  I share very strongly the view expressed by Deputy Mitchell that increasingly &mdash; I am not sure if it was ever much better &mdash; the rights and the level of input into real decision-making of the individual Deputy is being eroded in this House.  Increasingly programmes, whether in relation to the economy, foreign affairs or any other issue, are presented as a <i>fait accompli</i> to this House and Members have a very limited scope to amend or change them.  Even in relation to primary legislation that comes before this House one is dependent on the attitude of the Minister who is guiding the particular Bill, as to whether any amendment can be adopted.  Although the Opposition win the argument in this House when the division bells ring and if we have a Minister who is unwilling to concede ground for some peculiar reason such as that it would somehow be a sign of weakness, the Government have the bodies to vote through legislation.</P>
      <P>On the general principles there is a fundamental need to have a root and branch look at national Government and national Government reform here in the same way that the Government have promised to look at local government.</P>
      <P>The specifics of the motions before us arise from changes that have begun to take place in this House.  A very significant change was the introduction of television.  I was very privileged to be on the working group on broadcasting the Dáil.  That has already brought a breath of fresh air into these Houses and has made all of us reassess how we do our business here.  That will increase and steadily the relevance of this House can be drawn back to us, the elected Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motions before us do not go far enough.  I was very upset at and resisted the proposals when they first emerged because I saw them as an attempt by Government to limit the scope of individual Members, particular to raise <Col N="1838" /> matters on the floor of the House.  I acknowledge the positive attitude of the Minister of State who did not, although he had the numerical strength, force them through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Instead he referred them back to the Committee on Dáil Reform and accepted a number of significant amendments that made it more acceptable to the Opposition benches. We had a number of meetings about these two motions and for that reason I do not intend to oppose them.  I am not satisfied with them but, at least, the attitude of the Government calling all the shots and bullying their way through the Standing Orders of this House has not taken place and for that I accept the small step forward that these resolutions encompass and I hope for greater things as Dáil reform takes on apace.</P>
    <P>The grievance time procedure has not worked.  I hope the minor amendments we are making will improve it.  Further amendments were suggested and rejected by the Government which would make it more relevant still.  I am hopeful that in the fulness of time they too will be taken on board.  I welcome the fact that the number of issues to be raised on the Adjournment Debates has increased to three per day.  That debate gives us the opportunity to make the House more relevant.  Increasingly local radio are looking into the procedures of this House and wish to take slots of the business of this House to broadcast to the local area. Issues that are not national in the sense of being relevant to every Member of this House can be addressed on Adjournment Debates.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's attitude is that we want substantial change in this area.  We hope this is only a first step and we will not obstruct the Minister in taking one step but will positively encourage him to go a long way further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I express some concern at what I perceive to be an urge or a drive within the Government to tidy up what they see as untidy events surrounding the Order of Business.  I can <Col N="1839" /> well understand the Government's reluctance to be seen to be under pressure on the Order of Business but it is unethical and unfair of the Government to attempt to restrict &mdash; as they have been doing &mdash; the efforts of Opposition Deputies to raise matters of concern on the Order of Business.  The fact that the Minister can point out that since 1973 only 50 or so requests have been made for Standing Order 30 debates or adjournments is an indication in itself that up to recently that particular procedure was not in any way abused.  He points out that in the last two months 11 such requests were made.  That is precisely because of the increased restrictions on the rights of Deputies in this House on the Order of Business, the tightening of the way in which Deputies can raise matters.  We are pushed back into using the devices which are available to us under Standing Orders and the response of the Government is to come forward with proposals that they will now restrict Standing Order 30 applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see an unhealthy urge and drive in the Government in relation to Dáil reform. There was a specific promise in the Programme for Government in 1989 that the Government would introduce a programme of Dáil reform.  Yet, since July, since the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been sitting &mdash; the Minister of State, who represents the Government on that Committee, has adamantly refused to produce any programme of reform for the Dáil. The sub-committee have been dealing with important but, nevertheless, minor aspects of the orders of this House in an attempt to restrict the options open to Deputies.  Any leeway given has been given at the tail end of the night, any reform of times has been of Opposition time, not of Government time.  The Government have not weakened in any sense in relation to giving additional time to the Opposition parties out of the traditional Government time allowed in this House.  I see a very strong drive from the Government not to give greater powers to the Opposition but to restrict their <Col N="1840" /> powers and their rights to raise issues in this House.</P>
    <P>I have put down two amendments to the proposals and I make no apology whatsoever to the Minister of State for doing so.  The Workers' Party Whip notified the Minister of State a week ago that we had two amendments and he requested the Minister of State to defer consideration of these proposals until such time as the sub-committee had an opportunity to discuss those amendments and the Minister refused to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had already agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot come in here and complain that he did not get adequate notice of these amendments.  I would also make the point that the most important amendment is No. 1 which seeks to enable Standing Order 30 requests to be taken any day the Dáil is sitting.  As the order stands and as the proposed amendment reads, they may only be taken on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  In recent years this House has frequently sat on a Friday.  There was a major controversy here last year when we sought to adjourn the House on a Friday to discuss a very important matter.  This was ruled out of order because it was not specifically stated in Standing Order 30 that Fridays were days on which the Dáil sat.</P>
      <P>We are simply seeking to delete the reference to &ldquo;a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;any day&rdquo; on which the Dáil sits, in other words, that it would be in order to make a request under Standing Order 30 any day the Dáil sits.  The Ceann Comhairle will still have the power to refuse it in line with the criteria which have been established over time, but it is important that we have this right to make the request in respect of urgent and important matters any day the Dáil sits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to come down off the fence and present the programme of Dáil reform which the Government promised in 1989.  They should not be fiddling around with minor <Col N="1841" /> changes here and there and pretending that action is being taken to make this House more relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the greatest complaints which can be made about the manner in which this House operates is that it is effectively a throw-back to Irish colonial times.  This House is modelled on the Westminster Parliament as it functioned in or around 1920.  However, while that Parliament has radically changed since 1920 there have only been minuscule changes in the approach adopted by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Since Fianna Fáil came into Government in 1987 and again under the Coalition arrangement with the Progressive Democrats we have gone backwards rather than forwards in Dáil reform.  A number of the Dáil committees established during the 1981-82 period have not been re-established and the Government have effectively blocked their being set up.  There is also the farce that this Parliament is the only Parliament within the European Community which does not yet have a committee on foreign affairs. Again this morning we had the Taoiseach effectively kicking to touch on this issue. We should have a committee on foreign affairs.  The need for such a committee can be seen from the volatile international atmosphere which has been in place over the past 12 months.  We should not be debating international issues which impinge on Irish foreign policy weeks after events have occurred and weeks after this country can make any impact on them.</P>
      <P>We do not yet have a crime committee. This Parliament had a crime committee during the 1982-87 period.  We have a growing crime problem.  This is a particular problem in our cities.  Yet we do not have a specialist committee to deal with the whole criminal justice area.  We need a series of committees which the Government are refusig to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a new system to deal with Private Members' Bills.  It is extraordinary that during the past 32 years only one Private Members' Bill, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, <Col N="1842" /> has been enacted by the Oireachtas. Hopefully, the Recognition of Foreign Adoptions Bill will be the second such Bill.</P>
    <P>People outside this House want to see TDs acting as legislators.  It should be an acceptable part of the parliamentary system that members of the Dáil, be they Government back benchers or members of the Opposition parties, be allowed and encouraged to bring legislation of a constructive nature before this House to tackle issues which the Government have neither the time nor, on occasion, the commitment to tackle.  There should be regular Friday sittings of this House for the purpose of processing Private Members' Bills.  This should be part of the normal business of this House.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a different system of putting down questions to the Taoiseach so that urgent current issues can be raised without the Taoiseach having to be given, in effect, a week's notice in advance of questions being tabled.  No other members of Parliament in Europe are so constrained in questioning the Government of the day on issues of immediate and vital concern.</P>
    <P>Many areas of reform are not being tackled.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme promised substantial parliamentary reform.  However, this reform is being blocked by the Fianna Fáil Party.  No reasonable explanation has been offered to this House as to why the reforms all of us on this side want to see have not been brought before the House.  In effect, a stonewalling operation is being carried out.  While I welcome the reforms being introduced today, they are only miniscule in the context of the overall operation of this House.</P>
    <P>There are also other problems in the operation of this House.  I have considerable reservations about the manner in which RTE are approaching both the televising and broadcasting of the Dáil. It is outrageous that Century Radio and the other independent radio stations do not seem to currently have available to them the facility of rebroadcasting the proceedings within this House, or if they <Col N="1843" /> have those facilities available to them they are not using them.  RTE who had a monopoly on sound broadcasting for some years manage to broadcast only one or one and a half minutes of what happens in the Dáil on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and rarely give any accurate picture of what has taken place.  The televising of the Dáil is going through teething problems also.  I hope that far greater use will be made by RTE and the other broadcasting media of the proceedings of this House so that the general public will be more aware of the work being done and put pressure on the Government to reform the antediluvian and anachronistic procedures we apply.  We need a more modern parliamentary system to tackle the problems of a modern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to be of assistance to you, a Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="1844" /> so I will be very brief.  I want to make a few relevant remarks.</P>
      <P>I do not think it can be stated loudly enough that the procedures in this House are not the only matters which need to be reformed.  The arrangements for the ordering of business are outrageously antiquated.  We are just past the age of the typewriter &mdash; I recall the long delay in introducing computer facilities.  The National Board for Science and Technology prepared a report on bringing this House into the modern age in relation to communications, including the use of computers, information systems and the processing of information.  That report was allowed to die.  I think what happens is that in an atmosphere where parliament and parliamentarians are under attack daily they lose respect and lose their nerve in not asking for better facilities in which wo do their business.  There are of course a further range of problems feeding into the problems of the reform of parliamentary time.  I will not take up the time of the House discussing these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take this Parliament as a Westminster-model Parliament, it suffers from the same defect as the British Parliament, that is Cabinet dominance.  The people who govern this House are the Cabinet and they enjoy a unique monopoly in the drafting of legislation in a particular relationship with the public service which excludes any access by the Opposition.  This is made more acute by comparison with, say the Scandinavian model, by the absence of a committee system.  In such systems members of committees would have access to both the legislative drafting process and the public service.  In addition, there is the regular breach in practice of existing Standing Orders.  It is a dreadful waste of time to have monotonous Second Stage speeches read tediously comma by comma by Ministers when many of these speeches, which are so repetitious that they assume the status of a mantra at the beginning, could be circulated in advance.  If Ministers do not want to circulate their speeches in advance could we not stick to the Standing Order of this House that <Col N="1845" /> they be not read?  If Ministers feel unable to give speeches from headings could they not circulate these large slabs of language in advance?</P>
    <P>As the author of the idea of a foreign affairs committee and with sufficient tolerance to respect the conversion of others to the idea, I want to say that the absence of a foreign affairs committee and committees on many other areas is simply outrageous.  If it is to work it will have to be an effective committee with adequate terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the public's attitude, all of the elements of the system interact.  If the electorate's expectations are of a localised and personalised service, that is going to be a constraint.  If there is no public service reform, that will be a constraint and if there is no loosening of the Cabinet's grip in relation to the drafting of legislation that will be a constraint. What we are talking about here this morning are mere tiny steps but it is most important that we realise that parliaments all over Europe are in decline in terms of the quality of decision making and their status in the societies in which they work.  If they are to be effective we cannot continue in the way we are, for example, my going for carbon paper and being handed a box with the year 1934 stamped on the bottom.  If Members of this House are prepared to put up with such an antiquarian set of procedures, arrangements and physical facilities, accountability and democracy will be the losers.  I join with my colleagues in urging the Minister of State to be courageous in publishing a paper and bringing detailed proposals on general and structural reform before us.</P>

      <P>I regret that my proposed amendment to this section has been ruled out of order.  I would ask the Minister to look at the proposal in this amendment whereby an indexing of the amount allowable for an adult dependant would be included in the regulations.  Perhaps the Minister would consider a figure of £75 per week as the earnings that would be allowable in that type of case.</P>
      <P>I would also ask him to look at the anomalies between the private sector and the PAYE sector.  For example, in the PAYE sector the earnings for an adult dependant are taken on a current basis whereas the earnings for the self-employed are taken on an average over a yearly basis.  I ask the Minister to apply the yearly average system to the earnings for the adult dependant in the PAYE sector.</P>

I recognise fully the need for such a Bill and for consolidating the legislation on a regular basis.  Indeed, I was responsible for the first consolidation of social welfare legislation since the unified social insurance system <Col N="1854" /> came into force in 1952, when I introduced the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  In this regard I am glad to inform the House that preliminary work has already started on a new consolidation Bill and I hope to be in a position to complete the work within the next year.  Significant progress is also being made in consolidating the various social welfare regulations.  I mention that on this section because it is the most relevant section dealing with this matter. As I have said, a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Dennehy and Deputy Wyse, raised the question of the desirability of again consolidating the legislation.  That process has begun and I hope there will be progress in relation to it in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points raised by Deputy Stagg, there are various views about its limits and operation.  The best way to look at it is in relation to the situation of the whole household.  We set up the Household Review Group which are examining household incomes following the Hyland case; the group are due to present a report to me in the very near future which will provide an opportunity to look at the whole question of the interrelationships of earnings and payments. In that context the Deputy was suggesting that the level should be higher than the current figure of £55; he is suggesting a figure of £75.  These questions can be considered when I receive the report of the review group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not have heard the other point I raised.  At present the PAYE adult dependant is assessed on a current basis as far as their earnings are concerned whereas the self-employed adult dependant is assessed on an average over a period of 12 months.  This creates an anomaly as if the part-time worker &mdash; usually the wife &mdash; goes over the limit the husband's payments are immediately affected whereas if the adult dependant &mdash; usually a wife &mdash; is self-employed the earnings are averaged.  Quite often, if somebody goes over the limit the payments are cut whereas if a person is self-employed they would need to go over the <Col N="1855" /> limit on an average basis over a period of one year.  Perhaps the Minister will try to remove that anomaly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in the operation because of the way in which incomes are assessed in relation to self-employed earnings as distinct from PAYE earnings.  I take the point made by the Deputy and I will look at it from the point of view of having equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>If the P60 was taken from the adult dependant on PAYE at the end of each year it would give the average amount earned in that year and would create equality with the PAYE and self-employed workers.  I am not trying to take from the self-employed person.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Since I came into this House I have repeated for the Minister, on many occasions, that if he could manage to have a fire in his offices where all the rules were burned, with no damage to personnel, it would be the best thing that could possibly happen. As I previously advocated, I welcome the putting together of the rules in relation to social welfare because it is very hard to understand how there can be such differences in payments.  There can be a difference of £1 per week between people of the same age and income.  There have been so many changes and new payments introduced that I very much welcome the concept of a new consolidation Act to bring all the social welfare bits and pieces together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman is John Curry and there are various experts, including some from within the Department. The whole idea was to take a fresh look at the problem which would be helpful in looking at the complexities and difficulties which arise.  The main problem was that the complexities were even difficult for the experts.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne probably could have told them that in the first instance.  The members of the board comprise Dr. Finola Kennedy, an economist, Dr. Claire Carney, Department of Social Science, UCD, Mr. David Byrne, Senior Counsel, Mr. Tony McCashan, social policy analyst, NESC, Mr. John Hynes, Assistant Secretary, Department of Social Welfare, Mr. Michael Guilfoyle, Principal Officer, Department of Finance and Mr. Eoin Ó Broin, Assistant Principal, Department of Social Welfare, who is the secretary.  Although the group are all experts they have found it very difficult to solve some of the problems because, when you solve one problem another arises.</P>
      <P>Whenever we make changes here, out of the goodness of our hearts and experience, we find that it alters something else because it is very difficult to look at all the interactions at once although we know that something needs to be done in a specific case.  It is Members in the House who most often create the difficulties and the anomalies but it is also Members who point out the anomalies afterwards.  In that regard we have been rationalising many of the payments; we rationalised the child dependant allowances from 36 different rates to three by averaging upwards although the Commission on Social Welfare advised averaging downwards.  However, we did not believe that should happen.  As a result there is now a minimum of £12 for each child dependant and there are only three different rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> The lone parent's allowance scheme is another rationalisation bringing together many different aspects.  It took a couple of years to bring them together without causing difficulties for some of the people involved.  We have been rationalising the payments in a variety of ways.</P>
    <P>I believed in consolidation in 1980-81 and I said at the time that ten years was about the life span of a consolidation Bill in this area.  With all the work done in between, it is time to begin the consolidation process again.  One of the difficulties is that the same people who worked on the Social Welfare Acts will be working on the consolidation Bills. That process has begun and will continue; it will certainly help to have a Bill which draws all the strands together and which will be a ready reference point.  When the time comes to introduce the Bill in the House I look forward to having the co-operation of the Members in getting the legislation through quickly.  I say that advisedly because when it was brought in before that did not happen and an attempt was made to delay its passing.  It was really a waste of time politically.  I hope we will not have a repetition of that problem but I believe Deputies are very responsible in relation to this and realise there is nothing new in it anyway; there cannot be anything new in a consolidation Bill.  A consolidation Bill provides ready useful consolidation of all the legislation and is particularly valuable to people working in the area whether they are social workers, those with a legal interest in it or Members of either House.  We look forward to advancing that during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me advise the House that we are on Committee Stage when we are required to apply ourselves to what is in the legislation. While passing references may be entertained, we should avoid being over-speculative because that is not permitted on Committee Stage.  Has Deputy Byrne a comment to make that is relevant to Committee Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope so, given the <Col N="1858" /> reference to the Household Review Group from the Minister's mouth.  Presumably our collective response to a consolidation Bill would be positive and we look forward to seeing a consolidation Bill before the House.  I am confused about the Household Review Group and the delays. Will the Minister not agree that it would have been very important to have the group's report prior to this Bill being debated?  I understand the budget creates certain conditions and that certain time factors are involved, but I am sceptical and worried, given that it is in black and white in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that &ldquo;A review of the treatment of households within the social welfare code has been completed by a special Household Review Group&rdquo;.  The Government when negotiating this deal with the trade union movement and when the programme was being printed knew that the Household Review Group had completed their work.  The programme says, &ldquo;The report of this Group will be discussed with appropriate interests&rdquo;. Needless to say, the House is clearly a group which should be interested in that report.  Why has there been such a delay? Why is this document not before the House?</P>
      <P>I do not know if I heard the Minister correctly but he seemed to say changes are made in this House out of the goodness of hearts.  Surely we do not bring in legislation out of the goodness of our hearts.  We have political programmes and given political commitments to the electorate before we come in here and so there is nothing really coming from the heart.  Let us be honest.  If anything is brought forward it is as a result of a political commitment to the voluntary social agencies and the electorate in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I have two questions.  When he referred to the review group he said he expected <Col N="1859" /> a report shortly.  Does he expect that to deal with the proposal I made on the increase in the amount of earnings disallowed for the adult dependant allowance payable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect it to be relevant to it.  It is one of the ways in which we deal with households and in that sense it would be relevant to it.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Byrne, first, as far as the review is concerned the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> states:</P>
      <P>A review of the treatment of households within the welfare code has been completed by a special Household Review Group.  The report of this group will be discussed with appropriate interests.</P>
      <P>The review has been completed but the report is not completed.  It is a question of dotting the i's and crossing the t's before the report will be ready.  Both statements are factually correct.  The review was completed at that stage and the report will be available fairly shortly.</P>
      <P>The other question the Deputy raised was very interesting.  It is about the goodness of our hearts.  Deputy Byrne is not here a long time yet but let me say the House, the elected representatives, in my experience do their work out of the goodness of their hearts.  Deputy Browne, who brought this to my attention reminds me of a person who works by his heart because of his genuine interest in people. Very often amendments are made because of the views of Deputies and the fact that we agree that something should be done.  They are not all made by backroom strategists who put a programme before the people and say, this is it, this is to be our lot for the next so many years. Deputies have a much more active role in the whole democratic parliamentary process.  That is the process I was referring to.  It is a very good process.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 3, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3. &mdash;(1)  The recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare in relation to a common basic payment or minimally adequate payment shall be recognised as the Official Poverty Line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> (2)  The Official Poverty Line rates shall be established at:</P>
    <P>(a)  for a single adult, £50.00 per week in 1985 prices,</P>
    <P>(b)  for a married couple, 1.6 times the weekly rate for a single person in 1985 prices,</P>
    <P>(c)  for each child under the age of 18 years, £10.00 per week in 1985 prices.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Official Poverty Line rate shall be indexed annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I move this out of the goodness of my heart.  It would be an expression of the Government's good intentions, without a necessary cost, to put a preamble, as it were, into this Bill expressing what they would see as a minimum requirement if resources were available.  I also see it as very positive from the Minister's point of view.  I am aware the Minister has to fight his corner around the Cabinet table against many other demands to get resources to provide the services in the social welfare area that are required.  It would give support to the Minister in that regard if there was an official poverty line recognised by the Government, the Minister and the Dáil.  That recognition would also give hope to people that that was an achievable, desirable target to reach.  The guidelines I have proposed for that poverty line are contained in the Government's Commission on Social Welfare whose report has, I understand, been accepted in principle.  The Government should take this amendment and express it as a preamble to the Bill, an expression of our good intentions from the goodness of our hearts, as the Minister has said.  It would give hope, and recognition and strengthen the Minister's arm in his discussions with his colleagues which I am sure are ongoing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My arm has been very considerably strengthened by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I do not know how much people have noted that but it is a reality.  The <Col N="1862" /> programme gives us great support in achieving the level of payments we want to reach.  The difficulty with the point made by Deputy Stagg is that he wants to establish an official poverty line while we want to establish a level of payment. We must bear in mind that many of our payments are made to people who have other incomes and whose other incomes are not means tested.  Consequently the level of those payments matter. Obviously the level of such payments on top of whatever other payments people may have will enhance their position. One can say that the standard of living for those people should be at a certain level, but to define an absolute poverty line would be extremely difficult because of all the variations and circumstances.</P>
      <P>The ESRI research in the poverty area over the last number of years has focused much attention on the derivation of poverty lines. However, the ESRI state clearly that there is not an entirely satisfactory and convincing method of drawing a unique poverty line.  Many would argue that adopting an all or nothing approach where people are sharply categorised as being poor or not poor is not appropriate.  If reality is better described as a continuum from very poor to very rich, drawing such a cut off will certainly involve a significant degree of arbitrariness. For reasons similar to those set out by the ESRI it would not be appropriate to refer to an absolute poverty line in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more appropriate forum for this type of discussion and where it actually took place is the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  In the kind of forum the programme provides one can set the levels of payments which are appropriate in a more practical and realistic way.  That is what has been done through the commission and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The programme, as the House knows, has been agreed by the social partners and represents a major consensus on policy development.  This is especially true in the area of social policy. <Col N="1863" /> The Government have specifically committed themselves under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to continue to protect social welfare rates against inflation and to move by 1993 to the priority level of rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare involving an estimated additional full year expenditure of £65 million on the assumption of an annual 3 per cent inflation rate and thereafter to increase social welfare rates further and progressively in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare as the resources of the economy grow.</P>
    <P>Recent reports have highlighted the particular requirements of families and the need for a particular focus towards families.  In this respect the lines that were used in the ESRI report which were quoted subsequently by the Combat Poverty Agency were valuable internal comparisons and in comparisons over the years but not for the purpose mentioned here by Deputy Stagg.  They are valuable in that they show a pattern and one can see over the years up to 1986 who had been losing out and who had been doing better.  That is where their strength is. They are just scientific instruments to measure the variation over the years of the way in which different groups had changed position.  One of the groups pinpointed were the long term unemployed especially the long term unemloyed with families.  If one looks at what we have been doing since then and at the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> one will find that we are continuing along the line of bolstering and bringing up the levels of people who were identified in these studies. The lines used are not absolute lines but they are useful for research comparisons.</P>
    <P>In the context of resources on the scale necessary to implement the additional child income support measures recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, some £69 million in 1990 terms will be devoted to child income support over a ten year period.  The measures to <Col N="1864" /> be taken are to be worked out in the light of up to date information on child and family circumstances and in the light of available resources.  These commitments are firmly based on the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare which, as stated in the programme, now provide a broad framework for the development of social policy.  The programme already achieves what Deputy Stagg wants but allows the flexibility for the policy to adapt to changing needs as and when these are highlighted.</P>
    <P>In addition such a flexible approach acknowledges the role of non cash payments, for example the value of the medical card, free schemes, subsidised housing, education and so on.  The non cash benefits were not taken into consideration in the other studies.  Both the ESRI and the Commission on Social Welfare acknowledge the role of these and the fact that the free schemes and additional allowances form part of a person's basic income.  This issue among others is not taken into account in the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will realise that what the Government are doing is what people have sought since I came back here in 1987.  People wanted a linking to the commission's report.  There was a great deal of criticism of the lack of firm commitment to the report.  We were doing what was necessary but we had not made a total commitment to the costs which would go with the report or to the levels stipulated in it.  These commitments are now built into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as part of policy. As Minister for Social Welfare the Government's commitment gives me an important support from year to year. Already we have reached priority rates in a number of areas which are part of the programme for 1993.  I am quite confident that we will meet all the priority requirements by 1993 as promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I would like to raise at this stage. From all the negotiations I had with <Col N="1865" /> people, particularly social welfare recipients, it appears that despite the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare will not be arrived at for a long time.  At this stage people on short time unemployment assistance should be receiving £10 a week more than they are receiving now.</P>
      <P>I notice that in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the aspirations are there but are qualified by the phrase &ldquo;as the economy grows.&rdquo;  As Deputy Stagg mentioned, there is great competition around the table for the resources.  Is it not reasonable to assume that the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare are unlikely to be met for perhaps ten years?  The Minister might address that point.  The fundamental problem is that the poor will always be at the bottom of the pile.  This is not a criticism of this Minister personally; it could be a criticism of any of his predecessors. In view of the conditions under which the poor have to live and work, is it adequate to state that their lot will be improved as resources become available? Is that good enough for the poor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a pre-budget submission to the Minister in which I asked that he look at the possibility of implementing over a three year period the payment levels recommended in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare. That has not happened.  The gap has not been narrowed by even one-third this year, taking account of the rate of inflation.  One million people are adjudged by experts and Government commissions to be living below the poverty line.  One-third of all households and all recipients of welfare payments are below the poverty line.  The commission stated that all recipients should be entitled to common basic payments of £50-£59 a week, in 1985 terms.  I am asking that the commission's recommendation in regard to a minimal adequate payment be adopted by the <Col N="1866" /> Minister and that nobody be below that level.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the gap which existed in 1985 between the payment and the recommendation has narrowed, but it is narrowing so slowly that the poor continue to be affected.  The Minister talks about his commitment to the report.  He could demonstrate that commitment very clearly by adopting this section of the report as a preamble to the Bill.  Such an action would clearly show that he is not just paying lip service to the report.  I thought the Minister would be pleased to accept this amendment because it would strengthen his hand in the negotiations with his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The restriction on our ability to table amendments is very clear. About 60 amendments have been ruled out of order on the grounds that they would constitute a charge on the Exchequer.  I am disappointed that my amendment has not been taken because it ties in with the sentiments which have been expressed in the debate.  Amendment No. 3 states:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 3, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1)  The minimum rate of benefit of assistance payable to an adult in respect of the periodic benefits or social assistance, specified in the Schedules, shall be not less than £65 per week.</P>
      <P>(2)  The minimum payment in respect of each dependant child shall&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of each dependant child under 15, not be less than 40 per cent of the adult rate,</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of each dependant child between 15 and 17, not be less than 55 per cent of the adult rate, and</P>
      <P>(c)  in the case of each dependant child aged 18 or over, who is living at home and in full-time training or education, not be less than 70 per cent of the adult rate.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1867" /> The commitment to social welfare in the famous <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a major disappointment. I am also disappointed that ICTU did not negotiate a far stronger deal on social welfare.  The programme refers to moving by 1993 to the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1985.  The commission felt then that the rates were so pathetic that there was an immediate need for an injection of capital to upgrade the bottom levels, and they listed these as a priority.  The report, however, goes substantially further in its recommendations. Even if priority levels were reached by 1993, that would be eight years after the publication of the report. In other words, the Government are eight years behind the times.  The commission estimated that a minimal adequate income for a single person would be in the range of £50-£60 a week in 1985 terms.  If we take a figure of £55 a week in 1985 terms, that would equal £62 in 1991 terms.  So much for the argument that the Government are on target. The priority rates are substantially less than the commission recommended.</P>
    <P>We have a good basic spectrum of social welfare benefits and payments. There is a progressive range of payments for various categories, although I am not in a position to compare it with what is available in other countries.  The difficulty is that the payments are not adequate and are substantially behind the level recommended by the commission. It is important that we recognise the required basic payment.  We suggested different rates of child benefit payments. Obviously the expense incurred in rearing children varies and there are greater demands on parents at certain times.  The cost of rearing a child at the infant stage is considerably less than when the child is between 16 and 18 years.  We have suggested having a range of age bands. Does the Minister accept the idea in principle of having age bands, irrespective of the cost to the Exchequer?  Teenagers particularly those between 15 and 17 years, make great demands on their <Col N="1868" /> parents by way of pocket money, feeding, and clothing and benefits should be higher.  We suggest that parents of children over 15 should receive 40 per cent of the adult rate in respect of that child and this should rise to not less than 55 per cent of the adult rate in respect of a child of 17.  If the Minister decided to take this on board, it would be seen as progressive.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment, but unfortunately the more the Government try to increase social welfare payments the wider and more apparent the poverty trap becomes.  The effect of providing less incentive for people to seek work is also apparent especially for those who are married and have a large number of dependants.</P>
      <P>The Green Party would like to see a system of basic income for all to replace the social welfare system.  The present social welfare tax system has the effect of leaving some employees earning £12,000 a year no better off in money terms than those earning £3,000 a year, so that the only way out of the ludicrous system which I have just illustrated is the introduction of a scheme of guaranteed basic income.  This would mean the payment to every adult, whether male, female, employed, unemployed, pensioner, self-employed, married, single, divorced, separated, co-habiting or whatever, with a basic income.  This scheme is to a great extent self-financing, as the employed and self-employed would lose their allowances and reliefs in compensation for receiving a basic income.</P>

      <P>With respect, Deputy Garland has been addressing the House for a minute and a half and we will let him demonstrate that the matter he is addressing is relevant to amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Stagg to section 3.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  There would be no means test for this basic income.  A system of basic income would totally transform both the economy and the lives of the unemployed.  Instead of putting obstacles in the way of returning to the workforce, basic income would result in a higher take-up of work, including part-time work and work for charitable organisations and voluntary groups.  It also would enable small businesses which cannot afford at present to pay a living wage to employ someone who would otherwise be unemployed, providing them with a top-up to their basic income, and giving them a feeling of their worth in society.  I would refer to subsection 2 (b) of Deputy Stagg's amendment, wherein he proposes that a married couple should receive 1.6 times the weekly rate for a single person.  This unfortunately conforms to the existing and now out-of-date concept of the family.  Certainly, it has to be admitted that two people can live more cheaply than one.  This would be fine if the vast majority of social welfare recipients were living together as married persons. However, whether we like it or not there are now many irregular liaisons; marriage breakdowns followed by second relationships or homosexual relationships.  We are into a very different scenario but the Minister's response has been to come up with this ridiculous co-habiting rule &mdash; which by implication Deputy Stagg approves of.  How can it be established that a second relationship is stable or unstable?  When is it considered stable? The rules for cohabiting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to the points raised at the outset by Deputy Connaughton. First, I want to make it clear that the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are not, as the Deputy has said, simply an aspiration but a firm commitment. Obviously they are conditional on the economy continuing to make progress.  It has been pointed out that as the resources of the economy grow we can proceed to these higher levels of payments.  There is a firm commitment in the programme and other things being anyway equal, we are going on that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the level of social welfare payments and what the Commission on Social Welfare have had to say on this matter, the commission made a series of recommendations to improve the standard of living for social welfare recipients while at the same time attempting to maintain the incentive to work. The points made by the Deputies illustrate the practical dilemma: that one must maintain a reasonable incentive to work at the same time as having satisfactory levels of social welfare.  The commission addressed this aspect of the problem.  The total annual cost of achieving the commission's rates of payment in 1990 terms is £327 million.  The full implementation of the commission's recommendations in relation to the rates of payment present very serious problems of resources, which can only be resolved as the economy grows.  The commission recognised these difficulties and identified priority increases as the first step in bringing the rates of payment up to the minimum acceptable levels.  The Government have committed themselves in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to achieving the priority rates recommended by the commission by 1993 and thereafter to increase social welfare rates further and progressively in accordance with the commission's recommendations as the resources of the economy grow.  The rates recommended <Col N="1871" /> by the commission, expressed in 1985 terms were: priority rate £45; and assistance rate £50.  Expressed in 1991 terms the priority rate becomes £54.60 and the assistance rate becomes £60.80.  In this Bill we are bringing all the long term rates up to the priority level from £54.60 to £55.  It is a marginal increase but some of the rates are higher than that again. Payments in respect of the elderly tend to be higher.  That point was made by the commission in the first instance.  Some of the short term rates mentioned by Deputy Stagg, supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance are only £45 at the moment and they are getting priority in this Bill and are being increased by 11 per cent to bring them up to £50.  We are bridging the gap there and bringing the rates closer to the priority rates.  Given what we are doing in this Bill, I see little difficulty in surpassing the priority rates by 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In what year would we reach recommended rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases we will reach them before the full period.  However when Government look at this they have to look at the total additional cost which is £400 million, and over ten years the inflation rate must be taken into account. We are, therefore, talking about providing substantial extra resources.  I would see us getting to the priority levels before the recommended date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of old age contributory pensions and retirement pensions, following this Bill the personal rate £64 for those under 80, for a person with an adult dependant under 66 it is £104.80, and for a person with an adult dependant aged 66 or over it is now £110.  These rates are ahead of the rates generally recommended by the commission.  What we are doing is keeping those higher rates ahead of inflation.  Inflation is under 3 per cent; they are getting 4 per cent and are staying ahead.  We are not doing what the expert with a more academic approach might do and stopping these rates until the others catch up.  We are keeping everybody <Col N="1872" /> moving ahead by something above inflation and, at the same time, giving the extra increases to those who need to close the gap.</P>
    <P>The invalidity pension is £56.40 per week.  The widows contributory pension and deserted wives benefit for those under 80 is £58.20.  We are bringing all the long term benefits above the £54.60 in this Bill and some of them are being increased by more.  The Government are making very good progress in this area. I would like to assure the Deputies that the Government intend to continue this programme of improvements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne made comparisons between us and other countries.  It is difficult for us to compare with other countries that have much greater resources, but when comparisons are made one realises that the long term unemployment basic rate, following this Bill, will be £55 and £33 for an adult dependant.  In Northern Ireland the same benefit is £41.46 &mdash; this may go up slightly following the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We can look at the other allowances.  An adult dependant gets £25.59 but here is is £33.  We were behind these rates only a few years ago but we are now ahead.  I would like it to be clear that we are making considerable progress.  The payments here for the elderly and retired are also better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to social insurance payments, the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare have already been achieved in the case of the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment, the occupational injuries benefit scheme, the old age contributory and retirement, invalidity and widows contributory pension schemes and deserted wives benefit.  The disability benefit, unemployment benefit and general maternity allowances schemes are <Col N="1873" /> the only social insurance payments which are not at the commission's priority rates. However, a pay-related supplement of up to £17.40 can be paid in addition, following this Bill, and that will bring the overall payment above the commission's priority rate.  This is something Deputies are inclined to forget when they talk about the rates of disability benefit and say it is lower now that we have brought the basic unemployment rate to £55 as against £50.  However, the £50 is normally associated with a pay-related benefit increase of up to £17.40 and the average there would be about £12.  The whole idea of the commission was to do away with pay-related benefit and to bring the basic levels up to these other levels we mentioned.  That is what we are doing. As those benefits rise the pay-related benefit is coming back to meet them.  We are following the line set by the commission to bring the basic levels up so that everybody gets that basic level irrespective of the pay-related element.</P>
    <P>With the extension of the provisions of the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, to cover women who are working for more than eight hours a week, many of the women who now qualify for the general maternity scheme will become entitled to the maternity allowance for women, the minimum rate for which is £76 per week.</P>
    <P>Of approximately 383,000 persons in receipt of the various social insurance payments, over 286 or almost 75 per cent are receiving payments at a higher level than the commission's priority rates which we are to reach by 1993.  I can assure Deputies that we will continue to make progress and be ahead of the target set.</P>
    <P>In relation to social assistance payments, the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare have been achieved in the case of all long term social assistance payments, that is, long term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, old age and blind pensions, widows non-contributory pensions, deserted wives allowance, prisoners wives allowance, single woman's allowance and lone parents allowance. <Col N="1874" /> The rates for short term social assistance payments are £4.60 below the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Government have, however, given a firm commitment to increase these rates to the commission's priority rates by 1993.  This year has seen a major step in this direction with an increase of 11 per cent in the weekly rate of short term social assistance payments, short term unemployment assistance, the carer's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Of the approximate 350,000 people in receipt of various social insurance payments, over 287,200, or 82 per cent, receive payment at a higher level than the commission's priority rates.  For example, of a total of approximately 733,000 social welfare recipients, over 573,200, or 78 per cent, receive payments at a higher level than the commission's priority rates.  The House will see that we now have the 78 per cent, or the 80 per cent, above the priority rates and it is clear that we will more than achieve the 1993 target.</P>
    <P>In relation to the child dependant allowances, Deputies have been advancing different proposals.  Broadly, we are following the lines recommended by the commission which constituted the broadest overall consideration.  The streamlining of the child dependant increases, which commenced in July 1988, has been continued.  The number of different rates for child dependants under the various social insurance, occupational injuries and social assistance schemes is being further reduced from five to three.  Since July 1988 the number of different rates of child dependant allowances for all social welfare schemes has been reduced from 36 to three.  There are now only one-twelfth of the number of different rates of child dependant increases compared with three years ago.  In addition, the difference between the highest and lowest rates of child dependant payments has been significantly reduced.  Prior to July 1988 the difference between the highest and lowest levels of payment was £8.20 per week.  The minimum child dependant allowance, introduced in July <Col N="1875" /> 1989, is also being increased by over 9 per cent to a minimum of £12 per week. I might make the point that the rates for child dependant allowances here are now considerably higher than those obtaining in the United Kingdom.  It will be seen that we have more than met the recommendations of the commission with which I think Deputies should be happy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland pointed out that these rates are now beginning to cause some difficulty with higher numbers of members of families which, with £12 per week for each child, adds considerably to the basic payments.  In order to counteract that we have increased the family income supplement and the child-related tax allowances.</P>
    <P>The overall question of the tax and benefit dilemma raised by Deputy Garland was referred to in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, at paragraph 8.5 which had this to say:</P>
    <P>If the present system were replaced, for example, with a universal social dividend at the unemployment benefit rate (£39.50) for all adults, with no extra payments for any category, plus £10 per child, per week, for all children, up to age 19 years, then total dividend expenditure would be about £5.1 billions...</P>
    <P>So it will clearly be seen that we are not talking about those levels at all now, we are talking about much higher rates.  At that stage the rate for unemployment assistance was £39.50 with a dependant rate much lower also.  The present rate of long term unemployment assistance is £55 with a £33 adult dependant allowance. It will be seen that we are talking about a huge volume of money creating enormous difficulties for taxpayers in meeting such commitments.  Of course these matters are being considered, and will continue to be mainly by relating the tax element to the social welfare one, in order to arrive at the best possible combination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg used the figure of one million people living below the poverty <Col N="1876" /> line.  This is thrown out as a cliché repeatedly. I should say that our payments go to approximately one million people.  In almost all cases we provide payments above the priority rates recommended by the commission.  I should make clear that a large proportion of our payments are paid to people with other incomes, which is a totally different question in that people do not know what other incomes those people may have.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that there are one million people in that group.  There are people who are poor, others who are very poor.  I recognise that fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people who are very poor not in that category at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have also gone further with the family income supplement. Initially it was thought approximately 35,000 people would benefit therefrom. When we assumed office people complained that there were perhaps only 3,000 to 4,000 people benefiting.  People contended that that was very bad, that we were not getting the money to those people, obviously poor, and in need of it.  We took various action, including increasing the rates so that between 6,500 and 7,000 people now collect that benefit. We also undertook research to ascertain the total number involved.  Our research showed that there were approximately 12,000 to 13,000 people only who would qualify, that people had other sources of income not shown in earlier studies.  It was discovered that, when it came to effecting payment, people did not qualify because their incomes were higher than had been understood.  We must still endeavour to get that benefit to more people although we have increased the levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things I should like to make clear.  One is that many of our beneficiaries are now insurance-based. We are increasing the numbers of insurance-based beneficiaries which is what Members said they wanted.  For example, we are now making all the self-employed insurance-based so that they can have other income and the means test has been <Col N="1877" /> abolished in their case.  Therefore, the figure of one million people below the poverty line is certainly not accurate.</P>
    <P>Taking the amendment before us I contend that what the Government are doing consitutes the correct line to be pursued. In the light of that perhaps Deputy Stagg would withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister, one got the impression he deluded himself and endeavoured to wipe out of his psyche that there are one million people in this country recognised as being on the poverty line.  On behalf of those people I contend there is no point in the Minister standing in the House saying how excellent are his benefits; that if one lived in Britain or Northern Ireland one would be much worse off.  It is those recipients of social welfare in this country who are experiencing poverty; it is their daily struggle.  There is no point reminding them that, if they lived in, say Bangladesh or some other Third World country they would have big pot bellies from malnutrition.  It is the responsibility of this Legislature to enhance the lives of those people, to give them an adequate standard of living, particularly when it is clear to so many of them that we have now a two-tier society, they constituting one tier and the remainder, comprised of many of the 166 Members of this House, the second tier.</P>
      <P>We have an obligation to the huge mass of humanity out there to provide them with an opportunity to exist with some self respect.  The poor here are not interested in the poverty of other countries and I would rather the Minister did not pursue that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document produced in 1985 made recommendations which the Minister has conveniently forgotten, because he seems to be looking down a glass tube and focussing in only on the priority recommendations.  The priority recommendations are subsequently inferior in value to the actual recommendations.  I would remind the Minister, for example, that in 1985 one of the recommendations &mdash; which the Minister seems to have forgotten &mdash; was that all social welfare <Col N="1878" /> recipients should be entitled to a common basic payment of the order of £50 or £60 per week which, by today's standards, would equal at least £62.  When one looks at the proposed payments &mdash; when the Bill is passed we look forward to the payments in July but some unfortunate people have to wait until October &mdash; one can compare them with what was recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I would like to cite two examples.  If we take the basic rate of approximately £62 in today's value and what is recommended in the Bill for payments to people in receipt of social welfare supplementary welfare allowance and unemployment assistance we will see that there is a differential of £12.  In other words, the Government are recommending the basic minimum payment of £50.  Had the recommendation been taken on board the amount would be £62.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that the real world of poverty exists out there.  I assure him that the £12 differential on which the Government, and previous Governments, have fallen short is a substantial sum of money to people in receipt of a supplementary welfare allowance or unemployment assistance because essentially we are talking about the lowest minimum payment to people.  They are the poorest of the poor and £12 extra would be a substantial sum to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to convince us that he had taken on board almost everything the commission had recommended and that he was surpassing their targets.  A quick glance at this voluminous document indicates that the recommendation is that a differential of the order of 10 per cent should be maintained between insurance and assistance payments.  If the Minister says he is taking on board the recommendations of the commission I cannot understand why he is going in the opposite direction.  As mentioned on Second Stage unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are both at the rate of £50 per week and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  Insured workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I am making is, how can the Minister say he is adopting the recommendations when one recommendation states that a differential of the order of 10 per cent should be maintained between insured and assistance payments. The Minister has done the complete opposite by equalising both payments for insured workers and those in receipt of assistance which flies in the face of that recommendation.</P>
      <P>Another recommendation states that single applicants for unemployment assistance, aged 18 to 25 years, should be entitled to a standard weekly allowance irrespective of household circumstances. We, on the left, have argued this point until we were blue in the face and the Minister has thrown it out as something we should work towards.  The Minister says he is attempting to adopt all the recommendations in the report and is reaching his priority targets to bring certain rates up to certain levels.  He has said he has exceeded them in certain areas and suggested we look at what is happening in England and Northern Ireland.  The fact is that we are talking about recommendations, not priority levels.  The priority levels were those which were to be implemented in 1985 to increase the lowest payments as a matter of priority. The priorities do not constitute the recommendations in the report.</P>

      <P>When reading his script the Minister talked about the need to retain the incentive to work.  By implication he said, and I interpret him as saying, that the only way to make the lazy unemployed work was to starve them into it.  I am sure he will correct that.  The Minister is saying that he could not pay enough money to people so that they could have clothes, shelter and food in case it would be a disincentive to their being available as cheap labour to be exploited by private employers.  I regard the position put forward by the Minister as patronising and insulting to those who are unemployed. It never ceases to amaze me that, as we organise our society, we must punish workers to make sure they go to work and we must give incentives, tax breaks and direct payments to the owners of capital to encourage them to exploit the workers we will not pay.  We have a carrot for one group in society and a stick for the other and never the twain shall meet. The Minister's remarks seem to indicate he fully accepts that position.  One of the figures the Minister keeps trotting out is out of date as it is for 1990.</P>

      <P>The index figures for the commission which the Minister is using are 1990 figures.  If the 1985 figures given by the commission are indexed they would come to £62 and £100 and not as stated by the Minister.  The Minister gave us the out-of-date figure to try to demonstrate he has achieved much more than <Col N="1881" /> he has achieved.  It never ceases to amaze me that the Minister can, on the one hand, say we cannot give them enough as it would be a disincentive to work and, on the other hand, say we have reached our priority for 70 per cent to 80 per cent of all people affected.  I wonder what the people in receipt of £50 disability benefit would say?  While this is described as a short term payment, my experience is that it is not a short term payment.  I have met people who are in receipt of disability benefit for 20 years without a break and who, of course, should have been informed of their rights to apply for invalidity pension by the Department of Social Welfare.  I have never yet met anybody who was told by the Department of Social Welfare, &ldquo;you may transfer from disability benefit to invalidity benefit after one year of disability benefit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think it happens because the payment is higher.  There is a cost to the Department of Social Welfare and they keep quiet about it so that people do not know their rights.</P>
      <P>The Minister kept referring to the priority level of payment and said that the priorities were being met. The priority level of payment he was talking about has been described by a Government Commission on Social Welfare as the minimal adequate payment.  They should not make it a priority to reach that level. They should make it a priority to exceed that level right across the board.  My amendment would simply strengthen the Minister's hand in this regard.  I cannot understand why he regards my amendment as undesirable or unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister is saying to people that they have never had it so good and they can effectively forget about the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare as he has implemented nearly all the recommendations.  Having read the recommendations of the commission and looked at what the Minister has done I do not think they meet.  I expect the Minister to accept my amendment.  If he does not accept it I will press it to a vote.</P>

      <P>The Minister has shown his clear understanding of this very sensitive area.  He has recognised the priority areas.  One cannot talk about the less well off in our community or refer to the deficiencies in the system unless there is the intention to do something about these problems.  The Minister has clearly recognised the problems in this area.  The reduction in the number of payments in child benefits from 37 to three over a very <Col N="1883" /> short period was the only way to deal with this issue.  As many people in this House have pointed out over the years, there were too many anomalies in this area.  It was only when the present Minister took on board the problems in this very complex area of social welfare that we saw any progress.  We have to acknowledge that major progress has been made in this area.  The wide-ranging increases given across the board in this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department carried out a study on the people concerned &mdash; some of the people to which the Deputy has referred may not have been included &mdash; and found that 40 per cent of those in receipt of long term disability benefit did not want to transfer to invalidity pension as that pension was taxable.  I will review the information given to those in receipt of long term disability benefit to make sure that they know what their rights are. It is made very clear in our information sections that they do have this right but I recognise, as the Deputy said, that some people may not be aware of it.  The number in receipt of invalidity pension has increased during the past few years and continues to increase perhaps because people are now better informed of their rights in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People cannot have it both ways as it is essentially a short term payment.  As I have said in the House before, the payment is stopped in most other countries <Col N="1889" /> after a period of six or 12 months when a decision is taken as to whether the person should be transferred to invalidity pension or go back to work.  However, in our case those who are not in a position to say that they will not be able to go back to work can continue to receive this benefit.  I agree that there is a need to look at the position of older people.  I should not say old as I do not want to offend anybody in the House but as the Deputy raised that question I will certainly have a look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made great play of the fact that an extra £164 million is to be made available but in relation to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare the question he must ask himself is if he can find a family anywhere in Ireland in receipt of long term unemployment assistance &mdash;&mdash; among the one million or so people living on or below the poverty line and can convince me that they are not having a bad time.  As I said earlier, there is a great deal of slagging going on, and I have been listening to this for many years. Indeed, I could outline during the next ten to 15 minutes many of the good things that were done by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  For instance, the family income supplement was introduced during their term of office.  However, such slagging is of no use to the man and wife with two or three children in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I would like the Minister to acknowledge that such people are far from being well off. Indeed, having regard to Government policy, they will find it far more difficult in the future to get local authority housing and their phone calls will be far more expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that one cannot divide wealth which has not been created but I should say in relation to the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare that, having listened to the Minister for the past two hours, I genuinely believe that it will be many years before social welfare <Col N="1890" /> recipients receive benefits at rates recommended. The Minister seems to be certain that the targets outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will be met but during the first two months of the programme there was an unprecedented rise in the unemployment figures &mdash; 8,000 in one month and 4,000 to 5,000 in the next.  That will have an impact on the figure the Minister mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is clear that social welfare recipients will be as far away as ever from the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1993.  It follows, therefore, that the family to which I refer will always be at the bottom of the pile.  It is very difficult to see what the future holds for them.  I do not care how many millions of pounds are tagged on by the Minister, we will always have to come back to consider the position of the basic family unit living in a town, a city or in the country who have to compete with others in this big commercial world of ours who have far more money to pay for education and so on.  I am concerned that the Minister does not seem to accept the view that the outlook is not very rosy for them. Unless the Minister says something different I will have to accept that these people will be no better off in three or four years time.  I would like him to comment on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has identified the difficulties facing families in the modern world.  I accept that families are under pressure but let us consider the position of a family of husband, wife and five children.  That family will receive £148 per week outside of the £8 per week fuel allowance during the winter months, the back to school allowance, certain other supports and the Christmas bonus. The figure for an eight child family is £192 per week.</P>

      <P>In relation to the amendment proposed by Deputy Stagg, we are providing a substantial basic child dependent payment.  Three or four years ago the rate was as low as £7.60 but the minimum rate will now be £12.  Child benefit is added to that, and here again we have been increasing the higher rates.  They are the levels we have reached in this section.  A family with five children will receive £148 a week unemployment benefit as a result of this matter.  There is also the question of people at work on low pay.  What has been happening here &mdash; and this relates to the questions raised about child benefit &mdash; is that the emphasis has been placed on the family income supplement and the child related tax exemption.  There is £16.5 million being provided in that area as a result of the changes in this Bill.  There is also an adjustment in child benefit for the fourth child.  We have to look at children as a whole, and that matter will have to be considered further as we go into next year.  We want to integrate as far as possible child dependant allowances with child benefit, child related tax exemptions and family income supplement, which is based on children and increased in accordance with the number of children in a family.  We want to bring these benefits together and to get a uniform package for families, whether the parents are at work on low incomes or out of work and depending on these payments. All I can say to the Deputy in relation to the points he has made is that I appreciate the problem he mentioned. We are increasing and we will continue to increase the rates and a commitment <Col N="1892" /> along those lines is given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Promises are made in the budget in relation to increases but people have to wait a long time to receive them, sometimes until October.  The budget is introduced in January but then there has to be further legislation to implement its proposals.  The increases announced should be granted in April as people are usually in need of the extra money, and should not have to wait an age to receive it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Byrne, upstaged me somewhat by suggesting bringing the payment date forward five or six days earlier than I proposed but I think the general trend of what we are saying is the same.  We are asking that the date on which people are expected to pay up when there is a deduction for taxation or otherwise be the date on which increases would be paid.  In this case we are talking about an across the board increase of 4 per cent to social welfare recipients.  That will be effectively eroded by the time it is paid.  As spokesman on behalf of the Labour Party, I will not accept the section which provides for payment in June or July.  I demand that payment be brought forward to an April date.  That is quite possible and easy to do.  The technology is now available to have books and other matters ready by that date, and that does away with the old excuse.  I am concerned that in this instance there is an increase in the VAT rates on items that affect poor people particularly.  I am concerned about the VAT increase, up to 12.5 per cent on fuel which in itself will nearly erode the increase of 4 per cent as proposed. Therefore, I will not accept section 3 as it stands and I hope the Minister can see his way to change the date of payment back to April as we proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case Deputy Stagg is making and I want to add a further dimension to it.  Many Deputies, particularly Deputy Ivor Callely who sits on Dublin City Council with me, will appreciate that there is an annual review of rents at local authority level.  Unfortunately this year an old age pensioner, for example, in receipt of the £2 per week increase proposed in this Bill will by the end of the year be marginally worse off because of the effects of the fuel increases, for example, and the automatic increases now imposed each year by local authorities.  I am referring to Dublin City Council on this occasion. Rentals are increased way ahead of the payment date for these increases.  Therefore, this year we will see people who qualify for only the minimum £2 per week having to meet increased bills for electricity and heating.  The price of smokeless fuel has gone through the roof.  It is incredible that VAT should have been added to the price of this commodity. The vulnerable elderly will find the cost of heating their homes very high and the net result is they will be worse off by the end of the year.  I ask the Minister to please bear in mind that everything else goes up in price nearly as soon as the Minister for Finance sits down on budget day.  Dublin Corporation do not hold back, neither do the ESB nor garages and people selling paraffin oil and fuels.  They <Col N="1897" /> apply the increases and the poor unfortunates have to wait for us to go through this ritual and even longer &mdash; and some have to wait until July and others until October &mdash; for payment of the increases. Therefore I ask that the date be brought forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and appreciate Deputy Byrne's sentiments.  You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a member of another body also are aware of annual rent increases by local authorities and the effects they may have on social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment, for the past number of years specified payment dates have been the system used.  There is no change in that regard.  I am sure the Minister will comment on that.  Maybe parliamentary draftsmen have everything in perspective by certain dates and may need time or whatever or maybe there is only a certain allocation in the budget and that time is an important factor in the context of the operative date for the increases of the nature provided in the Social Welfare Bill.  Generally one would have to recognise that the streamlining of the social welfare system must be welcomed, while acknowledging the generous increases in most payments.  I know some work has been done in the Dublin area to assist social welfare recipients but right around the country perhaps some measure could be introduced to provide a one-stop shop where people could be advised straight away in relation to when a budget announcement or any announcement is being made relevant to a social welfare recipient and as to when and how the payments will be made. Freepost was available prior to An Post becoming semi-State and I do not know whether it is still available.  Perhaps the Minister will also set up a freefone system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the last speaker concerning the importance of paying social welfare increases.  In the next section or two of the Bill I will have much to say about the child benefit scheme for which, for some <Col N="1898" /> unknown reason, an even later date than applies to the payments we are talking about is provided for.  The Minister present is not the only Minister concerned; for as far back as I can remember there was a time lag between budget day and the dates the increases were paid. What is the reason?  At one time we did not have the technology that is available now and it was not possible to implement the increases before certain dates by virtue of the change of rates and so on and the numbers of recipients in the system. That can hardly be the case now.  From experience I had in another Department I am sure we can very readily overcome that.  It is amazing what can be done about issuing cheques and so on in a short two or three year period.  This year the 4 per cent increase will have evaporated entirely by July when increases in VAT and fuel prices are to apply.  More important, rent increases for local authority houses even in rural areas have been very steep this year.  At my clinics many people, all on social welfare, are unable to pay the local council the increase in the rent demanded.  If ever there was a year the increases should be paid as quickly as possible this is the year.  What can we expect in the future in this regard? Is it possible that next year or the year after, we can expect an announcement on budget day and 30 days later all the recipients will get is what they were absolutely entitled to?</P>

      <P>The main points made by a number of Deputies relate to the date of payment.  The amendments put down bringing the date forward to April were ruled out of order on the grounds of cost. Deputy Stagg raised the question of VAT changes.  In fact, the Minister for Finance gave away a net £37 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in VAT changes which resulted in the Minister having to find the money elsewhere &mdash; an overall <Col N="1899" /> reduction in the level of the consumer price index which includes the items to which Deputies refer.</P>
      <P>A wide variety of household items were reduced in price by the Minister for Finance because of changes in VAT in the budget.  About that time I found a circular from one of the local supermarket groups to the effect that 5,000 ordinary household items had been reduced in cost because of the lowering of VAT.  We should keep this in perspective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked at the list.  It is true that a large volume of household items were reduced in price by the Minister for Finance.  It cost a lot of extra money to make that adjustment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. I appreciate that and the Minister for Finance has been anxious to ensure that the benefit would be passed on.  Certain investigations were carried out in that area.  Certainly our local supermarkets were passing it on.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation differential rents are a matter for Dublin Corporation. Naturally we are concerned that people should be able to keep as much as possible of the increase we provide.  The corporation normally take into consideration the fact that the increases are intended to cover other items as well. The Deputy is a member of the corporation and he and others can air that question there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> Deputy Callely referred to one-stop-shops and we wish to have as many of those as we can.  We are increasing the number of information officers throughout the country.  I agree with the Deputy's point about the need for one-stop-shops and to provide immediately the information people require.</P>
    <P>In relation to the freefone system, we provide freefone for certain specific items, for instance, the FIS.  We provided a freefone service for a week after the budget and this was well used.</P>
    <P>The basic question relates to the timescale involved in the increases.  Deputy Callely made the point, as did Deputy Connaughton, that for a number of years the commencement date for increases had been July and not April.  Over the last eight years increases have been provided from July.  During the sixties and early seventies the date was October for instance payments, with assistance payments taking place from August each year.  During 1973-75 increases took effect from July.  In 1987 in the budget proposed by the Labour Fine Gael Coalition the increases were deferred until November 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we brought it forward again to July.  The cost here is important.  The relevant Minister if he or she is wise will want to get the biggest increase possible that can be applied to the payments.  We must remember that once the increase is given it is there for good.  If it comes in from July it is in for all of the next and subsequent years.  If one gets a smaller increase, as happened <Col N="1901" /> with some other Governments before our Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In terms of the funds available this year my objective was to give the highest level of increases which are there from the day they are installed.  I hope that clarifies the position.  It is a question of priorities, of getting the higher rates.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that officers of the Eastern Health Board area do an excellent job providing the supplementary allowance when necessary. The people who go to a health centre in need of supplementary welfare allowance may be emotionally upset and highly strung.  They may not have found themselves in this position before and may find it difficult to deal with the questions asked.  A lot of good work is being done by most of the welfare officers in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment, I would point out that the short term unemployed are getting an increase of 11 per cent.  The amendment also refers to supplementary welfare allowances.</P>

      <P>There is a 4 per cent increase across the board.  We are not opposing the increase but opposing the fact that the Government are not paying it in time.  Regarding community welfare officers, I am well aware of the volume of work required to be done by them arising from the increased number of people living in poverty.  Nobody gets any money from a community welfare officer unless he or she is in dire poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  The community welfare officers are under severe pressure due to the increased incidence of poverty. In my health board area, of which Deputy Callely is the chairman, new instructions, of which the Deputy must be well aware, have been issued to community welfare officers.  They have to get proof of everything in writing.  Birth certificates, marriage certificates, receipts for the pram and receipts for the mattress must be supplied.  That is new.  Deputy Callely is newly appointed as chairman of the Eastern Health Board as well.  There are huge discrepancies between what happens not just as between health boards but as between one health centre and another where there are different <Col N="1904" /> officers.  The guidelines seem to be woolly and they set out to punish the recipients.</P>

I know the Minister does not like any strong language to be used about officials and in most instances I would excuse the officials in view of the pressures upon them.  The old school of home assistance men are mostly retired.  Some of them are dead and they had huge funerals because all the poor to whom they were nasty went to their funerals.  Where the new school of young officers is operating, my experience is that there is no problem. The old officers may need a workshop to educate them on how to handle the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposed to the increases.  However, we are pointing out that the increases are inadequate.  The payment to an adult under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is £50 per week and Deputies on the other side of the House will appreciate that that amount of money does not do an awful lot to keep body and soul together.  Two adults will be collectively worse off because their entitlement, courtesy of the health board, will be £83 per week.  I would not be proud, as a TD in any political party, of those figures; they are miserable when put in their proper context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the people seeking assistance from the community welfare officers are the most genuinely poor, deprived and disadvantaged in our society.  I take on board that there is a tendency for TDs to listen to their constituents' complaints and be shocked at <Col N="1906" /> what we hear about the happenings in the health board clinics.  That is not to suggest that people, not least our constituents, are not telling the truth.  Politicians tend to listen to their constituents and unless they have proof that contradicts what they are hearing from them tend to take what they say at face value.  I have on occasion gone to a number of health centres, although I do not tend to do this.  I went to the health centre on Cashel Road, Crumlin, because a constituent had complained about the difficulty she was having.  What shocked me most were the difficult conditions under which these people had to queue in the open, the sparse facilities.  The huge numbers shocked me.  There was no system of queuing and nobody knew exactly where he was in the queue.  It was like cattle going on board the B &amp; I.  It was horrendous and I found it very disturbing. In fact I went to view another centre in the inner city and I was not happy with what I saw also.</P>
    <P>These vulnerable people, the poorest in our society, have to seek assistance under very bad conditions.  I wish to put on record that I do most of my work on the telephone and I deal with health board officials regularly and I have nothing but pleasantness from the community welfare officers.  I do not know to what extent the allegations made against them are factual, we take what we hear at face value, but we have to accept, of course, that some of the complaints must be genuine.  The work of community welfare officers is horrendous.  Perhaps a case could be made for retraining them and allowing them to deal directly with the public on a week on, week off basis.  That would allow them to alternate between office work and dealing with the public. They face a very trying time.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with other aspects of section 4.  When one compares what is being offered in the Bill with what was recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, one will see that many areas remain to be addressed.  Under supplementary welfare allowances, the Commission made two recommendations one of which is that there should be clear <Col N="1907" /> guidelines for discretionary payments available under the scheme.  The absence of guidelines creates tremendous confusion for the public and politicians. Everybody knows somebody who has gone to a community welfare officer and had his or her case rejected while a person supposedly of similar circumstances and family size receives benefit from a more friendly or humane community welfare officer in another area.</P>
    <P>The Commission recommended that the supplementary welfare allowances at present administered by health boards should be administered directly by the Department of Social Welfare, as the health boards are administering the money of the Department of Social Welfare. Will the Minister comment on the progress been made in this regard?  It is important that the Department of Social Welfare are structured to administer supplementary welfare allowances.  In addition, has the Minister done any work on the guidelines for discretionary payments? The report recommends that the guidelines should be reviewed every two years.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended that the income needs of young people aged between 16 and 18 years should be met by reform of the social welfare scheme. Has the Minister addressed this issue? The Commission also recommended that in assessing the means of single adults living at home, board and lodgings should not be counted except for those aged under 25 years.  Will the Minister comment on the progress he has made to meet this recommendation?  I congratulate the Minister on giving a minimum payment of £5 to everybody who is eligible for social assistance but I criticise him for not implementing in full the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare, that single people aged between 18 and 25 should be assessed on their board and lodgings but should be entitled at least to £10 per week regardless of their parents' income.  The 1985 report of the Commission on Social Welfare is the bible for social welfare as far as I am concerned.  The Minister has gone <Col N="1908" /> nowhere near conforming to the very progressive and worthwhile recommendations of the Commission.  People who will get £5 per week under this Bill are those who qualify for social assistance having been means-tested but the Commission argued that irrespective of the household income a person should get a minimum payment of £10 per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent 20 minutes on self praise, as Deputy Stagg said.  He was attempting to make us believe that he was surpassing the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, but he has not gone anywhere near meeting their recommendation on unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wanted to rise on this occasion to say that while I can accept very readily what my colleague, Deputy Fennell, has said about an incident, these things happen unfortunately.  As has been pointed out also, many of these workers are under tremendous pressure; there are queues and so on.  It would be unfair of me not to compliment them on the work they do. When there is a problem, when somebody is in need of help immediately, I find that they are tremendously helpful. I suppose all of us as TDs fall down on the job at times as well; we come under pressure.  It is only fair that we should appreciate what they do because they rescue people in poverty and in difficulty who need help.  There is an ideal way of doing things that is not always done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would worry more sometimes about people in the Civil Service handling situations. The other day, for example, I <Col N="1910" /> rang up one of the Minister's sections and when I got through the person who answered the telephone told me to hold on a minute and left down the telephone for about five minutes.  I did not mind but when he came back I said to him that it just so happened that I was a TD but what would happen if I had been ringing from Kerry &mdash; I asked the Minister about putting in a free phone service at one stage.  He proceeded to give me a lecture to the effect that TDs do not get any special treatment.  I just could not get a word in edgeways.  Eventually I said to him that when he had calmed down I was not looking for special treatment; I was only worrying about the cost of a telephone call.  I asked him if that was the way a long distance telephone caller would be treated.</P>
    <P>Again I have to say he is the exception because I find that 99 times out of 100 the officials we deal with are very helpful and have a good sense of humour.  There is always this bad apple in a pile.  In fairness he should be taken away from telephones and told to use a megaphone because he should not be dealing with the public.  However he is the exception. People dealing with people in trouble are often under pressure themselves but I think they do a very good job.</P>

      <P>Much has been said about the community welfare officers working within the health centres.  In particular Deputies Fennell, Stagg and Byrne referred to Eastern Health Board areas and isolated incidents.  I hope they are isolated incidents.  I also wish to refer to <Col N="1911" /> what Deputy Stagg said about a very rigid regime being operated by officers and the policy of the Eastern Health Board with a large set of new recruits.  He was implying, maybe, that they were faceless officers interrogating individuals looking for assistance.  I would like to indicate that there are no such new faceless officers within the Eastern Health Board area.  There is no such rigid policy.  I take this opportunity to say that if Deputies have difficulty at any time I would greatly appreciate it if they would bring it to the attention of any of the board members or managerial officers of the Eastern Health Board to have it investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

      <P>Or the chairman, of course.  I would be happy to assist.  If there was a rigid regime in place, that would restrict the community welfare officers on occasions when they have to be flexible.  Once again I want to put on the record of the House our appreciation of the excellent job that most community welfare officers carry out in very difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the Minister's work in relation to what he described as the bible on social welfare, the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The record speaks for itself. The Minister has done an excellent job in the whole area of social welfare and that has been recognised not alone inside this House but outside it as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has streamlined the whole area of social welfare.  He has improved payments.  That cannot go unnoted and it is unfair of Deputy Byrne to refer to the Minister in the way he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputy for his assurances on that matter. In principle I disagree with this allowance. It should be changed because it is demeaning and humiliating and is subject <Col N="1912" /> to decisions by people who have no guidelines to follow.</P>
      <P>I do not like complaining about officials.  Nobody who is doing a job like this goes out of his way to complain and I am not somebody who would make trouble.  The vast majority of community welfare officers are doing the best job they can and they are under great pressure; but where somebody is not doing as good a job as they should and is being unpleasant something should be done because people can suffer from that.  I certainly would take the Minister up on his invitation.  My experience was not similar to Deputy Byrne's.  Two people were being rehoused, one from another area and from the constituency, and the difference in application of the benefits to each of them was so dramatic I have to question it.  It was not just a question of the person making the application being emotional.  An appointment had been made in a new flat that had been allocated to the women.  She took her year-and-a half-old baby out and got two buses to be there.  The community welfare officer did not turn up but left her high and dry. That is not good enough.  I would object strongly if somebody did that to me for any reason.  I want to make the point that where there is an officer that is unpleasant or unhelpful or downright nasty, something should be done.  Maybe the job they are doing on a daily, weekly, monthly basis is too awful and they get into a situation where the world seems like a very miserable place, and perhaps they should be moved or rotated into some other work.</P>

      <P>He would certainly be welcome to answer all the complaints or any of the complaints.  This seems to be a specific complaint.  It has been fairly well aired by a number of Deputies.  If the <Col N="1913" /> Deputy likes to give us details afterwards we will certainly take it up with the health board.  As some Deputies have said, at the end of the day we are paying for the service and it is administered by the health board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised other questions about the supplementary allowance scheme saying that she disagrees with the scheme anyway and thinks it should be abolished.  A lot more needs to be done with the scheme but there will always be a discretionary payment.  The objective should be to reduce discretionary payments to the lowest level possible, by increasing the level of payments in the first instance, and ensuring that everybody has access to them.  The discretionary element has been reduced considerably by way of a number of schemes we have introduced, for instance, the back-to-school scheme which eliminated the discretionary element, leaving one scheme applicable right across the country with one set of rules and conditions though they may not always have been applied in exactly the same way.</P>

        <i>Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>I was represented by a number of my officials at the Irish Sea Conference, which was held in the Isle of Man from 22 to 24 October 1990.  I have given detailed consideration to the conclusions arising from the conference.</P>
      <P>In relation to monitoring and research in the Irish Sea, existing co-operative arrangements between Ireland and the UK have been taken a stage further by the establishment of an Irish Sea Co-ordination Group.  The group will have the assistance of a scientific co-ordinator and its reporting procedure will be decided in conjunction with the UK and Irish authorities.  The aims of the group will be to promote the review of existing and proposed scientific programmes which will include accidental and operational discharges from ships.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the UK have also agreed to work together to establish formal arrangements for co-operation and co-ordination in dealing with pollution incidents in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>Arrangements in respect of both of the above matters are in train.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the information he has given the House in regard to some steps being taken to set up such a secretariat.  In view of the fact that pollution of the Irish Sea is of such danger at present surely the proposed secretariat should deal with more than discharge from ships and pollution incidents and that probably the day-to-day pollution of the Irish Sea is the most urgent matter requiring attention?  Is the Minister aware that, at an Irish Sea symposium held recently by the north of England Zoological Society speakers pointed out that the Irish Sea was contaminated by human wastes, notably refuse, petroleum oils, dredged material, human bacteria and viruses, heavy metals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I might remind her that the Irish and United Kingdom Governments have agreed to work together to establish formal arrangements for co-operation and co-ordination when dealing with pollution incidents in the Irish Sea; those arrangements are in train.  Their purpose is to improve overall management of the Irish Sea, integrating the research efforts on the part of the United Kingdom and Irish Governments.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy O'Sullivan's assertion that the recent Gulf war posed a serious threat to this country in relation to its deep sea shipping requirements. The carriage of bulk commodities to and from Ireland was unaffected and would in all likelihood have remained unaffected had the conflict taken longer to resolve.</P>
      <P>The reasons this was the case are straightforward.  There were numerous alternative sources of supply for all our main bulk imports and in fact only a very small proportion of total world trade was affected to any significant extent by the conflict.  With the exception of oil prices which rose for a time in the immediate aftermath of the invasion of Kuwait, the conflict had no discernible effect on Ireland's trade.  Of course confidence was shaken and this delayed investment decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> In the circumstances, the re-establishment of a national deep sea shipping line is not an issue of immediate urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the decision by a previous Government to liquidate Irish Shipping Limited, which cost taxpayers £100 million, was an act of national sabotage leaving this country very vulnerable in the post-1992 era endeavouring to compete in a European market in which we will be the only complete island State? Have the Government now changed their position from that expressed in a motion in this House in 1985 to the effect that the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited should be paid adequate redundancy payments and that a strategic deep sea national shipping fleet should be established?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The package of shipping incentives initiated by this Government in 1987 included the Irish fleet having been expanded from 141,926 deadweight tonnes to 190,319 deadweight tonnes, representing an increase of more than 34 per cent.  In addition, the Central Statistics Office figures show a small increase from 1 per cent to 2 per cent in export volumes for 1990 over 1989 for the period from January to November.  I am satisfied that the questions which have been tabled by the Deputy is not of immediate urgency but, as has been proved, the matter is kept under constant consideration by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we were very lucky the Gulf war was short lived?  The strategic importance of a deep sea fleet affecting this country could not be underlined sufficiently. In the event of the Gulf war escalating or being prolonged, our crude oil supplies could have been adversely <Col N="1918" /> affected as we do not have tankers capable of bringing that oil ashore.  Is it not a fact that there was not one ferry ship available when the Gulf war was in progress as every vessel was taken up by other countries and we were left in a very vulnerable position?  The question specifically asks whether the Minister for the Marine has changed his stance about providing a deep sea fleet.  He is on record as having said he was looking for a deep sea fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> There is no change in the stance but it is a question of priorities.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that every Government must have priorities.  I do not accept &mdash; and I have already stated in the reply &mdash; that the Gulf war would have had any detrimental effect with regard to our deep sea fishing fleet or trade between Ireland and many other countries.  The current market demand for large deep sea bulk carriers is weak.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, overcapacity continues to be a problem and a significant proportion of the world's bulk fleet is either laid up or bound for the breakers yard.  The slump in world shipping demands during the greater part of the last decade resulted in a major drop in new building investment.  At the beginning of the eighties, the age profile of the world's fleet showed that the percentage of vessels under ten years old was 62 per cent; by 1989 less than 36 per cent were in this bracket.  This trend reflects the low earnings of such vessels over the period, which were not sufficient to finance replacements costs and yield a reasonable return on capital.  In the circumstances it would be imprudent, if not foolhardy, to commit the State to a major investment of taxpayers' money in a shipping sector which has such doubtful prospects but, nevertheless, it is being kept in mind on a continuous basis.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The task of the recently established Review Group on Commercial Harbours and Pilotage Policy and Legislation is to identify those aspects of existing legislation which need up dating and to make recommendations regarding a revised legislative code and policy for commercial ports and pilotage. The review group which is chaired by Mr. Patrick Murphy, managing director, Minch Norton Limited/Irish Malt Exporters is comprised as follows: Ald.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The answer to the first question is no.  It is generally accepted that existing harbours and pilotage legislation is no longer appropriate to present day needs.  The Harbours Act, 1946, was based on the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal of 1930 and the pilotage legislation dates from 1913.  The group have not been given terms of reference.  Their task is to identify those aspects of existing legislation which constrain a modern port.  The present structure of harbour boards needs to be examined, as does the extent of ministerial and departmental control on the day-to-day activities of ports.  The group will be required to make recommendations for a revised legislative code and policy for commercial ports.  In doing this they will have regard to the challenges presented by the national development plan, the completion of the internal market and the need for competitiveness of Irish trade and industry.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I accept what the Deputy has said to a certain degree.  The Common Fisheries Policy will be up for review very shortly.  My Department and I are preparing for this review and we will be very much involved in it.  I will take into consideration what the Deputy has said.  I am satisfied that our fishing industry has made real progress, particularly the processing industry. Further progress can be made in this area.  Since 1987 the Government's investment in the marine sector through funding for BIM and support for the aquaculture industry has enabled these targets to be reached.  The figures speak for themselves.  Of course, we would all like to see greater output in the fishing industry and both the Minister and I are looking at the ways and means by which we can build on targets we have achieved.</P>

Secondly, is it not the case that the numbers employed in fishing will decline as a result of the restrictions imposed on our fleet and quotas?  A man in my constituency was recently refused a loan by BIM to buy a vessel which would have enabled him employ an additional four people.  This practice is commonplace and people cannot get into the fishing industry. People are signing on at labour exchanges who could usefully be employed in the fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a recent report published by the British Consumer Association that is critical of safety standards on certain ferries operating on the Irish Sea.  As Minister with responsibility for safety at sea, I am naturally concerned at any report that is critical of safety standards on board ferries operating in and out of Ireland.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that all such ferries adhere to the highest international standards of safety, including evacuation systems, as laid down by the International Maritime Organisation. Irish registered ferries are required to undergo an annual inspection by my Department's Marine Survey Office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates, and foreign-registered vessels using Irish ports may be inspected under the terms of the IMO's Safety of Life at Sea Convention and also the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, to which Ireland is a contracting party.</P>
      <P>In regard to criticism of safety standards on board B &amp; I ferries, I should point out that the most important part of any safety plan on board ship is the ability of the crew to respond effectively to an emergency.  In this respect B &amp; I have a good record.  Following the fire on board the <i>Norrona</i> last year, the master and crew of the <i>Norrona</i> were awarded a certificate of commendation by the chief fire officer of Dyfed County Fire Brigade in recognition of the manner in which they controlled the fire, effected rescues and ensured the safety of the passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are working on an ongoing basis to ensure that the highest standards of safety are achieved on all ferries using Irish ports, both in the context of the International Maritime Organisation at international level and the National Ferry Safety Committee at domestic level.  New regulations have been introduced on foot of the report of the Report of the Formal Inquiry into <Col N="1929" /> the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> disaster. Further regulations will be introduced as appropriate, based on the expert advice and recommendations of the Marine Survey Office, the National Ferry Safety Committee and the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the Minister of State in paying tribute to the crew for the way in which they dealt with the recent event &mdash; it could have turned out to be a very bad accident &mdash; and would like to think that all future events will be handled in the same efficient way. Can the Minister of State tell us if the new regulations being drawn up will acknowledge that to have a large number of passengers using rope ladders is not the most effective or efficient way of disembarking passengers in the event of emergency?  Would he further agree that this is a matter of some concern in relation to the safe evacuation of passengers and could lead to a negative attitude to ferry travel among travellers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Deputy is correct.  I want to say that B &amp; I and Irish Ferries vessels comply fully with Irish regulations which are based on IMO standards.  Rope ladders will always form an integral part of any evacuation system, at least as an alternative if other systems should fail.  New regulations, which will implement amendments to the IMOs Safety of Life at Sea Convention, are currently being prepared.  These require that vessels should be fitted with appliances, such as lifeboats or davit launched life rafts, for lowering passengers into the water. These regulations however only apply to vessels built after 1986.  It is likely that the retrospective fitting of alternative systems to ferries would require major and, possibly, extensive conversion work.  Of the new dry shod systems favoured by <i>Which</i> davit launched systems are excellent. Marine escape systems however which use chutes have not been tried or tested in bad weather conditions.  The key to an effective evacuation is a well trained crew.  This issue is being <Col N="1930" /> addressed by the National Ferry Safety Committee on a continuing basis and at seminars organised by the committee.  It is indeed worth noting that following the fire on board the <i>Norrona</i> last April the master crew were awarded a certificate of commendation by the chief fire officer of the Dyfed County Fire Brigade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>is the Minister of State not concerned that there has now been a succession of incidents, including fires on board ferries operating in the Irish Sea, and that a report from the British Consumer Association has criticised the safety standards on board six ferries operating on the Irish sea who evacuate passengers using rope ladders along the sides of ships?  Would the Minister of State not agree that this represents a devastating blow at the very beginning of the season for our tourism industry?  Can he tell us if he has made any attempt, since the publication of the report, to make contact with the ferry operators to establish if they have any plans to improve their safety standards and introduce the more modern dry shod evacuation methods in an effort to reassure passengers travelling on vessels on the Irish sea?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am concerned about the illegal activities of de-registered, former Community vessels, fishing off our south and south-west coasts.  In particular, I am most concerned about the serious detrimental impact that the use of massive gill nets by these vessels will have on fish stocks in the area.  In my view it is essential that these illegal activities be eliminated <Col N="1932" /> quickly so that the legitimate rights of fishermen to fish in these waters are protected.</P>
      <P>As a means of addressing this major threat to our fishermen, the Naval Service have been asked to intensify their efforts against such illegal operators.  The matter has also been raised at recent meetings with senior EC Commission officials with the intention of finding some means of bringing these activities to an end.  In addition, I have asked that the matter be included on the agenda of the forthcoming Council of Fisheries Ministers in mid April with a view to initiating a Community-based strategy aimed at ending these illegal operations.  I am now informed that that item will be on the agenda for the April meeting.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Minister's reply it does not go far enough towards meeting the serious problem off the Cork-Kerry coast.  Serious encounters have taken place between our native trawlers and Spanish trawlers.  The Minister for Marine is well aware of this and that the fishing rights of our trawlers have been impinged by these foreign trawlers.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister has already taken up this matter with his Spanish counterpart.  In addition to having it placed on the agenda for the April meeting he also intends taking it up again with the Spanish Minister.  While the problem affects our fishermen, to a certain extent it is a Community problem and needs a Community-based solution. The matter was also raised on the recent visit to this country by the Director General of fishing.  As I have already stated, the naval service has been alerted and have been making strenuous efforts to deal with such vessels, some of which have been arrested in recent times.  There is a request for a greater naval and air <Col N="1933" /> corps presence.  It still would be a daunting task to tackle the problem because of the vast number of vessels involved, but we are tackling it.  As I have said, the matter is on the agenda for the April meeting of the Council of Ministers, and the Minister will be taking it up directly with his Spanish counterpart.</P>

We noted in recent months that a sizeable fleet of deregistered fishing vessels are fishing hake and monkfish, mainly off the south and south-west coasts.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to reports that the toxic substance, TBT, has been found in the middle of the North Sea at levels which could harm wildlife; if any survey has been undertaken of levels of TBR in the Irish Sea; if there are any plans to restrict the use of anti-fouling paints used on ships which contain TBT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Anti-fouling paints including tributyltins (TBTs) are pesticides within the meaning of the European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations, 1985 and 1987. Under these regulations only pesticides which have clearance by the Department of Agriculture and Food can be sold.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent avoidable damage to the marine and freshwater environments my predecessor used his powers under the Fisheries Acts to make By-Law No. 657 of 1987 which prohibits the use of TBT based anti-fouling paints on any part of a pier, jetty, building or other structure which is on or in either the sea or freshwater.  The by-law also prohibits the use of such paints on boats under 25 metres in length except where such boats are used solely on the sea and whose hulls are made of aluminium alloy.</P>
      <P>The reports to which the Deputy refers probably relate to measurements of organotins, which include TBT, in German and Dutch coastal waters in the German Bight which is not in the middle of the North Sea.  I understand that the results of these measurements are preliminary.</P>
      <P>Waters most likely to be affected by TBT are portal areas adjacent to harbours, docks and marinas; there is no evidence to suggest that TBT is a hazard to the marine environment in open sea areas such as the Irish Sea.  Since the TBT ban was introduced in Ireland in 1987 there is evidence that Irish coastal waters are recovering from the effects of TBT usage in the past.</P>

Until the formal contract document has been signed, I am precluded from discussing the terms of same other than to say that a Sikorsky S61N aircraft modified to permit safe operation in extreme weather conditions is to be provided by the contractors.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Government's environment action programme announced the Government decision to ban all dumping at sea of industrial wastes from 31 December 1995.  This accords with the decision of the Oslo Commission, taken in Dublin in June of 1989, to cease the dumping of industrial waste in the North Sea by 31 December 1989 and in the rest of the Oslo Convention area by 31 December 1995 unless it could be shown that there were no practical alternatives for disposal on land and the wastes caused no harm to the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The three Irish based companies currently authorised to dump industrial waste at sea are preparing to switch to land based disposal at an early date within the agreed time frame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The global agreement adopted at the last meeting of contracting parties to the London Dumping Convention, held at <Col N="1938" /> the headquarters of the International Maritime Organisation in October and November last year, is similar to the regional agreement adopted by the Oslo Commission in 1989.

    <P>Dún Laoghaire Harbour is owned and managed by the Department of the Marine under the Dún Laoghaire Harbours Act, 1990.  It was formerly under the control of the Commissioners of Public Works under the State Harbours Act, 1924.

    <P>A number of harbours, or parts of harbours on the west coast are the responsibility of the Department of the Marine.  These were either built in accordance with the Marine Works (Ireland) Act, 1902, or were formerly under the control of the Congested Districts Board and transferred to the fisheries branch of the Department of Agriculture <i>circa</i> 1923.</P>

    <P>The vast bulk of the remainder of harbours, piers and landing places are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  In many cases, this responsibility derives from the adaptation of the Irish Enactments Order, 1899 to the Grand Juries Act, 1853.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Decisions in relation to the granting of applications for registration on the current Sea Fishing Boat Register are matters for the registrar general of fishing boats.</P>
      <P>I understand from the registrar general that the vast bulk of applications for registration on the Sea Fishing Boat Register have been successful.  From approximately 1,850 applications, some 1,450 boats have been registered to date.  In addition about another 120 applications are still the subject of correspondence between the registrar general and the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it important to stress that unsuccessful applications were refused either on the grounds that satisfactory evidence of the sea-worthiness of the boats concerned could not be provided or that the applicants did not hold current sea fishing boat licences in respect of the boats in question.  Where such applicants are now in a position to meet these requirements, <Col N="1945" /> the registrar general will.  I am informed, be prepared to consider their case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the restrictions this new fishing boat register has brought about and how it has prevented hundreds of Irish fishermen from seeking a livelihood at sea?  To pass it over to the registrar, as the Minister has stated, does not seem fair.  Surely it is a matter for the Minister for the Marine to see that adequate provision is made to have all boats fishing off our coast registered.  Does he not agree?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Of course it is a matter ultimately for the Minister for the Marine, but all fishing boats must have a sea fishing boat licence before registration can take place.  I must be satisfied, with regard to the applicants who were not successful to date, of the sea-worthiness of the boats concerned and that the applicants hold a current sea fishing boat licence in respect of the boats in question.  If they comply with that there is no problem about registration.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> My Department have no proposals for a coast protection scheme for the south County Dublin coastline.  The primary responsibility for coast protection does however rest with the relevant local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the Dáil on 13 February 1990, I was not then persuaded that the Coast Protection Act, 1963 was necessarily the best vehicle for dealing with proposals for coast protection schemes.  I am also aware of the considerable dissatisfaction that has been expressed at the long and complex procedures required by that Act.  A more flexible approach has since been adopted. The policy of my Department is to facilitate the implementation of permanent schemes, where warranted, to prevent <Col N="1949" /> progressive erosion by the sea subject of course to availability of adequate finance.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that in 1979 Dublin County Council submitted a proposal under the Coast Protection Act, 1963 for a coast protection scheme for the south County Dublin coastline?  That was made to the Office of Public Works who were then responsible for it.  Is the Minister now telling us that since he has taken over responsibility for this brief the proposed coast protection scheme for the south County Dublin coastline has been lost?  Over that 12 year period the coastline has been eroded by between four and five yards.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> State funds for coastal protection was transferred to my Department in 1990.  One example of how the departmental policy is operating concerns the North Beach, Arklow.  Wicklow County Council, employing consulting engineers, recently completed a major coastal protection scheme with 50 per cent grant assistance from the Department.  All coastal works depend on a contribution from the local authority under the Act and we are drawing up a list of priorities.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to state that, rather than abide too closely by the inflexible Coast Protection Act, 1963, his Department had invested in permanent schemes.  How many of those permanent schemes are there and how <Col N="1951" /> many are on the east coast?  Considering the badly resourced local authorities, is it not totally unacceptable that 50 per cent funding should be expected to be given by the local authorities for such an expensive project?</P>

(6) Deputy John Connor &mdash; The urgent need for the Minister for Education to sanction funding to link St. Joseph's College, Summerhill, Athlone to Monksland sewerage scheme in view of the fact that the underground link in this proposed project must cross sections of the new Athlone relay road now nearing completion and the absolute economic justification that all works be incorporated in one scheme.  (7) Deputy Brendan Howlin &mdash; The urgent need for the Minister for Education to sanction the much needed new school for the town of Wexford VEC in view of the unacceptable condition of existing facilities <Col N="1979" /> and the threatened withdrawal by members of the Teachers' Union of Ireland from substandard classrooms. (8) Deputy Michael Kitt &mdash; If, in the context of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communication's discussions with Telecom Éireann on the system of charges for telephone calls, he will investigate the inordinate number of telephone codes in County Galway and the question of local call charges within the county.  (9) Deputy Alan Shatter &mdash; The provision of a grant by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to provide for the travel expenses and other costs that will be incurred by the four young Irish people selected to play in the European Concert Band over the Easter holiday period.

(14) Deputy Joe Sherlock &mdash; The reduction in the hours of the care attendance scheme operated by the Irish Wheelchair Association for handicapped and disabled people and their families due to funding cutbacks by the Southern Health Board.  (15) Deputy Eric Byrne &mdash; The failure to roster public service vehicle inspectors for duty at weekends and the effects of this in hampering the Garda actions in improving road safety standards.  (16) Deputy Tony Gregory &mdash; The report on Dublin's north inner city commission by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent De Paul outlining the failure of Government policies to help those most in need in this acutely disadvantaged area as reported in the <Col N="1980" /> media (details supplied).  (17) Deputy John V. Farrelly &mdash; If the Minister for the Environment will outline the plans he has to provide sufficient funds to repair the N52 between Kells and Ardee and if he is aware that Meath County Council are considering closure of the road because of inadequate funds.  (18) Deputy Seán Ryan &mdash; Whether the Minister for Education will outline the safeguards that are being taken by the English Football Association and the British police force to ensure the safety of both the Irish and English supporters at next Wednesday's soccer international in Wembley.

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1991: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fennell raised a specific complaint which we will take up with the Eastern Health Board.  Deputy Byrne raised the matter of the Department of Social Welfare taking over the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This has a lot of different implications.  As we develop the localisation of services we are in a better position to operate the scheme locally. We have been taking a number of steps to facilitate and regularise payments of supplementary welfare allowance.  The Deputy asked about rents and mortgages. We have revised the relevant guidelines and unified them throughout the country.  The exceptional needs payments are being considered.  It is a more difficult matter to unify these on a nationwide basis but they are being standardised as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Stagg and Byrne would like to see greater increases, as would most people.  The increases being given are, however, very substantial.  Deputy Stagg mentioned an increase of 4 per cent.  In many instances rates of assistance are being increased by far more than 4 per cent.  The supplementary welfare allowance, which is a basic fall-back allowance, is being increased by 11 per cent, bringing the personal rate up to £50.  I would point out that the adult dependant and child dependant rates of supplementary welfare allowance are at the full rate of £33 for an adult and £12 for a child.  The increased supplementary welfare allowance of £50, plus £33 for a dependent spouse, gives £83 for a married couple, an increase of £7.  A husband and wife with three children on supplementary welfare allowance receive an extra £10 a <Col N="1982" /> week.  We are closing the gap in relation to the priority rates recommended by the commission, which in 1991 terms would be £54.60.  We are raising the personal rate to £50, but the combined rate is much closer to the priority rate because the adult dependant rates are unified, except for some few which are much higher. The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme will be further considered in the development of the whole system and arrangements for payment.</P>
    <P>In the area of assistance, the increases are in most cases above 4 per cent.  The increase in short term unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and carer's allowance is 11 per cent. The increase in long term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and single woman's allowance is 6 per cent. They went up by 11 per cent in each of the last three years.  The lowest rates now are the supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance. The allowance for an adult dependant which is payable with unemployment assistance, the pre-retirement allowance and the supplementary welfare allowance is being increased by 6.5 per cent.  The increase in respect of a spouse of an old aged pensioner is 5.7 per cent.  The child dependant allowance is going up by 9 per cent.  The new rates are set out in Schedule B to the Bill.  In almost all cases the increases are well above 4 per cent, which is the general rate of increase.  That is consistent with applying additional resources to those on the lowest payments.</P>
    <P>As a result of those increases, a couple with two children on long term unemployment assistance will get £112 per week, giving them an increase of £7 or 6.7 per cent; a couple with five children on short term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance will get £143 per week, which will make them £12 a week better off, an increase of 9 per cent.  The recipients of the carer's allowance will receive an 11 per cent increase. In the Schedule we see the changes in relation to the payments: almost all the <Col N="1983" /> payments are now above £50 and all the long term payments are above £55.  The rate for those with an adult dependant are £86.70 and £88 and a person on supplementary welfare allowance with an adult dependant will receive £83.  Those in receipt of a lone parent's allowance will receive an additional £14 for each child.  A family with three children in receipt of the old age or blind pension will get an extra £36.  Those in receipt of unemployment assistance or other allowance will receive £12 per child.</P>
    <P>Taken together, considerable increases have been given in each of these areas.  The number of beneficiaries of means tested payments is estimated at 349,000, and they will benefit from the increased payments.  Their dependants account for a further 329,800 people, giving a total of 679,000 people who will benefit from these measures.  With regard to the points made by Deputies Stagg and Byrne that the increases were only 4 per cent, it is very hard to find an example in this section where the increase was only 4 per cent.  The increases are mainly above 4 per cent.  Therefore their argument does not hold.  I want to make that very clear at this stage before they decide to vote against the increases in this section, which by any standard are very good.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised the matter that wives of persons in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance were being directed to sign on.  I will follow the matter up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Minister is capable of provoking me today.  Whether he knows it or not, he is doing his best to put it across that everything is rosy in the garden.  He denies our claims that the increases in certain areas are miserable.  He presents the increases in terms of percentage increases.  He argues that he has given percentage increases of 4 per cent, 9 per cent and 11 per cent in certain cases; but when you bring this down to figures, both widows and old age pensioners will get an increase of £2 per week.  They will get <Col N="1984" /> a £2 increase on £53, which brings their payment up to £55, and this puts it more clearly in context.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the trade union movement negotiated a 4 per cent increase; but a 4 per cent increase for somebody on the average industrial wage, perhaps it is £200 or £250 per week, the officials might know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The average male industrial wage is £240 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not too far out.  Let us take the example of the 4 per cent increase for a man in receipt of the average industrial wage and compare it with the increase for old age pensioners, a third of whom at least are male.  We are singing the praises of a 4 per cent increase for old age pensioners, which is 1 per cent above the rate of inflation, but the workforce got the same percentage increase on a much bigger base.  We are creating a society where the gap between those in receipt of welfare and those who are lucky enough to be at work and in receipt of a wage is getting wider.  Four per cent of the average industrial wage of £240 is substantially more than 4 per cent of £53.  All things are relative.  The income gap between old age pensioners, those in receipt of welfare and those trapped in poverty and those at work is widening as a result of the programme.  In criticising that part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I was addressing the area of social reform.  I felt that the disadvantaged did not get as good a deal as they were entitled to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me set the record straight.  I did not say that the increases in the particular section were 4 per cent but that the general payment increases were 4 per cent &mdash; that is a fact &mdash; and the Minister clarified that earlier on.  The Minister seems to be now misinterpreting what I said.  The reason I will not support this section is that the Minister continues to make payments in the middle of the year rather than at the beginning of the financial year, which we are seeking. That is the reason I will not be supporting <Col N="1985" /> this section.  I am not trying to provoke the Minister into another long reply because I am anxious to reach other amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Byrne will allow me to develop my point perhaps he will understand more clearly what I am saying.  Nobody on this side of the House believes that people on social welfare are already booking their flights to the South of France because of the increases they have received in this budget.  Of course the increases in the Social Welfare Bill are not enough.  They are never enough. The reality is that our resources are not infinite.  The increases are over and above the projected rate of inflation for the year to which the increases relate.  That is real progress.  That is a real increase.  That is redistribution.  I do not know how Deputy Byrne envisages we should redistribute resources within this economy.</P>

      <P>His party were adherents in the past of an ideology that has proved to be a failure all over Eastern Europe. The Government are trying to develop the economy and spread the fruits of that economic development around as fairly as possible among all sections of the population.  Deputy Byrne said that if we increase the average industrial wage by the same rate as we increase social welfare we are maintaining a gap between the people on social welfare and the people who are lucky enough to be in employment.  Deputy Byrne seems to overlook the fact that any increase given <Col N="1987" /> to people in employment will attract income tax at the top marginal rate.  That is something that does not apply to people on social welfare.</P>

      <P>Second, Deputy Byrne seems also unaware that various members of his party have joined with all the other parties in this House criticising what we call the poverty trap, the fact that it is sometimes more profitable for people to stay on social welfare than to go out to work.  We should be trying to get away from that.  We should be trying to give people an incentive to work rather than to remain on social welfare.</P>

      <P>Long term unemployment assistance has increased by 6 per cent after increases of 11 per cent per annum for the last two years.  That is real progress and we should compliment and congratulate the Minister on it.  This debate has a certain familiarity.  I accept an equal degree of responsibility for this because I too participated in it, but when any party is on the Opposition benches they spend all their time in a debate like this criticising the Government for not providing enough social welfare and the Government reply that resources are not infinite.  That was a fact when the Government prior to 1987 were in power. Unfortunately it is still a fact, because <Col N="1988" /> of the very successful economic policies pursued since 1987, our resources are not as finite as they were.</P>
      <P>There are many other good things in the Bill which I have no doubt we will go on to debate.  There is provision for changing the method of payment to people in receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  That is something I heartily welcome.  We must try to get away from this Dickensian soup kitchen practice where people have to queue up for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance in full view of everybody else.</P>
      <P>This is only one improvement which was overdue and necessary this Minister has made in the administration of social welfare and he is to be congratulated on that.  He has not only improved the social welfare benefits in real terms but has made tremendous far reaching changes in the system of administering social welfare. Rome was not built in a day and we will not make all the necessary changes at once, but we are moving gradually in the right direction.  I want to thank the Minister for that.  He deserves the gratitude of everybody in receipt of social welfare for what he is doing in this regard.</P>
      <P>The debate is familiar.  The job of the Opposition is to oppose, regardless of how farcical it is to see Deputy Stagg telling us he is committing his party to voting against a provision of £164 million for social welfare.  In the present economic context that is not an inconsiderable provision.  It is a direct consequence of the successful economic policies being pursued by the Government that we can afford to give this, and that the Minister can provide the finances to go ahead and implement the other very necessary and desirable changes which he has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can think of things in the social welfare system that I could still criticise.  Of course in any big administrative system there will be things to criticise.  There will always be room for improvement. However, since his accession to the Department of Social Welfare in 1987, Deputy Woods has made considerable improvements.  The Government have <Col N="1989" /> provided considerable finances over and above the rate of inflation since 1987 as a result of which the lot of people on social welfare has improved in real terms no matter what the Opposition might say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that my amendments were not acceptable.  We have had a long discussion on various aspects of social welfare since 10.30 a.m. today and a great deal of relevant information has passed across the floor of the House.  The Minister has certainly made progress in the budget.  However, one of three black spots is the child benefit scheme.  For some strange reason the Minister has discriminated against children.  For my money, the child benefit scheme is the most direct way to help families financially.  I know of no better way.  With the exception of one at the higher income levels it avoids all the traps, and all the studies have shown that it is couples with families who are most likely to be below the poverty line.  Anybody charged with the responsibility of raising children understands that, but it is reasonable that we would state it on the floor of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to restate the importance of the child benefit scheme, which has been in existence for a long time and has been the subject of attack by one section of the community or another from time to time.  This scheme has many advantages.  Its first and most important one is that it is easily targeted, going to the people who have an immediate use for it.  I can think of hardly any household &mdash; because it is paid principally to the mother &mdash; that it does not benefit in a real way.  Unfortunately, because of the way our society is organised, a great number of the problems of rearing families, whether we like it or not, fall on women's shoulders.  Even though I speak against my own sex in that respect I have to say I know of no other allowance better used.  Nationwide, and particularly in the area I represent, it has kept body and soul together in many a family over many <Col N="1991" /> years.  I would not like anybody to dream of touching the child benefit scheme because it can be targeted where it is most needed and gives greatest benefit. In addition, because of the many problems encountered by children in our society today, the scheme has many advantages for them.</P>
    <P>In deciding how to implement budgetary increases the Minister came up with two crazy proposals.  For some strange reason &mdash; which must be of a budgetary nature &mdash; he decided that the first three children would not attract the extra £7.10 child benefit.  In other words, he was saying: hard luck on a family with three children only, we will intervene only where there are four or more children. Many studies undertaken have shown that families with two and three children are experiencing dire poverty although I freely admit that the greater the number of children the greater will be the degree of poverty experienced.</P>
    <P>It is an insult to the women and children of Ireland that the Minister decided to implement the relevant increase at a level which would debar, on my calculations, three out of every five families.  We are all aware there has been a dramatic reduction in the numbers of families with four or more children. Therefore, I contend that the demarcation line with regard to the increase is cynical.  I believed that the increase should have been given in respect of the second and additional children.  On the basis of any analysis one cares to use, no money paid by the Minister's Department does so much good for so many people.</P>
    <P>I have a real bee in my bonnet about the next point.  We spoke at length over the past two hours on the reasons, good and bad, various payments could not be effected until July next.  We were all of one mind that they should be paid earlier. The Minister made a reasonable shot at explaining to us why they could not be paid earlier.  But the increase in respect of child benefit will not be implemented until October next so that almost the entire year will have passed before that <Col N="1992" /> increase will be paid.  How can the Minister turn to the women and children of Ireland, say he believes in this scheme, and decide that their increase &mdash; which should be paid in tandem with all others &mdash; will not be paid for several additional months?  Whatever are the Minister's views, I contend it is a slight on the women and children of Ireland.  If, as I heard the Minister say on a number of occasions, child benefit is so important, then this is a very ham-fisted way of showing that concern.</P>
    <P>It is well to make the point that child benefit beats almost all the poverty traps. It is a straight monthly cash payment paid principally to mothers.  It is paid to all families, whether in receipt of social welfare, those on low incomes, where taxation does not count, or those in receipt of higher incomes liable to taxation; it does not matter, the mother receives that payment.  I contend that it is one of the most eagerly awaited payments from the Department of Social Welfare, particularly on the part of women.  I am terribly disappointed &mdash; because of the way the Minister has pitched the increase &mdash; he has excluded families with two and three children from reasonable benefit.  When replying perhaps the Minister would give us some indication of the numbers of families he has excluded which, on my calculations, are three out of every five. The Minister will have the most up-to-date figures available to him.  I should be glad if he would let us have them.</P>
    <P>No matter how one views it, I contend it is an attack on the women and children of Ireland.  Unless I hear something very different &mdash; I cannot understand how the Minister would have allowed it happen &mdash; I will be putting this to a vote.  I believe we owe it to the most important sector of our society, women, because, as a group, they shoulder 80 per cent of the problems of rearing families.</P>
    <P>I am particularly dissatisfied with this section.  I and my party will be putting it to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the child allowances, as they were then, should be <Col N="1993" /> improved and differentiated according to the ages of children with higher payments for older children and larger families. The child benefit allowance has been increased from £15.05 in 1986 to £15.80 in 1991.  I would be grateful to Deputy O'Dea, an expert on figures, if he would work out the relevant annual percentage increase that has led to an increase of 75p over that five-year period.  Perhaps he would inform the Minister, his officials, the House and the public at large of his calculations. In effect, there has been no increase whatever but rather a decrease in real value in child benefit between the years 1986 and 1991 with higher payments for the fifth and subsequent child to date, now being granted to the fourth child.</P>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I believe that a non-means tested payment to mothers on behalf of children probably constitutes the best method of targeting money where it is most needed.  I will go further and say I regret my proposal on the matter has been ruled out of order for the reason outlined earlier.  I proposed a combination of the child benefit allowance and family income supplement, effectively abolishing the family income supplement, since 30 per cent only of those entitled to it actually receive it. Only 30 per cent of those who are entitled to the family income supplement receive it according to figures from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearer to 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the maximum of up to 50 per cent, but in any case the scheme only half works so that it is a bad scheme and it does not get to where it is needed.  There is a resultant marginal tax rate of 100 per cent for people who claim family income supplement &mdash; in other words, if they receive an increase of £1 in their wages they will lose £1.  There is a marginal tax rate of 100 per cent for people in receipt of family income supplement. It is a very bad scheme and creates poverty traps all over the place. I propose that that scheme be abolished. <Col N="1994" /> That amendment is still on the amendments list and is in order and we will deal with it when we come to it.  I was combining that amendment in a package with the child benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>I propose, without charge to the Exchequer, that the child benefit scheme be increased from £15.80 per month per child to £43.50 per month per child and that there would be a special additional payment of £15 per month for each child over the age of 12 years.  Taking the cost of the family income supplement, if it operated properly at 100 per cent, and the cost of the present scheme into account and if the child benefit payment was taxable, which was my proposal, there would be no cost to the Exchequer and we would direct a huge amount of money where it is most needed.  We would direct it in a way that it would be untouchable by Governments of the future.  Governments can always take away from the poor because the poor are not organised in any sense, but if they touch child benefit the well-organised and often well-heeled lobbyists would go after them.  To get the strength of the rich on the side of the poor in this type of scheme would be to the eternal benefit of the poor.  That is why child benefit is sacrosanct and the reason Governments do not touch it.  For that reason I propose that it be used to a greater extent to end poverty traps, to direct the money where it is needed and to claw it back to where it is not needed through a tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child benefit scheme has been increased by 75p in five years.  We pay £3.65 per week per child through this scheme and we rely on a failed scheme called family income supplement.  It is a perfect mechanism for creating poverty traps.  This is a system whereby people are judged on an ongoing basis as to their entitlements &mdash; six weeks is the time span allowed &mdash; and, for every increase of £1 they receive, £1 is taken from them. There is absolutely no incentive to receive an increase in wages because you gain nothing; and sometimes you lose because family income supplement is not taken into account, at least in my local <Col N="1995" /> authority, for the purpose of local authority rents.  An increase of £1 would be taken into account and it could well mean that one would lose £2 as a result of receiving £1 in wages.  That type of system should be scrapped.  It was introduced as a temporary measure and the commission recommended that it should not be used any longer.</P>
    <P>We recognise that increases in child benefit, without any compensatory mechanisms, would be extremely expensive. For that reason we suggest to the Minister &mdash; we cannot formally propose it now because my amendment has been disallowed &mdash; that he look carefully at the idea of combining the two systems, possibly talking to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, take the child tax exemptions into account also and combine them in a package where they would be taxable and paid directly to the mother.  There is no hint or sign of the Minister moving in that direction.  We are still left with the situation where the child benefit is now £15.80, given that it was only £15.05 five years ago.  There has been a massive increase of 75p in that period.</P>
    <P>Taxing child benefit as I propose would clawback, it was estimated by the Revenue Commissioners when I asked them to examine it, 30 per cent of the total cost. Taking the two schemes into account, the family income supplement and the child benefit scheme, there would be no loss to the Exchequer; and, as Deputy Connaughton has said, this scheme directs money to where it is most needed.  Everybody agrees with that.  There is no way in which anybody can get at this money except the mother of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>Children are the group of people most liable to be at risk from poverty.  The Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI estimate that 40 per cent of all children are at high risk from poverty and that about that number live at or below the poverty line.  I would like to have seen the poverty line rejected by the Minister earlier today accepted and put into the legislation as a guideline for himself and for future Governments.  I would ask the <Col N="1996" /> Minister to look at my suggestions to see whether he can move along those lines. His proposal to give nothing in this budget to the vast majority of children and simply move on to the fourth child is not acceptable and I will not be supporting this section.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker's amendment, unfortunately our amendment was also ruled out of order.  Our amendment asked that the amount for each of the first three children be increased from £15.80 to £30 and the amount for each child in excess of three from the existing £22.90 to £40.  That amendment has been ruled out of order because it would incur a cost on the Exchequer.  Deputy O'Dea went on to suggest that The Workers' Party are always ranting and raving about spending more and more money and where was it to come from.  We heard those arguments before when it was alleged that The Workers' Party was being alarmist when we said there was a massive untapped pool of uncollected and unpaid taxes in the hands of the self-employed.  We as a party estimated that sum to be in the region of £250 million.  That estimate was treated by those in Fianna Fáil as an incredible big joke and a figment of the imagination of The Workers' Party.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne, this section deals with child benefits and payments.  I ask the Deputy to confine himself to what is in the section. I want to remind Deputies on all sides of the House that we must pursue this with some semblance of what is required under Standing Orders.  I know that inevitably there will be a passing reference to this, that and the other, but we must confine ourselves to child benefits.</P>

      <P>I am talking about child benefits and the amount payable under <Col N="1998" /> the child benefit scheme.  I have argued that these amounts should be substantially increased.  The odds of being caught under the present audit system are 33,300:1. the figures produced by the Revenue Commissioners prove that approximately £9,800 can be collected from each self-employed person.  The money should be collected from the 205,000 self-employed people in the country so that children can have a better start in life.  If I remember correctly, the increases last year were so pathetic that I was able to argue that the increase per child would not even finance the purchase of an apple a day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is key area in social welfare legislation.  As has been pointed out, this is a very important source of funding for many parents.  It is one of the most important social welfare payments for women as it goes straight into their hands.  I grew up in a financially deprived background and I know the importance of the children's allowance to women.  As <Col N="1999" /> I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, thousands of women celebrate these monthly payments.  These women know that they are guaranteed to receive these few bob every month.  It is very sad to think that they will not receive any increase this year.</P>
      <P>There is a startling amount of deprivation and poverty in our society.  The reports on child poverty are frightening. We should hang our heads in shame at the recent reports which state that many children in our society are so under nourished that, in comparison to children in the better off sections of our community, they are undersized physically, and they under-perform in sporting activities and outdoor pursuits.  It has been well documented that the children in the poorer sections of our society are not as healthy as those in the better off sections.  We should bear in mind that this is happening in Ireland and that it is not just something which happens in the third world, Africa or the Sudan.  As legislators we have the power to do something on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the changing nature of the Irish family.  Many children are now born outside of marriage and are being raised by single parents, be they men or women.  The children's allowance has been proven to be of tremendous assistance to parents.  I want to record my incredible disappointment at the Minister's decision not to give any further increases this year to the first, second or third child.</P>

      <P>I found Deputy Byrne's remarks very interesting.  It is clear that there is a contradiction in his comments.  His party cannot agree to increases of £164 million in social welfare benefits.  Yet they want to increase the allowances from £15.80 to £30.  The reason my party are on this side of the House is because they have shown concern for the less well off members of our community.  Many people may think that I should be sitting on the other side of the House with the Deputy as I too come from a deprived background.  I do not know what the Deputy's background is <Col N="2000" /> but I want to refer to mine.  I have six brothers and three sisters and I can distinctly remember that my father's social welfare cheque amounted to £3 1s per week.  I might be grey but I am not that old: I realise the importance of this assistance to people with large families.  The Deputies on the other side of the House are not fooling anybody by their hypocrisy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think women who receive this allowance will be happy at Deputy Byrne's remarks about how they celebrate when they receive it.  Many of those people look forward to going out but the Deputy implied that they spend the money they receive on their night out.  I compliment the Minister on directing the available resources to those most in need.</P>

      <P>Major changes have taken place in the child benefit area.  The reduction in the number of child benefits from 37 to three has eliminated much bureaucracy, reduced the cost of implementing this scheme and benefited in a substantial way those families most in need.  I appeal to Deputy Stagg and Deputy Byrne to be more responsible.  I understand that they have a job to perform in Opposition, but they should not oppose everything just for the sake of opposition.  When they had the opportunity Deputy Stagg's party did very little for the less well off in our community. The Deputy said today that he was not in the House when many budgets were being put through.  When it was proposed to cut the alleviation allowance by £20 a week, at the stroke of a pen, only one Deputy, a member of the Deputy's party, stood up to be counted.  I compliment him for doing so.</P>

      <P>That is what they will be remembered for.  We should cut out <Col N="2001" /> the nonsense and remember that we are dealing with a very important matter. Most of those who have benefited from the increases in social welfare payments during the past three years recognise that Deputy Woods is a man who is concerned, has made changes and is prepared to fight his corner at the Cabinet table to ensure that the less well-off in our community benefit from increases in social welfare payments.  The 64 sections outline the benefits to be passed on and the improvements he intends to bring about.  We should cut out the nonsense and contribute in a more positive and constructive way.  I am sure the Minister will look seriously at any amendment worth considering.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment for the reasons outlined by my colleague, Deputy Connaughton.  Like Deputy Wallace, I too, can get very emotional whenever the children's allowances are discussed.  Indeed, I can recall my mother taking out her book and the ridiculous amount of five shillings sticks in my head.  Unfortunately, the Minister has failed dismally to make this a meaningful payment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton who recommended that the higher amount should be paid in respect of the second child.  I would much prefer if the higher amount was paid for all children and if the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare were taken seriously.  As I pointed out yesterday, that report recommends that the higher rate should be paid in respect of children aged 12 and over.  It costs more to care for children as they grow older but this factor has not been taken into account.  If I had my way I would give mothers £15.80 per week in respect of the first child and an increased amount for each subsequent child as that is the most direct and realistic way of ensuring that money will be spent on the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> The issue of the children's allowances was one of the first issues on which I actively campaigned way back in the early seventies.  As the House will recall, the allowance at the time was legally paid to the father.  One would be surprised by the number of men who, on getting the allowance each month, put it into their pockets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They drank it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say they drank it but they certainly did not give it to their wives.  I was horrified &mdash; I was involved with an organisation called AIM at the time &mdash; when I discovered that what happened in my own home did not apply in other houses.  It was pathetic that women hung around in the hope that their husbands would give them the money but a high proportion of them did not get it.  However, in 1972-73 women got the legal right for the first time to hold the book and claim the allowance.</P>
      <P>The day they go to claim the allowance is the high point in the month for many women.  Indeed, when the details of the budget are published in newspapers the majority of women turn first to the section dealing with children's allowance. Unfortunately, they have had no reason to cheer during the past two years as no increases were granted.  This shows up the lack of politicisation of Irish women. There has hardly been a peep out of women or a remark from women's organisations and that is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our rates of child benefit are very poor compared with the rates payable in other EC countries.  No account is taken of the fact that we have larger families, high unemployment, a greater degree of family deprivation and that a higher proportion of women remain at home.  For every women aged over 25 working in the house there are five at home who are dependent on their husbands and are financial cripples.  This very often leads to emotional difficulties.  In deference to practice and custom many women have decided to say at home to look after their children.  They are doing a wonderful job and in many instances this is the best <Col N="2003" /> career possible.  Unfortunately, the only payment they get is £15 per month.  I regret that a more substantial increase has not been granted and that there is not greater recognition of the financial needs of children and mothers.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the financial wizards and economic strategists in the Department of Finance would like to get their fingers on that money and it is suggested regularly that this benefit should be taxed.  I was horrified to hear Deputy Stagg of the Labour Party suggest that it should be taxed and I wonder if those mothers who support the Labour Party are aware of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed when I heard Deputy Stagg make that suggestion.  In fairness to him, he may not realise that many middle class families live in what one might call working class conditions behind the front door.  In many homes, the woman who rears the children and puts the meals on the table is not getting an adequate amount of money from her husband.  Rather than <Col N="2004" /> go to court she prefers to stay in the home and preserve her marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should look at the levels proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that a huge amount of money is not involved &mdash; in the region of £60 to £80 per month &mdash; but it might be enough to ease hardship.  We should not assume that women married to men in the high tax bracket should not get this benefit.  I suggest to Deputy Stagg and to anybody else who is interested that if we are talking about giving tax relief on this allowance &mdash; that is probably not exactly what the Deputy was saying; he was talking about taxing the husband &mdash; the husband will take the money back from the wife.  That would create an unpleasant atmosphere within a marriage. It is the husband's income that would be taxed because in most instances the wife would not have a taxable income.  We should leave the allowance as it is, except to increase it, make it more generous, more worthwhile and more meaningful.  We are lagging behind our colleagues in other countries, but maybe there are ulterior motives why they are enticing women to stay at home.  I would like to think that this allowance would be given some priority in years to come.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely disgusted that the allowance is not being paid until October, the latest of all the payments.  Does this suggest the low status or the lack of political clout of these women?  Unfortunately, mothers in the home are not like farmers, teachers or groups who have well-funded organisations to look after their interests.  Perhaps it should be brought forward and should not be left until two months before the next budget. I support my colleague's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the case made by the Opposition about the cut off point, but the Minister has indicated to me that he intends to deal with that.  I cannot let the debate pass without referring to some of the remarks made earlier by Deputy <Col N="2005" /> Eric Byrne.  He referred to the magic pot of gold that is out there to be collected. I have been inundated with complaints, both in a professional and political capacity, from our own supporters and from the self-employed regardless of what party they support about the ruthless methods employed by the Revenue Commissioners to collect taxation.  I will give the House one example.  I know of ten or 11 dairy farmers who have had attachment orders issued against them for their creamery cheques.  As Deputy Connaughton knows well, the creamery cheque represents the dairy farmer's gross income; but he has to incur expenditure to earn that income.  These people have come to me &mdash; God knows how many have gone to other Deputies in my constituency &mdash; because attachment orders have been issued by the Revenue Commissioners against their creamery cheques.  If that is not a ruthless and merciless method of collecting income tax I do not know what is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne made the point, if I understood him correctly, that the self-assessment scheme enables people in the self-employed category to avoid paying tax on a wholesale basis.  I want to disabuse the Deputy of that notion.  The figures show that the net yield from the self-employed sector has increased since the introduction of self-assessment.  I know one or two cases where people submitted their own returns and the Revenue Commissioners went through them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have made my point. Deputy Stagg invited me to work out a percentage of the increase in child benefit over the last five or six years.  while I was working on that I came up with another figure.  I do not know if Deputy Stagg was in this House between 1982 and 1987; but the Labour Party, of which he is a member, were here.  If the Government had available to them the interest we are paying on the amount by which the then Government increased the national debt we could increase this year's allocation for social welfare by 800 per cent</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <P>Deputy Stagg should take that figure on board and consider it.  I accept that child benefit has not been increased by any substantial extent over the past five or six years; but this is a Social Welfare Bill and child benefit is one small section of the total social welfare budget.  Nobody can deny that since 1987, despite straitened financial circumstances which were not of our making and despite the need to contain and control public expenditure which had been let run out of control, the increases in the social welfare allocation by this Government and the Government which preceded them have been very substantial. They represent real increases and real redistribution.  To isolate one small element of the social welfare system in which there have been such substantial increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have not heard one word of praise, thanks or recognition for what the Minister has done both in the administrative system and in terms of the real increases he has introduced since 1987.  If we are to have a logical debate in this House that fact would have to be recognised rather than focusing on small elements of the system. We could all do that.  That is a most dishonest method of argument and, as I have said, it is really unworthy of Deputy Stagg to make that argument.  As Deputy Wallace rightly said, it is reducing this debate to a farce.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will remain strictly within the bounds.  I want to make a passing reference to one matter with which the Minister is probably familiar, that is, multiple births and the lack of payments in this area.  In 1965 recognition was given to the fact that there are greater financial demands on parents of multiple births, but the legislation was structured in such a way as to restrict the grants and allowances to families with three survivors. The number of families of multiple births &mdash; triplets or quads &mdash; is not great.  There is a strong case to be made for parents of twins.  Although not recognised by the legislation these cases would also be regarded as multiple births.  Clearly, anything over one is multiple.  Would the Minister reconsider the grants available for multiple births, particularly for families in which there is a succession of multiple births, which could constitute up to eight children?  They do not get the grants or double allowances applicable where the births are in excess of two. Perhaps the Minister will address that because his Department have noted that multiple births created more financial problems than a succession of single births.  I hope it will be recognised that the logic of that means obviously far more financial problems accruing from a succession of multiple births, i.e. twins as against triplets.</P>

      <P>We have had quite a number of contributions on this section <Col N="2009" /> already, the section gets to the root of a very important element in social welfare generally, the support for families. Indeed, at the outset, Deputy Connaughton raised the question of support for families and suggested that there was no better way to direct money to families than through the child benefit &mdash; or children's allowances &mdash; as people know them.  I still have difficulty in regard to child benefit because when I talk about it people do not understand what I mean until you refer to it as children's allowances.</P>
      <P>This argument intensified during the period of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition and it was also considered in the commision's report in which they said they could not agree whether it should be taxable. They were talking about how best to direct resources to families who needed support, especially those who needed it most.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fennell to the extent that I regard the children's allowance as a very important payment which goes directly to the mother, which is a non-selective payment right across the board.  From my own experience, I regard that as very important.  However, we have become caught up in the argument about the selectivity of these payments and while I agree with Deputy Fennell that those interested in these payments should speak up and make their points clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are always under pressure here.  We have nothing to hide in regard to this issue and I have been involved in public argument about it.  I have always felt that it is central to our whole policy.  The same applies to all countries, there are no simple answers. From my experience as a family man, I regard it as a very important payment. The Taoiseach, I am happy to say, cleared this up in his statement recently at the Árd Fheis when he spoke about families and tackling the problems in relation to them.  He said that the <Col N="2010" /> children's allowance &mdash; note that he called it children's allowance because that is how we always regarded it &mdash; supports all the children of the nation. He said that the allowances were paid directly to the mother and will continue to have a central role in our family policy. There have been many questions as to what that role will be.  In the case of an Ard Fheis people are inclined to read the important speeches but the fine print is very important.  This is a contentious matter at present between parties; we want to find the right solutions as we go on.</P>
      <P>The report of the commission highlighted the fact that many families and children were living on very low incomes. That had to be dealt with as a priority and I have been doing so for the past three or four years.  I make no apology for directing the resources to where the need was greatest.  That was the right policy then but we must look at the whole question again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg, Deputy Fennell, Deputy Connaughton and Deputies on my side of the House said that we must again look at the best way to direct these payments and they made different suggestions.  The commission could not agree in this regard.  On page 296 of the report they state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation of children's allowance is another possible method of &ldquo;selectivising&rdquo; child income support.  We have considered this question but did not reach agreement.  One point of view was that children's allowance should not, in principle, be assessed as taxable income; the function of children's allowance is to adjust the post-tax incomes of households according to family size and a cash payment, rather than a tax allowance, is the appropriate mechanism to achieve this.  This was the approach recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  An alternative view was that these payments should, in principle, be assessable for income tax as they form part of the total income of all families; <Col N="2011" /> further, taxation of children's allowance could be combined with a higher level of benefit and the net effect of this would be to redistribute resources to lower income families.  However, advocates of this view also argue that taxation of children's allowances should only be implemented when:</P>
    <P>(i)  the taxation of all groups in the community on the basis of income is effectively in force, and (ii) the real level of payments evolves to a level considerably higher than at present.</P>
    <P>We agree that the child tax allowance was an indirect and regressive method of child income support.  We, therefore, approve of the abolition of the tax allowance and favour a system of cash payments with some element of targeting resources as the most appropriate mechanism of child income support.</P>
    <P>Members can see from that that the commission were debating the matters which we are now debating but the problems are somewhat similar to those at that time.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, made disparaging remarks about child benefit, he said that they went to people on higher incomes, which should not be the case.  I was concerned about his remarks because there are not all that many people on higher incomes, just a small group in society as a whole. He set about taxing children's allowance and Deputy Spring agreed with him.</P>
    <P>If one reads the commission's report carefully, one discovers that they were saying &mdash; indirectly &mdash; that taxing children's allowance is not feasible in most cases and that even when it is, they are not sure whether it is workable.  At that time the Coalition Government set a process in motion between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance to match the families. We do not know who is paying tax, that is not our direct business; we pay child benefit to each mother directly.  If the <Col N="2012" /> allowance is to be taxed, the income of the father and any other income must be taken into account&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a problem in regard to whether it is current income or that of last year.  The Coalition Government set about trying to match these two sets of data and, when they left office four years ago, they had matched a very small proportion; it was not feasible at the time.  That procedure has been continued because, of course, you want the best match possible between social welfare and tax information.  At present about 80 per cent match but 20 per cent of the people involved is a very large number and if you cannot match child benefit with 20 per cent of the people, the position is very serious.  That is one of the practical difficulties.</P>
      <P>In the middle of all of this, what was to be done?  Over that period I set about directing the extra resources I could get towards the people who obviously needed it most.  We did a number of things.  We increased the child dependant rates to £12.  We extended the child dependant payments up to age 21 when children are continuing in education. These were priorities.  We increased the rates in the FIS which goes directly to families on lower incomes.  That must be taken into consideration when you talk about the money going to child benefit and the FIS.  We are talking about the same people here, other than the people dependent on social welfare.  In this budget £16.5 million is going to child-related tax exemptions at this time and that will benefit a substantial number of people at the lower end of the income spectrum.  That is what the Government have been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have done a good deal of that work. We have increased the child dependant allowances.  We are ahead of what the 1991 equivalent would be for basic rates in child dependant allowance for all social welfare groups.  We have increased the FIS and various other payments which go <Col N="2013" /> to families and to children on lower and lower middle incomes.  Across the board we have brought down the higher rate from the sixth to the fifth child and now to the fourth child.  It is obvious that as Minister for Social Welfare I would like to go further and I hope to do so in future budgets, but at this stage this whole area needs to be looked at again.  I hope these various elements can be considered again in next year's budget and Social Welfare Bill in the light of the developments that have taken place in between.  In the light of the Commission's report we have already directed substantial additional resources to those on the lowest incomes and within that context we can look once again at the position of children's allowances within that scheme.  In fact, when the taxation was being introduced the child benefit concept was introduced. Child benefit came in then but taxation did not follow because it was not feasible at that time.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the number of children on the rates.  From the fourth child alone we are talking about 400,000 children, so taking the fourth child plus into consideration the number is considerably higher.  That is the number of children as distinct from families who would benefit from the increase provided in this section.</P>
    <P>I accept there is more to be done and in the context of the various discussions and recommendations I look forward to more being done in this area in future.  I am happy the Taoiseach has emphasised the fact that the children's allowance will continue to be an essential part of our policy.</P>

The amount was 15p per month.  That is less than an increase if inflation is taken into account and that is unacceptable.  In reply to the points made by Deputy Fennell and directed through the Chair at me, I wish to clarify that what I am proposing will leave more in everybody's pocket, including the well off, but it will change the system so that the larger part of that &ldquo;more&rdquo; goes where it is most needed.

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section which technically deals with the definition of a qualified child.  Section 6 completes the process which was initiated in 1989 of progressively raising the age limit up to which child dependant increases may be paid to recipients of long term education.  Up until 1989 child dependant increases ceased to be payable when the child reached 18 years of age, except in the case of recipients of widow's pensions and deserted wife's payments where the child dependant increase continued to be paid between the age of 18 and 21 years in respect of children who continued in full-time education.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 6 provides that, from the beginning of June 1991, child dependant increases will be payable to all social welfare recipients in respect of children who are under 18 years of age and will continue to be paid up to 21 years in the case of all long term recipients where the child continues in full time education.  That is a major improvement.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) also extends the definition of qualified child for pension purposes and for family income supplement. This means that family income supplement will now continue to be paid in the case of families on low incomes where the child is between the age of 18 and 21 and is in full time education.  At present FIS is not payable where the child is over 18 years.</P>
      <P>These are two changes which I trust will be welcomed by Members, who will recognise their value to children and families.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) also provides that the circumstances in which a qualified child is to be regarded as being in full time education will be specified in regulations. This regulatory power will be used to provide for the payment of child dependant increases during the summer months for children over 18 years who are in full time education.  At present child dependant increases in the case of children over 18 years are discontinued for the summer months.  Where the child returns to college the payment re-commences and arrears for the summer months are paid. This arrangement is cumbersome, particularly for the client.  Under the revised arrangements the child dependant increase will continue to be paid up to the end of September unless the child qualifies for a social welfare payment in his or her own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important development which so far has gone completely unnoticed by people who have commented on the provisions of the Bill.  It will be of great assistance to families during the summer months when children are out of school.  Formerly they would <Col N="2019" /> lose the child dependant allowance element of the payment.  Now we are continuing the payment up to September and the decision will then be taken as to whether the child is continuing in education.  Those Deputies who are close to the situation will realise that this will be a considerable easement for the families in question.  The only exception would be if the child were in receipt of payment in his or her own right.</P>
    <P>The regulatory power provided for in the revised definition of &ldquo;qualified child&rdquo; will also be used to expand on the types of educational courses which will be accepted for the purposes of determining whether the child is in full time education.  At present the continued payment of child dependant increases is generally confined to children who are pursuing second or third level courses. However, there is now a wide range of other educational and training opportunities available and it is intended that the regulations will cover these where such courses are undertaken on a full-time basis.  Provision will be made in the regulations, however, to enable certain courses where payments are made to students to be excluded from the definition of full time education for child dependant increases.</P>
    <P>Section 223 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, defines a qualified child for the purposes of the child benefit scheme.  This definition provides that child benefit is payable in respect of children who are under 16 years and children between the ages of 16 and 18 years who are receiving full-time instruction by day at any university, college, school or other educational establishment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides for a similar regulatory power in the case of child benefit as is being provided for in the case of child dependant increases, so as to expand on the types of educational courses which will be accepted for the purposes of determining whether the child is in full time education.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that the increase in the age limit to 21 years will <Col N="2020" /> come into force generally on 1 June 1991 and in the case of recipients of long term unemployment assistance from 19 May 1991.  The increased age limit for family income supplement purposes will come into operation from 24 October 1991.</P>
    <P>The way in which the provisions in the section are expressed may look fairly technical, but it is a very important development for families.  It will mean that more families will have the benefit of both child benefit and child dependant allowances while their children undertake a wide range of courses.  Second, during the summer period, the payments will continue to be made and will stop in September only if the child does not continue in education.  I trust that the changes in this section will be very much welcomed.</P>

I have come across the case of a young fellow who regards himself as an external student &mdash; he is repeating the leaving certificate but studying at home.  I understand the Department of Social Welfare consider that he is not available for work so he cannot get unemployment assistance. Is it correct that his family are not entitled to the family income supplement either, given the Minister's definition of educational courses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the very positive and progressive measure contained in this section.  The children involved&mdash;I have heard them referred to as the &ldquo;limbo children&rdquo;&mdash; could not gain in any way and were always at a loss.  They could not draw any form of social welfare in their own right and their parents could not claim for them either.  Children at this stage are probably at their most expensive. I would ask Deputy O'Dea, to take note that when there is something positive, we acknowledge it and we have been doing that all day long.  We will continue to do so as we find positive measures in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister elaborate on when we might expect the regulations, and when the provisions of the section will come into force?  Will they be in force this summer, for example?  What means will be used to bring the regulations to public notice?</P>
      <P>My next point, and we raised this earlier in another context, deals with disability benefit.  This is regarded as a category of short term payment which, in effect, is long term; people may be on disability for many years.  Since disability benefit is regarded as a short term payment they will not be covered by this measure.  When the Minister is making the regulations, will he look at the people who have been in receipt of disability benefit for two years or more to see if they could be considered as being in receipt of a long term payment&mdash;without differentiating the size of their payment&mdash; simply in order that they qualify for the child dependant allowance and child benefit payment as proposed in this measure? The Minister is aware of the difficulties with the short term disability payments, which continue for many years.  These people would be excluded from this measure and they would need this money as much as others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret, that my amendment was disallowed, but I understand why&mdash;it would have given rise to a charge on the Exchequer.  This measure is a move in the right direction.  My amendment sought to expand on this but from what the Minister <Col N="2022" /> said, I accept it is his intention to expand on it in future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the progressiveness of this section and the extension of the provisions to children of 21 years in full time education.  However, I would like to ask the Minister a couple of questions on the regulations.  More and more there are opportunities for young people to go outside this jurisdiction to be educated, but, by and large, they are still being maintained by their parents. The definition in section 6 (1) states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`qualified child' means a person who is ordinarily resident in the State,...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does that cover young people who have gone to Northern Ireland or Britain to pursue third level education?  Will their parents still be allowed to claim the dependant allowance for them?  Very often it is at great personal cost not just to the parents but to the extended family that young people get the opportunity to go abroad for third level education when they cannot get places here.  It would be very detrimental if they were not allowed this allowance.  Will the Minister qualify what he means by &ldquo;ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister commented on the regulations defining those students and the courses which would qualify under the section.  Was he implying that a student in receipt of an ESF grant would not qualify and their parents would not be entitled to a dependant allowance, albeit the students were in full time third level education?  There is a number of one year courses that may not necessarily give these young people more than a certificate or a diploma, and I would like an assurance that all post-leaving certificate and post-inter certificate courses will qualify, even if there is an element of payment in it.  I can understand that some account will be taken of the payment, for example, to an apprentice if he is reasonably well paid while doing his apprenticeship, but very often people are disqualified because of the small element <Col N="2023" /> of payment they get for the courses they are pursuing.</P>
    <P>I want to follow Deputy Stagg's point on recipients of disability benefit.  More and more I find that disability recipients under the age of 60, or even as low as 55 years, cannot go on invalidity pension, even though it is as clear as the nose on my face they will never work again.  They are being denied all the other benefits that go with invalidity pension, which is a long term payment.  They do not get the Christmas allowance, the fuel allowance of any other benefits paid to those in receipt of long term benefits.  The Minister needs to look at the case of people on disability benefit for more than a year. I am dealing with a number of cases where people are on disability benefit for two or three years but because of their age&mdash;they are under 40&mdash;they will never get an invalidity pension because it is feared they will be a burden on the State for 40 years.  This is an inequity and people are suffering unduly.  They feel very hard done by when they cannot get these additional benefits.  I endorse what Deputy Stagg said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the previous speakers who have called on the Minister to explain why people on short term benefit are not included in these provisions. He has specifically and clearly stated that this is a provision for long term social welfare recipients; perhaps he might reconsider this and give us an explanation.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the regulations the Minister will be putting forward because section 54&mdash;budgeting in relation to social welfare payments&mdash; reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may make regulations to provide that where a recipient of any benefit, pension, assistance, allowance or supplement under the Principal Act consents, an amount of such benefit, pension, assistance, allowance or supplement...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this section and section 54, perhaps the Minister would tell us what <Col N="2024" /> his plans are and when we might see the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section and in particular the Minister's clarification in relation to the definition of full time education.  I look forward to the Minister's clarifying regulations in relation to the definition of full time education. Most of us have come across the individual who is not working and is in some form of training or educational process, maybe at night classes, and is not available for work during the day but who should qualify under this category of over 18s in education.  I would ask the Minister to look favourably on the clarification of full time education.  On leaving school, I participated in night classes to further my education.  A large number of my young friends, some of whom are working and some of whom are not still go to night classes.  I would ask the Minister to look favourably on those who are obtaining further education by way of night classes.</P>
      <P>Another point that is appropriate to raise at this time is the cost and expense to parents of the 19 or 20 year old availing of further education.  I know it is the Minister's desire to widen this area further but there is a case for extending this not alone to long term recipients but to recipients right across the board, even to the working parent who has a 19 or 20 year old availing of further education and not working.  There is an area there that we should explore a little and try to give something by way of child benefit to people in that category.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> On Deputy Stagg's amendment in regard to net weekly income, it is a principle that will have to come into force.  At this stage it may be out of order but I would ask the Minister to consider it for the future. It affects medical card holders.  There is a value put on board and lodgings for a teenager staying at home.  It would be much fairer if the net salary was taken into account rather than the gross because in the long run it is what one has in one's pocket to spend that makes all <Col N="2025" /> the difference.  Gross salary gives a distorted picture.  I know it would obviously lead to extra money but it is something we will have to face because as it stands at the moment there is inequity.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this section.  The continuation of payment during the summer is very important because we have all come across cases where people have had to reapply after the summer holidays for children continuing their education at third level institutions.  The increase in the age limit to 21 years is also welcome.  It should be remembered that many of those young people attending third level institutions come from homes that depend on social welfare and any measures that can be taken to eliminate difficulties for these families must be welcomed.  In this section the Minister is going along way down the road to ensuring that that is done.  As Deputy Callely said, we must also look at the question of parents working part-time whose children are availing of further education to see if such education can be made more accessible for them.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for welcoming this section. They are right that it will have important practical implications.  I have noted that Deputy Stagg has welcomed it as a positive and progressive measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Deputy.  The whole purpose is to have this in force this summer.  We will certainly publicise it in the most appropriate way to get the message across to the people affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This applies to people in the 18 to 21 category but people on short term payments whose dependants are not in that category will not benefit at present. Deputy Owen raised the question of people going out of the jurisdiction for third level places.  I will certainly consider that.  &ldquo;Ordinarily resident&rdquo; means they are still dependent on parents and I think that is the sort of case the Deputy is <Col N="2026" /> talking about.  I will have to look at that technically, bearing in mind the point the Deputy made.  We would certainly want to cover people who are still dependent on their parents.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of whether the ESF prevents people from receiving payments, I do not think that is so, since it is the income of the parents that is taken into consideration here.  It is an allowance given to the parent in respect of that child.  There could be cases where the child has gone into a training programme, such as, an apprenticeship, and that would be a different situation.</P>

      <P>We had some discussion about invalidity pensions earlier.  The numbers on invalidity pensions have been increasing.  I agree to some extent with what has been said about it.  There is the problem that some people do not want to go on invalidity pension because it is a pension and is taxable.  The question is raised from time to time whether there should be an option at that stage because it means there is other income as well. At present increasing numbers are going on invalidity pensions from disability benefit and we have undertaken this morning to ensure that people know their rights in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come across cases like that.  It is hard to write people off everything.  An example is people with <Col N="2027" /> bad backs.  I have a bad back myself and have had a lot of things done to it.  I may be worse than some of the people who are coming to me.  It means I could not be in a steel works or something like that at this stage but there are a lot of other things I could do.  That is the kind of question that can arise with younger people but there are quite a few younger people who are on invalidity pensions as well.  It means that, as one gets older, there is less likelihood of one getting an alternative job.  Certainly we will keep that in mind.  Deputy Byrne asked when these payments will become effective.  I should stress that the whole purpose is that they be effective this summer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callely raised the question or people participating in night courses and studying by day.  The theory is that one is supposed to be in full time education but I can well understand that quite often people will be working by day and studying at night.  But if they were participating in courses at night and studying during the day they could possibly be regarded as receiving full time education.  I would have a lot of sympathy with the point made by Deputy Callely, which is something that can be examined under the power being given under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne spoke of the net salary.  I think he was referring to the next section covering the family income supplement.  Deputy Wallace also welcomed this provision for the benefits it will confer.  There is no doubt that it is a very useful extra, that arose from some of our previous discussions, which we endeavour to implement at the time of passing the Social Welfare Bill.  Many Members referred to the fact that it is a very substantial Bill.  The reason for that is we pick up ideas in our discussions and endeavour to implement smaller provisions that do not entail such heavy expenditure as well as the major issues contained in the budget.  While one may not necessarily have permission to implement those smaller ones at budget time one manages to get permission for them by the time the Social Welfare Bill <Col N="2028" /> is introduced in the House, which is tied in with the drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been referring to this invaluable document issued by the Department of Social Welfare.  I have been doing a quick calculation on the basis of the 1989 figures, the latest available to me.  I presume that most of the unemployment assistance beneficiaries would be covered by the proposal before us.  They have 159,000 children though naturally not all are in this category. There are 55,000 children of unemployment benefit recipients, 55,000 children of disability benefit recipients giving a total of 269,000 children in those categories.  All of the children of the categories included total 85,000 since it is only those in the higher age group in any of the categories who would be involved. Therefore, there is still a huge number of people excluded, some in receipt of the lowest payments.  What I am saying is that 85,000 children of people who will qualify for this rate at present receive dependant payments.  I would presume that a proportion of them would be included in the category we are not talking about.  But there are 269,000, apart from children being paid a dependant allowance, and I presume a proportion of them will be excluded. Therefore, it will clearly be seen that there is a large proportion of people excluded.</P>

      <P>Anyone currently in the 18 to 21 age group where that benefit applies.  The Deputy is confusing himself talking about numbers with regard to disability benefit.  The House should not forget that there are up to 60,000 disability claims a week.  Most of those come in and out of eligibility, some continue, but the vast majority come in and out of eligibility.  The children of all of those people are included in these figures as well in terms of their being short term beneficiaries.  In any case in which the 18 to 21 age limit applies&mdash;and we have now extended that provision in this section&mdash; the new arrangement will be applicable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Minister mentioned disability and invalidity payments.  Has there been any change of policy in the Minister's Department with regard to these benefits?  While I know one case I might cite might not prove my point I am aware of a person in Carlow who had been in receipt of invalidity benefit for seven years, was called for re-examination, was disqualified, appealed the disqualification and was turned down.  He then applied for disability benefit and was awarded that benefit on the very same medical grounds on which he had been in receipt of invalidity benefit for seven years.  Can it be that there is some policy to disqualify as many as possible from invalidity benefit? There is something very peculiar about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  First, I would rather have circumstances in which people could go on to invalidity benefit for a period, especially younger people mentioned by Deputy Owen.  If at any given time it is quite clear that such a person cannot work for, say, three or four years I would rather have such a person declared eligible for invalidity benefit and re-assessed after a couple of years to ascertain whether their circumstances had changed.  And circumstances do change.  All that is happening is that the system is becoming more efficient which means that people will be called up at certain intervals.  If we were to revert and render it less efficient they would not be called so frequently. Not only that but I might add that one is called in relation to the illness one is suffering.  In future people will be categorised more in relation to their type of illness.  If it is unlikely that a person will not be better for quite some time then they will not be called within that time. But if the illness is of a type that could mean the person could have improved considerably in the meantime then they could be recalled sooner.  The same applies to the overall operation of disability benefit.  I am not now talking about the manner in which any medical people carry out their examinations.  I am talking <Col N="2030" /> merely about the manner in which people are called for examination.  There is no doubt but that the system is vastly more efficient and increasingly becoming more so which, at the end of the day, is good for everybody.  If there are problems encountered they can be identified and we can deal with them.</P>

      <P>Though I have not participated I have found this a most interesting debate having listened from my office.  I should not like this section to pass without making one or two comments on what the Minister has said.  I have been a Member of this House for four years only.  It is indeed true to say that the system has become much more efficient. There have been many advances made in a quiet, efficient way.  It must be remembered that the Commission on Social Welfare made very many recommendations. The Minister has picked them off, one at a time and implemented them so that we now find that the members of that commission are quite impressed at the advances made.  It is easy to throw comments across the floor of the House and criticise but I would defy anybody on the far side of the House to grasp this complex area of social welfare in the efficient manner the Minister has done.  It is very difficult to get it all right, to cater adequately for the needy and eliminate abuses.  Deputy Browne mentioned the matter of invalidity and disability payments.  If you like, we Deputies are at the coal face endeavouring to deal with these huge personal problems.  It is a tremendous challenge for any Minister to set up a system to deal with these human problems.  I am convinced he has got it right.  He has managed to maintain the funding and to increase it steadily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I hope you do not mind if I make this point as it is not often done on Committee Stage.  This has been a fine debate.  Across the floor we have had some very constructive comments. Praise has been given where it was deserved.  I would encourage the Minister in a general way to continue his efforts to rationalise the system.  I would encourage <Col N="2031" /> him to use the computer system he has in the Department, to improve on it and to ensure that we have an efficient and positive social welfare system.  I will have other things to say later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 7 and the family income supplement, I have a different variation on what Deputy Stagg was speaking about.  There is a great deal of merit in the proposal from Deputy Stagg, but we will leave that for tomorrow for the Deputy to deal with. I always liked the concept of the family income supplement from the very day the Coalition Government, of which I was a member, introduced it.  There is no doubt that it has many warts but a large number of families avail of it.  If I heard the Minister correctly this morning, he said that 6,000 or 7,000 people are in receipt of family income supplement.  That is a sizeable number, but I would have thought there would have been more.  I am sure there are many more families out there who could do with the additional money. At this time of the evening there is no point in going through a whole list of the principal features of the family income supplement because the House would be fully aware of them, except to say that many families who are on low wages find great satisfaction in getting sums as small as £12, £14, £15 or £20 extra on to their wages.  That makes a great difference in a household where there is a very low income.  I acknowledge that we have to talk about the poverty traps.</P>
      <P>I genuinely believed that one way we could eliminate poverty traps and at the time ensure we could promote the work ethic would be through the family income supplement.  What has gone wrong with the system that only about 6,000 people in the workforce are in receipt of family income supplement?  I am sure the Minister will give us all the information on that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter with which I can never come <Col N="2034" /> to terms with is the fact that only PAYE workers qualify for family income supplement. It is no harm to bring to the attention of this House the huge problems which the low income self-employed people have to face.  I am talking particularly about local carpenters, JCB drivers and so on.  I can assure Deputy Byrne they would not have £1 million in their brief cases; they may be self-employed but they are at the bottom of the ladder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>And small shopkeepers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The list is endless, without mentioning farmers.  In fact, it was with farmers in mind that I put down the amendment, even though it has been ruled out of order.  There are only two ways in which these people can be helped. They can be helped via unemployment assistance.  This is not practicable for many of the self-employed because the system adopted is such that if you were in receipt of a reasonable income for the first three or four months of the year you must have earned enough to sustain yourself for the other eight months.  The Department of Social Welfare cannot come to grips with that position, perhaps because of lack of proper evidence from the Revenue Commissioners of their income.</P>
      <P>I understand that the cut-off point for a family with one child is £140.  I know thousands of self-employed people, small farmers and shopkeepers, who would not have an income of £140 over a two week period, not to speak of one week.  This can be proven by the Revenue Commissioner's figures.  The Revenue Commissioners could not be bothered writing to many self-employed people because it would be like going to the goat's house for wool&mdash;they do not have a taxable income.  Some Revenue Commissioner inspectors say it is not worthwhile writing to certain groups of people because they would only be wasting the time of their staff going through their accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister gets a grip on an idea there is no better man to run with it.  I do not know whether I have the wrong end of the stick&mdash;if I can be <Col N="2035" /> proven to be wrong I will accept it&mdash; but I cannot see how our social welfare system will come to the aid of the people about whom I am speaking.  There are thousands of such people around the country.  I do not think our social welfare system is organised in such a way that recognition can be given to their exact position.  If the Revenue Commissioners are in a position to give a certificate which proves they know everything about the activities of the self-employed, so that there can be no double dealing, no money under the mattress, that everything is above board, and that they can prove conclusively that those people are living below the poverty line, why would it not be possible for family income supplement to be paid to people living in those conditions?</P>
    <P>I think I have made the case as clearly as I can.  Every night in pubs and halls people say to me that they cannot understand why they are not entitled to receive family income supplement.  I assume there are a thousand reasons why they may not be eligible.  However, I believe there should be only two important points taken into consideration in deciding whether people are entitled to family income supplement: first, their yearly earnings should be at such a level that they are entitled to the family income supplement as it applies under section 7 &mdash;this is the most important point&mdash; and, secondly, how it will be paid.  If the Minister says that there is no problem in giving them unemployment assistance, I will buy that; but as a public representative for ten years I do not think, from experience, that that will fit in with the Bill.  In a strange way it might fit in with Deputy Stagg's suggestion that this payment should be paid automatically.  I assume that that is what the Deputy was getting at in his amendment.  I hope I have articulated my point clearly so that the Minister knows what I am getting at, that is many people do not have an income of £140 per week, the cut-off limit for receiving family income supplement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important <Col N="2036" /> section.  The family income supplement has been a blessing in disguise for many families.  I know the Minister and his Department have made great efforts to ensure that people are aware of their entitlements.  This has been very much in evidence over the past two or three years. However, the number of people who avail of the family income supplement is quite low.</P>
      <P>I want to take up the point made by Deputy Connaughton in regard to part-time workers.  I referred yesterday to taxi drivers in smaller towns who sign on the live register but who are not unemployed in the strictest sense of the word&mdash;they may work for two or three days a week. Consideration should be given to providing family income supplement for such people.  It would mean a lot to these people to be taken off the live register and given family income supplement.</P>
      <P>Some medical card holders were very concerned that the family income supplement was being taken into account in assessing their income.  As we all know, the cost of medication is very expensive and it was very unfair to give people a family income supplement and remove their medical cards from them.  I am glad that this issue has been cleared up.  This was not a problem for people in the Southern Health Board area but it was a problem for people in other areas.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement is a great scheme and I welcome the increases being introduced this year.  These increases, together with the tax concessions, will be very beneficial to people. Many more families could benefit from this scheme.  The family income supplement has made a tremendous difference to the lifestyles of many families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a great lover of the family income supplement as it automatically builds anomalies into the system, creates poverty traps and discriminates, as it is presently operated, against various people who need an income supplement in addition to what they receive at present.  According to the figures I have only about one-third of eligible families avail of this scheme.  The <Col N="2037" /> Minister said the figure is 50 per cent. Even if this is the case, it is still not an effective system.  In the case of the child benefit, which I proposed as an alternative, there is an 99.9 per cent take-up and the money goes directly to where it is needed most.  The family income supplement was introduced as a short term measure until such time as the child benefit scheme took off properly.  If this scheme is to remain as a permanent feature it will have to be reformed.</P>
      <P>I want to draw to the Minister's attention some of our amendments which were disallowed.  I will resubmit one of my amendments on Report Stage.  When I talk about the self-employed I mean craftsmen, shopkeepers and small enterpreneurs who set up businesses under Department of Labour schemes&mdash;for example the enterprise allowance scheme.  Many self-employed people have very low incomes and would qualify on a means basis for assistance.</P>
      <P>When I was spokesman on Agriculture and Food for my party I became acutely aware of the level of poverty among small farmers in rural areas.  I was reared on a small farm in the west.  A huge amount of money is given to this country to support farm incomes.  The Department of Social Welfare should get their hands on some of that money and direct it, without going through any other source to the kitchen tables of the farmers' wives, the people who usually take care of the money part of the business.  I am talking of approximately £1,000 million per year.  Even with Commissioner MacSharry's proposed restrictions on it, this amount is growing.  This money could best be channelled through the Department of Social Welfare as an income supplement to keep productive farmers producing valuable materials for export and consumption at home rather than forcing them out of existence, as it presently happening.  I think this is recognised across the board politically, both at home and in Europe.  I regret that my amendment in this regard was disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than taking gross income as the figure, we proposed that the net income <Col N="2038" /> of the person involved should be taken as the base line in assessing their applications.  I do not know if a huge cost would be involved but I would ask the Minister to reconsider that.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of automation with the Minister on a previous occasion and he indicated that he would look at the matter again.  Given that only 50 per cent of families eligible under the scheme, which has been designed to be of assistance to poor families are availing of it an attempt must be made to get the money to them.  I suggested what I thought was a simple scheme.  One has to fill up a tax form each year; many people do not but it is illegal not to, Consequently, the Revenue Commissioners know of the number of children a person has and they should link their computers with those in the Department of Social Welfare so that the best information is available to enable them give the best possible service.  In this way, they would know who is entitled to the payment.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if any additional cost would be involved as I take it the Minister did his calculations in drawing up his original proposals for the scheme on the basis that everybody entitled to the payment would avail of the scheme.  I am not proposing any change in the rate of payment proposed by the Minister.  I would ask him therefore to consider ways of making the payment automatic.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned yesterday that a notice is included with the P60 of a person whose income is below a certain limit.  Perhaps that is not what he said because as I understand it, it is the employer who issues the P60 and not the Revenue Commissioners.  When the Revenue Commissioners see on their computers that a person qualifies for the payment they, at the very least, should issue an application form and, if possible, make the payment automatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Stagg and they tie in with an argument I made here this time last year on a different issue.  I argued then that it should be possible in this era of computers to make the payment <Col N="2039" /> automatically.  I instanced the cases of two unnamed women, representing 44,000 married women, on whose behalf FLAC took a case to the courts.  I contended that there should have been no need for those women to submit an application for the money they were owed, roughly £800, and that the Department could have made these payments automatically.  It seems Deputy Stagg's amendment would guarantee that the remaining 50 per cent would take up their entitlements.</P>
      <P>I would now like to turn to the points made by Deputy Connaughton which received the support of Deputy Stagg.  I would have severe reservations about a proposal to extend the family income supplement scheme to cover the self-employed. I do not doubt for one moment that many people, who were formerly in full-time employment and are now, at the instigation of companies, self-employed as milkmen or as drivers for builders providers, are living in poverty. I am sure that many of those individuals, including members of the farming community, would be entitled to receive payments under the family income supplement scheme if it could be verified that they are on low incomes.  However, it would be a matter of some concern if we were to rely on the Revenue Commissioners to provide certificates to the self-employed.  The stark fact is that there are 205,000 self-employed people and the self-assessment system is open to abuse and is being abused.  We are also aware that only 294 audits have been carried out since the introduction of the system. Therefore, it is hard to see how we could rely on the Revenue Commissioners to verify the incomes of the self-employed, unless, of course, the number of staff was greatly increased and they were obliged to go through the books on an annual basis.  There is a weakness in the argument but I do accept that some of the self-employed could be eligible to receive payments but a safer method of authenticating their incomes would have to be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that between 6,000 and 7,000 families are availing of this scheme, it is clear that we have got it across to people that this scheme is available and they should avail of it.  I appeal to the Minister to simplify the system even more as we seem to have reached the stage when one has to inform the Department that one can do the breaststroke, has brown hair, that two of the children play the tin whistle and so on before one can avail of the scheme.</P>
      <P>People find it very difficult to understand the system.  For example, section 7 contains the following:</P>
      <P>232C.&mdash;(1)  Subject to this Part, the weekly rate of family income supplement shall be 60 per cent of the amount by which the weekly family income is less than the amount appropriate in the particular case under section 232B.</P>
      <P>I have no idea what that means but I am sure it is explained in the leaflets published by the Department.  Is there any mechanism by which a person on low income, such as a person who picks vegetables and who might make £170 one week and £50 in another depending on the weather and the availability of fruit and vegetables, can combine income for a number of weeks which would bring their income below the magic figure of £140 per week and allow them claim family income supplement, if they have only one child, or would they be excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the system simple enough for people to slot in and out of the family income supplement scheme so that they will receive it for weeks when they are earning less than the required amount?  I would appeal to the Minister to consider applying the scheme on a monthly or six monthly basis if a person's income is on average below £140 a week.  Can the Minister tell me, for example, how many <Col N="2041" /> one parent families are in receipt of this supplement?  The vast bulk of one parent families are women and children. Women very often stay in the black market in order to earn money because they are afraid their allowances will be taken from them.  They work in black market employment and never apply for the family income supplement because they are afraid that in getting into the system they will lose out in other areas. Perhaps there is a market there which the Minister should target.  Is there any evidence that there are fewer one parent families claiming this supplement than should be the case?</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister what may be a difficult question.  I assume the Minister allows for 100 per cent take-up of the scheme.  What does he do with the money that has not been used at the end of the year if there is not a 100 per cent take up?  Is there one almighty bash in the Department of Social Welfare, or how is it spent?  Can the Minister give an assurance that if all the money allowed in the Estimates is not taken up the remainder will go, as far as possible, towards alleviating poverty for people in low income groups?  Perhaps the Minister would give some idea, for example, for the year just past what he has done with the money saved in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the family income supplement and I congratulate the Minister on increasing it.  It is indeed a great scheme which encourages the lower paid to go to work.  Some people may ask: why bother going to work when you can get all the benefits as an unemployed person?  The family income supplement has changed that attitude and has encouraged more low paid workers to work.  It is indeed one of the best schemes that has been introduced, particularly since the increases have been made to it.  A number of part-time workers who work for three or four days a week sign for unemployment assistance for the other two or three days.  Would the Minister consider giving these people family income supplement for the days they are not working rather than have <Col N="2042" /> them on the live register, signing for unemployment assistance?</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Without repeating what has been said, we do not want to discourage people from working.  On the other hand, we do not want to get carried away with the idea that all unemployed people are sitting around doing nothing.  I agree that there are many small farmers who are very badly off at present due simply to their sense of pride and the fact that down through the ages they never looked for help.  These people would benefit greatly from this scheme.  It may be difficult to bring them within the scheme but I would certainly support it because it is an important area in which help should be given. Deputy Stagg mentioned small shopkeepers and so on.  Many of these people are competing against supermarkets and are barely existing.  If this scheme was extended to those people it would be of tremendous help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments of Deputy Dan Wallace and Deputy Matt Brennan.  I support the family income supplement scheme.  For many years in this country we agonised about what has been called the poverty trap and how to solve that problem.  This is one imaginative scheme that was introduced to solve the problem.  Nobody is seeking to suggest that the unemployed are sitting around and do not want to work.  We have to recognise that if a person is to gain £5 a week by getting up in the morning to go to work &mdash; perhaps in some cases they lose £5 a week or more when you take into account the benefits &mdash; there has to be some incentive to encourage that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point made by Opposition speakers that there is a communication problem in regard to this scheme.  The existence of the scheme and its benefits has not been communicated to a sufficient degree to the people who qualify for it.  In the first year of its introduction there was an alarmingly small take-up of the scheme &mdash; about 22 or 23 per cent &mdash; but I was delighted to hear the Minister <Col N="2043" /> say today that the take-up is now 50 per cent.  Therefore we are managing to get the message across.  Some quite good suggestions were made by Deputies on the other side of the House, but when listening to suggestions from Deputy Owen and others I wonder if they would complicate the scheme to such an extent that it would exacerbate rather than improve the communication problem.  I support the principle behind the scheme. The poverty trap is something that I, among others, have been concerned about.  Until somebody comes forward with a better solution to the problem I support this scheme and compliment the Minister on the increases he has announced to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the family income supplement scheme.  It is an excellent scheme, as are many of the schemes introduced by the Government, such as the carer's allowance scheme. However, the application of these schemes leaves a lot to be desired.  The policy of the Government is: the birds are in the forest, but catch them yourselves. As Deputy Browne has rightly said, there are small farmers, honest, decent people, living in poverty, and that will continue to be the case as long as the Minister and the Department base their assessments on 1988-89 incomes.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the manner in which these assessments are carried out.  He should apply this scheme to small farmers and small business people.</P>
      <P>I would compliment people on keeping their homes neat and tidy and making an effort to improve them, but they should not be penalised for doing so.  Too many people in this country allow their houses to fall down around them and everybody then rushes to support them.  People who make some effort in this country are penalised, and that is why the people who deserve it do not receive the family income supplement.</P>

I am acutely conscious of the fact that we are about to <Col N="2044" /> spend £3 billion while at the same time leaving one million people in poverty &mdash; and perhaps even more, by the Minister's own admission.  The time allowed to us is totally inadequate.  We are about one-third of the way through the Bill, with very many important measures to be dealt with yet.  I certainly will not support a measure which not alone does not tackle the poverty issue but ensures that more people will be living in poverty at the end of the year than was the case at the beginning of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is our problem.  We deal with the practicalities.  The other problem mentioned was that the tax is based on the previous year's income and that we would be using the income of the last two months in our assessments.  We are looking at Deputy Connaughton's <Col N="2045" /> proposal, but it is much more complex. If you went straight on to the family income supplement the whole structure would have to be changed to suit the self-employed and farmers because some people could lose in comparison with unemployment assistance or benefits paid to smallholders.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wallace, Deputy O'Dea and other members also said that the system should be changed, but we must ensure that people do not lose as a result.  We considerably increased the benefits in relation to family income supplement and it will extend the number of people who will benefit from it.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputies that we should look at the matter to see how much more widely it can be used.  I take the point made by Deputy Byrne&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I received representations about this case.  I also received a letter from the mother of the child and I think one paragraph of the letter sums up the cruel predicament the parents find themselves in.  I quote from the mother's letter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most importantly of all is that we just cannot cope at home on a full-time basis.  I am emotionally and physically drained as our daughter needs full-time supervision day and night.  Someone needs to be in the same room as her all the time because of the unpredicatability of her attacks.  I am totally confined to the house at all times.  I cannot even go for a walk with her or to the shops in case she has an attack on the way and I would not be able to cope on the side of the road.  My husband is out at work all day and my <Col N="2049" /> other children are in college.  They are very supportive but they have to lead their own lives.</P>
    <P>The mother goes on to describe the situation she finds herself in and finishes by saying, &ldquo;we really are near despair&rdquo;.  I can understand the situation the parents find themselves in trying to cope.  I raised this matter to try to get the Minister's support in obtaining a residential school placing from Monday to Friday for this child so that the parents will have both the physical and emotional energy at the weekend to help this child.  That is a reasonable request.  The Minister has all the details as to the number of schools and places where the child has tried to find placement. without success.  I raise the matter tonight in the hope that the Minister will be able to respond favourably.</P>

      <P>In 1990 approximately £160 million was spent on a wide range of service for people with a mental handicap.  This includes funding of voluntary agencies by health boards and directly by my Department, services provided by health boards, maintenance of people with mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals and the cost of providing disabled persons maintenance allowances and domiciliary care allowances to people with mental handicap. This does not include services funded by the Department of Education.  Over 12,000 people are in receipt of a day or residential service funded either directly by my Department or through health boards.  In addition, some 8,500 people attend special schools or classes funded by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the present level of service provision falls short of meeting all needs.  For this reason, regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees were reactivated in each health board area to produce multi-annual plans for the development of the service in a prioritised and co-ordinated way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Government provided an additional allocation of £2 million to meet <Col N="2050" /> the immediate priority needs identified by the co-ordinating committees.  This allocation enabled 149 residential places, 442 day places and 21 respite care places to provide breaks to about 200 people to be approved.  It was also possible to provide 25 extra staff for other supports.</P>
    <P>This year a further £1 million is being allocated to build on last year's positive developments.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government are committed to the development of services for people with mental handicap to meet identified needs in the year 1991-1992.</P>
    <P>I must also point out that allocations to voluntary mental handicap agencies funded by my Department have been protected since 1986 in real terms in recognition of the vital service they provide. This Government's record shows a commitment to mental handicap services, and an understanding that this area should be regarded as a high priority.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries about the case to which the Deputy refers.  The Eastern Health Board, who are statutorily responsible for the provision of mental handicap services, are actively seeking a suitable placement for this person.  She is included on the board's priority list for residential placement and the board are also pursuing inquiries with the Department of Education.  I would like to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to resolve the issue as soon as possible. I intend to take a personal interest in the matter.</P>

      <P>In the Southern Health Board area the Irish Wheelchair Association have provided a practical relief service to families caring for physically disabled people at home since 1987.  In effect this means that a caring relative can receive a weekly or daily break from the continuous demands caring for a handicapped person at home&mdash;washing, dressing, toileting, feeding and a wide variety of tasks.  The 24 hour responsibility and consequent stress is in no <Col N="2051" /> small way helped by the relief service.  It lengthens people's ability to maintain a disabled person in the community.</P>
      <P>The cost of the scheme in 1990 in the Southern Health Board region was £25,000.  Of that £20,000 came from the Irish Wheelchair Association and £5,000 came from the Southern Health Board. About 35 families benefit from the scheme.  Due to various matters affecting the financial situation of the Irish Wheelchair Association the level of service cannot be maintained in 1991.  To date no contribution has been received from the Southern Health Board.  I raised this matter at community care level with the Southern Health Board on two occasions. I am now requesting the Minister for Health to intervene to ensure that a reasonable level of service can be maintained to give relief where it is so badly needed.  Indeed, there are some cases of which I am aware in the Fermoy area who benefit so much from this scheme that it would be a disaster for the families concerned if the scheme ended.  The service is so reduced at present as to cause hardship for families and indeed many will be forced into residential care.</P>
      <P>A submission was made to the Southern Health Board in September 1990 by social workers representing the Irish Wheel Association, Cork Spastic Clinic, the Multiple Sclerosis Society, Cork Regional Hospital and Mercy Hospital which stated that a discrepancy existed between the demand for and the availability of service to meet the growing number of young, chronically disabled people.  There are two groups involved. One consists of 110 people who are living at home and who are potentially at risk and the other consists of seven people whose families can no longer cope.  The families are unable to care for them and there is no permanent place available to accommodate them.  I appeal to the Minister to provide the Southern Health Board with additional funds to allow the necessary services to these families, which are provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association, to continue.</P>

      <P>The home care attendant scheme operated by the Irish Wheelchair Association provides relief for those relatives who bear continuous responsibility for the physically disabled in their homes.  The essence of the scheme is that a trained, reliable care attendant is available when the caring relative most need a break, for example in the evenings, at weekends or in the event of sudden illness.  Most families avail of the assistance of the care attendant on weekly basis.</P>
      <P>The scheme is in operation in Dublin, Cork, Laois, Donegal, Limerick and Clare.  The scheme is valuable and cost effective, its aim being the retention in the community of severely physically disabled people by providing the necessary support for them in their homes. However, a more intensive service is provided if the relative is under a serious degree of stress.  The scheme differs from the existing home help service in that it is more flexible &mdash; being available as and when the family require assistance, for example in the evenings, at weekends and during holiday periods.</P>
      <P>In recognition of this excellent service the Irish Wheelchair Association have received substantial funding from the national lottery for their home care attendants scheme.  This funding amounted to a total of £300,000 up to the end of 1990.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Woods, Minister for Social Welfare, recently provided a grant of £75,000 for the IWA to assist the organisation in the various services they provide, including the home care attendants scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, the health boards have provided further grant support for the scheme at local level.  The Southern Health Board provided grant support of £5,000 per annum to the IWA in recent years for this scheme the board have not cutback their funding to the IWA as might have been suggested by the Deputy.  I am aware that the home care attendants scheme is providing a valuable service for those involved in caring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Irish Wheelchair Association are experiencing difficulties in relation to this <Col N="2053" /> scheme in the Southern Health Board area, I would suggest that the association should discuss the matter with the board officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said there are mountains to be climbed, but on this issue the people of Wexford have waited 14 years. Throughout the eighties the number of students in this school has increased and currently stands at 657.  That is a situation which does not exist in every school, but it has not been recognised by the Department in relation to the facilities.  There has been much toing and froing on this issue during the past few years.  There is one clear issue.  All the preliminary work has been done and all we await is the indication from the Minister that the allocation of funds will be made and that he will give tender approval.  The tender documents could be ready within eight to 12 weeks and work could commence in 1991.  All we require is the decision that the Minister recognises the problems in Wexford and will provide the money.</P>
      <P>I will give a brief summary of conditions at this school.  The accommodation being used for teaching includes eight prefabs, two cloakrooms, two former bedrooms in what was an old dwelling house, a kitchen designed in the thirties which was never modernised and six other rooms which are totally unsuitable. There are three toilets for 170 12 to 19 years old girls in the old building.  There are no staff toilets and there is no school library, cloakrooms or gymnasium. There are no showers, no changing rooms, play areas, no language laboratories, no lockers for students, no vice principal's office, no lunch room, no geography room, no career guidance room.  I could go on.  Basic essentials are not provided in this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents think we do not care.  I care and the people of Wexford care.  One can blame parents or politicians who may have been too complacent over the past 14 years but there is a new determination. It seems to us in Wexford that school <Col N="2054" /> building funds are allocated without reason.  The real need is there.  I appeal to the Minister to allay the fears of Wexford tonight by giving a clear signal.  If we live in a democracy the pupils of Wexford should be treated no worse than the pupils in any other town.  I appeal to the Minister to give the go ahead immediately to this vital project.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his spirited case in support of the Wexford vocational school.  I do not mean to be in any way disparaging, but I see from the files which I examined today that absolutely no progress took place in relation to this school during the four-year period when Deputy Howlin's party were in Government.</P>

      <P>We have to be fair about where the blame lies.  It partially lies on this side of the House but also on the other side of the House.  When we establish that, we can go forward.  I agree that there is an urgent need to proceed with a new facility in Wexford.  I am fully aware of the condition of the existing facilities and every effort will be made to have the needs of the school met as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to provide a major extension at Wexford Town vocational school has reached an advanced stage of planning. However, in 1990 in common with all major building projects it became necessary to review the project in the light of declining demographic trends which had become evident throughout the country.  The Deputy will appreciate that such reviews, which are a regular part of the planning process, have become increasingly important in recent years because of changing population trends.  It is worth noting that the birth rate in County Wexford declined by 28 per cent in the years 1980-89.  In these circumstances it is imperative that all <Col N="2055" /> building projects be critically examined to ensure that the need for the proposed building is fully justified by long term projections of pupil numbers.  This is particularly important in multi-school centres such as Wexford.</P>
    <P>Inevitably a review of this nature disrupts the planning process, but nevertheless it is an essential part of procedure if unnecessary waste of capital resources is to be avoided.  In addition, the limited resources available require that economies be achieved where possible and therefore the costs of all capital projects are subjected to very careful scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In the case of Wexford Town Vocational School the review of the school's requirements indicates that the provision of 550 pupil places would be adequate to meet the school's long term needs.  As the project was being planned on the basis of catering for 800 pupils it is accordingly necessary to adjust the schedule of accommodation to be provided and to examine the need for changes to the plan to take account of reduced pupil numbers.  This further review of the project is being conducted by my Department and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken a very keen interest in having this review carried out as quickly as possible and she regrets not being able to be here to respond to Deputy Howlin.

      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise the embargo on social employment schemes.  The social employment schemes have been a great success and have been availed of extensively by many voluntary organisations, including parish councils, tidy town committees, development bodies, local authorities, co-ops and even State bodies. Excellent schemes, both environmental and social, of tremendous benefit have been carried out.  Many people who were unemployed for long periods jumped at the opportunity afforded by the social employment schemes.</P>
      <P>Many organisations throughout the country have planned imaginative and worthwhile schemes but cannot begin due to the embargo on all new schemes.  The position seems to be that no new approvals are being granted and, furthermore, that schemes approved are not allowed to commence.  I know of instances where all arrangements were made to commence work, workers were notified, interviewed and dates arranged. They are now being told that they may not proceed.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to intervene and have this embargo lifted so that many bodies throughout the country can commence work on what will be schemes of great benefit in their own area and to the environment in general.  I wish to thank the Minister for his presence in the House to reply this evening.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the external courses being run by FÁS.  I stress that I am talking about the external <Col N="2057" /> courses because at one stage the impression was given that we were questioning the very excellent and well organised detailed courses being run by FÁS in their training centres.</P>
      <P>My concern lies with the external courses on which we spent £6.8 million in 1990 to cover approximately 400 external courses throughout the country.  The courses are funded by taxpayers money and European Social Fund money.  I am not happy that the proper assessment or, more important, that the level of placement of the graduates of these courses is as high as is being stated by the Department. I would refer to the &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; given by the Secretary of the Department of Labour at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that 70 per cent of people were placed but when pressed he said no survey was done on the external courses.</P>
      <P>I hope we are getting value for money and that the Minister will give us that assurance tonight.  I would like an assurance also that we are not just in the numbers game in relation to these courses.</P>

      <P>I am raising tonight the need to extend the national gas grid to the satellite towns of Blarney, Riverstown and Glanmire and villages around Cork city as well as to the suburban area of Ballyvolane in Cork city.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that the potential of our natural gas resources are utilised to the full.  I want the Minister to extend the gas grid to these towns and the suburbs of Cork city for two reasons.  Natural gas is environmentally clean and is a substitute for oil and coal which we have to import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much regret the compartmentalisation of the environmental issue.  When I raised the use of natural gas in towns and villages in the context of the environment, I was told it was a matter for the Minister of the Environment. I ask the Department of Energy <Col N="2058" /> and the Department of the Environment to get together to ensure that the potential of natural gas is used fully in all our towns and villages where it is economically viable to do so.  It is environmentally important and is also a very efficient import substitute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGinley and Allen for their questions.  I have secured an Exchequer allocation of £57.785 million for the social employment scheme this year and it represents an increase of more than £7 million on last year's allocation. The Community assistance of £9 million approximately is available which means that there is a total of £67 million available for expenditure on the scheme this year.  There are more than 11,700 people on the scheme at present involved in about 2,000 projects throughout the country and the available funding of £67 million will allow an average participation level of £10,500.  This is a very significant level of expenditure and is evidence of the Government's commitment to help the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>If there is a difficulty it is because FÁS operate on a regional basis and each region has its own budget to cover the provision of training and employment schemes in the region.  This ensures a more equitable distribution of FÁS operations throughout the country resulting in some cases in requests for projects under the various schemes in parts of the country where demands did not exist prior to regionalisation.  There still will be over 10,000 people on the scheme.</P>
      <P>The other difficulty that may have arisen is that the introduction of the child dependant allowance last year proved very attractive to older unemployed people who now participate in the scheme far more than they ever did.  Fifty-seven per cent of participants have adult and child dependants compared with only 30 per cent at the end of 1989.  We are endeavouring on a regional basis to ensure that it is spread as fairly and evenly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Allen's question <Col N="2059" /> FÁS collects regular information on placement of all trainees, those placed in training centres and on external training courses, and the information indicates that the placement of mainline training programmes such as specific skills training, enterprise training and apprenticeship was between 65 and 70 over the last number of years.  I thank the Deputy for his remarks in that regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to external training, I asked FÁS some time ago to carry out further research on placements.  That relates to the question the Deputy asked at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  A very detailed survey was carried out on behalf of FÁS by the ESRI in 1990 and I understand the results are currently being analysed by the ESRI. I do not believe it is necessary for the Department but I certainly will make the examination of the level of placement from external courses public.</P>
    <P>Last year I brought in new regulations covering external training to make sure that there are audit procedures and that there is more accountability.  I hope both mechanisms will ensure that training is more efficient and better value than previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in the House recently, Bord Gáis Éireann are currently undertaking a pilot project, with the intention of supplying gas to two housing estates in Dublin which had not been linked to the grid up to now.  The results of this trial will not only enable the board to draw up a programme for connecting up other non-gas estates in Dublin, it will also provide the basis for considering an extension of the grid to non-gas estates <Col N="2060" /> in Cork and other urban areas linked to the existing national gas grid.</P>
      <P>BGE have, of course, a statutory obligation to earn a commercial return on their capital investment, and, in the light of that obligation, the board will connect only those areas where there is a sufficient take-up of gas to mount a viable project. I am glad Deputy Allen agrees with that, viability is the bottom line in these matters. In areas where the possibility of a connection is under examination, estates will be surveyed to find out the level of take-up.  At the same time BGE will explain to residents the costs involved for them in changing over to gas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that only a small proportion of householders in areas already served by the gas grid currently use gas central heating.  This leaves a considerable market for expansion within the area of the existing grid.  I would expect the board to continue to give priority to targeting this market since it requires comparatively little capital expenditure and would provide a more immediate return on investment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy recently raised the matter, by way of a Dáil Question, of extending supply to Blarney, Riverstown and Glanmire.  I took the matter up with Bord Gáis Éireann and I understand that because the size of the potential loads in these areas is not sufficient to meet the significant capital costs involved in providing a supply, viable projects could not be put in place at this time.</P>
      <P>I should say, however, that the natural gas grid has recently been extended into Carrigaline and this year a network will be developed to serve the commercial and domestic markets in the town.  I understand, also, that the feasibility of extending the grid to Ballincollig and of developing the commercial and domestic markets in Midleton in the future is being considered actively by BGE.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 22 March 1991.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to establish such a committee at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmental impact assessment procedures, in accordance with the relevant EC Directive, are now applied by my Department in respect of all marine fin-fish farms where production is to exceed 100t per annum.  Environmental impact assessment procedures in respect of fresh water fish farms are operated by <Col N="1952" /> local authorities as part of the planning process.  These procedures are thorough and involve an assessment of relevant water bodies, their assimilative capacities and the potential impact on adjacent fish stocks and the environment generally of any anticipated chemical usage.</P>
    <P>My powers in this general area derive from my role as licensing authority for fish culture projects and relate to the conditions which may be imposed through that regime.  In this connection my Department carefully monitors usage of chemicals at Irish fish farms and operates a notification procedure in relation to usage of certain products.  In addition, there are a number of other agencies at Government and local level with responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food, for example, control the use of veterinary medical products under the relevant EC Directives; the National Drugs Advisory Board have responsibilities in relation to the availability of drugs; and local authorities, to which I referred earlier, have responsibilities under the Planning and Water Pollution Acts.  I can take this opportunity, moreover, to advise the Deputy that an interdepartmental working group, set up by the Government, under the auspices of my Department, are already considering the environmental aspects of freshwater aquaculture installations and it would not be my intention, pending at the least the outcome of that group's investigations, to pursue the setting up of an additional committee.  That group's work is progressing and is taking into account, for example, experience in other countries with fish farming industries.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would take this opportunity to advise the Deputy that on 26 February last my Department published a major study in relation to the impact of fish farming on Irish coastal waters.  The report was written by Dr. Richard Gowan of the National Environment Research Council of Scotland and assessed the results to date of my Department's extensive monitoring programmes for the industry in five long term intensively farmed areas, Mulroy <Col N="1953" /> Bay, County Donegal, Killary, County Mayo, Ballinakill, Bartraghboy and Kilkieran, County Galway.  I was keen that this assessment on the impact of fish farming on the marine environment should be undertaken so that the facts and their scientific evaluation could be presented objectively in the interests of better informed public discussion of the issues involved.  The report confirms my view that by and large our fish farms are properly maintained and have little or no adverse impact on the environment.</P>

      <P>There is intense competition annually in the hake fishery on the coral grounds off the south-west coast between trawlers, <Col N="1954" /> longliners and gillnetters from a number of countries including Ireland, France, Spain and the UK.</P>
      <P>The question of imposing an EC wide ban on fishing in this area during spawning periods in the interests of conserving stocks is to be actively pursued by my Department's scientists at forthcoming scheduled scientific expert group meetings under the auspices of ICES over the next few months.  I am hopeful that arising from these meetings positive recommendations on closed seasons for the hake fishery will emerge.  My Department are also raising this issue directly with the Commission.  I should point out to the Deputy that I am precluded from taking national measures which would affect the fishermen of other member states and that effective action on this issue may only be taken at Community level and on the basis of expert scientific advice.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to his written questions of 20 February which provided a breakdown of the Irish registered fleet by type of vessel and defined the type of ships which engage in the liner trades.</P>
      <P>As he will recall from last month's reply, the Irish registered fleet is currently made up of 82 ships with a total carrying capacity of just over 190,000 tons.  The fleet is mainly composed of small ships of between 1,500 and 5,000 tons deadweight which are predominantly deployed in the European short sea trades.</P>
      <P>That is not to say however that Irish ships never venture beyond the near continental area.  On occasion in recent years Irish vessels have operated in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  It is not possible therefore to give a definitive breakdown between long and short haul services.  Shipowners decide on cargoes and destinations on the basis of current market rates and the suitability of their vessels to the particular trade.  The availability of cargoes for the return trip (backloads) is also a crucial factor.  As more than 70 per cent of Irish trade is with the EC countries it is hardly surprising to find that the great majority of Irish ships operate to, from and between European countries.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, I would again refer him to the reply to his written question of 20 February in which the nature of liner conference vessels and their operation was explained.</P>

      <P>No targets as such were set for job creation in the inland fishing industry. The potential for long term growth was, however, identified at 1,500 new jobs.</P>
      <P>Direct estimates of the level of employment directly and indirectly generated on the basis of the inland fisheries resource are not produced on a regular basis.  The Economic and Social Research Institute have estimated that in 1988 the level of employment generated was the equivalent of 1,900 full-time jobs.</P>
      <P>There are no estimates available of the trend in employment in the sector since that date but, in view of the general expansion which has occurred in tourist-related activity, I expect that this sector has made a positive contribution to employment creation in recent years.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the importance of the shellfish industry in the Bantry Bay area.  It accounts for a significant <Col N="1957" /> proportion of the output from the Irish shellfish sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is a major objective of my Department to support the shellfish industry generally by the implementation of programmes designed to ensure that consumers are assured of the highest quality standards in the industry and, in particular, that any risks of illness from consuming shellfish are minimised.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware there is a significant risk of illness from eating contaminated mussels.  To protect consumers and markets the most stringent controls must be applied.  Since my Department initiated the shellfish monitoring programme in 1984, there have been no reported cases of related human illness due to DSP (Diarrhoetic Shellfish Poisoning) despite high levels of the organism which gave rise to DSP being recorded in the waters in the south west in 1984, 1987, 1988 and 1990.  Additional results of this policy are that the reputation of Irish mussels is excellent and the growers accordingly command the highest prices.  This programme has been highly successful and it depends for its success on taking no risks that contaminated fish products should be put on the market for human consumption.</P>
      <P>I am of course concerned that these programmes be administered and organised on an effective and cost efficient basis from both the perspective of the Department and the industry as a whole. In this regard and taking account of the experience of recent years, I am at present considering options to further improve the testing programme.  These options include the appointment of regional stations which could carry out the tests to prescribed standards under the auspices of my Department.  Responsibility for additional costs associated with this option would have to be worked out.  I have instructed my Department to bring forward proposals in this regard as a priority matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy, in the first instance, that I am well aware of the importance of our fishing grounds and of the need to engage in ongoing research in order to extend our knowledge of the resources they contain. To this end, my Department and BIM carry out a series of exploratory fishing voyages and surveys each year, sometimes using my Department's own research vessel, the <i>Lough Beltra,</i> while on other occasions fishing vessels chartered from the industry are used.  These voyages have proved very successful not only from the point of view of extending our knowledge of traditional fish stocks but also in the identification of new species of commercial potential to the industry here.</P>
      <P>With specific reference to the Soviet Union, I would like to inform the Deputy that a highly successful and cordial agreement already exists between this country and the USSR in the field of marine research.  The Polar Research Institute in Murmansk carries out an annual acoustic survey of blue whiting during their spawning period off the west coast of Ireland in March and April each year. For a period of three to five weeks, Irish scientists, both from my Department and University College Galway, Join their Soviet counterparts on board ship and work in close co-operation on the study of this important and relatively unknown species.  While on board, the Irish scientists also engage in research on horse mackerel eggs and a variety of other studies.</P>
      <P>This co-operation with the Soviet Union in fisheries research is of substantial value to the Irish fisheries sector. I will be exploring on an ongoing basis all means of further developing this co-operation in fisheries research.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement of the European Commission that grants for aquaculture projects will only be awarded where the projects are fully licensed.</P>
      <P>My Department accord priority to licensing projects which have a good prospect of attracting EC grants.  I have already increased the resources available to the aquaculture and research division of my Department to strengthen the licensing programme.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy is aware, the process of licensing is a complex one and is designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to protect the rights of other water users.</P>
      <P>The position in 1990 has been that nine aquaculture projects were approved for aid amounting to £1,596,824 in the April tranche.  In the October tranche a further project was approved to total grant aid of £93,700.  Of these, three were shellfish projects, with a total value of £448,095. A number of projects were not approved in both tranches but these remain eligible in future tranches so that there is no question of any loss in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will continue to endeavour to overcome any difficulties that are in the way of licensing projects in line for grant aid. In some instances, however, serious difficulties of legal and other natures arise and are not readily resolved.  Before a project can be, or will be licensed, I must be satisfied that it will not damage the environment.  Promoters can help expedite the process by supplying information requested in this regard.  I would also make the point, that licensing does not guarantee grant aid from the EC for <Col N="1960" /> any project as a number of other criteria are also applied.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the aid being made available to certain harbour authorities under the operational programme on peripherality 1989-1993.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the EC aid available to port authorities under the programme is fixed.  Having examined our particular circumstances the Government decided that the goals of the programme, of offsetting the impact of Ireland's peripheral location and assisting sub-regional development, could best be achieved by spreading the allocation over all of our key ports.</P>
      <P>The programme provides that harbour authorities can receive grant aid of up to 50 per cent of their approved project costs.  If the programme were to provide for a level of aid comparable to that which obtains under the Northern Ireland programme, the result would be less effective in our particular circumstances, because all our important ports would not benefit to the extent which the current level of aid allows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of availability for work and genuinely seeking work, these are statutory conditions. To receive unemployment benefit or assistance, a person must be available for and genuinely seeking but unable to find, suitable employment, having regard to age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  These conditions are a common feature of unemployment payment schemes in many countries.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides also that the onus is on the individual claimants to prove that he or she is available for work. It is a question for the deciding officers and appeals officers to decide whether any claimant has shown that he or she fulfils the conditions having regard to the available evidence.  It is thus simply not possible to have guidelines defining the circumstances when a person is available or not, the only guidelines that can be given are those aimed at ensuring that investigations are adequate and are conducted in a thorough and impartial manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All claimants are normally asked when making a claim for unemployment benefit or assistance to complete a questionnaire regarding their efforts to obtain employment.  If there is any element of doubt about the position, the deciding officer may seek further relevant information on such matters as the extent to which the claimant has made efforts to obtain employment since becoming <Col N="1970" /> unemployed; the type of work the claimant is seeking and the reasons for any restrictions which the claimant may be placing on the type of work he or she is available to do; whether there are domestic or other commitments or circumstances which limit the claimant's ability to accept full-time employment which would normally be regarded as suitable, whether the claimant has a history of leaving employments frequently, without good cause.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the replies given to questions such as these the deciding officer determines whether the person is or is not available for and genuinely seeking work.  Each case has to be considered on its own merits and it is a matter for the deciding officer to decide the evidence required in any case having regard to the individual circumstances of the claimant.  These guidelines are internal documents and communications which relate to the day-to-day running of social welfare schemes.  There are no plans to publish them.</P>
    <P>Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer has the right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of invalidity pension from 12 September 1985.  In September 1990, my Department became aware that he may have been working as a security person on a building site.  He was interviewed by social welfare inspectors on 27 September 1990.  He denied then that he <Col N="1971" /> had been working.  However, following further investigations it appeared that he was, in fact, working at this site.  In October 1990 inspectors interviewed the client who admitted that he had been working on the site for the previous six weeks.</P>
      <P>Because he was working whilst claiming invalidity pension, payment of pension was disallowed from 1 September 1990, the date from which he admitted working.  His payment was stopped on 3 January 1991.</P>
      <P>He appealed against this decision on 8 January 1991 claiming that he was not working at the site.  He submitted medical evidence in support of his claim to be medically incapable of work.  The matter has been referred to the independent social welfare appeals office who will shortly be contacting him directly concerning his appeal.</P>

      <P>The Department of Defence considered the person in question unfit for work as a shipwright because he suffered from vertigo and could not work at heights.  He was considered fit for, and capable for, other work, not involving heights.  He declined to accept an offer made by the Department of an alternative position as a storeman.  When certified as permanently incapacitated for the duties of his employment as shipwright, he retired on health grounds in January 1987 with a gratuity and pension.</P>
      <P>Decisions on claims for disability benefit are matters for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer subvention to CIE in 1991 in respect of essential public transport services will amount to nearly £110 million.  In addition, the public capital programme for 1991 provides for capital expenditure by CIE of £36.2 million, of which £5.7 million has been allocated for expenditure on railway signalling and track replacement, an increase of over 137 per cent on the 1990 allocation of £2.4 million.</P>
      <P>The allocation of resources within the group's individual capital programmes is a matter for the board.</P>
