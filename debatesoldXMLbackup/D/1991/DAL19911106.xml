      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach whether the Government have any plans to introduce amendments to the Companies Act in view of the possible gap in the legislation disclosed in replies given by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications yesterday in so far as the powers of an inspector under section 14 of the Act in regard to the seeking of information on bank accounts and the beneficial interest in transactions are concerned.  This arises in relation to the Telecom inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assist in the matter by saying that this is an issue that was referred to by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications yesterday. Clearly, he could not deal with the issue because it is a Government <Col N="318" /> matter to decide on companies legislation. Perhaps the Taoiseach will be able to give me some indication on that in view of the importance of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, it does not come within the Chair's terms of promised legislation but, as usual and in accordance with my constant excess of generosity and courtesy in the House, I suggest to the Deputy that probably the best thing to do would be to wait until the present investigations have been completed and then we can consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach, in view of the recent statement by District Justice Wine about the unsuitability of the juvenile detention centre at Lusk, what plans he has to bring forward the <Col N="319" /> promised legislation to deal with that matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach when the amendment Bill for Oireachtas allowances and parliamentary pensions will be introduced.  Will it be taken this session?  When will the provisions of that Bill be brought into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will certainly be taken this session.  The general thrust of the Bill will come into effect immediately. However, as the Deputy knows, some of the provisions relate to things that can happen only after the next general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you have indicated to me that it is a matter for the Members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to call a meeting of that committee.  My understanding is that the Government Whip has indicated to my Whip that it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle to call such a meeting.  Indeed, you have on file a letter from Deputy McCartan seeking a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss the question of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  That is one of the matters I was anxious to discuss with the Chair.  I now ask you to convene a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that that specific issue can be dealt with as a matter of urgency? You have ruled out a number of questions, a Cheann Comhairle on this basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, I have to dissuade you from taking on the Chair so often in this manner.  It will not get the Member anywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek your advice, a Cheann Comhairle, on whether Item No. 49 on the Order Paper will be taken in Government time.  I understand there is a precedent for that as it is a Government Standing Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure to what the Deputy is referring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 49.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is item No. 33 and No. 49.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to the negativing of a statutory instrument by the Minister for Health.  There is a prescribed period of time in which the Dáil can discuss that, and Government time would be needed for that discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy will allow me an opportunity to consider the matter.  Perhaps it could be considered by the Whips also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach when he proposes to have the debate in the House in advance of the Maastricht Summit in view of the fact that the British Government have made a very full statement of what they would not accept at Maastricht and also in view of the fact that the Taoiseach is making a statement outside the House on this matter today.  When does he propose to have a discussion in the House on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that probably the week before the Summit at Maastricht would be the most effective time for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that that would leave very little time for the Government's mind to be influenced by anything said here and that an earlier discussion would be more productive from everybody's point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am easy about the matter, but the nearer we get to the Maastricht meeting the more firm the proposals which we could debate will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach whether he has any plans to alter the format of the debate on the Estimates this year.  In the past the debate has been very unsatisfactory in so far as scrutinising what is going on and has predominantly comprised word-processed and pre-digested speeches from Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedure will be followed but we hope to give more time.  I have indicated that we hope to give time to have each Estimate discussed fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about changing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Taoiseach that the format of the debate <Col N="322" /> be such that there would be an interchange of questions on some of the details which is not permitted under the present system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not a matter that might be discussed by the Whips?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said in the House earlier &mdash; which I thought was a major step forward &mdash; he was going to make special provision this year to allow line-by-line examination of the Estimates. Now it appears it is just a question of more time and that we are not going to have a change in the format of the debate.  If that is the case the Taoiseach has taken a step backwards from a statement he made earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Government under health, the Government are committed to developing the health services to ensure equality of access to services irrespective of means.  That is not happening at present, because of the financial circumstances obtaining.  There is an urgency about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>As the Chair frequently abides by precedent here may I ask you, sir, at your convenience to convey to my office what precedent, if any, exists for the refusal of the Ceann Comhairle to meet with the leader of a group or party in this House?  It is unprecedented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I revert to the matter of the Maastricht Summit.  The Taoiseach will be aware that yesterday the British Government issued a statement, through their Foreign Secretary, setting out fundamental positions on a number of issues. Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be extremely helpful if he would do the same with regard to his Government and allow us debate the issues in this House well before the summit takes place, as is happening in the House across the water?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a fairly comprehensive statement this morning setting out our position on most matters. Again, the Deputy should understand that the process of negotiation is still in progress.  The Deputy should understand also that the approach of the British Government in regard to these negotiations is totally different from ours.</P>

I tabled questions to the Minister for the Environment and attempted to raise on the Adjournment the growing problem of repossessions and evictions and I was told on each occasion that that is not the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.

    <Title>Criminal Damage Bill, 1990: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> In page 8, lines 16 to 19, to delete subsection (3).</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 (3) reads:</P>
      <P>(3) A compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property concerned and the approximate cost of making good the damage to it (or, where appropriate, of replacing it) are readily ascertainable.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important Bills that will pass through this House this session, which, unfortunately, is not receiving the attention it deserves.  Built into this Bill is our overall approach to the problems of criminality and those who will commit serious offences in the future.  Here we are talking about something very close to the problems confronting many residents of this city and country, that is, damage to property whether by way of stolen cars, joy-riding, damage to property itself, causing injury to the ordinary person in the street going about their daily business.</P>
      <P>What we are endeavouring to do by way of the provisions of this Bill typifies what is wrong with our whole penal system.  We are giving the courts a choice of whether they should commit somebody to prison or impose a fine on them. For the first time in our legislation we are attempting to give the courts that little additional power, that is, to make a compensation order but we are going halfway only.  We are beginning to pull back in that we are going to impose all sorts of restrictions on a victim, the person who has suffered at the hands of a criminal. We are saying that the courts cannot make a compensation order unless the owner of the property, the person who suffered, and the approximate cost of making good the damage are readily ascertainable.  Why should a person who suffers damage to their property have to go to the trouble of ensuring that the actual cost of the damage is known?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the thinking here. What happens daily in our courts is that people come before them, the judge <Col N="326" /> looks at the Act under which he will hear the relevant offence and examines the options open to him.  He may say: &ldquo;I can impose a fine that probably relates to a law that dates back 50 years, the fines themselves are out of date or, alternatively, I can impose a prison sentence of, say, six or 12 months.&rdquo;  Rather than let somebody away with a miserable fine he imposes a prison sentence and the person in question finds themselves in prison.  In order that that person may go into prison somebody who has committed a much more serious offence is released from prison.  As the Minister knows, we have approximately 2,000 prison places only to accommodate approximately 7,000 people.  Therefore, there is this merry-go-round, of somebody going into prison while somebody else is released to make a place for them, all because of bad legislation.</P>
    <P>Compensating the victims of crime &mdash; which we are attempting to do here &mdash; is a means for our courts to impose a practical penalty on somebody who commits an offence which involves damage or loss to some other person.  I do not believe we should tie the hands of the courts by making certain that they cannot make a compensation order unless both the owner of the property concerned and the cost of making good the damage are readily ascertainable.  No obstacle should be put in the way of the courts if they decide it is better that a person should make good the damage he has caused and compensate the owner rather than spend a month or six weeks in prison so that he will become a better criminal while he is there.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to agree to amendment No. 9.  The deletion of the subsection would strengthen rather than weaken the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we last dealt with this Bill on 19 June I understood that amendment No. 9 was to be withdrawn on the basis that it would be considered again by the Minister together with amendment No. 8 and that the matter would be raised again on Report Stage.  As Deputy Barrett has made a <Col N="327" /> comment, I should like to make an observation on what has been said.</P>
      <P>Section 9 provides for the imposition of an order directing a person convicted of having caused malicious damage to make compensation, possibly in addition to a term of imprisonment.  Deputy Barrett has suggested that it would be an alternative to imprisonment and I wish to correct that.  Earlier in the debate I tabled amendment No. 6 a in an attempt to achieve what Deputy Barrett believes to be provided for in the Bill.  This is important legislation, a new departure in our legislative code.  Given the overcrowding of our prisons and the little practical benefit of locking people up, other than keeping dangerous people out of circulation, as well as the huge cost to the taxpayer of keeping people in prison, it is important to devise means to avoid putting people there.  If we provide for the adequate compensation of a victim, the court should be entitled to consider that as reasonable grounds for making an order as an alternative to imprisonment. However, subsection (1) provides for the possibility of making an order in addition to the imposition of a term of imprisonment. I had argued in my amendment that an order should be an alternative to a prison sentence.  When a person is committed to prison and a compensation order is attached, there is no practical hope that the compensation will be paid. The person imprisoned will have no incentive to abide by the compensation order.  The matter should be dealt with on the basis of imprisonment only, from the point of view of the offender.  I argued that the provision should be couched in strict terms as an alternative to imprisonment but that was not acceptable.  The section will be weaker as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett's amendment is an attempt to compensate the victim.  One of the principles of court proceedings is that there, must be a finality in criminal matters.  I do not see how a court could order the payment of compensation to a person whose identity was not ascertainable at the time and where it was not possible to establish reasonable cost.  I <Col N="328" /> have no particular difficulty with sub-section (3) but I believe that section 9 has been weakened by the failure of the Minister to appreciate that a compensation order should be a strict alternative to imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 (1) states:</P>
      <P>On conviction of any person of an offence under section 2 of damaging property belonging to another, the court, instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way, may, on application or otherwise, make an order (in this Act referred to as a &ldquo;compensation order&rdquo;) requiring him to pay compensation in respect of that damage to the owner of the property.</P>
      <P>That would suggest that the court is being given discretion by the inclusion of the words &ldquo;instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way&rdquo;.  Section 2 gives the court discretion whether to impose a fine or a prison sentence.  I would argue that the court does have discretion to make a compensation order rather than to imprison the person.</P>
      <P>Perhaps because I am not a lawyer I look at legislation differently.  Precedent built up in the courts does not make sense to the ordinary person.  If somebody is brought before the court having damaged property to such an extent that it constitutes a serious offence and if the owner of the property cannot be ascertained and the cost of repair and replacement is not known, the judge should be able to tell that person to come back before the court in three or four months, having completed the necessary investigations.  We should not be bound by the custom which has been established in the courts that a matter must be dealt with finally on a particular day and cannot be left over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody takes my car and rams it into a wall, damaging both the car and the wall, it does not do me any good if that person is sent to Mountjoy and kept there for a week at a cost of several hundred pounds to the taxpayer before being released due to overcrowding in the prison.  If it takes ten years for that person to make good the damage, paying <Col N="329" /> even £1 a week, he should be made do it.  The real deterrent is hitting somebody in the pocket.  He would think a second time before taking a car again.  If he is simply sent to prison for a month it will not cost him a thought, especially since he is likely to be released after a week. Taxpayers have to foot the bill for such people in Mountjoy Jail for one or two weeks.  That is no deterrent.</P>
    <P>I do not think it makes any sense whatsoever to include in legislation provisions which tie the hands of the court in making common sense decisions in the future.  Can someone explain the common sense behind providing that a compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property concerned and the approximate cost of making good the damage are readily ascertainable?  I want the Minister to tell me the common sense &mdash; I do not want him to read his script &mdash; behind incorporating such a provision in the law.  Why should we tie the hands of the court by including the words &ldquo;readily ascertainable&rdquo; in this subsection?  If the courts want to spend three months finding out what damage was caused and who the actual owner of the property is, we should let them do it and not tie their hands.</P>
    <P>We have to approach legislation like this from a common sense point of view. We must realise that what we are doing at present will not solve our problems. Our prisons are full and some prisoners are being let out to accommodate others. The whole system is a sham.  It is costing the taxpayers but is not solving our difficulties.  Prisons are institutions to which people who commit serious offences should be sent.  These people should serve their sentences and be given help so that when they leave prison they will be able to fit back into society.  Prisons should not be used as places to which people are sent for a week or fortnight without any treatment being given to help them fit back into society.  We are achieving nothing if these people have to go through this whole process again.</P>
    <P>Why should criminals not be made refund to their victims what they have <Col N="330" /> lost?  We now have the opportunity to provide for compensation orders for damage to property; this happens regularly. At present people who cause damage to property get a prison sentence or have a miserably low fine imposed, but what about the unfortunate victims? They should be compensated in some way.  We should give the courts the discretion to decide even if it takes two, three or four years, whether to make an order to make good the damage caused to property.  Why should we tie the hands of the court simply because there appears to be precedent in the courts?  It is time we did away with that precedent and started to deal with such issues in a common sense way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete subsection (3) in its entirety.  This subsection provides that a compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property and the approximate cost of making good the damage to the property or of replacing it are readily ascertainable. In other words, it provides for the simple straightforward case.  The object is to ensure so far as possible that the compensation order which is made on a conviction is based on readily ascertainable facts and is, therefore, likely to be reasonably accurate.  It would not be appropriate for the Criminal Court to enter into complicated inquiries about the extent and cost of the damage.  The civil courts are better equipped to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy with what Deputy Barrett said.  He has put across his case in a very sincere way.  I understand the demands he is making for flexibility.  He wants to ensure that compensation orders are made in as many cases as possible. However, there is another side to this issue.  It would be unwise to put the Criminal Court, which must deal quickly with the question of guilt, in the position that it would have to go into the exact amount of compensation payable.  This would have to be done in such a way that no unfairness would be done to the owner <Col N="331" /> of the damaged property.  This would take some time.</P>
    <P>If the owner can produce reliable evidence of the cost of the damage the court can make the order there and then &mdash; there is no problem with that.  No doubt that would be the proper and most fair way.  If the owner cannot produce this information he cannot complain if the judge does not make an order.  How can a court make an order to pay compensation if it does not know the owner of the property, the value of the damage done to the property or the cost of replacing the goods damaged?  The courts must have these facts available to them.  We have to take all these issues into account. We cannot allow for a grey area or vagueness. The law must be clear in the direction it gives the courts.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McCartan rightly said, when we discussed both this and the previous amendment on 19 June last, I undertook to look again at the adequacy of the reference to the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in subsection (1).  This has implications for this subsection also and, when we have fully completed our deliberations, may involve the introduction of a consequential amendment on Report Stage. I want to assure the House again that I will take into account all that has been said during this debate.  I intend to further consider this matter in detail with my officials and I hope to come back with a better amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, my experience with the Department of Justice since 1987 has been that nothing is given on Report Stage.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, occupied the Minister's seat between 1987-89 some of our amendments were accepted.  However, one has to be realistic and remember that they were a minority Government and during that time we had some good debates in this House.  This proves that Committee Stage debates can improve legislation.  It is irrelevant whether legislation is improved by this side of the House or the other side; if it is good legislation and is in the interests of the <Col N="332" /> public, I go along with it.  I have no hang-up about whether Deputy McCartan, Deputy Bell or anyone else puts down the amendments so long as the legislation is improved.</P>
      <P>What the Minister has just said does not make sense.  Under our system of justice, the victim very often is not informed of a court case.  How many victims of crime have complained to us as public representatives that they heard no more about their cases until they picked up the evening paper or local paper and read that the person who committed the crime was in court?  These people are not informed of the court case; they are disregarded.  That is our criminal system.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it would be unreasonable to expect the court to start treating this as a civil matter.  Why would it be unreasonable to treat it in the manner I have suggested?  We are talking about a form of punishment which would be far more advantageous to the victims. Who can afford to go to a civil court to get compensation from the person who damaged a vehicle or property?  The criminal will be able to get free legal aid but the person who suffers will not and therefore will not go into the civil courts. They have to depend on the criminal courts to get this compensation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it would be unreasonable to expect a court to postpone its decision until the victim produced, to the satisfaction of the court, the value of the property damaged.  He also said the owner may not be known. If the court was not considering a compensation order, how would it know who was the owner?  This is a criminal offence. Since the owner of the property may not even know that a court case is proceeding, how would he be able to present himself in court as the owner of the property? Who would get this information for the judge?  We should be practical and reasonable about this.  With respect to the Minister, what he said does not make sense because the owner of the property may not be in court, may not know about the court case, and may not know that he should be there, knowing the actual value of the property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Surely the judge can say: &ldquo;I am thinking of imposing a compensation order and before doing so I want you to go away, find out for me who is the owner of the property, what was the damage caused to that property and come back to me&rdquo;.  We are saying he cannot do that.  What sort of legislation are we talking about?  The judge cannot do that because it is not the done thing in the courts.  This is 1991 and crime is rampant in the streets.  The public are asking me, Deputies Briscoe, Bell and Callely and the Minister to sort out this problem and pointing out that the present system is not working.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Government &mdash; I give credit to them for this &mdash; this is the first time we have seen the light and, in a Criminal Damage Bill, we are giving powers to the courts to impose compensation orders.  However, like everything else, we are afraid to go the full step; we are afraid of precedent.  The attitude is: we have to be careful here and it would not be right for the courts. I do not worry about the courts; I worry about the people.  I want to see more people being compensated for the damage caused to their property, in many cases by young hooligans who know that if a fine is imposed they cannot afford to pay it and if they are put into prison they will be released after one week.  We all know these hooligans who are going around town wrecking people's property. When they go into court they smile at the judge and at the prison officer who is taking them away for a week or a month because they know they will be out again.  What happens to the poor unfortunate victims?  Their insurance premium is increased and they lose their no claim bonus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How can a judge have that information available to him on the spot if the owner of the property does not know that the court case is being heard?  He will not be in court and may not have been informed.  We all know that happens every day of the week.  The owner of the property certainly would not go to court armed with a valuation from one of our leading auctioneers or one of our top motor garages because they do not know. Therefore, how will they have this information readily available.  This does not make sense.  I will put this amendment to the House if the Minister is not prepared to accept it.  I am not playing party politics here.  There are a sufficient number of people in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats who are as concerned as I am about this issue.  I hope they will persuade the Minister, through their contributions, to see sense and delete this subsection.</P>

      <P>I am very sympathetic <Col N="335" /> to and supportive of Deputy Barrett's amendment.  If it comes to a vote, naturally, I will have to vote with the Government.  That is the reality of life in politics but I support what Deputy Barrett has said.  People are fed up to their teeth about the record wave in crime.  People are entitled to be compensated. We are aware that a civil action costs a fortune.  People cannot afford to engage lawyers.  We are trying to reach a situation where the courts can administer justice.  Sadly, today we have lawyers and judges who are concerned only with the technicalities of the law but the people in the streets are crying out for justice.  I ask the Minister to give us an undertaking. He said he cannot accept this amendment now but that he will come back on Report Stage and say whether this subsection can be deleted.  As Deputy Barrett has said I do not think a change of wording will do anything.  I was the first Member to advocate that parents should be held responsible for the actions of their 14 and 15 year old children.  Some compensation must be paid to the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>Last night I witnessed a crime and helped to make a citizen's arrest of a young fellow.  As it so happened I had come from a meeting on vandalism.  One of the people who had attended the meeting had his car broken into.  He caught this young fellow in the car, wiring it up in readiness to steal it.  He ran off and was caught.  I helped the person who made the citizen's arrest on him.  A short while later the inspector, who was also at the meeting, came along and marched him off to the garda station.  That young person was laughing.  He said: &ldquo;Inspector, you will have to wait until next year; I am only 15 now, and you cannot do anything with me now&rdquo;.  The State should make some recompense to the man whose car was ripped apart while it was being wired up by the young person in order to steal it.  If his parents are in receipt of the children's allowance it should be taken away.  This is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A district justice has said there is no way of knowing who the person was <Col N="336" /> whose property was either stolen or damaged.  Let us implement a system under which people will be compensated. The courts have what is known as the poor box and let us have a compensation box into which the parents of the guilty youths should pay compensation.  For those over 15 years of age the way to stop them committing crime is by awarding damages against them.  Last night the young person was mocking.  I said to him that he would spend the rest of his life in and out of prison, that he would end up as a toothless old lag and that life would pass him by.  The inspector said to me: &ldquo;That does not mean anything to him, he does not care, he does not know&rdquo;.  There are many people like him going through our streets.  I urge the Minister to do something now.  The legislation before us has been welcomed by the Opposition parties and let us make it work.</P>
    <P>We had a period of peace in the sixties during which much legislation was updated and changed.  When the whole situation deteriorated and we had vandalism on an unprecedented scale, suddenly we needed the old laws.  When we closed down Letterfrack and Daingean reformitories &mdash; it was correct that that should have been done &mdash; we did not open up any new secure detention centres.  The reason the situation has got out of hand is that many of those people have no respect for the law.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  The idea of forcing victims of crime to go through a civil procedure to get compensation is not on because they cannot afford it.  Law is too expensive today.  This is a wonderful opportunity to finally make people amenable to the law.  The only way a person who sets a car on fire will understand the gravity of his actions is when he is made to pay compensation.  Let the criminal pay.  If we have to take 10 per cent from his social welfare benefit for the next 20 years, I do not care.  The compensation should be payable to the victims.</P>
    <P>The law works on the side of the criminal, there is no question about that, and it is about time it was weighted on the side of the victim.  Not a day goes by <Col N="337" /> without calls to my office from suffering constituents.  It occurs not just in Dublin and in other cities, it occurs throughout the country.  We have a real problem on our hands and I urge the Minister to get tough on this.  I do not want to starve people or put them into concentration camps, as some people imply when I suggest that the law should be weighted on the side of the victim.  In this Bill we have a chance to compensate the victim.  I urge the Minister to consider this and not to allow these cases to go from the District Court to a higher court where few people will be able to afford costs, either the victim or the criminal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely agree with Deputy Briscoe.  I live in an urban area and as recently as last weekend a young fellow with a balaclava over his head smashed half a dozen shop windows in the main street of the town and was heading out of town before the squad car picked him up, still wearing his balaclava. This fellow, whom I know, has been convicted on a number of occasions on similar charges.  He is on unemployment assistance and he knows that the State cannot get anything from him, and that he will be put into prison for perhaps six months when he comes before the courts again.  All the people whose shop windows were broken still have to pay for them and their insurance premiums go up while the criminal is laughing at everybody. It does not cost him anything.  If he had to pay £10 or £20 a week from his unemployment assistance he would not break any more windows.  We must hurt the criminal where it really hurts, in the pocket.  It is not a good idea just to put some of these young scoundrels into detention centres most of which are inadequate, leaving the bill for the victim. Deputy Barrett's case for his amendment has been well made and I will support his amendment if it is put to the vote.</P>

This Bill <Col N="338" /> seeks to amend the law relating to damage to property.

In the light of the way Deputy Barrett explained his amendment, one cannot disagree with him.  This matter needs to be addressed urgently.  We need to get tough in this area.  We are well aware of individuals who have no respect for the Garda Síochána, the Judiciary or the courts.  They know they will get away with their crimes.  I totally agree with Deputy Bell in that the criminal must pay.</P>

If the State wants to wriggle out of its responsibility, it can do so here.  I submit that the State is wriggling out of its responsibility daily in that our streets are becoming <Col N="339" /> theatres of crime.  I experienced this personally in the past 24 hours in seeing how innocent people are becoming victims and are being terrified in their homes because of the nature of the crimes being committed in our cities.  The State is reneging on its responsibilities because it is not allocating adequate resources to combat criminals throughout the country.  Of the last 206 gardaí who qualified in Templemore only two have come to my city and county, a city and county with a population of 250,000 people.  There is lip-service by the Government and Government Deputies to the wages of crime and the victims of crime but when it comes down to putting into operation the only effective mechanism to prevent crime, the garda on the beat, we are not providing the resources.</P>

      <P>I have just outlined the manner in which the State and the Government are reneging on their responsibilities to the public.  Here, again, the victims are being left on the hook.  The victims may never know that there is a court case involving the criminal and suddenly can find themselves high and dry without any compensation.  There is no real service to help the victim to get over the trauma.  We are all hung up on the question of monetary compensation and compensation for loss of property.  What about the psychological <Col N="340" /> damage done to people because of criminal activity?  I had personal experience of this in the last 24 hours.  The continuing trauma for a victim in the days and weeks ahead cannot be quantified.  There is no professional therapy service available. There are a number of people who, out of their own resources, in their own time and through their own efforts, are helpful to victims of crime.  However, the State has opted out from offering any help or therapy for victims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one <Col N="341" /> more point.  Often the victim of a crime is intimidated.  When the amount of damage to their home or car has been assessed, the people who perpetrated the crime threaten that victim.  They say that if he appears in court his house will be burnt down, with him in it.  With the best will in the world, legislation often does not achieve what is intended because of victim intimidation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would look again at this section and provide that, where damage has been assessed by the Garda an assessor, or a reputable garage or other body, such as the Automobile Association or the RAC, that money would be paid into the court and held in what I would term a victim compensation fund.  The perpetrators of crime should be made to pay whether the victim turns up in court where the Garda can produce some evidence of the value of the property damaged.</P>
      <P>Ordinary people are frightened.  Only this morning I had a telephone call from one of my constituents who would not even give me his name.  Victims of crime are afraid to give their names.  This is what we are up against.  The Department of Justice needs to take a good hard look at some of the fear being generated in victims of crime.  We have an opportunity here.  Let us give this legislation teeth.  Let us get around the problem of the victim being afraid to go into court so that the judge can say to the perpetrator of the crime that, as he burnt a car, he should pay such an amount to the court compensation fund.  This money can be reallocated to the victim support fund.  Let the criminals pay for the damage they do.  That is the best recipe I know for the reduction of crime in our cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested to know if the Minister considers that subsection (3) is unduly restrictive.  Other Deputies have adverted to the fact that this is the first time that compensation has been given the statutory force of law, although it is fair to say that in practical <Col N="342" /> terms courts have been ordering compensation in favour of victims over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Barrett said.  Is it necessary to make the compensation order so restrictive?  I believe that the operational difficulties of sub-section (3) will make it somewhat difficult for courts to award compensation in certain circumstances.  The wording is &ldquo;a compensation order shall not be made&rdquo;. It does not give the court the opportunity to use its discretion, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, depending on the facts placed before the court or on any given set of circumstances.  There will be circumstances in which it is difficult to carry out a professional evaluation of the damage and the manner in which this subsection will be construed by the courts could give rise to a more restrictive position than operates at present.</P>
      <P>I certainly welcome the contents of section 9 which, for the first time in statutory form, allow the court to make an order for compensation.  It is important that we as legislators prompt the courts to move in that direction.  Vast amounts of moneys are due in unpaid fines.  Courts have made orders against defendants, on conviction, ordering them to pay fines for their wayward acts within a period of two, three or four months.  I would hazard a guess that, as from autumn 1991, we are talking about in excess of £10 million due to the State in terms of unpaid fines; this time last year it was about £12 million.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to ascertain the exact figures because I believe it is fundamental to any debate on compensation. The primary order that is being made daily in every court, in every part of this land, is being disregarded by criminals within our society to the extent of the £10 million, £12 million or £15 million outstanding.  We talk about law and order, the courts doing a duty on behalf of society.  Yet we allow such a massive amount of money to go unnoticed in terms of unpaid fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all in favour of compensation for victims to in some way alleviate the pain <Col N="343" /> of many thousands of victims of crime within our society.  I would hope that what the Minister has inserted in this section will not allow that process to be restricted.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have experienced in this city and in the country as a whole particularly nasty crimes of criminal damage.  Wanton and meaningless damage is taking place, not in furtherance of a robbery where a defendant will pocket some money for himself and try to get away with it, but where specific goods are targeted by criminal gangs.  We are seeing a particularly nasty and vicious process where damage is being perpetrated with no motive other than to wreak havoc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be described as action where there is no motive other than to inflict wanton and meaningless damage to a person's property. However, addressing that matter in this legislation the Minister has gone overboard in introducing a statutory restriction. When compensation orders were made in the past I do not think a superintendent or a judge plucked a figure from the air as an estimate of the value of the damage done to a window without having some back-up.  In any event, information is to be sought by the court. On that score I would ask the Minister whether there is a necessity for subsection (3) having regard to the fact that in practice no court is going to make a compensation order without first getting a global figure in respect of the cost of the damage done to the victim's property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the practice of our courts to order the payment of funds into what is best described as the court poor box.  This practice is gaining some importance in the orders made by many District Court and Circuit Court judges. I ask the Minister to look at this practice and ascertain the legal status of the court poor box.  In lieu of a fine or conviction, a defendant is required, at the discretion, I presume, of the local district court office <Col N="344" /> or justice to pay a certain amount of money into the court poor box.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the status of the court poor box is nor do I know the amount of money that is collected or paid into court poor boxes, but if this practice continues a strict set of guidelines and regulations should be introduced by the Minister or some other party, even though the Minister is best placed to introduce such a set of regulations and guidelines.  I have no evidence of any impropriety on the part of anyone with regard to the court poor box but it is a twilight zone between acquittal and conviction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would ask the Minister to comment on the status of the court poor box which is a form of compensation, but I wonder to whom.  This practice should be scrutinised because it is one with which I would not readily agree.  Having regard to this practice in certain parts of the country on my meagre calculations hundreds of thousands of pounds in lieu of fines are being paid to court poor boxes, but I wonder which sections of the poor in society are benefiting?</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the amount of money coming from the national lottery, the coffers of the health boards and the Department, while I am aware that under this subsection the victim will not have to appear in court to produce an estimate of the cost of the damage, a strict reading of it will set alarm bells ringing for a judge of the District Court or the Circuit Court that they must comply with the statutory requirement.  Where will that leave the victim who has an estimate of the damage done in his back pocket or in her handbag?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look at the pre-trial procedures and how the victim is treated between the time a charge is laid against the person who has been apprehended and the case is heard in court.  In many cases the victim will be left in the dark and, more often than not, will not have an opportunity to meet the chief superintendent or the State counsel prior to the case being heard.  Neither will the victim have any idea at what time of the day the case will be heard.  In many court cases it is difficult to distinguish between the victim and the defendant.  In many of our courthouses there are no rooms where a victim can consult with the chief superintendent prior to the case being heard.  Indeed, in many cases the chief <Col N="346" /> superintendent does not even want to know the victim once he knows he is there.  There is a need to build a pre-trial procedure into our legislation to recognise the rights of the victim.  We do not have such a procedure at present and there is nothing in the Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, which will lead us to treat the victim with any greater respect than we do at present.  Subsection (3) will require the victim to make sure that he has a professional estimate of the cost of the damage which will be scrutinised not only by the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but also by the learned counsel for the defence who clocks up a substantial legal aid bill in the course of the proceedings.  The sub-section reads that a compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property concerned and the approximate cost of making good the damage to it are readily ascertainable. When this requirement is written into the Statute Book it will place an onus on the judge to seek compliance with the Statute by asking the victim to come forward. There is that element of danger and it is a pity that this is all we are doing in terms of making life a little easier for the victim of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with an amendment which proposes to delete subsection (3).  I am in the remarkable position of trying to argue the Minister's Bill with his own Deputies who do not appear to have read the legislation.  The position of the victim has been particularly addressed in the provisions of this Bill because, for the first time in the proof of a charge of malicious damage, the victim will not have to be in court to prove the charge.  I ask the Deputies who are bleating about the worries of the victim in the context of this legislation to look at section 2 where proof of a charge of malicious damage &mdash; for the first time when this Bill is passed &mdash; will not require the presence of the victim, the owner of the property, in court.  Up to this when <Col N="347" /> the car was burned out, the wall was knocked down or other damage caused, it was an essential proof requiring the attendance of the unfortunate victim in court.  He or she had to go into the witness box to say the obvious, that he or she owned the motor car, and that they did not give permission to anybody to take it, to knock down a wall and so on.  Now, for the first time, the legislation will say that the charge can be proved without the presence of the owner because the issue of ownership does not come into it as long as it is not the property of the defendant.  That is a major advancement.</P>
      <P>We have been listening for the last hour or so to a debate about nothing in regard to subsection (3).  I fully subscribe to the concerns people have about ensuring that victims are properly protected and are treated properly in the context of a criminal prosecution.  I have spoken many times in this House about that but my remarks are tempered when I hear what is being said in the context of subsection (3) which is, as I said earlier, an eminently sensible provision.  It does not &mdash; and will never &mdash; require bringing in professional assessors, as has been suggested, to prove damage.  It says that the approximate cost of repair or replacement be ascertainable.  You are dealing at that stage in the criminal process when the proofs part has passed, the accused has been found guilty and now the issue is penalty.  It is a well established practice in our courts that the strict rules of evidence do not apply at that stage. What happens, invariably if not universally, in those situations is that the garda gives testimony to the court armed with an assessment document from a garage or a builder saying the damage will cost so much to repair.  The strict rules of evidence do not apply because you are dealing with penalties, not with proof of guilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously it is open to the defendant, but at his peril, to say that he does not agree with the figure or for his counsel to argue that point.  Perhaps then one might get into the realm of proof but no court, faced with that brazen attitude of the <Col N="348" /> defence, will say that it will not make an order for compensation and that it will put the matter back to allow the garda to assemble reasonable evidence if it is needed.  It is my experience, in a long number of years in practice in the criminal courts, that a defendant is advised to keep his mouth shut at that point; to start quibbling about figures on the level of compensation is not practical.  Therefore, I suggest that that portion of the section is a reasonable one and is in the spirit of recognising that criminal proceedings should be precise and finite.</P>
    <P>The other point was in regard to the owner.  I listened very carefully to Deputy Barrett and I accept that he is arguing from a genuine point of view.  I found Deputy Flanagan's intervention remarkable. He complained that the poor box is some kind of nether region about which we do not know very much.  In fact, the poor box represents the ultimate discretion of a court to extract compensation from a defendant.  Invariably, it is compensation which will not be paid to the victim but which will be held for disbursement by the court in various ways; it is the ultimate discretion from the point of view of the court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett wants discretion for the court and Deputy Flanagan does not. The problem I have in terms of Deputy Barrett's argument is that, where an owner cannot be ascertained, the provisions of section 9, nonetheless, should be applied.  To whom do you pay the compensation?  Is he not really talking about a fine at that stage?  If you cannot ascertain the owner of the property, you do not have a victim to compensate but if you are anxious to hit people in their pockets, then fine them.  There is adequate provision in the law to do this. You do not have to worry about the absence of ownership identity when it comes to the court being able to impose a monetary fine.</P>
    <P>In the context of section 9, which by and large, is a very good one except for the reservations I outlined earlier, I do not see that subsection (3) imposes restriction or undue limitation, as has been argued.  Deputy Barrett has also <Col N="349" /> tabled an amendment in which he talks about a very real restriction and I would be inclined to support him regarding the limit of 12 months as a period in which a compensation order can be paid. However, I do not see real restrictions in relation to the amendment which we are discussing.</P>
    <P>As long ago as 19 June we had agreed to look at the matter again on Report Stage and I hope the Minister will advance reasons which make it difficult for the court to act otherwise.  The Minister should also bear in mind that the judges act sensibly and within the realms of what is possible.  It may well be that there is a link between what Deputy Barrett is arguing and what the Minister seeks to maintain in terms of the law being able to act and not being seen as an ass.  We have had a very good debate but we should look at the subsection again on Report Stage and move on to something a bit more pertinent.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate Deputy McCartan's clarification in regard to sections of this Bill, I am nevertheless conscious of the fact that he is an expert in this area of law.  He has carved out a very successful career defending the perpetrators of crime.  I should not like to think that we would introduce legislation which was so black and white that there would not be any grey areas for the lawyers, which they love.  We should be aiming for clarity as far as this section is concerned.  I am sure the lawyers work for their crust and it is a pretty good crust.</P>

We have to restore the balance.  I say to Deputy Flanagan, who made a good contribution, that the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice has welcomed this Bill as being a much needed advance.  Governments <Col N="350" /> in the past 15 or 20 years may deserve to be blamed for not introducing this type of legislation but we need to get it through fairly quickly.  It is important that we discuss every line of this Bill.  We should make the most of the debate because the nation is crying out to us to do something and we should respond to that appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>People should not become intolerant about the length of the debate on a particular point.  I regard this as one of the most important aspects of this legislation.  On Committee Stage it is up to the Minister to convince the House of the need for this subsection.  That is not being arrogant.  It is the Minister's job to convince the House of the absolute need for this subsection.  I have not heard one word from any Member which convinces me that there is a need for this subsection.  It does not weaken the proposition of imposing compensation orders. Well established practices in the courts make my hair stand.  This country is bedevilled with ancient well established <Col N="351" /> practices in our legal system and it is time some of those practices were blown out the window.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, who has responsibility for prisons, knows that it cost £75 million of taxpayers' money this year to run the prison service, but that system is not working.  Crime is on the increase.  Statistics may show that there has been a slight drop in crime but the average person knows that crime is at a very dangerous level.  My wife was mugged in town yesterday and thousands of people will be mugged between now and Christmas.</P>
      <P>Recently, I visited a widow who underwent two serious operations.  She lives alone.  While she was in hospital young men and young women who had gathered in a laneway nearby decided to put a hose in her letterbox and turn on the water.  When the woman arrived home from hospital her house was flooded.  Those young people also knocked down the wall outside this woman's house.  That unfortunate woman has many problems with her illness but she now has to pay for the rebuilding of the wall because neighbours say it is dangerous and is her responsibility. She also has to pay for the damage caused to the interior of her house.  That is wanton vandalism.</P>
      <P>The children who caused this damage are not from so-called working class areas; they are children of middle class families who gather in these places.  They drink alcohol bought with money supplied, presumably, by their parents.  They all attend second level colleges.  Those responsible should pay for the damage they caused.  If a judge places an attachment order on their income, applicable from the day they start earning until they are 65 years old, so be it.  It is not so much for the money but society should not tolerate this behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is better that we spend an hour arguing this very good principle and pass legislation that is good and proper than have public meetings called by vigilante groups, in many cases instigated by the Provos who impose their own laws and <Col N="352" /> find solutions to the problems concerning so many citizens in the State.  This is due to the well established practices in our court which result from our legislation being weak.  If we think that by trotting out legislation which provides that the courts may impose a fine and/or a prison sentence of up to a maximum of 12 months, as is provided for in section 2, we will solve the problems, we are living in cloud cuckooland.</P>
    <P>By all means we should put these people away but it will not solve the problems.  If we provide that these people should contribute something to society and that as long as they work they have to make up for the damage they caused to people such as the unfortunate woman about whom I spoke, we may solve the problem.  There are times when we have to quote examples to bring home to these people the severity of the suffering they cause.  When I call to the house of the woman I mentioned she has to open two or three locks before the door is eventually opened.  People are being terrorised in their homes.  I do not care about well established practices in our courts.  It is time the Minister ignored the advice being given him and accepted amendments put down by Members who represent ordinary people.  The Minister has not convinced me of the need to tie the hands of the court.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan said he was satisfied that the courts may or may not do something, but the courts should be in no doubt.  What is the sense in providing that a compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property concerned and the approximate cost of making good the damage to it or, where appropriate, of replacing it are readily ascertainable?  What is the necessity for that provision?  As Deputy McCartan said, the courts may or may not make such an order.  I do not want to pick up the newspaper in 12 months time and read the comments of a district justice that he would have imposed a compensation order for the owner of such a vehicle but the legislation prohibited him from doing so.  That is what we will likely <Col N="353" /> be reading because the courts may interpret the law in that way.  Why should the innocent person always have to go with the begging bowl?  Deputy McCartan is right when he says that the fact that the owner of the property no longer has to be in court is an improvement but should he ever have to be in court?  Why should we not have a system which would apply in cases, as I have just quoted where it is obligatory for the State to advise the person that the accused is coming before the court; that it be obligatory that the person be consulted and told the outcome of the case; and that it be obligatory that the person be allowed attend the court to hear the court's decision on the young hooligan who caused them such pain and hardship?  Why should we have a one-sided system?  Of course, the accused should have proper representation and a fair trial.  I do not begrudge the accused proper representation but equally, I argue that the other side should get the same treatment.  It took this House many years to recognise that in rape cases there was a need to consider the victim.  It took a great deal of persuasion and a change in public opinion to ensure that the rape victim was considered.  Eventually, however, the rights of the rape victim were recognised in the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  It is about time that we had similar thinking in relation to other aspects of crime.</P>
    <P>I could give another example, indeed I am sure many spokespersons have met parents who are very concerned about drunk driving cases.  One family told me how they had read in the newspaper that the person who murdered their son, as they said, had appealed his case and the prison sentence was dismissed and a fine imposed instead.  How would one feel if one picked up the evening newspaper and read that the person convicted of drunk driving in the case where one's son or daughter was killed had appealed the case, was no longer going to prison, and instead a fine was imposed?  Nobody had ever bothered to call on those people and ask how they were.  They were not told that the convicted person was appealing his case, the date on which the <Col N="354" /> case would be heard or informed about the court procedures.  These people are very bitter about this, and rightly so. They say that we, the legislators, do not care about them; but of course a public representative will attend the funeral and shake hands.  They blame us, and rightly so, because we should have changed the laws that affect ordinary people and not defend well established practices.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to give me very good reasons for retaining section 9 (3) because what I have heard does not convince me one iota.  I believe it is unnecessary, is restrictive and will lead to all sorts of doubts.  Deputy McCartan may be right in what he says but I am entitled to read it as an ordinary lay person and, as with some later provisions in the Bill, it does not make sense to me.  We have the opportunity to delete this subsection and that is what I am proposing to do in my amendment.  Quite frankly, I am not going to be fobbed off by the Minister saying he will consider it on Report Stage.  As Deputy McCartan has said, it is five months since we last discussed this Bill and the Minister should not need further time to think about it.  This matter does not have to be referred to the Attorney General, the matter should be debated in this Chamber and, if it is right it is right, and if it is wrong it is wrong.</P>
    <P>It is irrelevant to wait until Report Stage to delete this subsection.  What is wrong with this House is that we tend to put things off until the next day.  The Minister should not need more time to think about it; either he comes down on the side of clarity and ensures that victims are compensated or he does not.  If the Minister takes that road he should go the whole way and give the courts discretion to impose a compensation order.  There is no need to tie the hands of the courts as in the present subsection.  When the evidence was presented to a judge that a person was being charged with having burned ten cars in a housing estate, as happened in my constituency, the court did not go into the details of the value of the cars.  Indeed the owners were not circulated by the chief superintendent <Col N="355" /> and told that the case was coming up, as the criminal charge was brought by the State.  In fact, under the present system the owner will not know about it.  The owner should be informed and should be able to tell the court the value of his car. Indeed the chief superintendent should be armed with that information and should be able to present it in evidence to the judge.  Indeed in one night's work a young hooligan caused approximately £90,000 damage in my constituency.  It was just for fun.  Indeed when the fire brigade came on the scene, he only jangled the car keys and told them they would have to come back later.  He caused £90,000 worth of damage, yet he might get only three or four months in St. Patrick's.  I know what I would do with him.  I would ensure that there would be a debt on his back for the rest of his life and something would be deducted from every penny he got, and as Deputy Bell said, either from his unemployment assistance or his income.  He would have to pay something back.  Things have gone beyond a joke.</P>
    <P>I have made the argument and the Minister will either accept it or not.  I do not wish to be asked to let the matter stand until Report Stage, I want to have it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to respond to a comment by Deputy McCartan.  The Minister's Deputies are fully informed on the Bill.  Indeed, I am sure he is aware that the Minister will clarify any matter for a Deputy.  I would like to comment on the case instanced by Deputy Barrett where a woman had to replace a wall because hooligans had put a hose through her letter box.  As I have said, we have a Bill to amend the law dealing with offences against property.  For the first time we are putting in place legislation to address this issue and provide for compensation orders.  We should not lose sight of what is in the Bill before the House and the fact that we are putting in place a provision for compensation. While I understand Deputy Barrett's concern and reason for wishing to amend <Col N="356" /> section 9 &mdash; no one wants a hooligan, a little girl or anyone else coming before the courts to get off scot-free because there is not an identifiable owner or a cost available &mdash; I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments; I think they would be on similar lines.</P>
      <P>We now have in place a compensation order provision.  Section 3 clarifies the compensation order and indicates that the owner and the approximate cost or replacement should be ascertainable. One can understand the reasons for that.  We do not want the situation to occur in which one individual brought before the courts has a compensation order imposed because the owner can be ascertained or identified, yet another individual before another court gets off without a compensation order because the owner cannot be identified or ascertained.</P>
      <P>The poor box is of long standing and perhaps it is time it was improved and brought into modern-day thinking. However, I am sure that in section 3 we can come up with a suitable clarification that will exactly meet the concerns of Deputy Barrett.  Nobody wants individuals to be let off in circumstances such as those mentioned by Deputy Barrett. That is exactly what is provided for by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the terrific step forward being made by this Bill.  For the first time provision is being made for a compensation order.  As I said, we shall have to wait for the Minister's comments, but it is my understanding that the case referred to by Deputy Barrett would be adequately covered by section 3.  I also note from Deputy Barrett's comments that he wants to make sure that the situation to which I referred does not occur &mdash; that two individuals either in the same court or in two separate courts are treated differently in relation to compensation orders because, on the one hand, the owner of the property and the cost of the damage of replacement are readily ascertainable but on the other, neither the owner nor the cost of damage and/or replacement is ascertainable.  As I said earlier, I suggest that when the Minister <Col N="357" /> comes back on Report Stage he might indicate how the House could fully and adequately deal with that loophole or, for want of a better expression, not fall between two stools, where one individual pays compensation and another does not. Perhaps some kind of compensation order fund could be set up so that if an owner were not readily ascertainable a compensation order could still be made to ensure that a perpetrator paid for the damage he caused.  A compensation order would still be made against the individual causing damage and if an owner were not ascertainable, that compensation could be paid into a fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, the whole of section 9 worries me.  I agree with the Deputy &mdash; I think it was Deputy Barrett &mdash; who said that the provisions of section 9 are weighted too much against the person who actually suffers as a result of criminal damage.  Why could it not be possible, under regulations issued by the Minister under this legislation, to make an assessor available to the courts, the police, the chief superintendent of the area, or whoever?  When damage is caused through a car accident an insurance company will send out an assessor to assess the damage and very often a decision on compensation is made based on the assessor's report.  I am not suggesting that that particular system should be adopted, but I do suggest that a similar system could be brought into operation.  Under such a system a person who causes criminal damage would have to pay the cost of the assessor.  Not alone should he be made to pay for the damage, we should also make him pay the cost of the assessment of the damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should not matter a damn whether an owner is &ldquo;readily ascertainable&rdquo;&mdash; those words worry me greatly.  Whether an owner is readily ascertainable should not enter the issue at all.  It should not be too difficult to have the damage to property assessed by an assessor where the owner can be identified.  It would be very much in a minority of instances that the owner of property that had been set on fire &mdash; whether that property be a car <Col N="358" /> or a building &mdash; could not be ascertained. I am quite sure that the local police would find that out very quickly.</P>
    <P>The section also refers to a person's means.  Again I think we should not be talking about the means of the person who causes damage to property, a car or a person.  We should be concerned about the means of the person whose property is damaged.  For example, if a large store window is broken, it might be easy for a major multiple with a shop in a town such as Drogheda or Dundalk to replace that window the following day, at whatever cost was involved, but it would be a very different matter if that same window had to be replaced by a small shopkeeper who was just scraping a living and paying and collecting taxes for the State.  To make it even harder, that small shopkeeper might have to wait several months before the person concerned was brought before the courts.  At the end of the day, of course, the person causing the damage might be sent away and kept, again at the expense of the State and the taxpayer, at some prison or school.  The means of the person who causes criminal damage should not matter.  I think it was Deputy Briscoe who said it does not matter about the length of time it takes a person to pay, it is the amount he should have to pay over whatever period the court should decide &mdash; whether it be under an attachment order on any benefit that person was drawing, or on his wages that is important.  That is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>If such a deterrent existed and if parents had to pay the cost, irrespective of their means, they would be much more vigilant in relation to criminal damage, what their children are doing out on the streets and what time they are out on the streets.  The other night, just by chance, I was passing my own office when leaving a corporation meeting.  Two boys walked over to the bin outside the office and set it on fire.  If I had not been there and rushed inside to get a fire extinguisher to put out the fire, the whole building would have been burned.  Those boys ran up the street, regarding the whole episode as very funny.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the whole subsection is <Col N="359" /> weighted far too heavily in favour of the criminal rather than the victim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the arguments advanced here this morning, the more I think about this subsection the more I believe it will leave the door open to the vested interests of practitioners in the courts.  The provisions of this section could give rise to many lucrative arguments on the part of vested interests who may want to apply established practices.</P>
      <P>I might advance a number of examples of potential legal gymnastics in the courts under the provisions of this section.  Take the example of an individual whose car is vandalised outside his door, let us say the damage amounts to £1,000.  Suppose he is purchasing the car under a hire purchase agreement and has not made his payments for a number of months and the hire purchase company are chasing him for payments.  He enters a claim of £1,000 for the damages.  Suddenly the hire purchase company see it as an appropriate time to move to seize what they may not get otherwise.  They decide to go into court and contest the matter under the provisions of this section and say they are really the owners and any damages being awarded by the courts must come to them.  I anticipate that there would be a fair number of teams of legal representatives in court arguing that point. Another example would be that of a flat dweller whose flat is vandalised.  He is the tenant and may not have paid rent, perhaps, because he is unemployed. Under the provisions of this section the landlord can enter with his team of legal advisers.  There is a loophole for the landlord to go into court and claim the damages being awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there may be an individual who has taken out a mortgage with a local authority or financial institution.  I might add there are many people &mdash; I referred to the matter on the Order of Business this morning &mdash; on the point of being evicted or having their properties repossessed by financial institutions.  Suppose his house is vandalised, somebody sets fire to it, and there are damages being <Col N="360" /> awarded by the court.  The question must be asked who will enter there?  Of course it will be the financial institution with their team of legal advisers who will claim the damages awarded.  This means that the unfortunate victim, who has suffered trauma and loss, cannot protect himself; he cannot afford legal representation.</P>
    <P>I could give many more examples.  It is my belief that there is an attempt here to protect the vested interests that are stifling our courts.  We have witnessed too many examples of legal gymnastics being engaged in in our courts in recent years when, at the end of the day, the ultimate victim is also the original victim. The Minister should delete this subsection in the interests of justice for the victim.  Why place the onus on the victim, who has already suffered, to prove that he or she is the legitimate claimant?  Why should he or she have to do so?  They have suffered enough.</P>
    <P>The hair stood on my neck when I heard the term &ldquo;established practices&rdquo; being used.  It makes me very wary.  I would ask the Minister to delete this subsection in the interests of justice to the victim.  If we do not it will give the Hardimans, McDowells and McCartans of this world plenty of freedom to create another layer of legal bureaucracy in the courts.</P>

      <P>Let us not anticipate matters. I was about to say to Deputy Seán Barrett &mdash; through you, Sir &mdash; that if the Minister is unable to accept this amendment to delete this subsection &mdash; if put to a vote, particularly bearing in mind the position of The Workers' Party &mdash; there is no question of that vote being carried.  Where there is life there is hope. If the Minister tells the Opposition that he will come back to it on Report Stage, such proposal should be accepted.  In such circumstances we will speak to the Minister.  I contend it is a good amendment. I would plead with the Opposition not to push it to a vote because, in those circumstances, the subsection will be gone and there will be nothing we can do to reinstate it.  I have explained that I have to vote with the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as a free vote on legislation; the Deputy should know that.  I am sympathetic to the mover of this amendment.  If the <Col N="362" /> Minister were to say &mdash; allow me to bring this back on Report Stage &mdash; then I would plead with the parties opposite to allow him do so.  If, for whatever reason, the Minister cannot accept it at this stage, then I would say that he should not throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>
      <P>When replying perhaps the Minister could explain what appears to me, as a non-legal person, to be a contradiction in that section 9 (3) states:</P>
      <P>A compensation order shall not be made unless both the owner of the property concerned and the approximate cost of making good the damage to it (or, where appropriate, of replacing it) are readily ascertainable.</P>
      <P>It says &ldquo;both the owner of the property concerned&rdquo;&mdash; let us forget about the approximate cost of making good the damage &mdash;&ldquo;... are readily ascertainable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (2) (a) (i) states:</P>
      <P>(2) (a) Where a person is charged with an offence under section 2, 3 or 4 in relation to property belonging to another&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) it shall not be necessary to name the person to whom the property belongs, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It conflicts with the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 (3) says that a compensation order shall not be made unless &ldquo;both the owner of the property concerned ... are ascertainable&rdquo;, whereas section 7 (2) (a) says:</P>
      <P>(i)  it shall not be necessary to name the person to whom the property belongs, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that the property belongs to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seek clarification on that.  Where a loan <Col N="363" /> has to be taken out in order to pay for a replacement car or to make good damage caused, the interest on that loan should be taken into consideration by the court.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider the amendment favourably but I am happy to listen to his arguments.  If the Minister cannot now see his way to accept the amendment, let us live in hope.  It is a good amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy Allen's attitude.  I want to be as helpful as I can and I am being interrupted and berated.  Most of Deputy Allen's colleagues with whom I dealt on other Bills had no difficulty in finding a consensus.</P>
      <P>The victim of the damage does not have to be present in court.  He or she can tell the Garda in a statement the approximate cost of the damage.  The Garda will inform the court what the figure is and this will enable a clear decision to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been debated at length and a number of key points have been made.  We are providing for compensation within the provisions of legislation. If we drop subsection (3) are we saying that the court can make an order where the owner and the cost of the damage are not readily ascertainable? Has the court that right?  I do not think it is logical, legal or practical.  I have the utmost regard for Deputy Barrett's contribution as a spokesman on justice. He has given clear illustrations, as have Deputies on all sides, of the serious position of the victims of crime.  I totally <Col N="364" /> concur with what has been said in that regard.  I do not claim that I have the totality of wisdom or that my Department have all the answers.  We are in this business and we must try to achieve consensus on the best law in the interests of citizens. If the victim is unaware of the trial, the court is not prevented from making an order if it knows the owner and the approximate cost.  These facts might be quite obvious to the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be very obvious.  If a car is stolen it is easy to identify the owner from the registration information.  Alternatively, the facts may not be publicly obvious but they could be ascertained by the Garda who, acting on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, would make those facts available to the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be possible too.  People have alluded to the complexities of holding and owning property. I accept that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would convince us why this subsection is necessary.  He is not doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best. Nothing in subsection (3) would prevent the court from making a compensation order against each of the defendants in the case mentioned by Deputy Barrett. The owner would be known and the Garda would know the approximate cost. I am referring to the case which was raised of a widow who is in hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice of requiring payments to be made into the court poor box is of long standing and an old tradition.  I am not sufficiently familiar with it to comment usefully on it.  Suffice it to say I am not sure that it is a proper solution.  Flexibility must be left to the court.  Young fellows coming before the court may be put in a position of having to make a contribution <Col N="365" /> and it may prevent them from commiting further crimes.  The power to order compensation given by this section may help to reduce the number of cases where this old practice is invoked.  I suggest that this subsection may help to get rid of it.</P>
    <P>In the case mentioned by Deputy Briscoe, the owner would be easily identifiable but the amount of damage would not be ascertainable unless the owners turned up and provided that information. If it were clear that the means of the offender were such that he could not pay even by instalments what appeared to be the cost of the damage, perhaps an order could be made, even if there was no information about the cost of the damage.  Perhaps that is something to be considered for Report Stage.  I should like to have a meeting of minds rather than destroy an opportunity to strengthen provisions.  The argument has been made that where the owner and the cost are not known, if the court thinks the defendant could pay compensation it could postpone sentence until the owner and the approximate cost of the damage are known.  This could cause a difficulty if a sentence of imprisonment were appropriate and an immediate decision were taken.  Further reflection could reveal that such a provision would be objectionable on various other grounds. It is a very complex area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing that it should be there.  Deputy Allen made the point that it might be difficult to know who is the owner.  Perhaps it could be a tenant, a financial institution or otherwise. I agree that this could be a problem. I undertook on amendment No. 8 to look at this matter before Report Stage and that undertaking stands.  With regard to amendment No. 9, there is no use in saying that I will consider it again on Report Stage if I am not prepared to do so.  On the other hand, if a division is challenged it will kill the amendment and it will be of no benefit to the victims of <Col N="366" /> crime.  I want to help and to ensure that this Bill is as strong and as legally binding as possible on the defendants, the perpetrators of crime and mindless vandalism. I want effective legislation which will take account of the consensus which exists in the House that the Bill should be strengthened.  I am asking the House to allow me to do that on Report Stage and not to push this amendment to a vote. At the end of the day I hope Deputies will not be disappointed.</P>

It is in the interests of the victims of crime that it should be deleted, yet the Minister claims that I am acting against the interests of those victims.  This is a whitewash job.  The Minister can try that on his leader, or his leader can try it, but it will not succeed with me.  The Minister has had five months to consider this matter.  The Official Report shows that we debated this legislation on 1 May and 19 June and that Second Stage was taken on 29 November last year.  The Minister has had five months to consider his concern about the victims of crime.  This amendment was tabled months ago.  With respect to the Minister, the most sensible part of his contribution argued in favour of dropping the subsection because its inclusion imposes possible dangers.  If it is not included none of the Minister's fears in relation to victims of crime can possibly arise.  It will be up to the court to decide on such matters.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (1) the court is being given the power to make a compensation order and under subsection (2) the court will have power to decide on the amount of the compensation order relative to the court in which the case is heard.  I am in favour of deleting subsection (3).  Later I will be putting forward arguments in favour of leaving out much more of this rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important provision is subsection (1) which gives the court power to make a compensation order.  Why, in later subsections, should we impose all these possible restrictions on the court? Why has it taken the Minister 12 months <Col N="367" /> to make up his mind on this matter?  He has had five months to decide whether my arguments are right or wrong.  It is not as if he was presented with my amendment this morning.  I am sorry to have to say that the Minister's suggestion that we leave this issue until Report Stage is a cop out, a way of getting off the hook. If we leave this matter to Report Stage we will never hear any more about it.  On Report Stage, as an Opposition spokes-person, I will be cornered because I can only speak to the amendments put down. This puts me at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and his Department, should realise that if I table amendments I am serious about them.  I am not in the business of tabling amendments for the fun of it.  If the Minister wants to argue against my amendments, it is his job to convince me that what he is saying is correct.  However, equally I have the right to argue in favour of my amendment. It is wrong to say that I would be doing a disservice to the victims of crime if I persist with my amendment.  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had five months to consider my amendment and I reject his argument as being neither fair nor reasonable. The one sensible point the Minister made clearly indicated that subsection (3) should not be included.  There is no justification for its inclusion.  It will impose difficulties in the future, will restrict the court and could lead to the type of disputes outlined by Deputy Allen.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the victim would not have to be in court and that a sergeant or inspector could, having consulted with the victim, give evidence as to the cost of the car in court.  I have yet to hear of a sergeant or superintendent calling to a person's house and telling that person that a court case is proceeding. How will the garda know whether a judge will make a compensation order, impose a fine or prison sentence? This is another cop-out and there is no need for it.  A judge should be able to ask how much a car was worth or what damage was caused to a wall.  If the <Col N="368" /> person does not have that information the court should be able to tell him to come back with it because a prison sentence would not be imposed as it was too good for the criminal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The judge should be able to say, &ldquo;I am going to punish you where it hurts, in your pocket; I am going to see to it that you compensate the victim who has suffered all this hassle and annoyance by making you pay out of your pocket; I am not going to send you to Mountjoy for two or three weeks at a cost of £900 per week to the taxpayers; I am going to make you pay for what you did&rdquo;.  The judge should be able to say: &ldquo;in addition, I am going to impose a community service order so that you pay back to society what you have taken out of it.&rdquo;  That might put a stop to the sort of nonsense which is going on at present.</P>
      <P>The arguments put forward by the Minister are spurious.  We should let the courts decide such matters.  We should not give them the power to make a compensation order under one subsection and in the next breath tie their hands by saying they cannot make a compensation order unless they know the owner of the property and the cost of replacing the damaged goods.  That does not make any sense.  I do not know what the Minister has to think about; he either accepts that argument or he does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that Deputy Briscoe has to wrestle with his conscience and that he did not, with his excellent contribution, get the Minister, who is a member of his party, to see sense.  It is sad to think that the Department of Justice are being led by a person who cannot make up his mind about whether an argument is right or wrong so that he can get on with the job. He should not have to check whether it is right or wrong.  It is also a sad day for the Fianna Fáil Party when the Minister will not listen to a worthwhile contribution from one of the Government backbenchers.  Neither will he listen to what Deputies Callely, Bell, McCartan, <Col N="369" /> Allen, Flanagan and I are saying.  We cannot all be wrong.</P>
    <P>I not am sure where Deputy McCartan stands on this amendment &mdash; I am not being smart when I say that &mdash; but I hope I have managed to persuade him that on balance, legislation will be better without this subsection.  If we delete it the legislation will not be weakened in any way, rather it will be strengthened.  The Minister does not need another five months to make up his mind on this issue.  He has had ample time to do so and heard all the arguments.  Now is the time for decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett made a statement, not in his last contribution, but in one of his earlier contributions: <Col N="371" /> what is right is right what is wrong is wrong, and let us make a decision on what is right.  What is right, so far as this legislation is concerned, is a consensus in this House on what is best.  What the Deputy may think is right is not necessarily what I think is right.  What the Deputy may think is legal, may not be what I think is legal, and what either of us may think is legal may not necessarily be what the courts may think is legal. Based on that and the complexities evolving therefrom, we must take into account the real legal parameters.  I have a duty, even though Deputy Barrett seems to think my role is one of subservience to officials in my Department.  I am subservient to nobody but I am guided by experts, by people who have knowledge, information and a track record and by Members of this House who, representing the problems of the people, are prepared to articulate those problems to see that we put forward the best law.</P>
      <P>It is very unfair of Deputy Barrett to suggest that I had five months to think about this amendment and that I cannot come in and make a decision.  We debated this amendment five months ago and I gave a clear commitment that I would come back on Report Stage. Deputy Barrett, at the end of a long evening, stood up and said he would expand his argument the next day.  I am still prepared to stand over the traditional method of dealing with the situation where we either vote and get a decision or come back on Report Stage.  When I give a commitment &mdash; and my record will show this &mdash; to come back on Report Stage with amendments, I have done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (4), line 22, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a long discussion this morning about tying the hands of the court in cases where the court wishes to consider imposing a compensation order.  This is another example of the legislation tying the hands of the court unnecessarily.  It will not weaken the legislation if we substitute the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) reads: &ldquo;in determining whether to make a compensation order against a person and in determining the amount to be paid by a person under such an order, the court shall have regard &mdash; (a) to his means, or (b) in a case to which the Children Act, 1908, applies, the court shall have regard to the means of the parent or guardian of a child involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why we have to be so restrictive.  Why should the court take into account the means of the individual at the time the person is appearing before the court?  It could be that in the future that person's income could increase.  It could be reduced.  There is every possibility that it could increase.  However, that is not the point.  The point is that the court is considering the case before it and in deciding, if a person is guilty, what type of punishment it will impose upon <Col N="377" /> the person convicted before the court.  It has to decide whether to put the person in prison, impose a fine or place a compensation order.  A compensation order should include the possibility of attachment of earnings or income.  We are trying to get across that society wants these problems dealt with and putting a person into prison is very often the worst way of imposing a penalty on the perpetrator of the offence.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers agreed with my point of view that very often putting people who should not be there into prison is costing the State money and contributing nothing to the victim of the crime or to society itself.  In the case of malicious damage the person involved is very often punished far better by making that person contribute something back to society and to the victim of the crime.  I do not see why it should be provided that the court &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be obliged to take the income into account.  It should be provided that the court &ldquo;may&rdquo; take the income into account.  Any reasonable judge faced with this situation will of course ask what the income of the person is and their possible future earnings, and take all those things into account.</P>
    <P>We have just voted on subsection (5) and I accept the majority view in the House.  Unfortunately, it went against my view, but that is democracy.  Subsection (3) is already saying that all we can really do is impose a compensation order to put the victim back in the position he was in before the crime took place.  It is no compensation as such but replacement of what has been lost.  I suppose income may come into it but I do not think it should be the only criterion that the court should take into account.  The fact that I have caused £90,000 or £100,000 worth of damage due to wanton vandalism and that I happen to be on unemployment assistance or earning about £200 a week must be taken together.  To ask a person in that position to pay back the £90,000 within 12 to 18 months would be unreasonable because it would not be paid.  The person could not afford to pay it.  However, it would be a real punishment if, for the rest of that person's <Col N="378" /> working life, he had to pay back £10 or £15 a week.  It would hurt him and he may not have the money to go to a disco or to go into the pub and drink.  It would be a real punishment.  That is what it should be.  If we want to cut out malicious damage and stop people destroying other people's property there should be a hardship on the persons responsible for causing that damage in the first place.  Perhaps that person would be far better off contributing something back to society, in addition to a compensation order, by doing some community service rather than being sent to prison for two or three weeks which would do nothing for the person who has committed the crime, nothing for the taxpayer or for anybody else.</P>
    <P>The argument is quite simple.  Why impose such heavy restrictions on the court?  Why say that the court shall have regard to the income when we can easily achieve the same thing by saying that the court may have regard to the income of the individual?  That leaves greater scope for the court to make up its mind what steps it should take in the circumstances of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too excited about whether we have &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  What we are discussing here is the administration of justice rather than law. I am sick to death of the law.  What I am interested in is justice.  There is no question but that the court has to take into account the ability of a person to pay.  Deputy Barrett uses the word &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;deterrent&rdquo; which I use.  Of necessity compensation has to be relative to a person's means.  I fully support the idea that a person has to pay over a period.  I do not care how long it takes, if it is for the rest of their lives or until they reach retirement age. The victim must be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to illustrate my point.  I have a very good friend who is a Federal Court judge in Chicago.  He had an old lady before him charged that she had contracted for work to be done to her home at a cost of $50,000.  When he asked her could she afford to pay for this she <Col N="379" /> said that she could not.  He asked if she had contracted for the work to be done and she said yes.  The judge asked, if she knew she could not pay for it why she contracted for the work to be done?  She pointed to the contractor, a youngish man, and said that he persuaded her that she could get the work done, that she needed to get it done and that she could pay for it.  The judge asked her what was her income and she said it was $200 or $300 a week.  He asked her if she would be in a position to pay the contractor at the rate of $5 a week and she said yes. The judge then said that he was making an order that this man should be paid at the rate of $5 a week.  Then he turned to the contractor and said to him that if his mother came into this court before him she would get the same justice.  To me, that is what justice is about; it is not a matter of law.</P>
    <P>Over here we might have a judge saying that he was very sympathetic to the lady but that the law says such and such.  What I would like to see is justices being allowed to administer justice.  If a person is unemployed he should have to pay something and the parents of underage people have to be held responsible for the actions of their children. However, that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>I believe fervently that everybody should be held responsible for the actions either of themselves or their children.  It would be the greatest blow we could deal to vandalism in our city if we could get judges to fine people and make them pay compensation.  That is the only thing that can be done because nothing else seems to work.  Young people do not seem to mind being taken off and put in different institutions.  That does not seem to worry them at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.  In view of the widespread media comment about the matters raised in these questions, I propose to deal with the background of events against which they are framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The putting down of these questions <Col N="382" /> by Deputy Spring is clearly part of a larger process.  There is strong evidence to suggest that the former managing director of Greencore, Mr. Comerford, and a number of other executives, betrayed the trust placed in them by the board and shareholders of Irish Sugar and used their special inside positions to make large personal gains at the expense of the company.  These matters are the subject of some of the most exhaustive investigations at present that have been carried out in the State, including an investigation by inspectors appointed by the High Court.</P>
    <P>Mr. Comerford is now, it would seem, going to considerable lengths to create a major diversion which will draw attention away from this central issue.  He is ensuring that confidential information and documents which were entrusted to him as managing director are being made available to the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> for publication.  Deputy Spring subsequently puts down follow-up Dáil questions. These Dáil questions are nothing more than an attempt to use this leaked information as a basis for false allegations and give them the additional status of an airing in the Dáil.  I now propose to demonstrate to the House the spurious nature of these allegations disguised as Dáil questions by analysing the latest example which has been used by Deputy Spring.</P>
    <P>A former worker director of the Irish Sugar Company, Mr. Noel O'Brien, as part of this process, spoke at the EGM of Greencore on 30 October and subsequently on radio about a very odd sort of telephone conversation which is supposed to have taken place between Mr. Cahill, chairman of Greencore, and Mr. Comerford following a meeting with me in May.  Mr. Cahill is supposed to have stated, in the course of this telephone call, that as the Government had recently appointed NCB as advisers in the privatisation of Irish Life, they were inhibited from doing so in the case of Irish Sugar.</P>
    <P>I have no responsibility for any telephone conversations which are supposed <Col N="383" /> to have taken place between the chairman and chief executive of Irish Sugar, but I believe there are aspects of Mr. O'Brien's statement that Deputy Spring might have raised about this peculiar type of telephone call before taking the step of putting down a Dáil question and thereby, in effect, turning it into a serious allegation.</P>
    <P>First of all, we must ask how did Mr. O'Brien know about this supposed telephone conversation.  He had ceased to be a worker director in 1988 following his rejection by his fellow workers because he was rightly or wrongly regarded as being in Mr. Comerford's pocket.  He must have been instructed by Mr. Comerford to make these statements.  There is no other explanation.  Secondly, there is a crucial flaw in Mr. O'Brien's version.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>He was in the wrong pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He quotes Mr. Cahill as stating that the Government had recently appointed NCB to the Irish Life privatisation, but it can be shown that Mr. Cahill could not have said anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The firm appointed in the Irish Life privatisation was Goldman Sachs/NCB, but they were not in fact appointed as advisers to the Minister for Finance for the privatisation of Irish Life until 23 July 1990, two months after the alleged telephone call was supposed to have taken place.  The facts of the appointment are as follows.  The Department of Finance circularised 51 firms about the appointment: 18 firms replied and 12 were short-listed.  When the 12 firms on the short-list had been interviewed by the Department of Finance, a submission was made by the Department of Finance to the Minister for Finance in June 1990 and the appointment was made by the Minister on 23 July 1990.  So much for the implied suggestion that the Government had appointed NCB on some basis of favouritism.  The simple truth, therefore, is that a conversation to the effect <Col N="384" /> reported by Mr. O'Brien could not have taken place.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken here about this strange new concept that the Taoiseach must not apparently meet business people, the heads of State companies or persons of that kind.  This is, of course, palpable nonsense, but it is inherent in the sort of questions being addressed to me by Deputy Spring and others.  It is also being used to question the propriety of my functions in relation to the privatisation of Irish Sugar and my involvement in discussions about it.</P>
    <P>On this I would like to quote from a clear statement on the functions of the Taoiseach by one of the most respected authorities in this area, Maurice Moynihan, former secretary to the Government. In an article in <i>Administration</i>, volume 7 (1959-60) page 293 subsequently reproduced in Basil Chubb's <i>A Source Book of Irish Government</i>, page 64, Dr. Moynihan states:</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is well to recall once more the special position of the Taoiseach as the Head of the Government &mdash; the captain of the team.  In this capacity, he is the central co-ordinating figure, who takes an interest in the work of all Departments, the figure to whom Ministers naturally turn for advice and guidance when faced with problems involving large questions of policy or otherwise of special difficulty and whose leadership is essential to the successful working of the Government as a collective authority, collectively responsible to Dáil Éireann, but acting through members each of whom is charged with specific departmental tasks.  He may often have to inform himself in considerable detail of particular matters with which other members of the Government are primarily concerned.  He may have to make public statements on such matters, as well as on general matters of broad policy, internal and external.</P>
    <P>A similar statement on the Taoiseach's co-ordinating role, and his need to concern himself with the work of all Departments of State in particular on all major <Col N="385" /> matters was made in the Report of the Devlin Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely clear from these statements on the role of a Taoiseach that the meetings I held with the chairman of Irish Sugar or Greencore were fully in accordance with the proper discharge of my functions and responsibilities as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of public record that I regard the commercial, semi-State companies as an important economic resource capable of contributing substantially to economic development and providing the jobs we need.  I have met their chairmen and chief executives many times collectively and individually for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The former Irish Sugar Company was one of the more important of the commercial semi-State companies.  I regard its privatisation as a matter of major national importance.  In practical terms it required the full co-operation of three Departments for its successful conclusion &mdash; Finance, Agriculture and Food and Labour.  It was essential that I give it my full support as Head of Government and ensure the Government's approach to this major, and from our point of view, unprecedented undertaking was coherent and co-ordinated.  My sole concern was that the transfer of this valuable company to the private sector should, in the best interests of the workers, the beet growers and the Exchequer, be carried through smoothly and successfully.  The meetings I held and my involvement was for this purpose and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm again to the House the circumstances in which my meeting with Mr. Cahill in May 1990 arose.  It has now been confirmed that my account is correct and that, following a decision by the company as part of their privatisation strategy, I was briefed by the chairman and Fine Gael were briefed by Mr. Comerford.  Deputy Sherlock of The Workers' Party was, I understand, also briefed by Mr. Comerford.  The Labour Party have been very coy about whether they were briefed.</P>
    <P>It is now definitely established, that, despite the attempts by Deputy Spring <Col N="386" /> and the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> to cast some aura of suspicion around it, the meeting in my home in May 1990 was held at the request of the chairman of Irish Sugar; that it was not secret or personal but was an official approach by the chairman of an important semi-State company carrying out company policy in a way that was open and above board.  I repeat again that at that meeting I was not concerned about advisers or their appointment, nor did I make any suggestions to Mr. Cahill about them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am informed that the chairman of Greencore indicated in his remarks at the Greencore EGM that the list referred to at his meeting with me, was a definitive list decided by management with the name of NCB included in it and that I did not suggest any changes in it.</P>
    <P>For my part I reiterate categorically that I did not make any suggestions to Mr. Cahill at any stage about the appointment of advisers or consultants and that that has now been firmly established.</P>
    <P>To attempt to suggest that in the light of all the fundamental and important strategic issues that had to be faced and the major decisions that had to be taken I was concerned about the appointment of advisers or their fees is patently absurd.  I had meetings with Mr. Cahill on 21 September 1989, 30 April, 26 May and 16 October 1990 and 24 January and 7 March 1991.  They were short and informal as the chairman briefed me on the ongoing process of privatisation.</P>
    <P>A serious attempt has been made by Deputy Spring and others to distract public attention from what is really the central issue in the Greencore affair. What the Dáil should be concerned about is the question of leading executives of a State company engaging in transactions for their own benefit.  It is significant and should be noted by all that Deputy Spring in his Dáil contributions has shown no concern for that real issue but has chosen instead to try to divert attention to the appointment of advisers by the company which, when one thinks about it, is of a minor nature compared to the real scandal that is now being investigated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> In response to assertions that Deputy Spring was acting in alliance with Mr. Comerford, Deputy Spring issued a statement, in which he denied that he had ever discussed the affairs of Irish Sugar with Mr. Comerford or anyone acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask Deputy Spring if he still wishes to adhere to that statement.  I am asking this because my information is that Deputy Spring, when he was Tánaiste and a Government Minister, was approached in 1984 on behalf of Mr. Chris Comerford, who at that time was seeking appointment as chief executive designate of Irish Sugar.  Deputy Spring as Tánaiste subsequently sought to influence the late Mr. Ruadhrí Roberts, a former general secretary of the ICTU and at that time a director of Irish Sugar, to support the appointment of Mr. Comerford as chief executive designate.  Deputy Spring on 23 August 1984 telephoned, while the board meeting at which Mr. Comerford was to be appointed was in progress, and had Mr. Roberts called out from the meeting.  As anyone who knew Ruadhrí Roberts would expect, he was firmly rebuffed.</P>
    <P>I believe that Opposition Deputies who have participated in the recent campaign have behaved irresponsibly; that they have not been concerned with the best interests of our parliamentary democracy.  They have tried to destabilise the Government by a vicious campaign of false allegations and personalised attacks.</P>
    <P>I want to submit that there has been a serious and culpable departure on their part from their responsibilities as Members of Dáil Éireann and as political leaders.  It is legitimate at any time for the Opposition to seek to damage and even bring down a democratically elected Government by political means on issues of policy, administration or competence.  It is not legitimate to seek to subvert a Government by an orchestrated campaign of vilification, innuendo and fabrication as has been happening.</P>
    <P>The primary business of this House is to discuss and legislate for policies to <Col N="388" /> improve the welfare of our people. Instead of that, we have had the spectacle for weeks now of Deputy Spring and Deputy Bruton engaged in a full time campaign of personal vilification, principally of me but also of members of the Government and of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The only basis for this vilification has been that certain persons in the private and semi-State sectors are very properly being investigated under the High Court for what are very serious alleged offences.</P>
    <P>When these events first came to light, all the anger and comment of the Opposition were directed at those directly responsible.  But suddenly and unscrupulously, these attacks were switched to me, members of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>In any other society or parliament, the legal investigations would be allowed to run their course and the findings debated in due course in parliament.  But Deputy Spring and Deputy Bruton decided not to follow this fair, honourable and responsible course.  They cannot wait for the legal findings from the various investigations. They prefer to attack me now because they know that in due course it will be found that neither I nor any of my colleagues was involved in any way in the matters being investigated.</P>
    <P>I find all this deeply distressing personally but even more so in the context of the damage they are doing to the country. Do they not realise how foreigners who are our competitors delight in their behaviour?  Have they no sense of dignity or indeed patriotism not to demean further our country's name already affected as it is by the events which are under investigation?</P>
    <P>Let me also tell Deputy Spring and Deputy Bruton that I believe the general public, seeing clearly what has been attempted, are rejecting it and demanding that the campaign of vilification ceases and that the Government be allowed get on with the country's business. Enough harm has been done to our country.  It is now time to return to the normal standards of decent behaviour <Col N="389" /> and the traditional procedures of this House.</P>

Were Goodbodys on the list and were they discussed by the <Col N="390" /> Taoiseach?  Who were the other companies on the list?  Was the list submitted to the Taoiseach as a definitive list in an official or semi-official capacity?  Does the Taoiseach realise that by denying the issue of advisers was discussed &mdash; he said today he was not concerned with the issue of advisers &mdash; and by denying that privatisation was discussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I implied nothing of the kind.  What the chairman of Greencore said at the EGM is entirely in line with what I am saying.  The chairman of Greencore, I understand &mdash; I was not there but I understand from reliable reports &mdash; stated at the EGM that the list referred to in his meeting with me was a definitive list prepared by management and that the name of NCB was on that list.  Therefore it is quite clear that when he came to me a decision had already been taken as to who should be appointed advisers to the privatisation of Irish Sugar into Greencore.  That is incontrovertible. I state here categorically again, I reiterate, that I did not make any suggestions to the chairman about advisers, and he has corroborated that fact.  That is the key central issue.</P>

      <P>My primary consideration, as I have already stated, at the meeting on 26 May was with two issues.  One was the question of a favourable allocation of shares to the workers and to the beet growers in the privatisation process because I knew that the privatisation process would not proceed smoothly unless something satisfactory was provided in that regard.  My second concern was, as I have already stated, with an undertaking given some time before by the Irish Sugar Company when they left Tuam, that they would put up £2 million by way of investment for an industry in Tuam.  These are my two primary considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa asked me about the meetings and I can give him information on the various matters that came up from time to time as the privatisation process unfolded.  Another matter which was discussed and discussed particularly at a meeting at which the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Labour were present <Col N="394" /> with Mr. Cahill and myself, was the question of trade union representation on the board of Greencore.  Other matters which were discussed from time to time were the question of a 45 per cent retention by the Minister for Finance, the question of the golden share, the Price Waterhouse report which had been presented, a statement by the Government on the broad framework of legislation and the special position of beet suppliers.  That was discussed on 16 October 1990.  On 24 January 1991 we discussed the Committee Stage of the Bill and also the deep concern of the company about the delay in the legislation.  Finally on 7 March 1991 we discussed the question of the status and rights of workers and trade union representatives and a request that the President provide an early signature of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make to Deputy De Rossa and the House is that these meetings which I held with the chairman were entirely devoted to the important issues of privatisation and the problems and difficulties as they arose as that privatisation proceeded.  At no time, again I repeat, did I ever make any representations, suggestions or anything of that kind to Mr. Cahill about advisers because it was not of the slightest importance to me.</P>

      <P>I again return to the specific information that I sought from the Taoiseach and which the Taoiseach has not yet provided.  I asked about the locations of the meetings with Mr. Cahill.  I asked for a list of the persons who attended the meetings he attended with Mr. Cahill, and whether there is any record of those meetings.  Is there a minute of the meeting held in May?  Is there a minute of any of the meetings held since?  Could the Taoiseach indicate whether any of the meetings were held, for instance, on Inismhicealáin or in any other private residence?  Could he indicate the decisions that arose from those meetings?  I think they are legitimate questions.  It is significant that the Taoiseach now admits that he did, in fact, discuss the question of advisers with Mr. Cahill, although on 16 October he denied that any such discussion took place.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is doubtless referring to Ireland's Operational Programme 1991-1993 under STRIDE (Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe) which I launched on 15 October last.  The Operational Programme totalling IR£13.5 million has been approved by the EC Commission, and comprises four subprogrammes of which the Marine subprogramme is the largest (the remaining three being Environment, Forestry and Food).  The investment under the programme will take the form of a contribution from the ERDF of IR£10 million over the period, with the remaining 25 per cent of the cost to be met from national resources.</P>
      <P>The programme is in essence a funding package for the development of natural resources in Ireland.  The money will be spent on a large-scale upgrading programme for a wide range of scientific and technological facilities in the four natural resources sectors identified.  These four sectors were chosen because of their development potential and the acknowledged need to apply resources to secure and develop that potential.  The agreement of the EC to co-finance the investment in science and technology in these areas is a recognition of their development potential and endorses the approach adopted in putting together the STRIDE Programme for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased by the recognition given under STRIDE to the marine area.  The marine sub-pro-gramme, with a planned total investment of £8 million, addresses the need to build up national capability and expertise in marine science and technology which will underpin further sustained development in the sector including the key areas of seafishing and aquaculture.</P>

      <Col N="415" /> The measures in the marine sub-pro-gramme fall under five main headings: (1) investment in the Fisheries Research Centre at the Department of the Marine to provide essential equipment to support the fishing and aquaculture industries; (2) investment in the Martin Ryan Marine Science Institute at UCG to fit out laboratories and facilities in the new institute with a full range of oceanographic equipment; (3) investment in the Coastal Engineering and Resource Management Centre at UCC to equip the hydraulics laboratory and coastal management unit to European standards; (4) the establishment and equipping of a marine data centre under the aegis of the Department of the Marine as a national centre for marine data management and (5) investment in the marine research vessel, <i>Lough Beltra,</i> to provide specialised equipment for the national marine research vessel.</P>
    <P>I am certain that this structural investment in key centres and facets of marine expertise will strongly support research and development in fish and fish farming, and contribute to the development of this important sector.  I would stress that the funding now being made available through the STRIDE Programme will complement existing expenditure which my Department already commit to fish stock assessment and research, fish pathology, aquaculture research and development and water chemistry.  Under my Departmental Vote for 1991 the Fisheries Research Centre has an allocation of £1 million from which a wide range of activities under these headings are funded. While available resources, both staff and facilities have been deployed to maximum benefit up to now the infusion of additional funding through STRIDE will greatly contribute to the objective of enhancing and underpinning activities in the marine sector through the provision of even better research facilities and more comprehensive R &amp; D.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Would he not agree that this new funding is coming on-stream <Col N="416" /> a little late, given that the Common Fisheries Policy is now being renegotiated and that much of the scientific information required is being supplied to us by member states who are competitors in relation to the allocation of quotas?  Does the Minister not think that the allocation is minimal, given the depleted condition of our marine science, particularly with regard to the <i>Lough Beltra?</i> The STRIDE programme clearly states that Ireland has only one research vessel, which is the smallest in the European fleet, and we are placed by STRIDE at the bottom of the European league.  In view of the castigating statement in the STRIDE programme, would the Minister not agree that there is need for major investment over and above the £8 million proposed by STRIDE?</P>

      <P>I would not accept that we are depending on our competitors for scientific information with regard to marine matters.  We are members of ISIS, the international scientific organisation, and we have played a very important role there for 40 or 50 years.  An Irishman is the deputy president of that organisation. To give the House an idea of how important our own research has been, I would point out that I was able to get 6,000 extra tonnes of herring in the Celtic Sea this year because of the research done by my Department.  I was very pleased about that.  Over 90 per cent of the Celtic Sea is our fishery anyway.  Most scientists are not biased in the way suggested and no other country would have a vested interest in giving us false information about the Celtic Sea.  We did the work ourselves and it means between £900,000 and £1 million worth of fish for our fishermen.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the Government reduced its support for the Irish cargo shipping sector in the form of the reduction in capital grant aid this year and the removal of eligibility in the business expansion scheme; and the steps the Government propose to take to increase Irish shipping capacity.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, last year the Government commissioned a major study into Ireland's access transport needs.  The study which was jointly funded by the Government and the EC Commission examined current and projected capacity requirements for sea and air transport.  Its findings and recommendations have formed the basis of a detailed submission to the Commission which was presented by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, on 27 May this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be pleased to know that the current Irish fleet totals almost 195,000 deadweight tons which represents an increase in capacity of 37 per cent since 1986.  The increase in fleet size has been aided by various Government incentives for expansion in the form of grant aid, BES investment and tax reductions.  The fivefold reduction in the level of corporation tax, <i>viz.</i> from 50 per cent to 10 per cent, payable by shipping companies is a most important and significant initiative which has underpinned the recent increase in the Irish registered fleet.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to the various curtailments of the business expansion scheme arising from this year's budget this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the average age of the cargo fleet is 14 years and is increasing rapidly?  Is he further aware that Government grant aid has been cut from £7.5 million in 1987 to less than £500,000 this year?  Will he agree it is somewhat hypocritical of the Government to look for grant-aid for shipping from the EC when they are cutting back on grants in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again call the Deputy's attention to the 37 per cent <Col N="418" /> increase in tonnage in the Irish fleet since the end of 1986.  That is not a tale of woe in any man's language.  We have put a proposition to the EC for the expenditure of over £100 million in this area with private sector investment and European Community financing.  I would like the full support of Opposition spokespersons for my efforts to get that money for mobile assets which is not all that easy to get.  I can rely on Opposition spokespersons to support me in that request.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that we are an island nation depending on sea shipping for 99 per cent of our exports will the Minister not agree that the Government should give a commitment that if there is such EC funding it will be extended beyond ferry-type ships and that there will be a matching commitment from the Irish Exchequer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>That is exactly what the Government have been doing.  The Deputy knows that shipping companies on the east coast have been helped in the ways mentioned &mdash; this help is multifaceted &mdash; and that ships on the south coast have been subsidised by the Government.  Our plan involves major shipping investment in the centre of the Irish Sea and from the south coast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 12 and 13 and Questions Nos. 20, 38, 40 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replying to these questions I would categorise the recommendations and views expressed in the Ballycotton report under four headings: first, the overall level of service which should be provided by the fisheries boards; second, the equipping, training, operational criteria, and so on required to ensure the safe <Col N="420" /> operation of sea patrols; third, improvements in marine rescue co-ordination and so on required to improve communications and, fourth, changes in legislation</P>
    <P>As regards the overall level of service to be provided by the fisheries boards, I must at the outset emphasise that I have made it clear to the boards that safety must come first and that if a service, be it protection at sea or otherwise, cannot be provided with proper regard to safety then it should not be provided at all.</P>
    <P>I have noted the various views expressed in the Ballycotton report about the need to increase the level of the fishery service so as to provide better protection of salmon stocks in a more adequate fashion.  I have much sympathy with these views but the funding of the fisheries boards cannot be looked at in isolation from the budgetary position generally and the reductions and tight controls which all agencies largely funded from the Exchequer have had to live with in recent years.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the cost to the Exchequer of running the inland fisheries function is high.  The outturn for the current year will be in excess of £7,647,000. This does not take account of the costs incurred by the Naval Service in providing salmon patrols.  In looking at these total costs to the Exchequer, it is worthy of note that the total contribution made by way of salmon licences will be only of the order of 5 per cent of the total allocation.  Nevertheless, I shall continue to press the case for additional funding and staffing of the boards so as, in particular, to enable the posts of deputy managers to be filled, a protection coordinator to be appointed, additional boats to be purchased and adequate safety equipment, training and so on to be provided.</P>
    <P>As regards the equipping, training, operational criteria and so on required to ensure the safe operation of sea patrols, I want to emphasise that I am very glad to inform the House that the main recommendations of the report have been implemented.  Sea patrols are being operated in line with the operational criteria <Col N="421" /> recommended by the Tribunal and additional personal safety equipment and radio and electronic equipment has been procured which, with the provision of training on the lines recommended by the Tribunal, has cost a total of £450,000 to date.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the report on the training of fishery officers to be assigned to sea protection duties will be adhered to in all recruitment.  I have asked the Central Fisheries Board for their views on whether there needs to be any change in the basic qualification required to become a fishery officer.</P>
    <P>As regards marine rescue co-ordination, the director of my Department's new emergency service, SLANU, is following up as a matter of high priority, the specific recommendations made in the report regarding this co-ordination and the equipment of coastal radio stations.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards the various changes in legislation suggested in the report, I have already, in reply to an earlier question, dealt with the specific suggestion that section 8 (1) (e) (i) of the Fisheries Act, 1980, should be amended and expressed reservations about the change proposed.</P>
    <P>The question of providing the same legal protection for fisheries officers as extends to members of the Garda Síochána is being examined.  This would entail significant changes in the law and the issues involved must be carefully assessed. I have asked that this assessment be completed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to once more put on the record of the House my appreciation of the work of the Tribunal.  I should also like for the second time to put on the record &mdash; and I am sure all Deputies will join me in this &mdash; my own strong personal view that the four officers who met their death in the tragic accident at Ballycotton, Mr. Benno Haussman, Mr. Dominic Meehan, Mr. Barry O'Driscoll and Mr. Barra Ó Longaigh, were extremely courageous and conscientious officers and that they gave their lives in the service of the State and the public good.</P>

Will the Minister agree that fisheries boards are in desperate financial straits at present?  Will he further agree that the reduction in the workforce from approximately 400 in 1980 to 300 today with extra duties means that fisheries boards cannot keep within their budgets, taking into account the fact that they have not been reimbursed for the funding they gave on the recommendations of the Ballycotton Tribunal?</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows very well that if unlimited funds were available for this development I would make them available because I am convinced of the value of the service.  I do not think I am being unfair or tendentious when I say that the provision out of taxpayers' money of £7.647 million for this service is very substantial.  I agree totally with the Deputy that more people were employed in this service ten years ago than there are today.  At present I am addressing the provision of training and expertise for the people who remain and requesting extra personnel for the various posts I mentioned in my reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Deputies had not concluded on this amendment.  Amendment No. 10 would give the Criminal Court a discretion as to whether it would have regard to the convicted person's means when it is deciding whether to make a compensation order or deciding on the amount to be paid under it.  I would not agree with this.  The section does not intend that the criminal court compensation order should be made on the same basis as an order for damages in a civil case: that is, that it should be made for the correct amount of the damages ascertained by the court after hearing all the parties in respect of the dependent's capacity to pay.  The criminal court is not or, at any rate, should not be in that position.  It is true that subsection (2) requires the court to have regard to any representations by or on behalf of the convicted person or the prosecutor as to the appropriate amount to be payable under the compensation order.  This does not mean that sufficient information will be made available to it to determine the correct amount of compensation. Indeed, the convicted person may say nothing on the issue and the owner of the damaged property may not be present.  If any information is available to the court to indicate that the convicted person's means are such that realistically he or she cannot be expected to pay any compensation, for example, whether he or she is being sentenced to a long term of imprisonment or only a limited amount, then the court should be bound to have regard to these relevant facts.  For this reason I regret I will not be able to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, I think he keeps missing the point of the total debate we had this morning and presumably will have this afternoon.  To repeat what I have said: I am asking that a compensation order be made in cases where somebody is convicted of a malicious damage offence. The Bill outlines certain alternatives to the court.  It states that if somebody is convicted the court may impose a prison sentence or it may impose a fine in lieu of prison.  It gives the court discretion as to whether a fine up to a maximum of £1,000, in one set of circumstances, may be imposed.  In cases of offences of malicious damage it is a pointless exercise from the point of view of the victim of crime that somebody is put into prison at a cost of £900 a week minimum to the taxpayer and perhaps released after two or three weeks because of over-crowding in our prisons.  If the court can have discretion as to the amount of a fine they impose, the same will apply in relation to the compensation order.  The court should have the discretion.  If the Minister is prepared to give discretion as to the amount of the fine to be imposed surely the court should also have discretion in relation to the compensation order it may make.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that because somebody happens to be in receipt of, say, unemployment assistance, or of a particular income, who is engaged in malicious damage, which is prevalent, unfortunately, in Ireland at present, that that person should walk away scot free after serving a short prison sentence or having a small fine imposed on him.  What about the victim of the crime?  It is no good to me or to anybody else if a fine is imposed, which is paid to the State, and my car has been wrapped around a pole or has crashed into a wall, or if it has been stolen, and I have to replace that car.  It is no compensation to me if the State is collecting a miserable fine of £50 or £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next amendment relates to the period during which a compensation order should be completed.  If you want to have a deterrent to people damaging other people's property then, in certain <Col N="488" /> circumstances, they should be made compensate the victim of crime.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Briscoe, the Minister of State's colleague, pointed out this morning we either have deterrents or we do not.  The present solutions to our problems are not working.  It has been proved time and time again that it is not a deterrent to put people into prison for a short period for offences like this.  A real deterrent would be to make a criminal repay society in some way.  If somebody happens to be in receipt of a particular income it is not a reason why he should not be made to repay the victim, even if it takes over 20 years to repay.  Every time the Minister replies to an amendment like this I feel he is missing the point I am making: that we have an opportunity here to do something about what is happening on the streets.  It is not any use threatening prison for a fortnight or three weeks on someone who has burned five, six or seven cars or who has smashed up somebody's car by joyriding it.  It has been proved that that does not stop them.  There is a greater chance that such vandalism will stop if the penalty hits the criminal where it really hurts &mdash; in his pocket.</P>
    <P>We learned from the police report that £36 million worth of goods were stolen in this country in 1990 and that £3 million was recouped by the Garda.  Some people are enjoying £33 million worth of other people's property.  The threat of prison has not reduced the number of robberies. It is big business.  The only way to stop it is to make sure that, in addition to perhaps a prison sentence, the criminal's assets which have been clearly derived from crime are confiscated.  If a person serves a prison sentence, probably a reduced prison sentence, and comes out to find that there are not any pickings to enjoy, criminality is less attractive. Society has to move towards deterrents alternative to prison.</P>
    <P>The Minister is missing a golden opportunity in this legislation to give courts alternatives to custody.  The hands of the court should not be tied by saying that the court shall have regard to a person's <Col N="489" /> income.  If we remove the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and replace it by &ldquo;may&rdquo; then the court may have regard to a person's income. What is a judge to read into this?  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; directs the court to consider a person's means and to perhaps not make a compensation order.  That is wrong.  The court should have discretion. The court may take into account the means of a person, but they would not be obliged to.  I am not trying to make criminal law into civil law.  I am saying that criminal law should include deterrents that are effective.  If a judge commits a person to prison because he knows a fine will not be paid and that person is released in a short time, nothing has been achieved.  The person who has suffered has not achieved anything, society has not achieved anything and the criminal is probably back out on the streets having served a short sentence.  There are just over 2,000 places in our prisons and over 7,000 people are going through them every year.  We are just letting people out to let somebody else in, and prison policy means nothing.  If those people had to pay compensation to the victim of the crime and knew that they might have to pay compensation for a very long time, it might be a deterrent and the unwonted vandalism might stop.</P>
    <P>There is not any justification for the unwonted vandalism which is occurring every day resulting in malicious damage claims.  One might perhaps understand why people become involved in other types of crime, perhaps because of their circumstances which may drive them into it, but it is incomprehensible why people just damage property, why they go into for instance a local authority housing estate and burn the cars of people who are struggling to pay their bills, to pay their rent, to mind their own business and to look after their families.  I cannot understand why some young hooligan would come along and set fire to such cars.  The people who own the cars are not wealthy.  The chances are that such people have loans from the credit unions or the banks to pay for the cars; and when the young hooligan has burned the cars out, the owner must continue to pay the <Col N="490" /> loan for it.  The owners have to find the money.  They cannot appeal to the courts for relief of the liability entered into to get the car.  Such people are not relieved of their responsibility.  They have to work and continue to pay for the car that has been burned out by some vandal.  Yet we are saying in our legislation that, before the court makes a compensation order, it shall take into account the means of the person who perpetrated that vandalism. What about the unfortunate person left without a car and with a loan to repay? We must take into account the means of the person who burned it before we can make a compensation order.  Why should we say that a compensation order can be made only for a certain period?  If a person causes £5,000 or £10,000 worth of damage, that liability should rest with him, if necessary until the day he dies. There is not any justification for not doing this.  If we are really talking about protecting the victims of crime we should not put legislation through which will cause difficulties for the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always time consuming and interesting to try to dissect the difference in meaning between the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Having listened to Deputy Barrett, I agree with him.  We all sympathise with the victim of crime and would like legislation to address the plight of the victim evenhandedly.  There is nothing as sad as seeing people who are up to their eyes in borrowings trying to pay for cars which have been burned, or for extensions to houses which have been subsequently vandalised and so on. If our position is that prison is not working as a deterrent, we have to look at the question of crime and vandalism in a different light.  I question whether changing the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo; will substantially alter the difficulty in the streets. Deputy Barrett instanced the fellow who has burned four or five cars and who is on unemployment assistance.  Why should he get off?  There are sound economic reasons for not levelling a compensation order against a person of such limited income as someone on social welfare. One just cannot reclaim the cost of <Col N="491" /> three or four stolen cars from such a person.  The only people one could claw back some compensation from are those criminals involved in low level burglaries where the cost of what they stole and the damage they did is so low as to make a compensation order practicable.</P>
      <P>The problem of criminals on social welfare doing tremendous damage cannot be addressed by way of compensation orders.  If prisons are not working it is up to us here in the Dáil to address the question of why they are not working. I would be interested in the Minister's response to whether a compensation order can only be applicable in real terms to someone who has a disposable income, such as the drug pusher, the drug importer or the professional criminal who has made a success of crime.</P>
      <P>However, when we speak of vandalism we are not speaking of people who have gathered large sums of money into their own personal coffers.  We are talking about mindless vandalism which is costing the community and costing the victim. There are two different areas &mdash; the area of mindless vandalism and what it costs the victim and there is the question of applying compensation orders to those who have been successful in crime and have accrued assets or cash into their own private coffers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) requires the court to have regard to the convicted person's means as far as they appear or are known to the court.  The object is to ensure that the compensation order can be realistically enforced.  The subsection makes special provision for the case where the convicted person is under 17 and where the court is empowered under section 99 of the Children Act, 1908, to order the fine, damages or costs to be paid by the parent or guardian instead of by the child or young person. In such a case the court must have regard to the means of the parent or guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 99 provides that such an order may be made if the offender is between 15 and 17 years old and that it must be <Col N="492" /> made if the offender is under 15 unless in either case the court is satisfied that the parent or guardian cannot be found or that he has contributed to the commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care of the juvenile.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett says that a person on the dole should not get away scot free if he or she has damaged property.  I agree completely with that.  There is nothing in subsection (4) that says he must get away scot free.  All the subsection says is that a court must have due regard to his or her means, that is, that it does not make an order for such an amount that he or she cannot reasonably be expected to meet.</P>
    <P>To avoid any misunderstanding, under the section the court can order compensation up to the full amount of the offender's assets or income.  What it does not do is allow the court to place an order for £60 a week against a person whose income is £50 a week.  It would not be possible to enforce such an order.</P>
    <P>If we change &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo; there must be an implication that there would be cases where a court should have regard to the offender's means in fixing compensation, but that could lead to a situation where orders that could not be enforced would be made.  What we are saying is that the court must take into account the means of the defendant and must make an order commensurate with those means that can be realistically enforced.  That is a logical and practical approach to ensuring that those who commit crimes can be made to pay.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Byrne's point, there is nothing to stop the court from making an instalment order over a reasonable period of time.  That is something that might be done on the basis of all the information available and we will be dealing with that on the next amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister put in subsection (7) if he is adopting that attitude to my question. Subsection (7) gives the court power after it has made an order to reconsider that order and to reduce it or to suspend it altogether.  I doubt very much if a judge <Col N="493" /> would make a compensation order for somebody who is getting £50 a week to repay £60 a week.  In using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as distinct from the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; the Minister is putting a greater onus on the judge to take into account the means of the individual.  People's circumstances change.  When this compensation order legislation comes into effect some bright boy who is earning money and who appears in court six months later convicted of malicious damage might decide to give up his job and say in court that he is on the dole.  That would suit him because the court would then make a compensation order for, say, £5 a week or it may not make a compensation order at all.  The Minister is now trying to restrict this to a period of 12 months. A month later that individual could be earning £250 or £300 a week.  There are a lot of bright people around this country and many who are a step ahead of the posse all the time.</P>
      <P>It is silly to tie the court's hands.  Putting in the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not weaken the legislation in any way; it makes it more flexible.  I am all for giving the courts flexibility so that a judge can assess the evidence and the character of the person before him.  He has all the advantages that we legislators would not have here.  It is right that we should allow the court discretion to sum up the circumstances of a case and decide whether or not to make a compensation order.  It could be that it is the person's first offence.  He may have been dragged into it, he may be on the periphery and in such circumstances the judge may decide not to make a compensation order but to impose a fine or apply the Probation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there may be other circumstances. A person may be before the court who has a criminal record, who ignores the law consistently, who is living quite well and who claims that he or she is in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I recall reading about drugs cases where some drug baron who is now in prison was a tenant of the local authority.  At the same time he had a nice big house in a very wealthy part of Dublin in his wife's name. He was in receipt of unemployment <Col N="494" /> assistance and everybody knew that that person had a considerable amount of money.  The problem was to prove it.  Is the Minister trying to tell me that the court's hands should be tied if that type of individual came before it?  Of course, it should not.  We should use our basic commonsense and allow our judges to use their commonsense.  We should not tie their hands or worry that they may go overboard in some cases.  They will not go overboard while a person has the right of appeal.  In addition, under subsection (7) the courts are being given the further power to suspend or reduce the compensation order.  Therefore a person will have the right to go back into the court. What I am saying is that we should not weaken the legislation or send out signals to the courts through the wording used. We should give them discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the courts would want clearly defined legislation. What Deputy Barrett has proposed differs only slightly from what we have proposed, that the courts should use their better judgment in making a decision based on all the facts before them.  I rest my case.</P>
      <P>Question, &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (5), line 30, to delete &ldquo;during a period not exceeding 12 months&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am attempting here to amend subsection (5) which states that &ldquo;a compensation order may provide for payment of compensation by instalments during a period not exceeding 12 months&rdquo;.  I wish to delete the words &ldquo;during a period not exceeding 12 months&rdquo; so that the subsection would read &ldquo;a compensation order may provide for payment of compensation by instalments&rdquo;.  Again, I fail to see why the hands of the court should be tied in this regard and it relates to the point we have just been discussing.  If we <Col N="495" /> say the payment must be made within 12 months then obviously income would be a factor.  Suppose £5,000 or £10,000 worth of damage is done and a person is in receipt of £50 to £100 per week, if an order stipulating £20 per week should be repaid is made, the maximum that would be collected, if the legislation is approved, would be £1,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>What is the logic behind the proposal that we impose a limit of 12 months? Again, we are talking here about using compensation orders as a deterrent to prevent mindless vandalism or damage to people's property.  I do not understand the logic behind the suggestion that it should be paid within 12 months.  If I damage someone's property there is no reason why I should be relieved of my obligation to that person and society after a period of 12 months.  If we decide not to send a person to prison but rather to impose a fine, then why should it not be paid over five years or ten years if a person can pay £10 or £15 a week?  It should be a deterrent.  The victim should also have the opportunity to recover the loss incurred.  Perhaps the Minister of State will convince me there is a necessity for this, but I cannot for the life of me understand the reason we should lay down a maximum period of 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Deputy Barrett because from what the Minister of State said on a previous amendment the subsection appears to be contradictory.  On the one hand, we are saying to the court that they should take into consideration a person's means but on the other, in subsection (5), we are saying conpensation should be paid within a period not exceeding 12 months.  If the sum involved is a large one, as it will be very often, the judge would have to come to the conclusion that it would not be possible for the person concerned to pay it back if they are on a low income or in receipt of some benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister of State is not prepared to agree to the amendment proposed by <Col N="496" /> Deputy Barrett, which is a reasonable one, he should bring forward an amendment which would allow the court, having taken a person's means into consideration, to decide on what the period of time should be.  If the words &ldquo;during a period not exceeding 12 months&rdquo; are deleted it would be paid by instalments. I do not know if it would be necessary to extend the amendment to read that the court should decide on the length of time over which the payment should be made but I suggest if the Minister of State is not prepared to accept the amendment which, as I said, I support, he should bring forward an amendment to meet the point.  It is contradictory as listed at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment gives effect to the views expressed on Second Stage that it would be better to leave it to the court to decide the period over which the compensation should be paid. In his reply to the debate the Minister for Justice said that there was no particular sanctity about the period and that the point could be teased out further on Committee Stage.  That is what we are doing at present.</P>
      <P>The object of imposing a limit of 12 months on the period of payment by instalment was to ensure that the payment could not be so prolonged as to be oppressive or unrealistic.  It would be better that these orders should be sharp in their effect and not for a protracted period of time.  On the other hand, I can see that there would be circumstances where payment under a compensation order could reasonably be made to extend over a period in excess of 12 months.  The only difficulty I have with the amendment proposed by Deputy Barrett is that it imposes no upper limit on the period of payment.  I think some guideline has to be given to the court in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the court be given some guideline as to the period and what is the logic behind the suggestion that we impose a limit of 12 months? I could suggest that it be six months, 24 <Col N="497" /> months, or 30 months.  There is no logic behind it and it is like picking a number out of the sky.  I cannot say that we should impose a limit of 24 months.  What I am saying is that the court should have discretion.  They may say that they are making a compensation order with the compensation to be paid over six, nine, 12 or 24 months or five years.  We should leave it to the courts to decide.  Why should we worry about it and why should the court be given this sort of direction?</P>
      <P>I thought about this matter when tabling amendments and I said to myself that if I suggest a period of 24 or 36 months the Minister of State might reasonably say to me, why pick 24 or 36 months?  The point I am trying to make is that there is no logic behind it.  Perhaps we are looking at this legislation from different points of view.  I consider this part of the legislation presents the Dail with an opportunity for the first time to introduce a new form of deterrent to prevent people engaging in mindless vandalism and damaging other people's property, by hurting them in their pocket as distinct from imposing a liability on the taxpayer all the time by putting them into institutions which, as we can prove, is not working.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that people should not go to prison; of course they should for certain offences, but while they are in prison it is better to try to rehabilitate them so that they will not reoffend. However, when somebody damages property putting them in prison will not make up a person's loss.  The punishment should be to pay for some of the damage they caused and in addition the court may decide that they should do community service.  I hate to see legislation being destroyed by unnecessary restrictions. We argued about the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as against &ldquo;may&rdquo; and we are now arguing about the period of 12 months.  In my previous amendment we had an argument in relation to subsection (3) where the onus was put on the victim to produce all sorts of evidence and so on.  However, that argument is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seem to be destroying something for which people are looking but we are <Col N="498" /> all afraid because there seems to be a hang-up about established court practices. This is 1991 and many established court practices should be done away with. We should start thinking about what is happening in today's world and what will happen in the world of tomorrow.  We should consider people's feelings and their resentment in relation to crime.  We should take note of vigilante groups and concerned parents organised, in many cases, by the Provos, who will try to fill a vacuum because they see our courts system is not working.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of the survey carried out by the <i>Sunday Press</i> in which only 9 per cent of the public said they had confidence in our courts.  Are the alarm bells not ringing in the Department of Justice as a result?  The lack of confidence in the system is the reason vigilante groups are gaining momentum. The Provos tell people that they will sort it out and not to mind the Garda.  Our laws are seen to be ineffective and the Minister consistently argues against logic.  I was astonished &mdash; I am sure my colleagues have heard the same stories &mdash; by the case of a man who came to me as a result of his car being damaged outside his door.  He is an ordinary person earning a weekly wage and living in a local authority house which he is buying. After his car had been damaged he went to his local for a pint, he was approached by a man who said he had heard his car had been damaged and his house broken into.  When the victim told him what happened the man said he could get the property back for him and that he could break the culprit's arm for £50.  He said he would sort out those involved.  We all know this is going on, that you can hire people for a small amount of money.</P>
    <P>Putting all these restrictions into legislation because it is established court practice is the greatest load of nonsense of all time.  There is no reason for a court not making a compensation order without any restrictions on the period during which the compensation will be paid.  The judge may stipulate that it may be paid in one year, five years or ten years.  The judge should make a decision of that kind <Col N="499" /> and we should enable the courts to make compensation orders in respect of damage to property, take into account the means of the individual and decide over what period the compensation should be paid.</P>
    <P>It is up to the court to decide on the level of compensation because it is not good enough to say that the amount should not exceed the value of the property. What about the pain and suffering involved?  What about the nervousness in people which makes them afraid to open their door?  All these factors are taken into account in every other aspect of law, the laws in relation to libel are a typical example.  The same applies to insurance claims and, before we abolished compensation for personal injuries arising from criminal assault and so on, there was always provision for pain and suffering. There is no point in saying that a victim of crime can take a civil action.  We all know that the vast majority of people to whom we speak every day do not have the money to take civil actions.  Even if they manage to bring a civil action and win, most of the money is swallowed up in legal costs.  The criminal courts should be able to help the victim and the penalties they impose on the individual should be a real deterrent so that people will not engage in crime of this nature in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments are designed to try to improve the situation and not to make life awkward for the Minister. However, if a court awards £50,000 compensation to someone whose house was burned down can it ensure that it will be paid?  How many people would be able to pay back a sum of £50,000 in one year? It would not be practical.  The person who committed the crime would inevitably come to the conclusion that he had no alternative to jail.  It would be nonsensical for a court to say that someone earning £100 per week would have to pay £50,000 in a year.  It would be self-defeating and would tie the hands of the court.  I am sure the judge would take into consideration the amount of the award and <Col N="500" /> the person's means and, therefore, would obviously come to the conclusion that it would be unreasonable to demand £10,000 from someone in the space of six months who would not have an income of that kind in six months.  I would much prefer to see a person paying the amount over a period of three years instead of spending six or 12 months in jail for non-payment. When a criminal is in jail the person whose property was damaged does not get any compensation and the State &mdash; the taxpayer &mdash; has to pay for the person in jail.  If he is married and has a family the State also has to support them.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to agree to the amendment and, if not, to put a much more flexible provision in place to strengthen the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to explain the position whereby a person appears in court as a result of causing malicious damage.  Presumably the court is compelled on conviction to decide on that day whether the person has the means to meet the compensation order. Is the person's house deemed as an asset and is the court empowered to compel the person to dispose of his house, for example, in order to meet the requirements of the compensation order?  When the judge finds the person guilty is he or she compelled to consider the circumstances of the individual on that day? If the sentence imposed is a compensation order plus a fine of £10,000 and the judge defers that sentence beyond the 12 month period the person may then be in a position to make payments in instalments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might be heading down a dangerous path in assuming that this new form of financial penalty is a substitute to a prison sentence, which has been the accepted means of punishing the wrongdoer. Already financial penalties are, to a large degree, imposed by the courts. Much of our legislation gives courts the option of imposing a fine or imprisonment or both.  The system of imposing financial penalties has been in operation for a long time.  It is not the case that we <Col N="501" /> have recently discovered a new method of imposing penalties on people convicted for all sorts of offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>These guidelines are not laid down in section 9 so as to comply with established practices but because they are justified on practical and common-sense grounds and in the interests of securing a measure of uniformity of treatment of offenders by different judges.  What we want is a reasonable solution.  Reference was made in the House this morning to persons on unemployment assistance paying £5 a week for the rest of their lives.  That would probably be unconstitutional and would be certainly unenforceable.</P>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Byrne's point, the judge would take all the facts into account, what assets a person has, be it a house or otherwise, and whether or not that house is mortgaged.  The decision would then be taken regarding compensation and it would be up to the defendant to fulfil the order made.  The purpose of giving a guideline of 12 months is to make sure that the measure is effective, that the person can pay the penalty imposed on him and that it will not be easy for him to perpetrate crime in the future.  We want an effective measure and we want to ensure that the amount due by the defendant is paid.</P>
      <P>There is a precedent for this in section 17 of the Environment of Court Orders Act, 1926, which authorises a District Court to order payment of a debt by instalments.  It provides that payment may be ordered &ldquo;by such instalments and at such times as a justice shall in all the circumstances consider reasonable&rdquo;.  In deference to what has been said by the three Deputies present and in response to Deputy Bell's earlier request, I am prepared to take this matter on board and to come back with a further amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I sound boring and repetitive but the compensation order is a very good concept.  In reply to what Deputy Byrne said earlier, I do not see compensation orders as the new way of dealing with certain forms of crime.  It <Col N="503" /> is an alternative method and will be a further deterrent to some forms of crime, particularly in relation to malicious damage which is what this Bill is about. We should bear in mind that we are talking solely about malicious damage, mindless vandalism, people abusing other people's property without any justification whatsoever.  Nobody would try to justify that kind of crime.  There was a spate of joyriding in this country and we spent some time looking for solutions to the problem.  The position is the same in Britain.  This is one way in which we might put a stop to such a crime.  If a person steals a car for joyriding purposes, crashes it and finds he has to pay the owner the cost of the car over a five year period, he might not commit the crime again.  That might be a deterrent.</P>
      <P>I am proposing that in subsection 7 we delete lines 43 to 48 and in page 9 that we delete lines 1 to 13.  The provision would then read: &ldquo;At any time after a compensation order has ceased to be suspended by virtue of section 10 (1) and before it has been complied with, or fully complied with, the District Court may, on the application of the convicted person or the owner concerned, reconsider the compensation order already made&rdquo;.  That would simplify the whole subsection. This subsection refers to reducing the amount of the penalty if the means of the convicted person are insufficient to satisfy the order in full and also to obligations on the victims of crime, but I see no necessity for this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 allows for the normal right of appeal.  The compensation order cannot come into force until the period of appeal has elapsed.  That is understandable and is in accordance with normal practices and principles of law. However it is acceptable to provide that the convicted person or the victim should have the right to go back to court.  We said earlier that the court shall have due regard to the means of the person who is being convicted.  At that time the person may have a particular income, be it social welfare benefit or from work.  The person <Col N="504" /> may have a job at the time the compensation order is made but may subsequently lose that job.  He should be entitled to go back to court to have his position reviewed since the order was made when he was receiving perhaps £200 or £300 per week.  The person may have been ordered to pay back £50 per week over a 12 months priod.</P>
    <P>In response to the person's appeal the court may decide to amend the order by reducing the amount and extending the period of repayment or by making a new order.  I have no problem with that provision. Equally, however, the person who suffered the loss should have the right to go to the court and ask that the order be amended.  For example, if the convicted person had been in receipt of social welfare but there is evidence that he now has a well paid job, the order should be amended to take account of the changed circumstances.  Both sides should get a fair deal.  At present it is all one-sided.  I believe that either the convicted person or the person who suffered the loss should have the right to go back to the court to have the compensation order amended.  This is perfectly reasonable, it satisfies what the Minister is seeking in section 9 (7) that the convicted person has the right to go back into court. However, I say that the victim should have the right to go back to the court if circumstances change.  My amendment does not in any way weaken the legislation. It makes it more flexible, which is in the interests of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Barrett is to delete the detailed provisions of paragraph () of subsection (7), and simply to authorise the District Court to reconsider the compensation order.  Paragraph (a) covers two eventualities that may arise after a compensation order has been made by the Criminal Court.  First, the convicted person's means may turn out to be insufficient to satisfy the order in full, or at all, because the person concerned has lost his employment or indeed become disabled as a result of an accident or otherwise.  Second, the damage to the <Col N="505" /> property may be less than it was taken to be for the purposes of the compensation order.  In either case it would be unjust not to amend or in some cases to revoke the order, because if the full circumstances had been known to the court at the time of conviction the order may not have been made in the same terms or possibly not have been made at all.</P>
      <P>I think it is better that the Bill should specify, as it does now, circumstances that would justify the District Court amending a compensation order.  That order may have been made by another justice of the District Court or by the Circuit Criminal Court.  It should also specify what action the courts should be able to take in those circumstances.  Without the guidance given by subsection (7) (a) it is doubtful if the District Court would have power to reduce the amount of compensation where this would be justified. On the other hand some district justices might be inclined, if the circumstances pointed to a substantial improvement in the convicted person's means, to increase the amount payable. This is a very important provision.  Again, such an increase would be of doubtful validity and would also be contrary to the policy underlying section 9, which is to enable the owner of damaged property to get a quick redress where the approximate amount of the compensation is readily ascertainable and the convicted person can realistically be expected to pay it one sum or by instalments.  This is very clear and for these reasons I regret I will not be able to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response is reasonable.  We have been talkiing about allowing for a certain amount of flexibility. The Minister's reply indicates that it would be better to leave that part of the section as it stands and to allow for a mechanism of appeal which gives flexibility. As the Minister has said, the Circuit Court might very well decide to increase rather than decrease the payments. I think that flexibility should be maintained in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Forgive me if I have <Col N="506" /> missed the point, but how would my amendment change the set of circumstances? My amendment gives the convicted person the right to go back to the court, but it gives the injured party also the right to go back to court.  I do not understand why the Minister should have a hang up about the method of paying compensation, that is, in one payment or by instalments.  Obviously, the thinking behind it was to have the compensation paid in a short period.  What is the logic behind paying the compensation in a short period?  We are using a new mechanism to compensate the injured party and perhaps to act as a deterrent against a repeat of that type of offence in the future.  Why should my amendment endanger this?  I have made provision for the convicted person to go back to the court should circumstances change, but the obverse is that the injured party should surely have the right to go back to the court.  Suppose it was thought that damage of £5,000 was done but it turned out afterwards that the damage in fact was £7,500, or even £10,000 nobody is too concerned about the victim in those circumstances.  However, we are bending over backwards to ensure if it was the other way round, that the damage was less than thought originally, that the money be repaid.  That does not seem to be fair.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister will achieve what he is seeking to do by accepting my amendment and in addition will extend that right to the injured party.  If the Minister can find a new wording that is better than mine, I will accept it. However, I am trying to establish in principle that it should work both ways.  I do not see how my amendment is destroying the principle the Minister is trying to establish.</P>

      <P>We are trying to ensure that what we put into legislation can stand up legally in court and that if the court makes a decision the decision will be binding and can be upheld on appeal to a higher court.  We have to enshrine this in the law.  It could be very dangerous if the decision taken would not stand up in <Col N="507" /> court and would not be effective.  This section is giving validity to the decisions taken by the court, once the power is given to the court to implement those decisions.

      <P>I referred specifically to subsection (7) (a) in my first reply. Under subsection (7) (a) it is doubtful if the District Court would have power to reduce the amount of compensation without that provision.  Later on I pointed out &mdash; and Deputy Bell picked up on this &mdash; that on further consideration of the facts a court could decide to increase a compensation order or the compensation payable.  What we are saying to you is that deletion of that would take that power away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am sorry.  If my amendment were accepted section 9 (7) would read as follows: &ldquo;At any time after a compensation order has ceased to be suspended by virtue of section 10 (1)&rdquo;&mdash; which is the appeal period &mdash;&ldquo;and before it has been complied or fully complied with, the District Court may, on the application of the convicted person or the owner concerned, reconsider the compensation order already made&rdquo;.  I am seeking to make it work both ways so that a convicted person can go back &mdash; this is what is provided in sections 9 (7) (a) and (b) &mdash; and an injured party can also go back if circumstances change. Both parties should be able to go back if their circumstances change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be missing the point that the <Col N="508" /> Minister is making, but as far as I understand it section 9 (7) as it stands would be acceptable if we wanted to provide for the convicted person to be able to go back but we would be ignoring the injured party.  However, if we wanted to give the injured party an opporunity to go back if circumstances changed then the provision would need amendment.  I am making a suggestion how it could be amended.  If the Minister has a different wording he would like to use, that is all right; but I do not understand the principle that he is fearful of.</P>
    <P>For example, in relation to a maintenance order in the family courts a judge will make a decision in court to make a maintenance order of a certain amount based on the income of, perhaps, the husband.  If the husband's circumstances change then the wife can go back to the court to seek to have a new order made. That does not seem to cause difficulties. That principle can apply both ways.  If the husband's income has gone down, if he has lost his job, or if his income goes up the court can amend the maintenance order.  Why could a court not amend a compensation order that relates to malicious damage in the same way that it can amend a maintenance order?  That provision should be available if somebody's circumstances change; a compensation order should be able to go up or down.  I do not recognise the principle that the Minister fears might be destroyed if my amendment were accepted.  As I said, if the Minister would prefer to use different words from those I use then by all means I should be prepared to leave the issue to the Report Stage, but I am trying to establish the principle that the injured party should have the right to go back just as much as the convicted person has the right to go back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point that is being made.  There is some confusion. I am not too sure whether the Minister in addressing the amendment and quoting section 9 (7) (a) had clarified the issue.  I think that he in fact confused it all the more.  Deputy Barrett is right in the case <Col N="509" /> he is making for his amendment.  That, by the way, does not mean that I am supporting the amendment.  However, I do need to ask the Minister whether he would agree with me that if a justice were to make a compensation order, that part of a penalty was that compensation be paid, the method in which the payment is to be made would be outlined to the culprit.  A hearing has been held, a sentence has been passed and a decision taken.  It would be impossible to alter the decision or to seek to alter instalments each time the economic staus of the culprit changed, that the court be empowered to alter indefinitely.</P>
      <P>I return to what we were debating earlier: the question of whether a compensation order should last 12 months or whether it should be extended beyond 12 months.  The Minister has said that he will come back to the House to amend the 12 month provision and perhaps extend it indefinitely, in the sense that Deputy Barrett wanted it open ended.  I think the Minister would agree that it would hardly be right that someone who appeared on a given day in a court, who was found guilty and was sentenced to a combination of imprisonment and fine and who had a compensation order levied against him or her on that day, given his or her economic circumstances on that day, could have the case retried again and again, particularly now that it has been argued that the method of paying compensation orders by instalment should be openended.  That would mean that a person in court would not know for the rest of his or her life at what stage he or she might be dragged back into court to have instalments increased or decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly should not be happy with people going through the court system under that provision.  I would rather that a decision be taken by a court on a particular day and that a penalty was applied there and then.  It is dangerous to leave something hanging over a person for the rest of his or her life, depending on whether or not his or her circumstances change, and have that person wondering whether the court would drag him or her <Col N="510" /> in to have instalments under a compensation order adjusted.  Before there is a vote on this matter, if there is a vote, I should like the Minister to clarify that point for me.  Am I reading the situation correctly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say to you, through the Ceann Comhairle, that if your agrument were correct then we should not have section 9 (7) at all.  You say that on the day a decision is to be taken that should be it.  If that logic were to follow through, then if a person's circumstances worsened he or she should not have the right provided in section 7 to go back to court and have the amount of the instalments reduced.  You are arguing that a decision is a decision and that is it, that if circumstances change then that would be tough luck.</P>
      <P>There is a precedent in all of this.  The Bill is saying that the amount of compensation payable should not exceed the value of the property damaged.  It is not a position such as that pertaining to a civil action when a court will take circumstances into account when awarding a particular sum of money.  What the Bill is saying is that if £5,000 damage were done, basically the compensation order should not exceed £5,000.  However, depending on the circumstances, the compensation order could be made for £500 at the time of the sentence.  If we were to follow through on what you said, once a decision were taken that would be it and an order could not be altered. However, that is not the case in accordance with section 9 (7).  That subsection gives the right to a convicted person to go back to the court to have a compensation order reduced.  I am saying that the injured party should also be given the right to go back and have a compensation order amended if circumstances had changed to justify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I point out that that position applies in family courts with maintenance orders.  Maintenance orders may be changed depending on the circumstances of a spouse at a particular time.  If a judge decides to award a specific amount to a wife based on the income of her husband <Col N="511" /> on a particular day, then surely if the husband's income trebles in the following week or the following month she should have the right to go back and have her maintenance order amended &mdash; and she has got that right.  Why not apply the same principle in this instance?  If a compensation order was for, say, £500 because a person had only a certain amount of income, then if that person's income improves dramatically the injured party should be able to go back, give evidence of the dramatic improvement in the convicted person's income, say that he or she is still losing £10,000 and ask that the compensation order be amended in order that more of the loss can be recouped.  That is all I am saying.  I do not see how my argument goes against any established principles of law.  That provision is made in relation to family law cases and surely it should apply for compensation orders as well?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier Deputy Barrett mentioned the one-sided nature of the provision which does not allow the compensation to be increased in circumstances in which the person's means improve or in which the amount of the damage is higher than had been thought.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with an order of a criminal court which should be as certain as possible so far as the convicted person is concerned.  To revert to a point alluded to by Deputy Byrne, under our Constitution, indeed the whole legal principles of law and equity here dictate that on the day a decision is taken the convicted person must or should know the exact decision and its effects; there can be no doubt or ambiguity about that.</P>
      <P>In reply to what Deputy Barrett said, the injured party always has the remedy of a civil action if he or she can get more money than that awarded by the criminal court.  They can always take a civil action against the defendant, but the criminal court must be absolutely certain, and the convicted person must know the decision taken and its effects.  Those are the principles of law here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, it is not because the convicted person is being given the right &mdash; under the provisions of section 9 (7) &mdash; to go back into court and have the order changed.  If the Minister is to adhere to his argument then section 9 (7) should not be in the Bill.  The Minister is saying that, once a decision is taken, that is final; one may agree or disagree with it but it is final.  Here the Minister is going beyond that.  He has argued against the very point he is now making.  He is saying now that if the circumstances of the convicted person change he or she may go back into the court and have the relevant order changed.  That is fine; I do not have any difficulty with that, but I contend that if that is to happen on the one side it should also happen on the other.</P>
      <P>I make no apologies for saying that I am more concerned about the rights of the victims of crime than about those of people who go about damaging other people's property, to quote Deputy Byrne, those who engage in mindless vandalism, leaving a trail of destruction behind them.  Victims of vandalism have to repay a bank loan on a car that has been destroyed.  Nobody seems to worry about them or be concerned about their rights.  Many people stand up and talk about the rights of the person who prepetrated such mindless vandalism. Nobody asked them to go out and damage other people's property; there is no excuse for that.  One sees it every day of the week.  Deputy Bell told us this morning that his office practically went up in flames simply because some fellow walking alongside his office decided to set fire to a rubbish bin.  If a building goes up in flames who is the loser?  Deputy Bell was the loser but nobody appears to worry about his rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned about the principles of law which stipulate that we give a convicted person the right to go back into court and plead: please, your Honour, reduce the compensation order you made because my income has decreased.  It appears nobody is pleading the cause of the victim who stands to lose X amount of money so that he or she can <Col N="513" /> go back into court and say: your Honour, when you made the compensation order three months ago the circumstances of the convicted person were such, but there is evidence to show that that person is making treble the amount you were told at the time.  However, the convicted person can go back into court and say: by the way, your Honour, you made a compensation order for £10,000 and there is proof the damage amounted to £9,000 only.  If a mistake is made in the other direction there is nobody to go back into court and say: your Honour, the amount of the damage was assessed at £10,000 and we had assumed it would cost £8,000 to do the repairs but, by the time the builder had finished the rebuilding of the premises, due to bad weather, srikes and so on, the cost turned out to be £15,000 or £20,000.  There is nobody to defend that person's rights.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for consistently arguing that somebody should speak up for the rights of those who suffer at the hands of criminals who go about damaging people's property without any justification. It is not that they are taking money and putting it into their pockets because they need money, they are hungry or whatever; they just set fire to buildings, damage property and burn cars.  It appears we have to look after their rights all the time.  I say: for a change let us look after the rights of the people who suffer at the hands of those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very interested to hear the Minister's response to the points made.  Due to the position adopted by the Minister in response to the arguments about compensation by instalments, the waters have been blurred all the more because we do not know what form the Minister's amendment will take on Report Stage.  For example, we do not know whether he will extend the period to 12 months or some other indefinite timescale.  That renders acceptance of Deputy Barrett's amendment all the more complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we leave the issue of the compensation order will the Minister explain whether a compensation order can be <Col N="514" /> levied against somebody in receipt of a social welfare payment, a social welfare beneficiary?  Given the method of calculating the benefit accruing to a social welfare recipient such as the number of dependent children under the various clauses in the Social Welfare Act, does the Minister envisage the courts having the power &mdash; given the family income supplement and all the other layers of social welfare payments geared to ensuring that nobody is in receipt of an income below a certain threshold &mdash; to claw back from a social welfare recipient sums of money granted under a compensation order?  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.  If one assumes that most of the vandalism &mdash; I do not know if this is a fair assumption &mdash; is being perpetrated by people in receipt of social welfare payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy Byrne, as far as I am concerned there is no justification for suggesting, whether by implication or innuendo, that social welfare recipients should be treated any differently from anybody else who perpetrates such vandalism. The source of the perpetrator's income should not be in question in relation to criminal damage.  For example, many social welfare recipients have more money than the take home pay of many people at work.  Indeed, some social welfare recipients may have more income than some people working in the public service on the basis of recent figures I saw.  We should not get into that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that a person may be in receipt of social welfare does not justify that person burning or damaging somebody else's care, house or property.  In fact if they are in receipt of a low income or of social welfare benefits they should be all <Col N="515" /> the more careful not to commit such offences.  If they are in receipt of State benefits they should be more careful about squandering taxpayers' money through damaging property and so on.  I want to make that point clearly on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The sons and daughters of well-heeled people &mdash; certainly not those in lower income housing estates &mdash; very often perpetrate more vandalism and cause more damage in city and urban areas than the children of people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  I want to put the lie to that implication and stitch it into the record in definite terms.  The fact that somebody is in receipt of a low income, high income, or social welfare payments, pension or whatever does not give them the right to damage somebody's property. We should not even go down that road.</P>
    <P>The amendment represents about the best balance one can strike.  We will have to take into consideration this aspect of income.  If a person in receipt of social welfare or on a low income committed an offence for which he or she had to pay a large amount of compensation, we would have to take into consideration innocent parties such as a spouse and children.  They should not be penalised because one of the family has been irresponsible enough to damage a car or a building.  The provision giving them the right to go back to the court to have the matter re-assessed is fair.  One would not want to penalise innocent parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that compensation should be relative to a person's means.  That would not exclude somebody in receipt of social welfare.  I would challenge Deputy Eric Byrne to say at any public meeting we might attend in the future that he is against levying compensation against people who are in receipt of social welfare.  Many such people have children who are out and about causing havoc.  The section calls for the court to take into account a person's means.  A person who comes from a well-heeled family may burn a £10,000 car but <Col N="516" /> may be able to pay compensation at £100 per month until the total amount is repaid.  A person who comes from a home where the income is, perhaps, £100 or £140 a week, would probably pay £10 a month.  We cannot legislate for one section of the community but rather for the whole community.  If there is not a deterrent, nobody will be able to contain those children.  Parents often go before the court and ask the court to take troublesome children off their hands because they simply cannot control them. Many of these parents are totally irresponsible and could not care less what their children are up to.  The parents are not held responsible and there is not a deterrent.  This is our chance to put the onus of responsibility on parents by making them pay for failure to control their children.  If we do so, parents will then be anxious to find out where their children are at night.  At 10 or 11 p.m. one can walk down any street of this city and see young children playing to their hearts content.  Many children are told by their parents to go out and play because they do not want them in the house.  If such parents know it will cost them money if their children cause mischief, they will want to know where they are.  People may say we are being Victorian but perhaps people were more civilised then than today.</P>

    <P>That is exactly what Deputy Bell is looking for.  The Minister is saying that this right should apply only to the convicted person, who could go back to the court claiming that his circumstances had changed and ask the court to reduce the amount of compensation to be paid.</P>
    <P>If the convicted person has that right, the owner of the damaged property should also have the right to go to the court and say that the income of the person against whom the order has been made has increased threefold and he should be able to ask the court for more of the compensation due.</P>

      <P>We all know about civil actions.  If the loss is £10,000 and the compensation order is made for £1,000 because of the income of the individual convicted of the offence, the owner of the property is still at the loss of £9,000. If circumstances were different and the person convicted had adequate funds, the owner of the property would get the full amount in compensation.</P>

      <P>That has nothing to do with the order.  Section 9 (1) states:</P>
      <P>On conviction of any person of an offence under section 2 of damaging property belonging to another, the court, instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way, may, on application or otherwise, make an order (in this Act referred to as a &ldquo;compensation order&rdquo;) requiring him to pay compensation in respect of that damage to the owner of the property.</P>
      <P>This compensation order is separate from any fine or sentence that may be imposed. The court may imprison a person for six months and in addition make a compensation order.  That is not what is being disputed.  All I am saying is that if a convicted person has the right to go back to court surely the owner of the property who may be at the loss of £9,000 should have the same right.</P>
      <P>I know all about taking a civil action. However, it can take a long time to have a case heard in the civil courts; you have to pay all your legal expenses and the court may award you only £5,000 while your legal costs could be anything up to £10,000.  We all know what happens in civil courts.  I want to repeat &mdash; I am glad Deputy Briscoe is in the House because I know his feelings on this &mdash; that last week or the week before <i>The Sunday Press</i> published a survey which showed that only 9 per cent of people have confidence in our courts because they do not believe that justice is being done.  A lot of this is perception.  It is startling to think that only 9 per cent of people have full confidence in our courts.</P>

      <P>I take the point that we, as legislators, want to bring in legislation which is capable of standing up in court. We will be wasting our time if we pass legislation which cannot be enforced.  I want to refer to section 9 (1), which has been quoted twice to me, which provides that: &ldquo;On conviction of any person of an offence under section 2 of damaging property belonging to another, the court, instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way, ...&rdquo;.  I want to take as an example the case of a man who is sentenced to six months imprisonment and is fined £100.  If the judge knows that he has £10,000 in the bank he may compel him to pay £9,000 in compensation.  The malicious damages may amount to £30,000.  I am asking the Minister to clarify for the benefit of the House whether a sentence delivered by a court on a certain day can be regarded as a variable sentence over the next 12 monhs or two years on the basis that the economic well-being of an individual may change.  If the Minister clarifies this point it will help me understand the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe suggested in a challenging way that I should stand up at public meetings and say all sorts of things. He said this on the basis of a question I asked.  Perhaps the Minister will give me an answer to my question this time.  There is no point in Deputy Briscoe or I standing up at public meetings and saying that people will be able to get compensation from these thugs if we know full well that the courts cannot impose compensation orders against people on social welfare. Given the legislation applicable in the social welfare arena, the formula used for calculating the minimum income on which a family can survive and that people can get money from community welfare officers on the basis of their inability to pay bills, etc., can the Minister say whether it is constitutional, legal or possible for a court to make a compensation order against someone who is on social welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Byrne, a compensation order can be made against a person on social welafre <Col N="520" /> but it must be relevant, reasonable and enforceable.  That is the reality of this situation.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Barrett, our Constitution requires that the criminal system could be conducted on the basis of fair procedures so far as the accused or convicted person is concerned.  An essential element of fairness is that the convicted person should know, when convicted, the full amount of the penalty imposed.  The law has always allowed the Minister for Justice to reduce a penalty, whether it is a fine or imprisonment, in relation to decisions made by a criminal court.  It is only fair that we should do the same in this Bill.  If fresh evidence shows that the compensation order is too high the court, which will take all the relevant facts into account, will have the power to reduce the amount.  When new information in criminal cases is submitted to the Minister for Justice he has the right to consider this and reduce the fine or term of imprisonment.  The only difference is that we are giving this power to the courts.  It would not be much more difficult to go to the District Court in a civil action case to recover more compensation as it would be to go to the District Court under the Deputy's proposal. There is a limit of up to £5,000. The injured party or plaintiff has the right to do this.  Under criminal law as it stands, our duty is to make sure that this right is clear, fair and equitable and that the convicted person knows exactly what the penalty is and where he stands on the day the decision is taken.  If an injured party feels he has not been fairly dealt with by the court he has the right to take an action in the civil court against the convicted person in order to recoup further damages.</P>

      <P>If I have to stand alone on this issue I will because it is time we faced up to it.  I do not disagree with everything the Minister has said.  The convicted person should have the right to go back to court.  Deputy Bell also argued that point.  However, I equally say that the victim should have the right to go <Col N="521" /> back to court.  I do not care what principles operated up to 1991.  I think only 9 per cent of our population have confidence in our courts because the ordinary members of the public cannot associate themselves with these outmoded and outdated institutions.  People know that they cannot go into the civil courts because of the costs and risks involved.  They know that the judges are operating under ancient laws which were established when circumstances were entirely different. The Minister referred earlier to a 1926 Act.  I was not around 65 years ago but from what I have read I know that the sort of mindless vandalism which occurs today did not occur then.  Twenty or 25 years ago when there was no such thing as free second level education people in poor parts of Dublin could leave the keys in their doors, visit their neighbours and come back a few hours later in the knowledge that nobody would have the cheek to turn the key in the door, walk into their house and take their property.  At that time people could park their vehicles in the street and know that vandals would not suddenly decide to burn an entire row of cars.  That did not happen 25 years ago but it is happening today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are fed up with this and they are asking what we as legislators are doing about it.  They also call us to public meetings.  If you are in Government you defend the Minister and if you are in Opposition you berate the Government and say there is not this, that or the other thing, but the problems remain and the public go away saying they are all the same, they give us promises.  When we get a chance to put legislation through here, the public expect us to pass legislation that means something to the ordinary individual.  I do not give two fiddlers what established practices are in the courts based on 65 years' experience.  I do not care about what happened in 1926, 1936 or 1956; I want laws that will deal with the problems of 1991 and the 21st century and which will deal with people who have taken it upon themselves to engage in activities which are totally and utterly unacceptable to normal society.  I want deterrents that will be seen to be <Col N="522" /> working to stop this sort of thing.  I do not want to see the taxpayer wasting £900 a week; £75 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on our prisons this year. What are we getting for it?  We are getting people who laugh at us and are walking out having served one tenth of their sentence and who are complaining about this, that and the other thing, having achieved nothing, I, along with all the other taxpayers, am paying for the great privilege. This has to stop.  The way to stop it is to hurt people where it matters, whether or not they are in receipt of social welfare.</P>
    <P>If I see a fellow who has damaged my car sitting in the local pub drinking his pint the day after, laughing at me, I will have no confidence in our courts or in our system of justice.  That is exactly what is happening.  We must wake up to this. I repeat, that is where the Provos and the vigilante groups are gaining ground. They love this and say: &ldquo;Do not mind the Garda Síochána, we will sort it out for you, we will make our own laws and we will start to complain when the public go along to these meetings&rdquo;.  We will lose the democratic control that everybody fought for simply because we are afraid to face up to the world of today and the world of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State not to continue quoting established court practices to me because, as far as I am concerned, established court practices have done nothing to sort out this problem. All I am asking is that the Minister leave the right for the convicted person there &mdash; which I am doing &mdash; but also give the unfortunate victim the right to go back into court if the circumstances change.  I do not see that affecting any established principles.  There will be some purists who will not like it, there will be people who will write books and say it is not fair play.  It may not be fair play depending on how you look at it.  I have tried to look at things from both sides and I want to see fair play on both sides.  I want to see the person before the courts having a fair trial, proper representation and having their case heard. Equally I want the victims' rights protected. They do not have the money to <Col N="523" /> be trotting off to civil courts and we are all aware of that.  We are not asking that they should get what is properly associated with our civil courts &mdash; compensation. All they are doing is asking to be put back in the same position after the event as they were before it.  They are not asking for a new car if it was a secondhand car that was burnt.  They are not asking for a new wall if an old wall was knocked down but rather they are seeking the money to replace the wall.</P>
    <P>Who is concerned about the widow, about whom I spoke this morning, who has come out of hospital.  That woman asked me whether her insurance would cover it and I said I doubted it.  This woman has come straight out of hospital. She asked whether the county council would accept responsibility for the wall because of the laneway beside it.  I said &ldquo;I am sorry, madam, yours is private property&rdquo;.  She said they put a hose in through her letter box while she was in hospital and flooded her house and to add insult to injury they knocked down her wall.  Here we are worried about the rights of people who carry out such offences.  Does the Minister of State mean to tell me that that comes from a deprived background?  That woman asked me whether she would have to pay her hospital bills because she did not have the money and the neighbours were complaining that the wall was dangerous and they wanted her to fix it.  She asked whether, if she had been living in a county council house, they would repair the wall, I said &ldquo;yes, because it is their property&rdquo;. She said: &ldquo;I did not damage my wall, other people damaged my wall&rdquo;.  You have to try to convince people they are not being hard done by.  If I was to tell her to take her case to the civil court and claim compensation, she would run me from the door.  Those people should be brought into court and told to: &ldquo;Replace that wall.  If you have to work after coming home in the evenings or at the weekends, you must rebuild that wall or pay that woman the cost of rebuilding it and sort out the mess in that woman's house either by going in yourself or <Col N="524" /> paying the woman for sorting it out.  If it takes five years to pay her back, you will pay her back, because we are not going to tolerate this&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What we are saying here is that if Mrs. So-and-So was awarded £5,000 and it turned out subsequently that she should have got £4,700, the convicted person has the right to go back into court and that woman would have to pay back the £300 or he would have the right to go back and say: &ldquo;things are tough, can I have my compensation order reduced?&rdquo;  We are giving all those rights but we will not give the woman the right to go back in and say: &ldquo;they are now at work, they were students when this happened, why can I not get some of my compensation&rdquo;. There I rest my case.  I am merely arguing that that right should be there in today's world.  Maybe it should have been there 50 years ago but it should certainly be there today as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I go along with Deputy Barrett so far as we have an opportunity in this Bill to speak about the victims of crime.  It seems to me that the person who is being considered over and over again is the criminal.  There are certain limitations being put on our judges.  If I were a judge in a case, having all the circumstances put before me of the person's income, I would like to be able to say: &ldquo;It is obvious that you are not in a position to pay this person the compensation to which they are entitled.  On the basis of your income, and to prevent you starving, or whatever, you can only pay £10 per month but I would like you to know that if it is brought to my attention by the victim of this crime that your financial circmstances have changed, I will increase that amount&rdquo;.  The Minister dealt with this point earlier but he did not say anything about the possibility of a judge being able to say to the victim that <Col N="525" /> if the person's circumstances changed the compensation would be increased.</P>
      <P>For too long we lived with the philosophy which one famous Supreme Court judge in America once said: &ldquo;Justice is a splendid thing but do not expect it in this life&rdquo;.  That is not much consolation for somebody who is left with huge bills to pay to put their car in order, to replace their car or to redecorate their house.  Under community service orders I would not mind if some of these fellows were to repair houses, not necessarily the house they vandalised, but other people's houses that have been vandalised by others.  It would go some way towards part of the compensation.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State if there is any reason we cannot give judges the authority to award the victims of crime a larger amount of compensation. I am aware that the law states you have to tell the person what their sentence is for a particular crime but I still think it is not unfair to say the amount is only X amount per month subject to no great increase in your pay.  If a person who had been convicted of a crime won the lottery and become a millionaire it would be great if we could bring him in and present him with the remaining bill. It is not probable, but it could happen. We should go as far as we can to let the people know that we are on their side and not on the side of the criminal.  I hope I do not hear people saying at various meetings that it is right that the parents of vandals should be made to pay compensation and then see them coming in here to vote against it.  If that happens I will make it quite clear to the people in my area that it has happened.</P>

      <P>I remember some years ago debating with a judge of the High Court.  I said that the law should be subservient to justice and the judge replied <Col N="526" /> that I was incorrect, that justice must always be subservient to the law and that it is up to the legislators to give us the laws.  We have an opportunity to provide the laws; how judges implement them is a separate matter.  It would be nice to be able to write to the Minister to tell him that a person who had committed a crime against one of my constituents had had a change of fortune, was driving around in a BMW which was his own for a change, that he had put energies formerly used for crime to work to do well for himself and that he was now in a position to compensate the victim of earlier crimes. That is an aspiration.  The people are disillusioned with the way the law is implemented.  We have to hurt the criminals.</P>
      <P>I go along with what Deputy Barrett has said in relation to the terror of subversive organisations.  Many of us would like to take the law into our own hands when young vandals strike.  That is a natural human emotion, but we should not give in to the impulse.  The elders in a community should not be influenced by subversive organisations who will offer to kneecap the vandals provided the people support them in an election and provided the people do not contact the Garda Síochána or public representatives.  That is not a society in which I would want to live.  We must ensure that people are not forced to take those remedies.  This is a serious possibility.  I am not exaggerating. Deputy Byrne will agree with me that vandalism has never been as bad as it is now in our constituency.</P>

He should have another chat with the Assistant Commissioner in Dublin in charge of the Dublin Metropolitan area to find out how he sees things.  We are very troubled at the moment and things are not getting any better.  Here we have a chance to tighten up the laws.  If the judges do not want to implement them, that is something else; and, if they are unconstitutional, we can deal with that problem then.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett has made a very strong point.  I would not disagree with the principle of what he is trying to achieve, but I am not sure whether or not it would be a practical thing to build into legislation.  The Deputy is basically saying that the same right should apply to the person whose property is damaged, or who is injured, as applies to the person who is convicted.  If somebody is convicted and fined and compensation is awarded to the victim, so far as I can see from my reading of the amendment, it does not say over what period the compensation should run.  If the award is made over a six month period and someone later on wins the lottery or gets a better job or inherits money, the victim would have the right to say that he had not been awarded the full amount and that he should get more money.  There will have to be some restriction or time limit on that.  I assume the Deputy is saying that if the award is granted over a period of 12 months a victim could not apply for more compensation after the 12 month period, that it should not be a never ending claim &mdash; in other words, that the victim could not claim further compensation five years later in the event of the convicted person winning the pools or something like that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to within the compensation period.</P>
      <P>At the moment even without reference to the industrial dispute the courts are bogged down and the delays in getting into and out of court are fairly substantial. We will perhaps deal with that in the Solicitors Bill.  I am concerned that this legislation will put a substantially greater load on the courts.  I do not know whether or not cases taken under this heading will ever be finished.  They will continue for a substantial period of time. I am not sure that it would be a good thing to further load the courts.  On balance I would prefer to see the decision being taken and being upheld except if the person concerned wishes to appeal to a higher court.  If a person is not satisfied with the compensation he can take civil action.  On that basis I accept the section as it stands, while agreeing with Deputy Barrett's sentiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases to which Deputy Briscoe referred the victim could take a civil action fortified with the evidence that the offender had been convicted of causing the damage.  Section 9 provides fully for compensation in the case mentioned by Deputy Barrett, so far as it is practicable to get compensation from the offender concerned.  With regard to getting extra compensation in the case where the women's house was flooded, the wall knocked down and so on, the women would have to go to court under the Deputy's proposal or under the law as it stands.  Deputy Barrett proposes that the injured party could go back to the District Court and get an increase in the compensation.  I do not see any difference between that and the owner's present right to go to the same court and achieve the same result.  The only difference is that the district justice is wearing his civil hat in the second case where the injured party is not satisfied with the decision of the Criminal Court. <Col N="529" /> He takes a civil action in the District Court and the same district judge takes the decision wearing his civil hat.  Of course, the district judge can only award up to £5,000 but that would cover 95 per cent of cases involved.  After that it would be a matter for the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>In regard to the points made by Deputies Bell and Briscoe about somebody winning the lotto and the injured party wanting to take the case to a higher court, they have up to three years to do so up to a limit of £30,000.  There are several legal avenues open to all our citizens and we must take that into account.</P>
      <P>The district court is a different court to the higher courts.  The higher courts are there by virtue of the Constitution and have very wideranging powers.  The District Court is a creature of statute and we must give it guidelines and parameters within which it must operate.  Consequently in this case, taking into account the criminal law, the rights of the individual and of the defendants, I regret I will not be able to accept the amendments as proposed by Deputy Barrett.  This amendment would be asking the court to reconsider a compensation order already made.  That is totally vague.  In what context would it reconsider?</P>

I asked him earlier &mdash; and this will help us decide on the position we will take if there is a vote on this &mdash; if he viewed a compensation order as part of the penalty for the crime.  If the defendant had been given a six months' jail <Col N="530" /> sentence, fined £100 and had a compensation order levied against him, would that be deemed to be the sentence of the court?  If we were to accept the amendment could the sentence be varied?  Is there such a thing as a variable sentence?  Could the court decide on the nature of the compensation order, that it is sentencing the defendant to six months because it knows the defendant can only pay so much compensation amounting to a small portion of the damage caused to some unfortunate person?  Is it possible then to retry the case in a sense by adopting the amendment as proposed and levelling a further penalty against the defendant after he has served his sentence when his economic circumstances might have changed?  The judge would view the case on a particular day and the defendant would be sentenced to six months because the judge knows the compensation order will bring in only £1,000 out of a total in damages of £10,000.  Is it possible to vary the compensation order later?</P>

      <P>The penalty would be decided by the court &mdash; the fine, prison sentence and compensation order.  There could be no such thing as varying that decision.  The court would take its decision based on the evidence before it. Under the Bill as proposed the defendant would have the right to appeal to the court to have that reduced.  The Minister for Justice will have the right, based on the information available to him, to reduce the fine or the prison sentence. Here we are giving the power to the court to do so.  The defendant would have a right of appeal to the court directly or to a higher court.  The injured party would have the right to take a case to a civil court and look for adequate compensation if he was not satisfied with the decision taken in the District Court. There would be no such thing as a variable decision that could be changed six months or a year later.  The law does not allow for that and it could not.  It must be equitable and fair.  The decision must be taken based on the information available on the day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne has raised an important point.  I am not too sure whether the Minister has succeeded in clarifying it.  I would tend towards the idea of finality and clarity with regard to court proceedings on the criminal side because it is one of the proper and fair principles that should be applied when dealing with criminal prosecutions. Nevertheless, subsection 7 (a) allows for a variation being introduced by the court at the motion of the defendant.  It is not just a variation by reducing the amount to be paid per week; it allows for the reduction of the overall amount.  It would seem that if the defendant can move on that motion there is no reason an agreed victim could not as well.  If that is all right for one side I do not see why it cannot be for the other.</P>
      <P>If there are problems that the Minister has in answering Deputy Byrne's point then he should look again at the entirety of paragraph (a) of subsection (7) to see whether or not it is in order.  I know the intention here is to be reasonable and fair towards the defendant and I see no harm in that whatsoever.  Earlier in the debate I thought at times that all sense of balance was being lost.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned at one aspect of Deputy Barrett's proposal.  In seeking alternatives to putting people in prison we should seek to introduce a regime that is also rehabilitative, that will do something to encourage people away from crime by training, education, supervision or counselling so that these people will be more law abiding and better behaved.  If the amount of compensation could be increased should the convicted person, for example, find a job or get some kind of bonus?  The question of the lotto does not appeal to me because it is so improbable.  There would be a disincentive for a convicted person to better him or herself by working longer hours, overtime or seeking a job because he or she would be concerned that an improvement in their lot in that regard might mean they would be brought back into the court and an extra order placed on them for an increase in the rate of compensation to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Once a court has determined that an accused person should pay a certain amount by way of compensation I would be concerned that the court might be asked on a subsequent date to increase the amount of the weekly payment.  I do not believe that is constitutionally possible. What might be allowable would be for a court to order an increase in the rate to be paid on the instalment so that the compensation is paid sooner rather than later.  I am aware Deputy Barrett is not inclined to stand by established practices or principles of the courts but the Constitution is something we cannot run away from all too easily.  Under the Constitution once an order is made on the criminal side it stands and cannot be altered after that day.  Once the court has risen on the particular day the orders of that court stand and cannot be interfered with other than on appeal to or review by a higher court.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Barrett suggested would give rise to practical difficulties.  The better approach would be to allow a victim to go back to court to seek a variation of the way the amount is to be paid but I do not think the victim would be entitled to seek, on the criminal side, a variation of the overall amount to be paid.  For this reason I ask Deputy Barrett to review the matter.  We could discuss it further on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's view that there can be no variation.  If a variation can be made on one side then clearly an application could be made for a variation on the other.  I am worried that there is a constitutional problem about increasing a penalty, which is what compensation amounts to beyond what was originally ordered by the court on the day in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutional points made by Deputy McCartan are open to interpretation and discussion. We would not be allowing the penalty imposed to be altered because in this instance we are talking about compensation. The same principle applies in the family courts where, depending on circumstances of the time, a judge may <Col N="533" /> decide to make a maintenance order based on income and circumstances.  If those circumstances change the spouse, the wife in most cases, has the right to go back to court and say that her husband's income has increased and she was seeking a new maintenance order made and the courts will do so.  That is perfectly sensible and reasonable.</P>
      <P>I respect the Constitution but I believe the men and women who drew up the Constitution did so for the benefit of and in the interests of the vast majority of the people.  The Constitution should not be abused to protect a small minority who are making life hell for the vast majority. The Constitution sets out to protect the rights of the individual which in this case are not being protected.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about compensation orders and not about a judge saying: &ldquo;I imposed a sentence of six months but on second thoughts I should have given you nine months&rdquo; or &ldquo;I imposed a fine of £500 but on second thoughts I am going to increase the fine to £750&rdquo;.  This would be a new concept in criminal law but the same principle applies in the civil court.  It would allow us say to people that in addition to sending them to prison or imposing a fine on them they must compensate the person they injured.  That would be a very sensible move forward.  I am not worried about the constitutional position in that respect because I know what I am suggesting does not run contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Minister said a convicted person has the right to go back to court to have the compensation order altered and that is fine as circumstances may change but if that applies to the convicted person it should apply also to the victim.  That is only reasonable.  Anyone drawing up a constitution in today's world, given the circumstances in which we live, in their right mind would say it is fair and reasonable that if one side can do that then the other side should also be able to do so. Here is a chance for us, as legislators, to express our view on what is happening in the big bad world and to restore confidence in our courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> Deputy McCartan was not present in the House when I made the point that it was frightening that, according to a recent survey the findings of which were published in the <i>Sunday Press</i>, only 9 per cent of the public have confidence in our courts.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that there has been an alarming increase in the number of subversives, those who are organising the vigilantes and public meetings and say, &ldquo;Do not mind the Garda Síochána, we will sort the matter out for you&rdquo;.  We are all well aware of this as we have to deal with this problem in our constituencies, particularly in the Dublin area.  This shows that there is a lack of confidence in our courts system and that our justice system is not striking a chord with the public.</P>
    <P>I may be accused from time to time of getting too emotional or going overboard about this matter.  Indeed I have been accused of being right wing about this.</P>

The Minister time and again says they have always the option of going to the civil courts.  Of course they have that option but why do they not go there?  The Minister knows as well as I the reason they do not do so is that they would have to go through a new procedure which costs money, could drag on and on and leave the person with nothing after deducting legal costs from the compensation. That is the reason they do not go to the civil courts.  If the civil courts were so great they would go there every day of the week in large numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hang-ups about mixing civil law with criminal law because this is 1991. I have no problem either with saying that in addition to a person serving a sentence they should also pay compensation which <Col N="535" /> is what they would be asked to pay in a civil court.  In this case we are saying compensation should match the cost of damage.  If the Minister said the wording is wrong and I should come back with a new wording on Report Stage I would accept that but he is not accepting the principle.  We must march through the lobbies and establish a principle that we want laws which state that if we are fair on one side we have to be fair on the other, that if a convicted person can go back to the court the injured party should also have that right.  It is for that reason that I am pressing my amendment.  If the wording is wrong I will listen to a new wording but the Minister has not said that; he said he is not accepting that principle.  Those who agree with the principle should vote for it.</P>

      <P>I am sure I am entitled to reply to Deputy Barrett.  I would not regard him as emotional or right wing. Like his colleagues, I regard him as a man who is good at making a fair case.  I respect that.  Strictly speaking, a compensation order is not a penal order but it is intimately involved in the decision of the court as to what penalty it will impose.  For example, subsection (6) deals with a case where a convicted person can pay an appropriate fine and appropriate compensation.  In such a case the court must give preference to making a compensation order; and I am sure Deputy Barrett, and indeed the House, will be pleased with that.  This would mean a serious risk of challenge inasmuch as it could be contrary to the principle that a penalty should be certain and not capable of being increased.  Deputy Barrett said that the family courts are a relevant precedent and that maintenance orders can be revised upwards and downwards. However, the family court is a civil court and different considerations apply to orders by a criminal court.</P>

I want to make sure, as I have often said, that we enact the best legislation possible to achieve the best decisions in our courts, to ensure that equity prevails before the courts and through the laws for all our citizens, the aggressors and the aggrieved.  In view of all that has been said I am prepared to refer this matter to the Attorney General for his advice.  If he recommends that a change should be made and that the injured party should have the right to go to a court, I am prepared to bring in a suitable amendment on Report Stage, if it is acceptable to Deputy Barrett and the House.  I hope it will.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that Deputy McCartan has become my defence counsel.  The Acting Chairman represents a constituency which is subjected night after night to crime and he knows that most people do not even bother to report it.  Years ago, when malicious damages were paid, people reported that the window of their car was smashed in order to qualify for payment; but now they merely ring the Garda to say that a gang of hooligans are throwing rocks at houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of compensation in the Bill as it is very important to make people pay for their crimes. As the Minister said, there is no need to confuse compensation with sentencing. Hardened offenders do not mind going to jail for three months.  We saw recently in the newspapers where a youth who had been sentenced to 12 months for 60 handbag snatchings was out after three months and reverted to his life of crime. You read about handbag snatching but you do not always appreciate the suffering, indeed terror, of the people whose privacy has been invaded by smashing the window of a car and grabbing the handbag even when it is under the seat. These criminals should also have to pay the cost of treatment by a doctor because many victims have at least to go to the hospital for a check-up.  Last night a man whom I helped to arrest a youth was bitten on the hand, the victim had to go to the hospital have a blood check and a tetanus injection.  The minimum cost would be £10.  I am sure that the youth in question is a hardened criminal and when the judge is sentencing him he should order him to pay his victim the sum of £10.  I do not care where it comes from; perhaps his parents will pay for it. A monetary punishment is the greatest deterrent, because these criminals only laugh at jail.  I remarked to the man I <Col N="538" /> helped to arrest last night that it did not seem to bother him that he would spend the rest of his life in and out of prison until he became a toothless old lag.  The inspector who was escorting him said that the man did not mind about that; it was the way he chose to live his life.  However, when they have to pay compensation they do not like it.  Sometimes when a person is convicted for a crime the court is told that he is already paying £10 per month compensation in respect of a previous crime and that the court cannot impose a further £10 per month.  We have consecutive sentences and we must also have consecutive compensation.  The State has a chance to be strong in this regard.  For years I have been insulted for being a law and order man.  I am not a right wing person; I am concerend for the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that this legislation has been introduced.  Let us hope it works because, if it does not, the measures will have to become stronger and stronger. We must give the judges the kind of legislation which they can use at their discretion.  I have always said that these people understand being hit in their pockets and perhaps it will teach them a lesson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the principle which Deputy Barrett is trying to achieve but I am not certain it is practical. As the Minister has agreed to take a further look at this, to consult the Attorney General and to come back on Report Stage, we will not press this to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have moved a small step forward as far as the Minister is concerned, I am prepared to see what comes out of the discussions.  I sincerely hope that a genuine effort will be made to establish this principle, particularly in relation to compensation.  I accept that a prison sentence cannot be changed half way through the sentence.  The principle the Minister is talking about is based on the fact that it would be unreasonable to impose a prison sentence of 12 months and after six months decide to impose an <Col N="539" /> extra six months sentence.  That would be unreasonable.  However, in relation to compensation there should always be flexibility.  A judgment can only be made given the circumstances of the time.  If circumstances change within the compensation payment period, consideration should be given to that.  It would not effect any genuine pinciples that may be held by people.</P>
      <P>I accept that when a sentence is imposed on somebody that sentence cannot be changed, but we are entering a new era in criminal law when we are introducing for the first time in Statute the whole concept of compensation orders.  In layman's language, it is civil law mixed with criminal law.  It is new in our Statute and the Minister, in making his submissions to the Attorney General, should make that point.  I will wait and see what happens and if I am given the right to re-enter this amendment for discussion on Report Stage I will do so.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 14 to 17, to delete subsection (8) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(8) A compensation order and an order under subsection (7) (b) shall be <Col N="540" /> treated for the purposes of enforcement as if they were orders made by the court concerned in civil proceedings and, without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (7), a compensation order shall be treated for those purposes as if it were an instalment order within the meaning of Part I of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main object of this amendment is to facilitate the enforcement of compensation orders.  As the subsection stands, compensation orders are enforceable as if they were orders made in civil proceedings.  This means, in effect, that where the convicted person defaults in making payment under the compensation order, the owner of the damaged property goes to the District Court and asks for an order that the convicted person be examined by the court as to his means and that a statement of means be lodged with the clerk of the court at least one week before the examination.  After the examination the court may make an order for payment of the whole sum or, as the case may be, of the balance either in one sum or in instalments.  That order is called an instalment order even though, as I have said, it may require payment in one sum.</P>
    <P>What the amendment proposes is to skip the first stage of the procedure, that is, the initial step of getting an examination order from the court and having the convicted person examined as to his means.  There should be no need for the court to inquire into means because under subsection (4) of section 9 the court which made the compensation order had regard to the convicted person's means before deciding to make an order.  So in such a case it is proposed that the owner would be able to go to the court straight away and ask it to enforce the order.</P>
    <P>The convicted person is not prejudiced by the amendment because if, as the amendment proposes, the compensation order is treated as an instalment order, then, whether the order was for payment of the compensation in one sum or by instalments, it can be varied by the court <Col N="541" /> on the application of the convicted person, as the circumstances of the case may require.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the revised provision should be without prejudice to the power of the District Court under subsection (7) of section 9 to vary the compensation order because under that subsection the court can effectively reduce the compensation payable or remit it altogether if the convicted person's means are insufficient.</P>
    <P>The redraft of subsection (8) also drops the reference to an order under section 11 (b) (ii) as being unnecessary.  It is clear from the context of section 11 that an order under that section has been made in civil proceedings.  I hope the House can agree to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to add to subsection (8) &ldquo;save that no committal to imprisonment or detention shall be ordered where the court is satisfied that non-payment of a compensation order arises from the inability of the person affected to pay&rdquo;.  The Minister is arguing that where there is failure to pay a compensation order, there should be enforcement in the same way as with a civil debt.</P>
      <P>Recently a man was taken to a Garda station in a town near Dublin for failure to pay a very small debt, and he died there.  That man was needlessly in the Garda station.  That highlights a fundamentally objectionable feature of our civil proceedings, that a person can be committed to prison for failure to pay a civil debt.  That is grossly wrong and such a provision should not be allowed exist in our law.  That is a matter that should be amended in our court rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this provision the Minister is proposing to enshrine that principle in this area of the law, but that is fundamentally wrong.  That is why I have tabled an amendment, and I did so in advance of the unfortunate circumstances which led to the death of the man in the Garda station.  I propose that no person in the context of civil debt generally, and particularly in the context of compensation orders, should be committed to prison on <Col N="542" /> the grounds of inability to pay.  Consequently when a person comes back before the court on the motion of the victim or indeed of the Garda, it would be grossly inequitable and wrong that that person be sentenced to prison because of inability to pay due to poverty.</P>
    <P>This points to a major issue that we have to address in the context of this legislation, that is the issue of poverty.  I do not want to take from many of the remarks that have been made in the debate on all of the amendments about the rights of the victim.  As I pointed out earlier, the position of the victim has been very substantially addressed in this legislation.  For the first time a conviction for malicious damage can be secured without the victim having the harrowing experience of going to court and giving testimony.  Equally, compensation will be provided.  However, there is another side to this debate, that of the person who ends up in the dock through their own fault, who is answerable to the criminal law but is in the same position as 90 per cent or more people who appear in District Courts, that is in a state of poverty. These people have not the means and genuinely will not be able to pay.</P>
    <P>This is particularly important in that compensation orders as alluded to in subsection (4) (b) can and will be made against the parents of young people who commit crime and are ordered to pay compensation.  It is conceivable that, under this legislation as it stands, an order for compensation could be made against one or both parents of the young person who committed the crime and they might not be in a position to pay for whatever reason, in particular through poverty.  The parent may be committed to imprisonment for the wrongdoings of the child because of inability to pay.  That is potentially possible under the provisions of section 9 as it stands.  I would not welcome that proposition.  I believe it is unduly draconian and unnecessarily unfair.</P>
    <P>On another level, which was alluded to by Members earlier on, we have to throw into the balance the effectiveness of getting a return for the taxpayers' money <Col N="543" /> spent in locking people up in prison.  As long ago as 1987, the Minister for Justice indicated in response to questions that I had tabled, that the average amount of money was recovered from people who were committed to prison for non-payment of a civil debt was something of the order of £200.  However, on average, a person was spending in excess of four weeks in prison and consequently, the taxpayer was spending up to £3,500 keeping a person in custody to draw out of them something of the order of £200 to pay back to a credit company or someone who was due the money on the civil side. To my mind that is fundamentally wrong in principle but equally it is very poor value for money and it is a waste of taxpayers' money.  That information which I got in 1987 was in respect of the year 1986.  I do not believe the position has changed, although I cannot advise the House of that.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I put down the same question as I put down in 1987 to the Minister for Justice in order to bring my figures up to date and to see if the pattern had changed; if fewer people were going to prison for the non-payment of debt and if they were in a position to pay more money, in effect to see if we were getting better value for money.  However, in reply the Minister said he was not in a position to give me the information because he did not have the personnel available to correlate all the information. That was a very poor day for the working of this House.  The information could be readily assembled in 1987 setting out and forming the basis of analysis of an important area of penal policy but in 1991, the Minister by using a very spurious device refused to give us this information.  I do not believe the pattern has changed.  In that context the Minister is asking us to extend that very unworkable system which gives a poor return for taxpayers' money to the area of compensation.  In effect, in the event of non-payment or inability to pay the compensation the civil debt process would be imposed.  The Minister has talked about the examination order, the instalment order but <Col N="544" /> was not terribly expansive about the end sanction in this area, and that is the committal order for non-payment of the instalment order.  That is what is proposed here.</P>
    <P>As I said, responsibility to pay can rest on entirely innocent people in the criminal law context, namely the parents of a juvenile offender.  Are we to consider the prospect down the line that we would ask the courts to commit to prison the parent or guardian &mdash; the provisions of the Childrens' Act, 1908 are not confined to parents &mdash; because of their inability through poverty to pay the compensation arising from acts of their miscreant children. In effect, that is, to use a clapped out expression which nevertheless is worth employing here, &ldquo;something of an appalling vista&rdquo;.  I urge the Minister to think again about the extent to which he wants this system to apply.  I have no difficulty if the procedure goes as far as the examination order, where the court looks into the means of the accused.  I have no difficulty if the court then makes a further instalment order demanding payment, but I have a fundamental objection to the concept that having looked at the means of the accused and establishing his or her inability to pay the court, nevertheless make an instalment order an ultimately, perhaps, asked to make a commital order.</P>
    <P>This is wrong in principle and I ask the Minister to accept as an addendum to his own amendment my proposition in amendment No. 14 (a) which is not an alternative but a way of de-limiting the operation of the new provision of subsection (8) which allows us to use the device of the civil debt process but not to the point where someone is put in custody simply because he is too poor and not able to pay at the time he is being examined. I hope this is acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to note that the Minister is establishing the principle that I expounded, and that is that there are some civil law principles in this Criminal Damage Bill.  The Minister should remember this when he talks to <Col N="545" /> the Attorney General about my last amendment.  I agree with a good deal of what Deputy McCartan said but I disagree with him on this point because section 9 (7) gives an opportunity to a convicted person to go back to court to have the compensation order amended, so the fears expressed by Deputy McCartan in relation to compensation orders will not be realised if this subsection &mdash; and my amendment would also cover it &mdash; operate properly.  People who have a genuine case can go back to the court and say that they cannot afford to pay at present.</P>
      <P>The law should be more flexible.  We should not send people to prison because they have not paid the compensation within the 12 months period.  In the light of the change of circumstances the judge should be able to extend the period of payment or suspend it for six months and then reintroduce it.  The more flexible we are the fewer problems will be created. That is why I have argued all day that it is in the interest of the legislation to give the courts a measure of flexibility so that they can deal with individual cases as they arise.  Most of the amendments that I have tabled set out to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a pointless exercise to commit someone to prison for the non-payment of a fine or the instalment of the compensation order.  However, that is not to say that they should walk away scot-free.  The old thinking is that the only way to punish people is to impose a fine or put them in prison and that is creeping into this legislation.  It is like a bad habit that we cannot get rid of.  We are now making provision for compensation orders but we are afraid to go the whole way.  It is a new idea and we seem to be very cautious.  The concept of a community service order is all right and in some cases the order works out well.  I have made the point before on radio, but unfortunately the Minister was not present to discuss our prison policy.  For the life of me, I cannot see the point of sending a person to prison for a minor offence when he is taking up a place that should be occupied by a hardened criminal.  We have to release somebody <Col N="546" /> who is in prison for a serious offence so that we can make room for a person who has failed to pay his fine.  He will stay only a fortnight or three weeks and then he is let go to make room for somebody else.  It just does not make sense.  As Deputy McCartan said, it cost us in excess of £3,500 to keep the person in prison.  The fine still has not been repaid and in this case the victim of crime will not get the compensation.  The taxpayer however, is being asked to pay £3,500 to keep him in prison.  That is not to say that when someone who is convicted of an offence says after the court has decided to impose a fine that he or she will not pay that person they should walk and have nothing happen.  However, we can say that if that person will not pay the money then he or she will still have to contribute something back to society and that he or she will have to carry out specific duties within the community, be it under service order or something else.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are thinking in terms of either a fine or imprisonment &mdash; that runs through all our legislation.  If one looks at our legislation it is all either &ldquo;and&rdquo; or &ldquo;and/or&rdquo; imprisonment.  I believe that we have a mental block when we are talking about fines in particular or compensation orders and we cannot realise that in this day and age we should be telling people that if they do not pay fines then they will not walk free but will contribute something to society as distinct from costing the taxpayer money.</P>
    <P>If people do not adhere to a compensation order &mdash; given all other provisions contained in the Bill that permit them to go back to court and have it reduced and all the rest of it &mdash; they should not be put into prison because that would defeat the whole purpose of what we are trying to achieve.  Instead, we should make certain that there is some other punishment, that they would have to do community service or make some other kind of contribution back to society, which is a real penalty.  We would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill if a court were to impose a compensation order, it is not met and as a result of that a person went to prison.  What would <Col N="547" /> happen to the person who has been in prison in addition to having to pay a compensation order?  Would he or she have to go back to prison a second time for the same offence?  That just does not add up.</P>
    <P>I am saying here again that it is a time for new thinking.  We should not be thinking only about prisons and fines.  We should be thinking that the taxpayer cannot afford that measure, that we have only 2,000 places in our prisons and we have 7,000 people going through them, that there is no point in letting hardened prisoners out of prison so that some fellow can go into prison for not paying a fine when he will come out two weeks later.  To me such thinking is just an incredible waste of time.  However, I also recognise that if a court has made a decision then the person convicted cannot walk away scot free if the fine imposed is not paid or if the compensation order is not met.  Here in this amendment we should change whatever has to be changed in order to provide that in lieu of imprisonment the court would be able to say that if a fine was not paid then the convicted person should carry out, for example, six months of community service doing specific duties. We should start thinking that way and we should change the law to give that flexibility rather than putting such people into prison.  It is quite absurd and ridiculous, as Deputy McCartan says, particularly in relation to a civil offence, that when a fine is imposed but is not paid the taxpayer should fund somebody to go to prison for two or three weeks. That is not a punishment at all.  That person should be made to pay.</P>
    <P>I come back to what I was talking about earlier, where does it really hurt?  It is when we hit the pocket; that is when people stop committing crime.  The 1990 Garda report contains one startling illustration that proves a point.  It reports that £36 million worth of goods were stolen in 1990 while £3 million worth were recovered. That means that crime pays.  There is £33 million worth of people's goods out there somewhere.  Putting the people <Col N="548" /> who commit those crimes into prison will not stop theft; in addition to prison, confiscation of assets derived from crime may stop it.  Likewise in relation to malicious damage: compensation in lieu of imprisonment may stop it.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that the Minister should accept the principle of what Deputy McCartan is saying.  He is right; putting people into prison will not solve the problem.  However, I should go a little further than what Deputy McCartan is saying.  I would say not to put those people in prison but to let them do something else such as community service work.  But they should not be allowed to walk free without doing anything.  It is time that we wised up to the situation and, again to make this very good legislation, made the other changes necessary to follow it through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should be very careful not to confuse compensation with fines, they are two completely different concepts.  A person is fined for a particular offence such as having an untaxed car or no insurance.  That is a punishment. Compensation is giving a person back what was his or hers.  We must not ever confuse the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree completely with Deputy McCartan when he says that there are people who, unable to pay fines because of financial reasons, have to be gathered under the civil law by a certain date and taken down to prison and that that is wrong in certain instances.  I have seen that myself.  That is where the Minister can step in, if he is satisfied that a person is genuine.  One old man of 60 years who came to me had nothing, but he had endeavoured to pay a fine.  The man was a silent partner in his son's business and, unfortunately, his son had knocked down someone while he was driving a bus that was insured but not taxed.  The man, as a director of the company, was also fined. He just did not have the money, he was on welfare.  He came to me, worried about being taken off, and said that all he wanted was to be allowed to go home each day.  I assured that man that there was no way he would be taken to prison. <Col N="549" /> He was a very genuine case.  We must not confuse compensation.  Compensation must be levied only relative to people's income.</P>
    <P>I do recognise that when a judge levies compensation against someone that will not be deducted from the source of that person's income.  I am suddenly becoming aware of that issue.  Will this compensation be levied in the same way that a fine is imposed?  Will people have to pay up so much a month or else?  If the compensation is to be levied in that way then it will not work.  In my view it would have to be deducted from source.  If a person is employed then the employer would have to be directed by the court that a certain amount each month or whatever has to be paid in.  In the case of a person being in receipt of welfare then the Department of Social Welfare should be notified that a certain percentage of that person's benefit is to be deduced. Collection of the compensation would not work in any other way and the situation would be very confused.  When the Minister comes to deal with the problem I should like him to develop on that point. If the collection of compensation is to be carried out in the same way that fines are collected then some of the gurriers I am thinking about and their families will in no way be paying on a regular basis. There is no doubt about that in my mind. In relation to this legislation the people about whom I am thinking in the main are the vandals, the people who are guilty of malicious damage.  Deputy McCartan quoted the 1987 figures of £3,500 per person.  That is a standing charge anyway, I should have thought, whatever the figure is today &mdash; for example, the staff still have to be paid.  I should have thought that the cost to the State would be for food.  Prisons probably have their own laundries &mdash; I do not know whether or not the prisons here have laundries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They do have them.  In essence, then, the prisoners would be working in the laundries so that would not be an overhead cost as such, it would <Col N="550" /> be provided anyway.  The laundries are there, the beds are there, the prison officers are there and so are many other cost factors already there.  If the prisons were empty it would still cost the taxpayer more or less the same amount, with the exception of food.  That could give a misleading image of the cost to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>It has been spelt out that any compensation ordered by a judge to be paid is being given the same recognition as a civil court measure, if my understanding is correct.  When the Minister has a chance to reply I should like him to spell out the way in which compensation will be deducted, whether it will be deducted from source or payable in the same way as a fine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment our spokesperson on Education, Deputy Jim Higgins, on the amount of work and research he undertook in order to introduce this Bill.  Its introduction affords us a great opportunity to debate this far-reaching subject of education here and its future.  Members have responded enthusiastically by their presence and contributions.  It is noticeable that opportunities to speak have been fully taken up with Members having to share their time in order to do so, in itself an indication of Members' desire to have a say on educational matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was somewhat disappointed with the Minister's response on the evening on which the Bill was introduced. I was more disappointed and concerned at the manner in which she contributed rather than the content of her response. Perhaps she had many other things on <Col N="551" /> her mind.  She said she was very glad to have been in the House to talk about education.  Yet she did not want to talk about this Bill.  She said there was no need for this Bill, that the House should not worry; she would produce a Green Paper, later a White Paper and, later still, an Education Bill no matter how long it would take; those were her words.  Since a Green Paper was promised by the summer of 1991, a White Paper by the end of this year and the Bill shortly afterwards, it is extraordinary that there has been a Fine Gael Bill introduced without having seen any Green Paper, White Paper or Government Bill.  Why is the Minister so annoyed with Deputy Jim Higgins and the Fine Gael Party in our attempt to assist her by producing this Bill and opening a debate in the House on it?  For example, why did the Minister not say that this Bill was a start and that we should all sit down together and henceforth work to produce a final document for the improvement of our educational system, which all contributors to this debate so far have acknowledged is in need of a certain amount of overhaul?</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago at the commencement of this debate, at the end of her contribution, the Minister dismissed this Bill with a wave of her hand, predicting that it would be defeated on Second Stage, thus ending the debate.  Would it not have been much better had the Bill been allowed its Second Reading, allowed to progress to Committee Stage when all requisite amendments could be introduced, when the Minister would have had her input?  Two weeks ago the Minister was safe in the knowledge of the support of her party and the Progressive Democrats in being successful at having the Bill defeated on its Second Reading. In the light of events since I hope she is as confident of that outcome this evening.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister will delay the introduction of her Bill as long as possible lest any of its proposed provisions would entail cost.  Since the revised Programme for Government was reached by the two Coalition parties I observe that there have been instructions <Col N="552" /> given to all Government Departments to cut out all unnecessary expenditure.  That means that the capital programme for education will also get the chop.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Education on 22 October 1991 asking her when work would commence on the building of the new school at St. Joseph's, Snipe Avenue, Galway.  I had this extraordinary reply:</P>
    <P>Tenders for the proposed new school for St. Joseph's, Snipe Avenue, Galway, have been received in my Department and are being examined. This examination will be completed at the earliest possible date when the question of the placing of the contract will arise for consideration in the context of the available capital.  I am not in a position, at this stage, to say when building works will commence.</P>
    <P>That is the same school promised in Galway by the Minister and her Minister of State &mdash; whom I welcome in the Chamber this evening &mdash; before the last general election.  It was subsequently delayed somewhat and reannounced before the local elections, constituting the second bite of the cherry.  In the meantime the 90 pupils in that school are being taught in leaking prefabricated buildings.  I am asking the Minister and Minister of State to state clearly to the parents, teachers and children when work will commence on this school.  I raise this matter because of my responsibility for children with mental and physical handicap and special educational facilities.  In that regard I am glad Deputy Jim Higgins has seen fit to include section 17 (c) which deals with that aspect of education and says:</P>
    <P>(c) the recognition and maintenance of schools for the mentally and physically handicapped and the training of specialist teachers for employment in such schools;</P>
    <P>Thereby recognising that the Minister is responsible for the care of the mentally and physically handicapped and for special education.  I believe there is a crisis in the service for people with mental <Col N="553" /> handicap, in that school places are impossible to obtain, some schools having no such service, and where there are such services, they are enormously under-funded.  The Department of Education should be responsible for funding and maintaining the mentally handicapped services and their special educational facilities.  Such provision is included in this Bill.  Equally it should form part of any Bill to be introduced by the Minister at a later date.</P>
    <P>There is too much buck-passing at present between Government Departments. For example, when one contacts the Department of Education inquiring about services for mentally handicapped pupils in schools one is told that it is the responsibility of the relevant health board; when one contacts the health board one is told it is the responsibility of the Department of Health; when one contacts the Department of Health one is told it is the responsibility of the Department of Education and, when one contacts the Department of Education, one is told it is the responsibility of the Department of Health.  There was a classic example of this buck-passing in my parish in Renmore.  A special class for nine handicapped children was initiated in Scoil Catríona, Renmore, as a result of a special class in Merlin Park having been closed at the end of the last school term.  Yet on the first day of that class no child-care assistant was provided as had been provided for those children previously in Merlin Park.</P>
    <P>When I inquired of the health board I was told I should contact the Department of Health; when I contacted the Department of Health I was told to contact the Department of Education; when I contacted the Department of Education I was sent back to the Department of Health.  Eventually I tabled a motion at Western Health Board level when I was told the health board had no legal responsibility in the manner, that it was a matter for the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Subsequently I tabled a parliamentary question when I was told, and the Minister of State was quoted in the local papers as saying, that this was a matter <Col N="554" /> for the Department of Health.  Let somebody be responsible for children's special classes.  Eventually the problem was solved by the provision of a once-off £10,000 grant for one year from the national lottery.  It should not be a matter for the national lottery whether children with special needs have child care assistants and the necessary back-up.  Rather it is a matter which should be legislated for in an Education Bill.  Equally it should be a matter for which one Department, the Department of Education, is responsible.</P>
    <P>Where it is proposed to integrate children with special needs into an ordinary school it is essential that the necessary child care assistants and proper back-up service be provided.  If not, children would be better catered for in special schools.  Parents should be very wary of integration proposals in circumstances in which written agreements on child care assistants and back-up services are not provided.  In any Education Bill the children with special needs should be provided for and the Department of Education only should be responsible for that.  In addition, each area should be provided with a special school, each class having a qualified teacher and trained assistants with a ratio of 1:10, one teacher to every ten pupils.  In the case of pupils with multiple handicap such as autistic/deaf with a mental handicap the ratio should be 1:5, one teacher to every 5 pupils, in that extremely structured supervision is essential in such cases.</P>

      <P>I could take the unusual step of complimenting Deputy Higgins on bringing forward this Bill and on the time and effort involved in doing so, but at a time when the Minister has committed herself to the publication of a Green Paper this Bill seems to represent political stroke pulling.  There must be criticism of this Fine Gael Bill.  The TUI who are involved in the Vocational Education Committees have regretted that there was no consultation before the Bill's publication.  The purpose of a Green Paper is to consult with all sectors. I am disappointed that Fine Gael did not consult those involved in the teaching profession, not that they are the sole authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I respect the effort put into drafting the Bill, it does not recognise the tremendous improvements which have been made by the Minister for Education. I particularly compliment the Minister on the introduction of a child psychology service on a pilot basis in Clondalkin and south Tipperary.  This has been widely welcomed by all child psychologists. The most important person in the educational system is the child and the need for child psychology services is growing.  It is frightening that so many young children are disturbed.  The pilot schemes will be monitored by the Department and by the psychology services. <Col N="556" /> Twenty-eight thousand young people will be assessed.  The Minister has also created 325 new teaching posts to reduce class sizes in primary schools this year.</P>

I cannot understand why Fine Gael did not wait to make their input to the Green Paper.  This Bill is scrappy and provides no real security for the child.  I do not see any emphasis on the child except in regard to discipline.  I hope when the Green Paper is published that all the vested interests, parents, teachers, the Department and others, will give priority to the child to be educated rather than to education itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That, no doubt, will be an educative process also.  The Green Paper will form the basis for initial debate <Col N="557" /> before the framing of a Bill.  In that context it is regrettable that this Bill is before the House.  It does not contain any definite statement of aims and objectives.  I respectfully suggest that one of the major flaws of our system to date has been that very lack of general statement of philosophy setting out what we want our system to achieve.  That should be the first priority.  One of the first things a lecturer endeavours to implant in the minds of H.Dip. students is the need for a comprehensive statement of aims and objectives underpinning our education system, which has evolved over a period. My view is that it is a very good and satisfactory system which has served the country well.</P>
      <P>One further limitation is that the Bill seeks to contralise power to a greater extent in the Department of Education. The view of educational theorists is that we should be democratising education and devolving more powers to local communities and boards of management.  The Bill lays down a series of regulations and administrative mechanisms which would continue the overbearing centralised involvement of the Department of Education in every-day school processes. That is one of the negative features of it.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the forthcoming Green Paper will be towards the democratisation of our educational system and the devolution of more powers to local communities and schools.  We can see the extraordinary results achieved by schools which have been given powers on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  These powers can relate to matters such as curriculum development, the recruitment of teachers and the development of greater liaison between homes and schools and local industries and schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give two examples of schools to illustrate the dynamism which can be injected into the education system by the devolution of powers to local communities and schools.  The first is Scoil Stiofáin Naofa in Cork city which is under the control of the vocational education committee.  This school introduced tremendous radical curriculum changes in the VPT and VTOS schemes, without <Col N="558" /> any prompting from the Department of Education.  This initiative started within the school.  In addition to recruiting teachers with BAs, H.Dips and B.Comms, they also recruited personnel from industry and the community who have a particular interest in certain subjects. They have developed courses under the VPT scheme in horticulture, stage craft and design, sound technology, modern dance and other subjects which were not catered for previously.  Courses in modern dance and how to manage a band would have been anathema to the school system ten or 15 years ago.  The curriculum in that school has been developed to a tremendous extent.  That illustrates my point that if schools are given more power and greater freedom they will achieve extraordinary results.</P>
    <P>The other school which has been to the forefront of curriculum development is the School of Commerce in Cork.  They have developed courses in languages and tourism.  Pupils at the school learn how to develop tourist products in Cork city in order to attract more visitors to the area.  That places extra demands on the teachers who are recruited.  Some of the teachers may not have the recognised teacher qualifications.  These schools have demonstrated that the more power schools have the better the results for pupils and teachers.  Curriculum development is not only of benefit to pupils; it is also of considerable benefit to teachers. It can rejuvinate teachers who feel burnt out or have become staid as a result of teaching the same curriculum for the past 25 years.  The Bill proposes to give power to the Minister to introduce regulations and mechanisms which would unnecessarily centralise the system.</P>
    <P>One appalling error made in the preparation of the Bill was the complete lack of consultation with teacher unions, parents, the teaching profession and other interested bodies.  The Minister in her speech demonstrated at length the complete lack of consultation in the preparation of the Bill.  It appears Fine Gael wanted to get a Bill on the agenda before the Green Paper was published.  It should be stressed that consultation with the <Col N="559" /> teacher unions and parents representative bodies is a prerequisite for change in the education system.</P>
    <P>There has been great growth in recent years in the input of parents into the education system.  I respectfully suggest that education will be the most potent item on the political agenda over the next ten years.  More and more parents are becoming involved in the education process. Parental involvement at pre-school, primary and secondary levels has increased beyond recognition over the past number of years.  We know this from the representations we receive from parents about what is happening in classrooms.  Gone are the days when such matters were left to the principal or schoolmaster and nobody else.  It is vitally important that parent representative bodies are consulted on the preparation of any education Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of a curriculum review board.  There is no reference to the achievement of the Primary Curriculum Review Body or the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Those bodies achieved a great deal since they were established.  It seems to be a terrible slight on them to think that they can be dismissed with the wave of a hand and a new curriculum review body established.  Those bodies have done outstanding work and have been to the forefront in the preparation of the new junior certificate syllabus, which has been welcomed by all sides to the House and by most people involved in education.</P>

      <P>Politics should become part of the educational process.  It is an issue which has been poorly treated in the curriculum over the past 20-30 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Fianna Fáil Party would dominate that subject.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper will have to concentrate on three areas of the curriculum. The first is the area of communication skills.  There should be greater linkage between the education system and industry. I am amazed that there has never been an oral English examination.  One of the most fundamental skills we can give young people is the skill of communication. This is of benefit to young people in all walks of life.  Communication is vital in the tourism industry, for example, for receptionists who answer telephone queries and tour guides.  We have concentrated to much on the written language as opposed to the spoken language.  An oral examination in English should be an integral part of the leaving certificate and junior certificate courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for greater liaison between schools and local industry. Industrialists and shopowners should be asked to outline to pupils the skills necessary to work in their places of employment. There has been a lack of linkage between schools and industry in this area. I accept that there is now greater liaison <Col N="561" /> between vocational education committee colleges and industry and that there are representatives of industry on the boards of management of schools. However, this process needs to be accelerated so that there will be increased linkage between schools and industry. The facts show that those who come out of our educational system with qualifications actually gain secure employment and sustainable and skilled jobs, those who leave school early do not and have a very poor chance of securing long term sustainable skilled jobs.  That is one of the great dilemmas facing us in our education system and facing the whole question of how we go about solving our unemployment problem.  The development of education cannot be separated from resolving the unemployment problems. We will have a chance by means of the Green Paper and the new education Bill to move towards that end by targeting specifically in a comprehensive way two areas &mdash; the area of the early school leaver of 14 or 15 years who finds it difficult to get into labour market.  We need targeted initiatives to increase the number of remedial teachers, or special integrated initiatives to examine and identify the problem areas.  Where we have an excessive number of people leaving school at an early age we must endeavour to find out the reason and put matters right.  That should become part of the new Green Paper and the new Education Bill.  This is vital if we are to come to grips with the long term problems of our unemployment situation at present.</P>
    <P>Another area which should come under focus and does not under this Bill is the whole question of extending the period of one's involvement in education. In a European context, and indeed in a world context, young people leave our schools much too early.  People can complete their leaving certificate at 17 or 18 years of age.  I suggest we extend the school period until students are 19 or 20 years of age.  For example, the Confederation of Irish Industry proposed some time ago that the school leaving age be increased to at least 19 years of age. <Col N="562" /> To an extent that is happening in an <i>ad hoc</i> way <i>via</i> the VTP process, but I think we should do it in a more programmed and determined way with the post-leaving certificate course which would enhance the skills of those students in a very specific and vocational way &mdash; in other words, that it would target them for particular employment areas.  That is happening in certain vocational education committee colleges but it is not happening in a uniform way.  It should become part of national policy.</P>
    <P>First, there are too many people coming on to the labour market who do not have the necessary skills and who therefore are finding it very difficult to obtain employment.  We have also a major problem in our system where a huge number of pupils are coming onto the labour market at the same time and that is creating shortages.  We are exposing too many young people &mdash; I say this quite bluntly &mdash; to the experience of the dole queue far too early and it is a waste of resources.  The resources would be far better ploughed in to extending the school system and, if necessary, paying to these students a sum equivalent to what they would receive on the dole.  We may not be in a position to do that, but I reckon it would be far better for people to improve their skills rather than go through the experience of the dole queue in the first two years immediately following the leaving certificate.  It is terrible for many young people that the first experience they have following their leaving certificate is to go on to the dole queue.  It does not help the morale and it does not help their own self-esteem. That is an area that needs to be examined closely.</P>
    <P>I turn to the extension of the lifespan of our school period.  In Germany and in most other European countries they come out of school at a much later stage.  We need to increase the number of third level places.  The present Minister for Education has had an outstanding record in increasing third level places both in the RTCs and in the universities. I know that has happened in relation to UCC and in relation to Cork RTC where <Col N="563" /> there has been an increase in third level places.  From a demographic point of view the number of people in second level education will begin to fall in the next couple of years and onwards.  It is clear therefore that the percentage of those leaving school who will want to go on to third level will increase.  The bulge in five or ten years' time will be in the third level sector.  It is important that we plan ahead for that expected bulge because more people want to get into education and more and more people want to get into adult education.</P>
    <P>The success of the VTOS scheme has been an outstanding revelation.  It illustrates the fact that people who left school at an early age are very anxious to return to education, to pursue formal education and to sit the leaving certificate and so on and go on to secure third level skills.</P>

      <P>The whole question of the control of teachers, disciplining of teachers and so on is touched on in this Bill.  We are dealing with a very difficult and sensitive area here.  Before we go down the road to creating a framework which would have as its objective the control of teachers &mdash; almost giving the Minister and the Department the right to hire and fire teachers &mdash; we should consult with the teaching profession. Undoubtedly there must be some degree of public accountability in relation to how teachers perform.  It is very difficult to establish a yardstick by which to measure performance in the educational system. This is not something that can be decided easily.  There are a whole range of circumstances which can determine how a teacher performs in a particular classroom, in a particular school, or in a particular location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to set down in an Education Bill a national uniform system.  Is it to be done by exam results or by discipline?  The issue of discipline is not a problem in certain areas in certain <Col N="564" /> schools but, because of other circumstances it can be an enormous problem in other schools.  Is it the teacher's fault or is it caused by the circumstances under which teachers work?  Who determines which?  These are points about which we will have to be very careful. Historically, there was a time when teachers were judged by exam performance. They were judged on the basis of how many As or Bs their students received: that was an appalling system and exacerbated the rat race that our points system has brought into this country. That is something we would not want to return to and I would be very anxious that we avoid that process.</P>
    <P>The matter of disadvantaged teachers will come into focus in the Green Paper. I should like to say that our Minister for Education has taken very important measures to combat disadvantaged situations in our school system.  Funding for the special assistance scheme for schools in disadvantaged areas has increased by 300 per cent since 1987; that is in the context of the severe budgetary constraints which were imposed upon the Government from 1987 onwards.  Within the past three years 325 additional teachers have been authorised for primary schools in disadvantaged areas and for remedial education.  A pilot school psychological service for primary schools has been included in the west Tallaght-Clondalkin area.  I would urge the Minister to extend that scheme because it is needed in a number of areas throughout the country.  In the present year 325 teaching posts were authorised in order to reduce class sizes in primary schools. At post primary level some 120 schools have each been provided with the services of an extra teacher to assist in the aspects of disadvantage within those schools, and to reduce the pupil teacher ratio in post primary schools a further 420 teaching posts were sanctioned this year.  At present there are some 1,000 teachers approved for post primary schools outside the normal quota provisions to meet particular curricular remedial and other needs.</P>
    <P>To sum up; a Cheann Comhairle, it is <Col N="565" /> widely acknowledged through editorials, through all commentators on the educational system, that the Minister for Education has made magnificent strides in the development of our educational system: at primary level by eradicating many of the deficient school buildings; at second level by extending the cycle to six years, and at third level by bringing the four honours rule back to two honours for grant purposes and also by extending third level places.  Above all, it should be remembered that in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the educational achievements this year were based on negotiations with the social partners &mdash; in other words, our education policy formed part of the Government's overall coherent programme in relation to both the economy and to the vital areas of health and education. This Government have taken a philosophical stand in that we are committed to Irish education and committed to the development of the system.  We recognise that the development of our economy and the growth of employment is inextricably bound up with the development of our education system. They cannot be separated and we cannot proceed without dealing with both.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> clearly indicated that a Green Paper on Education would be issued in the summer of 1991, that it would afford an opportunity to all parties to offer their views on this issue and that following consideration of the various views a White Paper would be issued in 1992.  We still have not got the Green Paper.  That we are discussing this Bill here tonight is an indictment of the Government for not adhering to their commitment and timescale in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It indicates a lack of commitment <Col N="566" /> to a Green Paper.  The delay on the part of Government has afforded Fine Gael an opportunity to introduce this Bill. While complimenting Deputy Higgins on the Bill, despite the lack of resources generally, it would be more appropriate to have a broad discussion on all aspects of education before an education Bill is passed.  Following the 1988 Bill in Great Britain, on which there was no consultation, there were disastrous effects.</P>
      <P>In the context of discussing this Bill and in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper we must recognise that Irish primary school class sizes are the largest in Europe.  The majority of children are in classes of 30 plus and in many cases the classes contain from 36 to 38 children. In many cases teachers are involved in crowd control rather than in teaching children and weaker children who need individual attention are not being adequately catered for.  It is a disgrace. Many schools are without the service of a remedial teacher.  Many of our European neighbours have reduced class sizes to a fraction of what we have.  In some of our schools class sizes are greater than those in Third World countries.  In the context of 1993, is this the way to plan for our children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill refers to social deprivation among the pupils or potential pupils of the schools.  Children from disadvantaged circumstances benefit less from primary education than do the children of better off families and the disadvantage is compounded rather than alleviated by the years in primary school. Because of the nature of home life many disadvantaged children are unable to avail of the opportunities provided by education.  They are lacking in their ability to cope with life, they do not have jobs, they lack self-awareness, confidence and so on.  Many leave the system with poorly developed literacy and oral skills.  They suffer from bad diet and a negative attitude to school and education generally.  This attitude is fostered in many of these areas by poorly paid work when available and by unemployment.  In contrast children from comfortable backgrounds are encouraged at home and <Col N="567" /> they can see the link between educational progress and financial reward.  Extra tuition is made available and is paid for in homes where there is a positive attitude to school so as to ensure success and a place in university.  Children from such a background make the most of the educational system.</P>
    <P>What can we do about this deplorable situation?  A programme of positive discrimination is called for.  We should have lower pupil/teacher ratios in disadvantaged areas and home/school liaison personnel should be employed.  I acknowledge that schools in disadvantaged areas were provided with £1 million extra last year.  This does not deal with the situation.  In the context of this Bill and the Green Paper we must deal with the problem once and for all.</P>
    <P>Education is constantly growing and developing.  New ideas and methods are being explored and defined.  Technology has changed communications.  Computers and language laboratories are accepted as part of the furniture in any modern school or university; yet there are teachers who have been working in schools for perhaps 20 or 30 years who have not had a chance to avail of in-service training to bring themselves up to date with modern trends and developments. Most in-service courses have been organised and indeed paid for by teachers and they have been pursued during spare time or during holidays.</P>
    <P>Even the smallest of industrial enterprises set aside part of their budgets to train and retrain their workers.  Many of the larger companies use either cash or promotion incentives to encourage the workforce towards self-advancement and development.  Major banks and large companies contribute towards the further education of their workers; yet teachers are expected to meet the changing times, cope with new demands and work with a changing curriculum without the benefits of a properly structured and financed in-service training scheme.  It is not that the facilities do not exist.  Many of the training colleges are working at half steam.  They have the personnel and the <Col N="568" /> expertise to organise courses.  The facilities should be used to bring teachers up to date.  Any profession that does not develop in a properly planned way becomes static.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the aspect of the Bill dealing with the utilisation of school buildings for community or other purposes during non school hours.  Community workers and community organisations right across the country have a major problem in getting facilities while schools are lying empty.  When one considers the cost of putting the infrastructure in place, with many buildings costing up to £1 million, these under-utilised buildings should be used.  Why should these buildings lie idle while many youth and community organisations are crying out for facilities?  The youth service is an extension of education, and in this regard I compliment the youth services throughout the country.  There are perhaps 40,000 voluntary youth workers providing an extension of education for the people who need it.  In many cases they are not getting the back-up for finance required.  They are prepared to give their time and in many cases the only thing they need is a meeting room.  The Minister should come up with policy guidelines to be implemented right across the board to facilitate these organisations. To that end the Government as a matter of urgency should address their minds to the cost of public liability insurance for voluntary youth and community organisations.  The boards of management of some schools have facilitated these organisations but there are many boards of management who are not prepared to facilitate community groups. They need encouragement and incentive from the Government to provide those facilities.</P>
    <P>On the provision of new schools throughout the country, there is some shortfall in the Department.  One section of the Department of Education do not know what another are doing.  The figures do not add up.  Communities are demanding new schools.  There is over-crowding. Children are being educated in prefabricated classrooms.  Then, after six or <Col N="569" /> seven years when a school comes on stream it is full up.  There must be closer liaison between the various sections of the Department to ensure that we have proper planning and development in our areas.</P>
    <P>The question of enrolment in our schools is addressed in the Bill.  Most of our schools are grant-aided for the buildings and the teachers.  It is an utter scandal that certain private schools here are creaming off the best of the talent in various communities.  If they are availing of grants and assistance they should realise that they are part of a wider community. I am talking of areas where there are different types of schools, such as vocational schools, community colleges, private schools, convent schools, etc. Many of those realise the role they must play in the community.  Unfortunately there are some people in schools out there who think they have the divine right to go out and cream off the best at the expense of some of the other schools. That is not the way to do things.  I have been made aware of schools that have encouraged prospective pupils to go to other schools because they said, their school was not the school for them.  The Department will have to have a more positive outlook in relation to this.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the education system is the lack of teachers to fill in when teachers are absent.  I would like to congratulate the <i>Irish Press</i> on highlighting the anomaly that exists at the moment.  I fully support the concept of paying properly trained teachers to cover the absence of other teachers through sickness, marriage, Department approved courses, etc.  This is needed because the current situation is totally unacceptable where there could be over 40 pupils in one classroom.  A panel should be organised on an area basis that could be contacted by principals needing a teacher for a day, a week or whatever. Any day there was no call for teachers on the panel they could be made available in disadvantaged areas or they could do remedial work in other schools in the area.  In my own area of north county Dublin there are many schools that have <Col N="570" /> not yet got remedial teachers and these could be facilitated through this mechanism of setting up a panel.  This proposal warrants consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are to be complimented on this Bill.  However, we feel the proper way to deal with this is to have a Green Paper discussed by everyone involved in education, and that means everyone in this country and then, at the end of the day, we will have a new Bill that will do justice to our children and our children to come.</P>

      <P>I support this major legislative initiative presented by my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins.  It is most peculiar that we have the most important work of all being carried out in this country by dedicated teachers and parents, namely the education of our children, without any worthwhile legislative base. In other words, there is little accountability for the education of our young people to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>One of the most reforming Ministers for Education was Mrs. Gemma Hussey who sought to put greater emphasis on providing a curriculum that allowed for the full development of the individual through all facets of life.  She established a Curriculum Examinations Board and because of Fianna Fáil's petulance and pettiness this work was abandoned and replaced somewhat later by something similar.  This political stop-go planning approach is not in the best interests of our young people.</P>
      <P>In recent times we have learned of proposals in relation to the implementation of the junior certificate and the primary education review without any debate in Dáil Éireann.  This lack of statutory framework is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always been led to believe that Irish educational standards are high. This has been a great source of pride to our country and indeed has given the <Col N="571" /> opportunity for many of our emigrants to gain access to valuable employment because of their particularly high educational standards.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill ensures that we have ongoing evaluation and monitoring of our educational system.  It clearly sets out the functions of the Minister for Education. Part 4 and Part 5 of this section speak about comparative information and the degree of achievement realised in our schools.  It is important that this comparative information in relation to different schools is broad ranging to include all subjects, the background of pupils, the resources of the school, etc. Otherwise it could be misinterpreted and the comparative information could lead to the labelling of schools as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; schools.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the primary school system evaluates pupil performance particularly relating to literacy.  I regret that there are still pupils learning the educational system who are not capable of basic literacy.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with co-operation between primary and post-primary schools and it sets down minimum standards to be attained in each school.</P>
    <P>Many of the teachers in the &ldquo;special&rdquo; area have to travel from one school to another at the moment.  Indeed, many of the specialist teachers who teach dancing, drama and music work outside school hours, which is not acceptable.  It is essential that all children are able to avail of specialist subjects within school hours.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that there is not a comprehensive scheme of in-service training courses for teachers.  In view of the great psychological and physical pressures on teachers to meet the curriculum demands at the moment it is important that an opportunity be given for re-training. Presently, in-service courses are totally underfunded and inadequate and not convenient for all teachers.</P>
    <P>I have never witnessed as much pressure and tension on teachers as there is today because of the lack of guidelines in relation to codes of conduct for pupils.  It is time that the Minister got off the fence <Col N="572" /> in relation to this matter and gave teachers a chance to teach pupils properly without harassment in some cases from pupils and more often from parents.  In fact, the situation is so serious today that a compulsory career break of one year in every ten years should be given to primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I wish to support the establishment of a school psychological service in view of the many social problems in society.  It is important that we continue to cater for the socially disadvantaged in each community through our education system.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 6 I think that the teaching staff of each school should draw up a school plan taking submissions from the parents' association into account which should then be put before the board of management for discussion and approval.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the qualification of staff.  In my opinion there are adequate mechanisms for teacher qualifications in the system already &mdash; but they could be improved.  We should establish under subsection (3) what constitutes an acceptable standard of performance or teacher efficiency.  Before termination of employment could take place teachers' mental and physical health should be taken into account.  Therefore, leave of absence accompanied by mandatory health care should be offered to the teacher in question for a period of one year.  A detailed procedure for terminating a teacher's employment should be worked out between the Department of Education and the teachers' unions and laid down in an Act.  This should also apply in reverting a principal to a non-principal post.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 (2) I believe that all activities of the parents' association should have prior approval of the board of management similar to school staff.</P>
    <P>Another matter that needs elaboration is the cost and procedure of building, maintaining and equipping a school.  The present procedure is ridiculous and not cost effective.  As public representatives, we are aware of the long delays in building schools which often means some <Col N="573" /> empty classrooms two or three years later because of a drop in the population.  This is a scandalous waste of taxpayers resources and it should not be allowed to happen.  In my own constituency.  Mooncoin vocational school, Johnstown vocational school, Ballyhale vocational school, St. Johns infant primary school and Clogh primary school have needed essential facilities for many years and have been the subject of planning reviews for far too long.  They urgently need new buildings.</P>
    <P>The Government can be accused in the most factual terms of having no plan for education and being very scant on planning every aspect of every activity in education. Inspectors are locked out and have no resources to inspect.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>An area that is largely forgotten in our education system is adult education.  We are living in an era when very few people will retain the one job during their lifetime. It is essential that the education system is able to respond to the retraining of these people and that planning and development for this upsurge in educational activity is given priority.  This is a practical way in which our education system can adapt to the world of work.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to commend, once again, Deputy Higgins for introducing this Bill.  In so doing he is proving once again that Fine Gael are committed to reform in all aspects of social and economic life to meet the challenges of the 21st century, and that actions speak louder than words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me and hope in the short time available to me to address a number of issues in relation to this Bill. First, I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, for bringing this Bill forward and for the time, effort and research he has put into it.  This proves, once again, that Fine Gael can produce worthwhile and far-seeing Bills which should be taken seriously in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed the Minister for Education could not accept the thrust of the Bill despite indications that many <Col N="574" /> aspects would be included in her own Green Paper.  This of course is the Green Paper which has been promised since 1987 and which has been put forward on many occasions as the answer to everything. I am afraid the patience of the pupils, teachers and parents is wearing thin at this time.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the debate during the past few days I note that many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken seemed to be more concerned with praising the Minister for Education than addressing the issues dealt with in the Bill.  I wonder if they are looking to the future and how many of them are trying to slot themselves into suitable positions in case there is a change of leadership.  It would have been far better if they had spent their time addressing the real issues in education.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond briefly to a number of the points made by two Deputies who spoke tonight.  Deputy Noel Davern spoke about the schools psychological service.  I welcome the fact that two pilot studies are being carried out in two parts of the country.  However it is important that the role of the schools psychological service should not be as he indicated, to find &ldquo;disturbed children&rdquo; but to help those pupils who have been identified by teachers and parents as weak to achieve their full potential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin made a worthwhile contribution and I would agree with many of the points he made but it was rather ironic that he spoke about the importance of parental involvement and the need to have parents on school boards as only a few short months ago a Bill which had been brought forward by Fine Gael and which would have made it mandatory to reserve places for parents on vocational education committees was voted down by him and his party.  He is being cynical in talking about that matter today.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill states that the Minister shall provide primary and post primary education to all persons of school age who enrol at primary and post-primary schools.  That section is extremely important to me at present.  An excellent <Col N="575" /> primary school in my constituency with enough pupils for an extra teacher were told when they applied to the Department of Education for an extra teacher that because some of the pupils were in what they called a repeat sixth or seventh class they were not validly enrolled and as such did not count or did not exist.  I note that it was somebody in the finance section of the Department of Education who decided that.  Those pupils were assessed on financial considerations and no consideration was given to the fact that the parents, the teachers and the principal had decided for educational reasons that these pupils would be far better off spending an extra year in primary school before going on to secondary school.  It is most disappointing that the Minister stands over this situation, particularly when it is in her own constituency.</P>
    <P>That constituency is not unique as I believe this is a problem facing a number of schools across the country.  I hope it will be addressed very quickly.  Surely parents have the right to decide what schools their children should go to and how long they should spend there.  That should be a prerequisite in introducing rules in relation to education.</P>
    <P>The second aspect I would like to address is the question of in-service training for teachers.  In the primary sector many teachers qualify at the age of 20 or 21 and could spend the next 40 to 42 years teaching two or three different classes in the same classroom.  Those teachers do not get the opportunity to update their skills, to become aware of new trends in education or new developments and to help themselves to do the job better. There is a crying need for a comprehensive in-service training scheme for our primary teachers.</P>
    <P>The Department will no doubt tell us that they run a number of courses around the country and that these are not fully utilised but I should point out to the House that most of those courses are conducted in July after the teachers have completed the school year.  They spend from September to July looking after their pupils and by the time July comes <Col N="576" /> they are drained.  They are then asked by the Department if they want to go on a course but if they do they have to go in their own time and at their own expense. To be fair to the teachers, many of them do go and spend a few very worthwhile weeks there.  Six to eight weeks then remain of their holidays but, low and behold, when September comes they probably have forgotten everything they have learned and what the purpose of the course was.  I propose to the Department that each teacher be given the opportunity to go on an in-service training course every five years which should take place at the beginning of September and, if necessary, the school should be closed. The service we give to our children must be improved and if this means closing the school to give the teachers that opportunity, so be it.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment Deputy Higgins for the work he has put into the preparation of the Bill.  It is nice to see the Fine Gael Party accord a high priority to education in introducing this debate.  However I feel they could have used this time in a much more effective and efficient way because it is clear the Bill was drafted in a hurry and without consultation with teacher organisations and other interested parties.  It is clear that the Bill is going in all directions, it does not have a focus or philosophy and lacks vision.  It is unfortunate that the amount of work the Deputy has put into it has been largely a waste of time because there is not much more in the Bill apart from statements such as: &ldquo;The Minister will make regulations ... build new schools, provide transport&rdquo;, do this, that and the other.  It is unfortunate that it does not deal with a number of specific areas regarding which it would have been very useful to have some interesting new policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>I see my good friend Deputy Deenihan here.  It would have been an ideal opportunity for Fine Gael to introduce some of the things about which he has been talking, including the need for physical education, in schools.</P>

      <P>This is the place to mention it.  The Bill lacks cohesion with Fine Gael policy because, very recently, the Leader of the party indicated that the cornerstone of their policy in Government will be the control of public expenditure.

      <P>In areas such as the provision of school transport it was an ideal opportunity for the party to have given us innovative ideas in relation to it.  However, merely to talk about the provision of school transport is hardly an adequate response to a need to improve the system.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that in section 17 there is no mention of special education. Earlier, Deputy McCormack, the new spokesman on special education for the handicapped, should have realised it was an ideal opportunity for him to give us an idea of his policy on special education. Alas, he took the opportunity to prove that he is a good parish pump politician by referring in most of his speech to issues in west Galway.  He should have referred to his policy for the development of special education at national level.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy, for instance, agree with the policy of integration of children with physical and mental handicaps where they can be assimilated in the normal primary school provided there are adequate resources? What is his feeling about the existence of special schools?  What is his feeling about the need for a change for children with severe physical handicap to be taken out of health establishments in which they are at present and sent to normal schools? This would have been an ideal opportunity for Fine Gael to declare their support of the new integration policy for children with handicaps to be treated normally as far as possible.  I hope the Deputy will now spell out his support for these initiatives which are taking place on a pilot basis for the first time.  They are very expensive but they are a novel part of the present education development programme.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, made much progress in education over the last number of years.  The debate on education is welcome but the time could have been more usefully spent by Deputy Higgins in perhaps outlining the way in which our education system challenges the present set-up and looks forward to the future.  The proposals he puts forward should have a vision and philosophy, make education look forward and respond to the demands of our young people.  Unfortunately, he did not do so, he merely outlined a list of promises. I recommend to the House that we should vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to thank everybody who participated in this debate.  I am happy that the Bill has afforded Members from all sides of the House an opportunity to voice their opinions on the <Col N="579" /> various issues current in first and second level education and the challenges facing them in the future.</P>
      <P>Although I explained quite clearly when bringing the Bill before the House that it was largely a developmental Bill, the majority of Members on the Government side of the House chose to ignore it.  Indeed, they made it quite obvious that they had not even read the Bill by talking in many cases about third level education and third level grants, a very meritorious concept but one not envisaged in this Bill.  It is flattering that 15 Members participated in the debate, again showing the high interest area that education is.</P>
      <P>In outlining the Bill during my introduction I emphasised that what Fine Gael are doing in this measure is putting in place a legislative framework to end once and for all the <i>ad hoc</i> system that has been the unique feature of first and second level education, to pull together all the directives and myriad circular letters that have issued from the Minister's office, to legislate for all the happenings, great and small, that have occurred over the years and to do it by way of a single Bill for first and second level education which will have a legislative scaffolding which will facilitate change for the future. I believe that this Bill does this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to thank Deputy John Bruton for identifying in 1989 the fundamental weakness in our first and second level education framework of having no legislative base.  His announcement in 1989 that Fine Gael would publish an education Bill gave rise to the debate on the need for such a Bill.  The initial reaction of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, was typical of her closed, closeted reflex action to any move coming from any quarters other than her own. She responded first by scorning the idea &mdash; there was no need for an education Bill, she said.  Having discovered that the idea was popular, that the public were interested and that a great public debate was about to take place she then discovered that she, as Minister for Education, was about to be left behind and <Col N="580" /> relegated to the role of a dumb spectator on the educational sidelines.  The Minister, therefore, did a complete U-turn and announced that she would publish an education Bill but not before the convoluted process of first publishing a Green Paper &mdash; a discussion document &mdash; then a White Paper with the Government's proposals and, finally, an education Bill.  The Green Paper was to be published in May of this year &mdash; it did not appear.  It was to come in September &mdash; it still did not arrive.  It was to emerge in October, October has come and gone and we are now told, courtesy of the Mark 2 cobbled arrangement between the Coalition partners that we will see it sometime before the end of this year. Three deadlines have already been broken and we are only talking at this stage about a Green Paper, a discussion document.  This from a Minister who has been in office for four and a half years with many civil servants and back-up at her disposal.  I do not have any doubt but that the Green Paper will eventually arrive, it will be a discussion document into which all the various interested parties will have an input.  I hope it will be thought-provoking but we can certainly rest assured that it will be accompanied by the usual fanfare.</P>
    <P>I am sure that there will be lots of discussion as a result, lots of questions asked, lots of PR but no answers given, the idea being to stoke the educational embers, get the debate running and their leaving some other Minister perhaps the hapless Minister Flynn, to pick up the political baby.  I do not have any doubt that whatever about seeing a White Paper which will be the Government's clear ideas on where education is going we certainly will never see under any Fianna Fáil Minister or Government an education Bill.  I make that as a firm prediction because I believe that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, never intended to introduce an education Bill.  Her sole interest is a high profile allin general free-for-all discussion paper by way of a Green Paper.  This Minister, indeed any Fianna Fáil Minister for Education, would run a mile at the prospect <Col N="581" /> of putting firm legislative proposals before this House.  I will be the first to recant if I am proven wrong in my predictions.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Education was eventually converted to the idea of a Green Paper, White Paper and an education Bill, she launched the process of a press conference with a universal invitation to everybody involved in education, teachers, teachers' unions, parents, parents' associations, and so on to make their input.  She wanted a frank, open and honest debate where people would feel uninhibited, where there would be freedom of expression, dialogue and ideas of every shape, sort and description would be advanced and encouraged.</P>
    <P>Yet in the debate three weeks ago on this Bill I heard an ingracious, dog-in-the manger attitude advanced by the Minister. It was quite clear, and it is a constantly recurring theme in every Fianna Fáil contribution on the Bill &mdash; nobody from the Progressive Democrats contributed &mdash; that the Minister essentially is peeved at the fact that Fine Gael have taken two quantum leaps forward and produced not a Green Paper, not a White Paper but a Bill that can be stood over.</P>
    <P>The Minister described the Bill as &ldquo;arid, bureaucratic and arrogant&rdquo;.  What an apt description of the Minister's own performance.  She faults the Bill on the basis that it was drafted without consultation. I can tell the Minister, the Minister of State and every altar boy from the Fianna Fáil side who regurgitated the same theme, that there was quite an amount of consultation, not at official level with the unions or the parents' associations but at semi-official level with individuals in each sphere of education, primary, vocational, secondary, community and comprehensive as well as with parents.  I have gauged the temperature correctly.</P>
    <P>These remarks from a Minister who has spent most of her time consulting and producing reports, reviews, studies and pilot projects, are very ill-founded and ungracious.  The Minister selectively quoted the Teachers' Union of Ireland, <Col N="582" /> that they regretted &ldquo;that no consultations were held with teachers' unions before the publication&rdquo;.  What the Minister failed to allude to however was the very positive remarks by the president of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, Mr. Billy Fitzpatrick, on certain aspects of the Bill. Furthermore, not one of the other teacher unions came out against the Bill or criticised it.  I can assure the Minister, and the Minister of State, that there is general agreement that the Bill has many positive features that they would like to see enshrined in an education Bill, if this Minister ever gets around to publishing one.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to state that the Bill contained no philosophy of education. It is obvious that the Minister's track record in relation to legislation has been very sparse.  One does not state in bald terms in a Bill what one's philosophy is.  One produces a Bill which has a set of measures, the philosophy of which is quite obvious from the content, thrust and direction of the Bill.  That is what we have done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, loves philosophy, vague talk, nebulous aspirations, every kind of verbal conundrum, so that the observer or interested party looking from the outside can selectively take about a half dozen interpretations from anything she says.  Again, I am saying that Deputy O'Rourke's education Bill will never see the light of day.  I get the impression that the Minister did not read the Bill because, apart from her cursory dismissal of it in her speech, she spent most of her time vaunting her track record in education over the past four-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>The Minister, presides over the largest primary school class units in Europe &mdash; 600-plus classes have more than 40 pupils, the vast bulk of them in this city, 11,000 primary school classes have more than 30 pupils; two-thirds of the primary schools have no access to remedial teachers even though between 10 per cent and 12 per cent of the pupils in all schools need remedial teaching.  There is a hopeless lack of career counselling in any of the smaller schools; there is no school <Col N="583" /> psychological service apart from two small pilot projects, alluded to by Deputy Davern, one in Tipperary South and one in Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of free education has literally gone out the window, with parents having to dig deep into their pockets to fund materials for arts and crafts apart altogether from the basics such as toilet paper, soap and other requisites. Yet the Minister not alone poured her bottle of biliousness over the Bill but she actually instructed her compliant train-bearers and acolytes, Deputies, Kitt, Wallace, O'Donoghue and Michael Ahern to come in with the one recurring theme that Fine Gael were queue-jumping, were being opportunistic and were cutting across the Minister's forthcoming Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputy Browne of Wexford, and Deputy Martin the only Government Deputies who showed any spark of independent thought.  However, I question Deputy Browne's analysis that it is top-down Bill.  In fact, it is the very opposite.  It is a bottom-up approach, starting with boards of management, having local structures known as local education co-operation councils and at the same time retaining the 1930 vocational education scheme which is the very essence of democracy.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with him in the need to target resources for the mentally handicapped.  Indeed section 5 (2) (j) provides for additional resources.  It can be described as a very fulsome Bill in relation to special cases &mdash; I am talking about the handicapped, both mentally and physically, the emotionally disturbed, the disabled and travellers.  As I said when introducing the Bill, equality of education provision is not equality of educational opportunity.  It is clear that where there is social and educational deprivation, poor and impoverished people who cannot benefit from the average education system, we must discriminate positively in favour of such groups if we are to fulfil the requirement of treating all children equally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt said I plucked ideas from <Col N="584" /> the Minister and from her Bill which will be published shortly.  The Deputy could not be further from the truth.  First, we do not know what the Minister's ideas are other than a few selected kite-flying leaps.  Deputy Kitt went on to state &mdash; this again was a recurring theme from the other side of the House &mdash; that the curriculum review board I proposed was a slight on the NCCA.  It is not a slight but a compliment.  I am proposing to enshrine it in this Bill while at the same time giving greater parental involvement and adding the very valuable input of FÁS.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputy Brian O'Shea for his positive comments, although the Deputy spend most of his time addressing third level issues which are not appropriate to the Bill.  I wish to say a word of thanks to Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla for his very fulsome and generous comments on the Bill.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, it puts in place solid legislative structures. Deputy Mac Giolla also expressed the hope that as the Minister had welshed on the Green Paper, at least this would provide a spur and a stimulus to her to come off the fence.  Of course, that will be the case.  The Minister would do much better in the general education debate if she showed a little more generosity, graciousness and openness in her contribution.</P>
    <P>In the Bill we have something on paper which will prove very valuable to the education debate.  Deputy Mac Giolla rightly questioned the Minister's remarks about the disadvantaged.  He asked, whose fault is it that they are disadvantaged? Who has presided over educational disadvantage, over spiralling unemployment and the loss of jobs on an accelerated basis?  Deputy Mac Giolla described the Minister as the worst Minister for Education in the history of the State but an excellent public performer. Deputy Mac Giolla sought clarification in relation to the Vocational Education Committee Act and I assure him that the Bill does not trammel or trespass on it because as I have said before it accommodates on a parallel line the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> In his very fine contribution, my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, again pointed out that all of the actions of the Minister for Education up to now have been <i>ultra vires</i>.  Every single circular letter and directive she has issued has absolutely no legislative basis whatever.  What I am doing in this Bill is putting in place once and for all a legislative scaffolding which enshrines everything that has happened so far and takes the education system up to the present day, yet is flexible enough to allow for much needed changes in the future.</P>
    <P>This is a fine comprehensive Bill and I believe the Minister will regret the derisory fashion in which she treated it three weeks ago.  This Bill introduces accountability and provides that an annual report be sent to the Dáil.  If we had such an annual report we would never have had the Carysfort scandal.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a greater role for parents as the true and first educators; <Col N="586" /> positive discrimination for the disadvantaged; retraining of teachers; regular curriculum review; the rotation of school principalships; codes of conduct and a strengthened role for the inspectorate; comparison with other EC countries and, last but not least, school-based assessment.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have always been a policydriven party.  It is a party with a dream and an ideal of where this country should be going.  This Education Bill enshrines this in terms of our view of education for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to address this issue.  It is a very straightforward matter.  On 30 October last I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice to ask him whether the former Garda house at Taghmon in County Wexford was to be sold and, if so, to whom and if it had not been sold whether he would consider giving the house either by direct grant or by way of cheap sale, to the Taghmon Community Development Committee, who are extremely anxious to use the facility there for community purposes.  The Minister for Justice informed me by way of written answer on the day that the house was being sold by the Office of Public Works to the garda who was occupying it.  I have been in touch with the community group since then and they have informed me quite clearly that there is no garda in residence in that house and that in fact it has been many years since the house has been occupied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  There was a considerable community campaign throughout those years to have a full-time garda in residence in Taghmon.  Unfortunately it has not proved possible in recent times to bring about that desirable position.</P>
      <P>It is now surprising that the house is to be sold, I understand, to a retiring garda who does not live in the village of Taghmon but who would like to retire there. This is a prime property in the middle of the village.  There are numerous social problems in the village of Taghmon that should be addressed.  The community development committee there are anxious to have a premises in which to carry out this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> I must inform the Minister for Justice that there is considerable public anxiety about this sale.  The purpose of my raising the issue this evening was to ask the Minister to reconsider the position, not to proceed with the sale as envisaged by the Office of Public Works, to allow this important public facility be put to the use and benefit of the community and the community development organisation which is a very progressive force in the village of Taghmon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Deputy decided to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening I requested that the Garda authorities be contacted again to confirm the information I had already given in the reply.</P>
      <P>I now understand that the garda to whom the house is being sold was assigned the house in February, 1990 and moved into it in July 1990.  He moved out after a month or so because of its bad condition.  However, having been assigned the house by the Garda Personnel Branch he remains the official tenant of the house and it is being sold to him on that basis.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme for the sale of garda houses, which were agreed with the Garda representative associations, houses selected for sale were offered, in, the first instance, to the gardaí to whom they were assigned.  In some cases, as in Taghmon, the garda concerned was not actually living in the house officially assigned to him at the time, in this instance, because of its bad condition, but this was allowed for under the terms of the scheme.  Vacant houses, that is to say, houses that were not assigned to a particular member of the force, were to be sold on the open market by tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain to Deputy Howlin the background to the decision to sell off a number of houses.  Because of the poor condition of many of them it would have cost a substantial amount of money, money which is not available in the present economic circumstances, to restore them to habitable condition. Even then, there would be no guarantee <Col N="590" /> that members of the force could be found to live in them.  On the other hand, given the context of the amount of money being realised by the sale of these houses, the Government, were able to maintain a high level of expenditure on the Garda building programme.  For example, expenditure on the Garda building programme in 1991 will be over £5 million with new stations being opened at Anglesea Street in Cork, Bandon, Carlow, Balbriggan, Mulrany and Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This case concerns a young man of 24 who, in 1989, was given a three-year prison sentence for firearms offences.  He is due for release on 23 April next.  On two recent occasions he has applied for a temporary release to attend an interview at the FÁS Training Centre in Loughlinstown, County Dublin.  On both occasions he has been refused, the most recent having been on 30 October 1991.</P>
      <P>I and other public representatives in the constituency have been making representations both to the prison authorities and to the Minister for Justice concerning his case.  Today I received a reply from the Minister of State at the Department which states:</P>
      <P>He would require temporary release to attend FÁS interview and, if successful, to participate in the relevant course.  While the Minister has taken into consideration your representations and the view of the presiding judge in his trial, he is not prepared to authorise any form of tempory release for this offender at this stage of his sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that has to be said in this case is that this man has been a very good prisoner.  While on bail he was required to report regularly to a Garda station, which he did, and held a responsible job during his period on bail.  He was a good prisoner in Portlaoise.  Subsequently he was transferred to Wheatfield Prison <Col N="591" /> where he had a good record and he is now in the training centre.  The judge who presided over his case and sentenced him, wrote on 3 October last, that he had written to the Governor of Wheatfield Prison asking him to consider the granting of temporary release.</P>
    <P>What this man is seeking is very simple. He has lost almost three years of his freedom.  He has written to me expressing his contrition for the offence and wants to rebuild his life.  He wants to make a fresh start by participating in a FÁS training course.  FÁS are prepared to interview him.  They invited him to attend for interview on 30 October which interview, I understand, was to be of a general nature.  Therefore, the question of consequential release to participate in the FÁS course probably would not arise immediately since it would appear from the reply of the Minister of State that there is some concern that, if he was granted release to attend for interview there would then be an immediate request for release to participate in the course.  Therefore it might well be some time before he could be placed on a course, when the question of release would arise.</P>
    <P>The principal issue involved here is that of rehabilitation.  Time and time again we hear of cases of people who have served prison sentences ending up going back into prison.  This is a case of a prisoner who has learned his lesson, who wants to make a fresh start in life, who wants to participate in a FÁS training course in order to assist him in so doing.  As part of the rehabilitation process I should have thought that that request would have been facilitated and welcomed.</P>
    <P>I note in the reply of the Minister of State there is a reference to the case being kept under review.  That has been the case for quite some time.  Perhaps the Minister would now give some firm assurance that, when this man applies to participate in a FÁS training course again, or is again invited to attend for interview, his case will be looked at sympathetically <Col N="592" /> and he will be granted the temporary release he has requested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to by Deputy Gilmore was committed to prison on 23 January, 1990 to serve a sentence of three years imprisonment imposed on him at the Special Criminal Court following his conviction on firearms charges.  He is due for release, with remission, on 23 April 1992, as Deputy Gilmore said.  He has applied for permission to attend for interview for a FÁS training course with a view to following a course in business-related studies.  He will require temporary release initially to attend for interview and, if successful, to participate in the course.</P>
      <P>Each application for temporary release is considered on its merits.  Regard is had to the circumstances giving rise to the application.  Factors such as the nature of the offence, length of sentence served, behaviour while in custody, previous record and possible risk which release might pose to the community.  Having regard to all of the circumstances of this case I am not prepared to grant temporary release to this person at this stage of his sentence.  An application for temporary release at a later stage of his sentence would be considered on its merits.  I invite him to make that application some time after Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of July 1991 Deirdre Brosnan, an 11-year old girl from Glenamaddy, County Galway, and her parents, were told to go home from Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, on the absolute understanding that they would be contacted by the hospital authorities a few days later with a view to getting special laser treatment organised for her in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The girl previously underwent an operation to remove a tumour from her spine. <Col N="593" /> However, the medical opinion in Beaumont was that she should have laser treatment. Her parents were informed that this would have to take place in the United Kingdom.  The House will appreciate the trauma this family were going through.</P>
    <P>Deirdre made good progress after the initial operation but seemed to be deteriorating during the early part of this past summer. When she was in Beaumont both her parents and her sister, who gave up her job to look after her, were constantly at her bedside.  The family are very small farmers and live in a council house recently provided by Galway County Council.  The thought of having to send their daughter to a hospital in the United Kingdom was quite a shock as this family considered Dublin to be a long distance, never mind the United Kingdom.  However, they decided that their daughter's health was of paramount importance and they got their bags packed the next morning.</P>
    <P>The call did not come.  August passed as did September and still no word from Beaumont.  This was not the fault of the Brosnan family.  They spent a great deal of money they did not have on phone calls to the hospital but never got a real answer.  They enlisted the help of no less than three medics, including a consultant, some of whom spent endless hours on the phone to Beaumont Hospital to try to find out what was happening.</P>
    <P>The month of October came and the Brosnan family were literally out of their minds.  Their precious daughter was deteriorating in front of their eyes and seemingly nobody could help.  The family in desperation asked me to do what I could.  I immediatley rang the office of the Minister for Health and I must say his staff were very accommodating.  A few days later the hospital did make contact with the family.  Deirdre Brosnan was admitted to Beaumont the following week and she is now in hospital in Nottingham in England.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his intervention and I thank the media, both local <Col N="594" /> and national, who carried the story but many questions needed answering.  How could any health service be so uncaring? Who was responsible for this inhuman act?  Will any action be taken against the people who caused so much hardship to this family?  Will the ten weeks delay have a profound effect on Deirdre Brosnan's health?  Will the Minister investigate the matter in the context of ensuring that this is never allowed to happen to another family?</P>
    <P>There is a final aspect to this tragic story.  It became apparent a few weeks ago that this laser treatment was available at the Mater Private in Dublin.  However, because the Brosnans were medical card holders it was deemed by the hospital and the health board that Deirdre would have to go to Nottingham.  Surely in the circumstances something could have been done to have the operation carried out in Dublin, considering the sad exprience the Brosnans were put through.</P>
    <P>There is something terribly wrong in regard to this case.  I sincerely hope that the treatment the child is receiving has not come too late.  I should appreciate an answer from the Minister to the questions I have raised.</P>

      <P>Decisions about the management of a patient are not normally conveyed to the hospital authority as this is a confidential matter between the patient and the consultant, unless these issues were referred by the consultant or the family to the authority for their attention.  I have been informed that the hospital have not received any correspondence from the child's parents in relation to her attendance at clinics or decisions taken about the management of her medical condition.  That is a matter between the child and her consultant.  It was only as a result of queries from the media that the hospital became aware of the parents' concern.</P>

      <P>As regards the arrangements for the referral of this patient for treatment abroad, I have been informed that an application was made to the Western Health Board on 21 October 1991 for assistance towards the cost of medical treatment for this patient outside the State.  The Western Health Board contacted my Department on 23 October 1991 requesting approval to refer this <Col N="596" /> patient abroad for treatment.  Approval for this referral was provided by my Department within 24 hours and the board were advised accordingly on 24 October 1991.  I understand that the patient travelled to Nottingham for her operation on 29 October 1991.  This matter was dealt with in accordance with the required protocols and as expeditiously as possible, once the hospital management became aware of it.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware that Beaumont Hospital is the national centre for neurosurgical treatment in the State. It is the policy of the Beaumont Hospital board that where a consultant surgeon judges that he does not have the expertise to deal with a particular patient he will discuss the matter with his consultant neurosurgical colleagues in order to determine if the required expertise is available within the hospital.  It has always been the policy of the hospital that, if the required expertise is not available, the patient may be referred abroad for treatment.  This decision is a clinical matter for the consultants concerned and it is not a matter in which I have any involvement, other than approving the cost of sending the patient abroad.  We never refuse once the necessary protocols are observed, namely that the treatment is not available in this country and secondly that the treatment is necessary and will offer the patient some hope of improvement.  I hope the child will do very well as a result of her operation in Nottingham.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 November 1991.</P>

      <P>I have received a number of representations from and on behalf of fishermens' associations in relation to the decline of salmon stocks in the rivers Barrow, Nore and Suir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply, I wish to inform the Deputy <Col N="424" /> that the decline of salmon stocks is worldwide and has been reported from Canada, Scotland, Norway and Iceland. To date no conclusive evidence has been put forward to identify the exact cause of this decline.  Within the State, despite increased protection at sea and greatly increased anti-pollution measures, salmon catches generally have declined.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware of the situation that exists in the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and particularly in relation to the Barrow, Nore and Suir.  I am informed that the salmon run into these rivers has been unusually bad throughout the last three seasons.  I would like to inform the Deputy that the Southern Regional Fisheries Board are doing everything in their power to monitor the situation and patrol the region.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of requests for meetings from different interests in the region including the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.  Officials of my Department earlier today met a deputation comprising representatives of the Southern Salmon and Trout Anglers Association and the River Suir Snap Net Fishermens' Association.  The deputation handed in a petition on the decline of salmon stocks in the southern region.  They also asked that I meet the Southern Regional Fisheries Board at an early date for a discussion on salmon conservation issues and arrangements are being made for this.</P>

      <P>The aim of shipping policy is to ensure as far as possible that Ireland's trade routes and needs are catered for efficiently and on an economic and competitive basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key focus in this regard must be on other EC countries which account for 70 <Col N="425" /> per cent of our trade.  With the introduction of the single market that figure will rise.  As a result our trade with third countries will diminish in relative terms. The pressing need therefore is for shipping services which provide fast and reliable access to the main European markets where demand for our produce is highest.</P>
    <P>This is why the Government have proposed in a detailed submission to the EC Commission that Community Support Framework funding be provided to assist investment in unitised capacity in both the lift on/lift off and roll on/roll off modes.  The proposed investment over the next two to three years of over £100 million would provide additional capacity for an extra 500,000 containers to be transported to and from Ireland annually.</P>
    <P>In this regard I see no need at present for and have no proposals to establish, a deep sea shipping company.  This could not be justified in present economic and financial circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main elements of the agreement between the European Community and the EFTA states, in so far as fisheries are concerned, are as follows: there will be full free access to EFTA markets &mdash; with some exceptions for Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and Liechtenstein &mdash; for EC fish with effect from 1 January 1993; and there will be full free access to EC markets for some EFTA whitefish products with effect from 1 January 1993 and progressive duty reductions from 1 January 1993 to 1 January 1997 for other EFTA whitefish products, bringing the level of duties on these products down to 70 per cent of the present duty levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> No tariff concessions have been made to EFTA for salmon, herring, mackerel, Norway lobster, coquilles St Jacques, shrimps and prawns, fish oils/fats and animal feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>By way of compensation for increased market access for whitefish granted to EFTA countries, the EC will receive an additional quota of cod in Norwegian waters, increasing progressively from 6,000 tonnes in 1993 to 11,000 tonnes in 1997.  The internal EC distribution of these resources will be on the basis of cohesion criteria.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, in overall terms, the agreement constitutes a most satisfactory outcome to what were particularly difficult negotiations.  Vital Community markets for Ireland's three most important fishery exports &mdash; salmon, herring and mackerel, where there are serious on-going market difficulties &mdash; have been protected.  On the other hand, access concessions granted to certain EFTA whitefish products should not impact significantly upon our exports of those products, given the already acute shortages of whitefish on the Community market, but there undoubtedly will be increased competition in certain segments of the processing sector.  My Department will be discussing with the industry how best to prepare for this.</P>
    <P>In looking at the fisheries sector in the Community, it must all the time be borne in mind that the Community is a substantial net importer of fish and that, as already mentioned, there are serious shortages in the whitefish sector for most species, due to falling stocks and growth in market demand.</P>
    <P>Ireland is, of course, among the few countries in the Community which is a net exporter of fish and our interests in this regard are quite different from most other member states.  Our objective in the EFTA negotiations was to secure as much continued protection as possible for as long as possible against the wider Community objective of opening up the whole Community market for all products as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> These negotiations were extremely difficult and I repeat that I am well satisfied that the best deal possible was achieved.</P>

      <P>Members of this House will recall that I have publicly expressed my concern at the tragic incident involving the Scottish fishing vessel, the <i>Antares,</i> in the Firth of Clyde on 22 November last in which four fishermen lost their lives.  Following the incident a number of inquiries into the tragedy were instituted by the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>The report of the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch, which is the authority responsible for the investigation of marine accidents, is expected in a few months.  The inquiry to which the Deputy refers was a fatal accident inquiry carried out under Scottish law.  I understand its report is the broad equivalent of the verdict of a coroner's court.  The report is being studied by officials of my Department and its recommendations will be followed up where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Following the <i>Antares</i> casualty the United Kingdom authorities began to broadcast information regarding dived submarine activity in the Firth of Clyde area and more recently in the wider Clyde exercise area.  This information is available on VHF radio to all Irish seafarers using VHF receivers.  My Department have recently issued a marine notice alerting Irish seafarers to this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are very seriously concerned about the dangers submarines pose to shipping.  We avail of every opportunity to raise this topic in international fora such as the United Nations <Col N="428" /> and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).  The matter was raised by Ireland at the 59th Session of the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee held earlier this year in London and is being raised again at the IMO Assembly this week. At that meeting my Department's chief surveyor is again stressing the Irish Government's continuing concern at this problem.  He is inviting the assembly, the highest level of the IMO, to ask their Governments to make safety the priority in this area so as to avoid a major tragedy. The assembly will also be invited by Ireland to adopt a new resolution on the matter.  The purpose of the resolution is twofold; first, to ensure that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its fishing gear is available, will avoid that fishing vessel and any fishing gear connected to it; and second, to ensure that information on submarines exercising in an area where vessels are known to fish is brought to the attention of the fishing vessels concerned.</P>
    <P>On another front the secretary of my Department has at my direction been in contact with the fisheries administrations of the powers which it is believed may navigate in submarines in Irish fishing waters in an effort to emphasise the risks to fishery and other vessels and to enhance consultation between administrations. The countries concerned are the United Kingdom, France, the United States of America and the USSR.</P>

      <P>Since the service came into operation on 15 July 1991 the Sikorsky S61N has been called out on 48 rescue missions.  Many of these missions have been undertaken in atrocious weather conditions around the south, south-east and west coast.  Rescues include medium range, coastal, mountain, air ambulance and medevac. As well as the rescue missions the crew of the S61N have to carry out continuous <Col N="430" /> role training in order to maintain their SAR rating.</P>
      <P>I need not remind the House of the atrocious weather we had the weekend beginning 25 October last.  In relation to my Department and marine incidents around our coast, it was one of the busiest on record.  I would like to publicly express my deep appreciation to all who contributed in any way to carrying out so many successful missions during that particular weekend and, indeed, I should say, on all other occasions.  Their professionalism and dedication to duty deserve the highest praise.  Thankfully, no lives were lost.</P>

      <P>The amendments to section 294 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, concerning the appointment of individuals as private waterkeepers, contained in section 17 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, provide for the following: 1. applicants seeking appointment will be required to hold a certificate of suitability issued by the appropriate regional fisheries board; 2. appointments to be limited to a maximum of five years; 3. existing appointment to expire within five years of commencement of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991; and 4. the form of instrument (Prescribed Form) to be amended to take account of these provisions.</P>
      <P>I introduced this amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, on foot of representations which I received from an organisation representing angling clubs and from the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>The concern expressed by these groups was that under the 1959 Act persons could be appointed without any consultation with the fisheries boards.  This process could give rise to situations whereby unsuitable persons could be appointed as waterkeepers.  Such an appointment confers them with considerable powers and authority under the Fisheries Acts.  Furthermore there is no time limit on such appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputy on the total number of private waterkeepers and the number who have been found unsuitable is not available in my Department as such appointments were made up to now on application by the persons concerned to a District Justice <Col N="432" /> without reference to either the fisheries boards or my Department.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would stress that I support the concept of private waterkeepers and acknowledge that they play a valuable role in fisheries protection. The changes made in the recent legislation are designed to secure and enhance that role.</P>

      <P>A Community support framework &mdash; CSF &mdash; for fish processing and marketing in Ireland was agreed between the EC Commission and my Department earlier this year.  This CSF sets out priorities for the development of fish processing over the period 1991-93 and puts particular emphasis on the better utilisation of available raw materials especially in the pelagic sector.</P>
      <P>Under the CSF an operational programme was submitted to the EC Commission last July.  This provided for total investment of £6.7 million approximately in nine projects and envisages EC aid of over £3 million.  It is anticipated that the projects will provide 148 new jobs over the next two years.  Commission approval of this programme is expected over the next week or two.</P>
      <P>A second operational programme involving Community aid of well over £3 million is being prepared in respect of 1992.  While precise details are not yet available it is expected that this programme will contribute to significant job creation in the sector in 1992-93.</P>
      <P>It is estimated by BIM that in the fish processing sector to date this year 180 jobs were created and 115 jobs were lost.  Most of the new jobs have been generated in the whitefish processing and salmon smoking areas.  The bulk of the job losses can be attributed to difficulties experienced by a firm involved in herring processing which led to the loss in the short term of 80 jobs.</P>

      <P>Following initiatives by me at the Fisheries Council meeting earlier this year the EC Commission convened a group of experts from the five member states directly concerned including Ireland and Spain to discuss unauthorised fishing activity in Community waters and ways to combat it.  At this meeting a plan of action aimed at addressing the problem was agreed.  Under this plan the member states concerned and the Commission agreed to co-operate at operational level in monitoring the activities of unauthorised fishing boats.  I am confident that these measures represent a major step towards enabling the control authorities establish the real extent of the problem and will contribute towards finding solutions. The Spanish authorities have indicated their willingness to play a full part in this co-ordinated programme.</P>
      <P>The Commission is monitoring the situation closely and will take whatever additional steps it considers necessary in consultation with the member states concerned to increase the effectiveness of the new co-ordinated plan of action.</P>
      <P>At the domestic level, measures to detect illegal fishing generally have been stepped up over recent months.  The coming on stream last summer of the new Casa aircraft which is wholly devoted to sea fisheries surveillance had greatly enhanced the State's overall surveillance capability.  The Casa is deployed in supporting naval vessels in spotting and positioning suspect fishing vessels or fishing activity.  Detentions to date this year amount to 73 vessels of which 19 have taken place since September this year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the recent report of the Common Fishery Policy Review Group contained a number of recommendations, including that mentioned in the question, on possible approaches to improving the position of the Irish fishing industry in the context of the mid-term review of the CFP.</P>
      <P>I have endorsed the group's report, which reinforces very considerably the case that has been made to Brussels on behalf of our industry.  The report has, accordingly, been submitted to the EC Commission for consideration in the preparation of their report, which is due to be released by the end of December.</P>
      <P>As regards the particular recommendation mentioned, I should point out to the Deputy that the present arrangement whereby there is an exclusive coastal zone of six miles and restricted access within the 6-12 mile zone is by way of derogation from the general principle of equal access which underlines the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>It is, however, also an important objective of the CFP to protect the position of coastal communities especially dependent on fishing.  I will, therefore, be pressing the Commission to take a range of measures, including strengthening the exclusive zone concept, so as to ensure that the interests of the coastal communities concerned are fully safeguarded.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the report of the Commission is due to be made by the end of this year.  Every effort has been made, at all levels, to ensure that the Commission, in completing its report, is fully aware of Ireland's concerns.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Commercial netting has been part of the management of the Moy Fishery for well over a century and it is closely monitored by the staff of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to know that redd counts and checks on smolt production clearly show that the stock of salmon in the Moy is in a healthy state. Since my Department acquired the Moy Fishery a number of conservation measures has been introduced.  One of these conservation measures involves a longer close season for draft netting.  The season now opens on 1 May instead of mid-March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year a group was established in my Department to consider the future management/development of the <Col N="439" /> Moy Fishery and the system as a whole. The group comprises representatives of my Department, the Moy Fishery, the North Western Regional Fisheries Board and the Central Fisheries Board.  The group have been considering all aspects of the fishery, including the commercial fishery and while I do not wish to preempt the findings of this group I must point out that the question of ceasing the netting operation at the Moy Fishery is not a simple one and must be assessed in the context of (1) a scientific programme which would monitor the effects of increased escapement and determine the appropriate levels of escapement and (2) the drawing up and implementation of a development plan for the river as a whole involving all fishery owners.</P>
    <P>With regard to the catch by rod anglers on the River Moy I wish to say that catches in the Moy have held up well in recent years when one considers the general decline in salmon stocks nationally and internationally.  It can be seen from the statistics in respect of the number of salmon taken during 1991 by the commercial operation and rod and line at the Moy Fishery, which I supplied to Deputy Higgins in reply to a parliamentary question on 23 October 1991, that the commercial operation does not adversely affect the catch by rod and line.</P>

      <Quest>if he is in a position to outline if additional fishing licences will be granted in the near future; and whether the EC have been requested to provide Ireland with additional tonnage for fishing boats.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions the background to national sea fishing boat licensing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal feature of current licensing policy is that, with the exception of applications relating to vessels engaged in aquaculture or bivalve fishing, applicants <Col N="440" /> must demonstrate that they are in a position to withdraw an amount of active tonnage and horsepower from the register equivalent to the tonnage and horsepower of their new vessel.  In addition they must be able to meet other criteria covering, for example, areas such as the safety and seaworthiness of vessels, crew qualifications and the economic and social benefits accruing from their proposals.</P>
    <P>Applications which meet the requirements of current licensing policy are being processed on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>On 18 July last I announced a special scheme to accommodate the entry of about 20 specialised large all-weather whitefish boats into the fleet.  The purpose of this scheme is to exploit hitherto underutilised whitefish quotas off the west coast.  The principal feature of the scheme is that successful applicants will be able, should they so wish, to provide the required replacement on a phased basis over a five-year period.  Licences granted under the scheme will include restrictions in relation to the areas of operation and the species that can be fished.  The closing date initially set for applications under this scheme was 1 August 1991 but on foot of representations from the industry this was extended to 1 October last.</P>
    <P>Applications received are currently being considered by my Department. Additional information is required in most cases and this is at present being sought from the applicants, with a deadline of 25 November 1991.  As soon as this information is available and has been processed I would aim to take decisions very quickly on the granting of licences to the successful applicants.</P>
    <P>In the context of Ireland's submission to the Commission on the new multi-annual guidance programme for the fleet and discussions on next year's review of the Common Fisheries Policy, a strong and reasoned case for a significant relaxation of the present restrictions on Irish fleet capacity has been made.  In seeking further scope for development and a tangible recognition of the special needs of <Col N="441" /> our industry, we have sought Commission agreement to the addition of, at minimum, 5,000 tonnes to our fishing boat register.  Discussions with the Commission in this regard are ongoing and it may be some months yet before we know the outcome.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave the House on Thursday, 16 May on the subject of the staffing of the fishery boards.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the necessity to ensure that the regional fisheries boards are adequately staffed to enable them to fulfil their functions to protect, conserve and develop the important resource that is inland fisheries.</P>
      <P>In my reply of 16 May 1991 I pointed out that the staffing levels of all the fishery boards have fallen significantly in recent years due to general restrictions on recruitment.</P>
      <P>I have also previously stated, that it would, in present financial circumstances, be totally unrealistic to expect that there would be any general relaxation of these restrictions or any general increase in the staffing of the fishery boards.</P>
      <P>I would add that I am actively studying an assessment of the board's staffing which I instructed my Department to carry out with a view to filling a number of priority posts.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any problem with regard to the number of boathouses available to the regional boards and I am satisfied that the regional boards possess adequate and secure storage.</P>

This decline in stocks has not been confined to Ireland, however, but has been recorded in all countries where stocks of Atlantic salmon occur, including Scotland and Norway.</P>
      <P>My Department received two papers last week from the Central Fisheries Board which discuss possible future options for the management of Irish salmon stocks in general and those in the Munster Blackwater in particular in the light of the decline in salmon runs here.</P>

      <P>The two semi-State companies for which I am responsible, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Arramara Teoranta do not currently have a formal code of conduct as described by the Deputy.  In line, however, with Government policy that the highest standards of integrity should be followed in the public sector I decided to ask the chairmen in question to review existing systems and procedures directed towards this end in the State bodies for which I am directly responsible.  This work is proceeding at present and both BIM and Arramara Teoranta are drawing up codes of practice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Mr. Reynolds, reported to the Government recently that the secretary of his Department was preparing a report as a matter of urgency, on the principles which govern the relationship between Departments of State and State bodies under their aegis, together with subsidiary and associated companies of the bodies in question.</P>
      <P>The examination is designed to ensure that: the traditional standards of integrity and conduct which are appropriate to the public service are maintained, and the interests of the community and the State as owners of these bodies are taken fully into account in their operation.</P>

      <P>The document from which the Deputy is quoting was submitted to my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications earlier this year.  I have examined its contents and find that there is much merit in the proposals it contains. Regrettably the Deputy has chosen to take the particular quotation out of context. Were he to turn the page he would see under the heading &ldquo;Ships as Infrastructure&rdquo; the following:</P>
      <P>The CII Transport Council believes that investment in shipping is an integral part of the transport infrastructure linking Ireland with the rest of the Community in the same way that roads and railways are regarded between continental member states.  Substantial EC/national investment in roads and railways on the Continent is either in place or planned.  This case has already been made in principle and accepted by the EC Commission and by Government (see Appendix I).</P>
      <P>Were the Deputy then to consult the appendix as directed he would find the following quotation from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to developing Ireland's internal transport infrastructure and facilities, it is a key objective of Irish transport policy that enhanced sea and air access transport services be developed between Ireland and other European Community states.  Such services are an essential element of Irish competitiveness within the Community and these will help underpin the Government's development strategies, particularly in the industrial, tourism and international trading sectors of the economy ... In this context, the Government will continue to press the European Commission for <Col N="445" /> additional EC funding for the development of access transport services to and from Ireland in view of the unique competitive disadvantage we suffer because of our island status and peripherality.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of this objective, the Government made a detailed submission to the EC Commission in May of this year seeking funding for substantial additional capacity in both the roll on/roll off (RO/RO) and lift on/lift off (LO/LO) modes.</P>
    <P>In June and July, I met with the Commissioner for Transport Policy, Mr. Karel Van Miert, the Commissioner for Competition Policy, Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan and Mr. Bruce Millan, Commissioner for Regional Policy to press our case for Community support.  I am hopeful that when the facts of the situation have been examined, a positive response will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I should add that in drafting the submission the views of the CII and other relevant parties were taken fully into account.  I would also like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation for the efforts which the CII have made in their contacts with the Commission services to press Ireland's case for assistance.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will no doubt be pleased to know that the current Irish fleet stands at almost 195,000 deadweight tons.  This represents an increase of over 37 per cent since 1986.</P>
    <P>Amongst recent additions to the fleet the MV <i>Bell Pioneer</i> operating between Waterford and Rotterdam is an outstanding example of the type of vessel we need to ensure the speedy and reliable transport of our trade.  The construction of the vessel, a state of the art hatchless containership designed for fast turn around in port, and the first of its kind in the world, was grant-aided during 1990. As well as being fully automated and computerised, the vessel is highly energy efficient and environment friendly in its operation.  Its sister ship which is currently under construction has been awarded EC funding of £1.2 million under the THERMIE programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> The significant increase in fleet capacity has been aided by various Government incentives for expansion in the form of grant aid, BES investment and a five-fold reduction in the level of corporation tax payable by shipping companies.</P>

      <P>The present structure of inland fisheries administration comprises seven regional fisheries boards, the Central Fisheries Board and the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>The regional fisheries boards are independent statutory bodies with a large degree of autonomy in their day-to-day operations.</P>
      <P>It is one of the main tasks of the Central Fisheries Board to co-ordinate the activities of the regional fisheries boards on an on-going basis.  The central board are required statutorily to fulfil this role by the provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
      <P>As you are no doubt aware the complement of the Central Fisheries Board consist partly of the seven individual chairmen of the regional fisheries boards and the meetings of the central board act as a forum for the different regional board chairmen to discuss matters of mutual interest relating to inland fisheries.</P>
      <P>At an operational level the Central Fisheries Board direct and acts as adviser to the regional fisheries boards in relation to financial, personnel and technical matters. It is also the practice of the Central Fisheries Board chief officer to hold regular meetings of all the regional managers to discuss and decide upon matters of concern to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine have <Col N="447" /> overall responsibility for policy and financial matters relating to the fisheries boards and in this regard keeps in touch with developments at individual board level.</P>
    <P>The achievement of a satisfactory balance between local autonomy and effective co-ordination at national level within these or any structures is a matter which must be continuously pursued.  It is our aim to keep up the pressure to ensure that, whenever co-ordination or harmonization can usefully be undertaken, the existing structures effectively achieve such co-ordination.</P>

      <P>Ireland has agreed to take part in a pilot project to determine the suitability of using satellite navigation systems to establish the movements of fishing vessels. This pilot project is being undertaken by the Irish naval Service under the fisheries surveillance package which is overseen by my Department and was approved by the EC Commission to <Col N="449" /> enhance Irelands sea fisheries surveillance capability.</P>
      <P>A request seeking tenders for the supply of the necessary equipment for this pilot project was sent out to the market place.  Responses are currently under evaluation.  It is expected that equipment for test purposes will be in place in early 1992.  This will involve placing of receiving and transmitting equipment on board a limited number of selected fishing vessels for a limited period.  This scheme does not fall under the STRIDE programme.</P>

      <P>The following programmes have been developed in line with the development strategy:</P>
      <P>Fishing fleet: a programme for the modernisation and restructuring of the fishing fleet is being pursued within the framework of multi-annual programmes, for the period to end 1991 and 1992-96, to better match available fish stocks and to strengthen its long term viability;</P>
      <P>Exploratory fishing: Ireland is carrying out a major programme for exploratory fishing, availing fully of grants that are available from the EC Structural Fund;</P>
      <P>Aquaculture: A programme for the development and expansion of the aquaculture sector is being pursued within the framework of multi-annual programmes for the period to the end of 1991 and 1992-96, to increase production, improve competiveness and to create additional employment;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> Fish processing and marketing: A programme for the development of fish processing and marketing is being pursued within the terms of a European Community Support Framework; significant aid for the programme is envisaged with a view to supporting investment of up to £30 million over the period to end 1993;</P>
    <P>Facilities: A programme for the improvement of facilities &mdash; Auction halls/ice plants etc &mdash; at fishing ports): with assistance from the ERDF under Council Regulation 4028/86, is being pursued; investment of £7.5 million is planned over the period to end 1993;</P>
    <P>Hygiene and quality: A programme for the improvement of hygiene and quality generally is in place;</P>
    <P>Monitoring and surveillance: The programme for the monitoring and surveillance of fishing activities is being expanded, with substantial financial assistance from the EC;</P>
    <P>Manpower development: The manpower development programme for fishermen is being expanded, with financial assistance &mdash; in excess of £3.2 million over the period to end 1993 &mdash; from the ESF in the context of the Operational Programme for Rural Development.</P>
    <P>Research: A major programme for research is being carried out in line with the Community programmes: FAR &mdash; Fisheries and Aquaculture Research &mdash; MAST &mdash; Marine Science and Technology &mdash; and STRIDE &mdash; Science and Technology in Regional Innovation and Development.</P>
    <P>Expenditure and progress on each programme, under a series of indicators, particular to each programme, is being monitored by the Department of the Marine.

      <Quest>if he has studied the report of the chairman of the Irish Fisherman's Organisation, when he suggested at a fisheries seminar in Killybegs on 19 July 1991, that available tonnage be bought by member states of the EC to enable young bona fide fishermen and fisherwomen to get into the business and that future licences be given only to young bona fide people with the relevant qualifications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that this was a suggestion made by the chairman of the Irish Fisherman's Organisation in the course of his address to the fisheries seminar.</P>
      <P>With constraints on fleet capacity, and in this regard the European Commission has estimated that the level of access capacity may be as high as 40 per cent, severe financial difficulties face any person, young or old, who may wish to enter the fishing sector either through the purchase of an existing vessel, or through the introduction of a vessel not previously in the fleet.</P>
      <P>The use of incentives to give advantages to younger or more qualified people over older or less qualified persons to facilitate their entry to any sector is not a standard feature of most sectoral policies. The objective of structural policies must be to bring about market adjustment which will best promote the long term growth of any sector.</P>
      <P>Apart from the policy principles and objectives involved, there would also be serious practical difficulties in drawing fine lines between young and old, or qualified and less qualified and especially in giving due weight to experience which tends to be positively correlated with age.</P>
      <P>In addition, of course, the costs of any scheme would have to be considered and especially so if these were to be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> All these issues would have to be carefully assessed if a firm development proposal should be advanced by fishing industry organisations.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the situation in relation to the claiming of allowances for cohabiting couples as opposed to married couples; whether there is any difference between the two in terms of obtaining joint mortgage relief or in terms of any other personal allowances; and if so, if he will specify the differences and the circumstances that define non-marital situations.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the income tax treatment of married as against unmarried couples.  Tax treatment in this area reflects the general law relating to marriage.  A married couple is entitled to the married personal allowance, which is double that applicable to a single person, and to double the rate bands applicable to a single person, as well as to mortgage interest relief up to a maximum of £3,200 per annum.  With the exception of the PAYE and PRSI allowances, there is general entitlement to the transfer of unused allowances from one spouse to the other, assuming the couple are taxed under the aggregation basis of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a cohabiting couple are not married, each partner is treated as a single person for tax purposes.  Each partner is, therefore, entitled only to the same personal allowances, rate bands etc., as are available to a single person.  Mortgage interest relief is available to each partner, up to a maximum of £1,600 per annum, in respect of the amount of interest actually <Col N="455" /> paid by that partner.  There is no entitlement to the transfer of unused allowances from one partner to the other.  Premiums paid on insurance policies taken out on the life of one partner by the other do not qualify for tax relief.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 72 together.  In County Westmeath in 1988 there were 2,070 applications for special beef premium of which seven were rejected; there were 2,464 applications in 1989 of which 55 were rejected; and there were 2,279 in 1990 of which 122 were rejected.</P>
      <P>More applications would have been rejected in 1990, however, but for the flexible approach which, at my request, the EC Commission adopted for that year in the interpretation of the relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>The EC Commission agreed to this flexibility because of the possibility of some confusion among applicants, given that 1990 was the first year in which 100 per cent on-farm inspections were not carried out.  The Commission were adamant, however, that the regulations governing the scheme should be strictly adhered to by all applicants in 1991 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Despite the warnings to this effect which issued to all applicants with their 1991 application forms, however, some 1991 applicants seem to have repeated the mistakes of 1990.  It is too early yet to say how serious this problem is but I am having it kept under constant review. Meanwhile, I have asked the EC to review the rules of this scheme.</P>

      <P>I have been aware of the problem raised by the Deputy.  A warning issued to all applicants with the 1991 application forms, however, telling them not to apply for premium on cattle whose cattle identity cards had been notched or <Col N="457" /> rubber-stamped already for premium as it is a fundamental condition of this EC scheme that each male bovine can be paid premium only once in its lifetime.  It is unfortunate that some applicants seem to have ignored this warning and, while it is too early yet to measure how widespread this problem is, I am keeping the situation under review.</P>
      <P>I have asked the EC to review the rules of this scheme.</P>

    <P>The reasons for delay in payments under this scheme are as follows: (a) the EC regulations governing this scheme were not finalised until July 1990 after <Col N="460" /> all other cattle scheme applications had been issued in Ireland; (b) those regulations were so complex that discussions with the EC Commission services were necessary this year to ensure that they were being implemented properly in Ireland; (c) there have been some difficulties in obtaining details of the milk quotas owned by certain applicants so that their eligibility for the scheme and the number of cows on which premium could be paid could be established accurately. These problems have been largely resolved now, however, and payment of grants under this scheme should start later this month.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement is <Col N="461" /> available to employees with families who are on low incomes.

      <P>Income support for low income farmers is provided through the smallholders assistance scheme.  The operation of the means test for that scheme can be a disincentive for smallholders to improve their position.  I am examining the possibility of providing a different form of income support for farmers in this situation.</P>
      <P>The Government have given a commitment in the programme that arrangements will be made to address the problem of low income farming families, in consultation with farming organisations. Certain discussions have already taken place between the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the IFA.  The possibility of introducing a pilot scheme to address the problems of low income farm families is under consideration.

      <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that there are 9,000 names on the orthodontic waiting list for treatment by a consultant orthodontist or by a dentist with a specialist qualification in orthodontics.</P>
      <P>Children on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment are categorised according to the severity of their condition.  I would like to point out that in category 1, which is the category of greatest severity, the waiting list is as low as 17 and these children will receive treatment as a matter of priority.  At present approximately 3,600 children are at varying stages of orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>The board have orthodontic clinics in North Strand, Crumlin, Greystones, Leixlip and Kildare.</P>
      <P>Minor orthodontic treatment is also carried out by the board's dentists at the dental clinics.</P>
      <P>Under the tuition of consultant staff from the Dublin Dental Hospital seven of the board's dental surgeons have been trained in orthodontics.  It is proposed that, as soon as possible, the newly appointed consultant in the Eastern Health Board will commence orthodontic training of dental surgeons from the health board's staff.  The further development of this training programme will enable the less severe orthodontic cases to be treated by a specially trained dentist and the board will therefore be able to deal more expeditiously with cases requiring treatment and to make further considerable reductions in waiting lists.</P>
      <P>These developments indicate that considerable progress has been made recently by the Eastern Health Board in the provision of orthodontic services. The recent appointment of a consultant orthodontist to the board marks a significant development in the services.</P>

      <P>Cash is issued by my Department to each of the health boards each week in line with cash profiles which are agreed at the beginning of the year.  Those profiles are based on cash figures determined by the Department in accordance with the boards' approved expenditure levels. There has been no change in this method of payment to the boards in recent years. I am satisfied that the levels of cash notified to health boards at the beginning of the year, together with the approved bank overdraft levels are sufficient to enable the boards to operate within the limits of the approved allocation.  In addition, the boards have been given additional cash to cover approved increases, including pay, increases in rates of allowances and certain service-related items.</P>
      <P>The cash available to my Department is directly related to the approved level of expenditure for health boards.  As the Deputy is aware, expenditure under health boards must be held in line with approved level of allocation.</P>
