      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 13, 14 and 15.  It is also proposed that business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 23.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that business be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the continuing concern about unemployment, would the Taoiseach allow time for a debate on the revelations yesterday of the extent to which it is not worth people's while going to work because of the complex of means tests which deprives them of benefits, raises their rent and so forth?  Would the Taoiseach <Col N="2" /> consider that an interdepartmental examination of this subject would be assisted by a debate in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clearly not a matter for the Order of Business. It is something that can be raised in a variety of ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you for that guidance, Sir, and to give notice that I will be seeking a debate through the Whips on that matter because of its importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine, that is the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear last night, within a matter of hours of the Taoiseach refusing to answer my question <Col N="3" /> on the Order of Business in relation to the family planning legislation, that the Government have decided to make amendments to that legislation.  Can the Taoiseach tell us when he expects that legislation to be introduced in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, as I said yesterday; first of all, legislation is not promised in this House in accordance with Standing Orders.  I have already indicated that legislation will be introduced but I am not yet in a position to say when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This session?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably, this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, would you clarify for me whether all the promises of new legislation that will be made at the Ard Fheis next weekend will be regarded as promises which can be pursued in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order.  Deputy Shatter will resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or will they be treated in the way they should be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is high time that you, as Ceann Comhairle of this House, raised at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges the question of the reform of this procedure where it is not in order to raise in the House legislation promised outside of it.  It is high time that that was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has representation on that committee.  He might proceed to raise it in that fashion. The Chair would welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We have tried to raise this matter on a number of occasions but we have got nowhere with it quite <Col N="4" /> simply because the majority on the committee, the Government, are anxious not to have these matters raised in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately this House decides the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not want to be kept to their promises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the promise with regard to the reform of ministerial pensions will be dealt with anytime soon in this House? It was promised in the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with that matter several times.  It is not likely to be this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Next session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the Government will issue a White Paper on their approach to economic, monetary and political union in Europe? I understand that yesterday in Luxembourg the Irish member of the Council of Ministers indicated support for the power of co-decision for the European Parliament.  Is this now Ireland's policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy surely realises that he is totally out of order in raising that matter now and in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time that we had a White Paper.  I would like the Taoiseach to confirm that we will have a White Paper and to say when we will have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Another time, Deputy; not now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I press the Taoiseach on the issue whether we will have a White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would respectfully suggest that the Deputy put down a question on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach would have to have a policy before we could have a White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, being aware that crisis meetings are being held throughout the country by the farming leaders and the farming community and that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is engaged in very difficult meetings in Brussels at the moment, if the House will debate the crisis facing the farming community at an early date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to pursue that matter in another way.  It is not relevant now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate if the Government are prepared to come before this House to discuss the very serious problem facing the farming community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As there are less than eight sitting days left before the Easter recess, may I ask the Taoiseach when he intends to bring forward the Social Welfare Bill and if he would give the House a guarantee that he will allow a full and thorough debate on the implications of that Bill before the Easter recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had that one quite recently also&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>But we have not been given a commitment with regard to the date. There are less than eight days left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to have it brought forward next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach <Col N="6" /> what is the present status of the legislation dealing with product liability? Would the Taoiseach not agree that we are already very substantially in arrears with this legislation and in breach of an EC directive of long standing in not bringing in this legislation?  We must be some two years overdue.  Would the Taoiseach tell the House what is the present status of that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, it is very complex and difficult legislation. There are constitutional issues involved. However, it is well advanced and it is hoped to publish it before Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it proposed to take the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Bill, 1991?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be taken this session.  I will let the Deputy know when it is likely to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach when the much promised Competition Bill will be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Malley, dealt with that matter the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to deprive the Government of the opportunity to promise each month that it will be taken next month.  I just want to give them the March opportunity to say that it will be taken next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like being repetitive.  I do not like to have to continue answering questions for Deputies who were not here when the answer was being given.  That legislation will be published at the earliest possible date.  It is well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change for the past three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Byrne the Taoiseach indicated <Col N="7" /> that the Social Welfare Bill will be brought in on Tuesday.  I understood that the debate on the Gulf was to take place on Tuesday.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when the debate on the Social Welfare Bill will commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to clarify matters.  Although the Social Welfare Bill will be introduced on Tuesday the debate will not take place on that day.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It properly falls to be decided by the Whips.  There is no point in our discussing it here and the Whips discussing it as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Programme for Government, the Government parties agreed to introduce legislation to regulate telephone tapping. Could the Taoiseach give us any indication when, if ever, this legislation will be introduced in accordance with that agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this legislation promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not specifically within the terms of order.  That legislation is proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When will it be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in Deputy Bruton's inquisitiveness about this legislation considering that his Government ran away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be fair to say <Col N="8" /> that our Government revealed an appalling episode of telephone tapping undertaken during Deputy Haughey's period as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This should not give rise to disorder.  I call Deputy Andrew Boylan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in his initial response to Deputy Bruton in respect of this question the Taoiseach indicated that he believed this matter was not entirely in order.  This was legislation promised in the House on 9 November 1989 in a reply delivered to the House by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made his point effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being claimed that unless something is on some list it is not in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has to be clarified.  Legislation is either promised or not.  If it is promised, information should be given on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Government through the Taoiseach that we are now in the month of March and almost a quarter of the year has elapsed, yet notification has not been given to local authorities regarding their allocation for the repair of county roads.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the serious situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned yesterday that good news is worth waiting for.  The Deputy will not have much longer to wait.  I can understand his anxiety in view <Col N="9" /> of the pitiable condition in which his Government left the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in relation to the acoustics of this House, could you advise us whether it is intended to increase the height of the microphones by the additional six inches the Taoiseach's microphone has, or is it intended to reduce the Taoiseach's microphone by six inches?  I see no reason that the Taoiseach is given a better acoustic facility than the rest of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now the month of March and we still have not been told. When will we be told the amount we are to get?  This is the way the Government are getting the books right.  The poor have to pay all the time.  They do not have the muscle of some of the people in the corridors of Fianna Fáil.  It is most immoral not to build housing for the homeless.  It is totally and absolutely immoral.  The silence on the Government side betrays their guilt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Government to consider the definition of the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, so that it will not refer to the Minister for Finance, as at present, but to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It seems unhelpful that the controlling body of this holding company should be the Minister for Finance and the Department.  In my view if anything is unhelpful within the Government structure it is the overall control by the Department of Finance.  I cannot see why the Minister for Agriculture and Food cannot have overall control of the Sugar Company whether it would be a public company or a State company as at present.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food would do a far better job if he were the man with 51 per cent of the <Col N="12" /> holding, irrespective of who the Minister is &mdash; some Ministers would do it better than others, obviously.  He would do a far better job than would any Minister for Finance who would be controlling the company by remote control.  The uncommercial attitude within the Department of Finance would be a major restraint in getting the company to operate as we would wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I would like to support my colleague.  The hand of the Department of Finance is like the sword of Damocles hanging over so many Departments.  The interest of the Department of Finance is simply and solely to make sure that we balance the books.  I am quite sure that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has genuine concern for and knows what is needed in the Sugar Company and what should be invested in it.  It is a very obvious and sensible move to give him responsibility for the control of finance under this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a pity we are discussing this Bill today, considering that there is a major meeting between workers and unions today and that matters have not been settled in advance.  Would anything do more damage to the success of privatisation in the long run than disagreement between the workers and the company as to what arrangements should have been made?  It is regrettable that we are working on the legislation in advance of the meeting today.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My party's stance on this is that the Minister should not have to introduce this Bill at all.  This company have been a huge success as a result of the changes that have been made by management and the profits that have been achieved over the past three years show that the company are well capable of achieving all the aspirations that the <Col N="13" /> Department and the company themselves should be able to achieve.  In my view, therefore, we have no need for this Bill and I believe it will be to the detriment of the company.</P>
      <P>In principle I agree with Deputy Deasy's agreement, but I would like to put my cards very clearly on the table. Although this Bill was accepted on Second Stage and it is <i>a fait accompli</i> that privatisation will be introduced in some form or other, I hope the amendment we have tabled will be accepted by the Minister.  However I think it is reasonable to agree with the principle being espoused by Deputy Deasy that the Minister for Agriculture and Food himself and his Department would be better controlling the shares of the company rather than the Department of Finance.  We know the Department of Finance &mdash; and what has often been referred to as the dead hand of Finance &mdash; and what their priorities are.  I would prefer to see a Department that has an intimate knowledge of agriculture being in control of the shares rather than seeing these shares in the hands of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said it before and I will say it again, that if ever there was a proposal to privatise a public company which was unjustified, unwarranted and unnecessary, this Bill to sell off the Irish Sugar Company is surely it.  It has the support of the Fine Gael Party holus-bolus. I find it difficult to understand the logic in Deputy Deasy's amendment; however as it refers to the Minister for Agriculture and Food having primary responsibility for the development of the agriculture and food industry, it merits attention.  The agriculture and the food industries are, of course, the great resources that we have in this country but unfortunately they have been totally neglected by the present Government and the previous Fine Gael Government. If attention had been paid to this industry why did the Sugar Company have to narrow their base to a two factory configuration and close down our food factories one after the other as was done <Col N="14" /> in the Midleton and Mallow Erin Foods factories?</P>
      <P>As this amendment refers to the development of the agriculture and food industries and its purpose is to ensure that finance accruing to the State should be to the benefit of the agriculture and food industries, I support it.</P>

      <P>But we have stated our hope that the new company would be a leader in the food industry, and therefore we would wish to see the Minister for Agriculture and Food and not the Minister for Finance being the main influence on the new body.  Deputy Kavanagh has already referred to the dead hand of the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should be the person driving the public company in order to ensure that they will play the developmental role in the food industry that we believe they can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me assure the House that I am very much in sympathy with the points being made.  I think I can <Col N="15" /> illustrate that by referring to an action I took when I was Minister for Finance, because as Minister for Finance I transferred the responsibility for overall policy of this particular company to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I subsequently, of course, inherited the overall responsibility that I had transferred at that time, as Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister inherited the Irish Sugar Company in very good shape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct and that remains the case.  Second, on the point the Deputies have made, the Minister for Finance under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts of 1924 and subsequently, is in fact the nominated shareholder of all State commercial companies.  While other Ministers have responsibility in respect of agriculture, transport and power or whatever, the actual shareholding is always vested in the Minister for Finance, and that is the reason it is here as well.  The fact that this legislation is being introduced by me as Minister for Agriculture and Food, underlines the responsibility the Government acknowledge should rest with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The fact that we will come later to special provisions on the special share and as to who holds the share and the control that goes with that, namely the Minister for Agriculture and Food, also underlines that fact.  There are no grounds for any apprehension of the kind mentioned.  The alternative is to say that the Minister for Finance should not be a shareholder in any State company.  That, however, has been the way for years.  It is purely because the Department of Finance are responsible for the management of the State finances, as Deputies Deasy and Kavanagh will recognise since they were both formerly in government.  As far as quality is concerned, that is the responsibility of the appropriate Minister, namely the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would wager a significant <Col N="16" /> sum that if the Minister had his way he would be only too delighted to agree with what I am suggesting.  I think he understands the ridiculous nature of the present situation where Finance controls what is the prerogative of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>I wanted to put down an amendment to section 1 specifically on this interpretation and I was informed by the people in the Bills office that it would result in amending every second line of the Bill.  I decided, rather than create bedlam by having about 99 amendments in, I would put down an amendment to change the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister will appreciate that.  I feel very strongly that the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Minister should have control: &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in the Bill should refer to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The point the Minister has just made in regard to introducing the Bill is not really significant.  What is significant is who controls the company. The Minister is being asked to do the donkey work but has no real responsibility. Once this Bill is passed the responsibility will be vested in the Department of Finance and that will inhibit the development of the food industry.  We are talking about vast sums of money, much of which will be reinvested to promote the horticultural industry as well as the beet industry.  I want to see that responsibility vested in the Department and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I want to see the public and the farming community getting value for money.  I want to see more jobs provided. I see the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance as a massive inhibition.  Because of that I will have to put this section to a vote.  I am making a protest and I want the Minister to sit up and do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If what Deputy Deasy says was true he would have to insist that no Department would have any reference whatever to the Minister for Finance in respect of State companies, but they do, for reasons that have existed since 1924 &mdash; financial accountability in all commercial State companies is to the Minister for Finance.  However, the responsibility for decision making, for control, for protection of worker interests, farmer interests and other interests rests absolutely with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Lest there be any doubt, there are in this legislation provisions which guarantee that the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the day, through the special share which he will acquire, is responsible for protecting that.  This is the first time that such a provision has been enshrined in legislation.  That is my purpose.  If the Deputy presses his amendment he is doing it in the light of the fact that what he wants to achieve has already been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is unprecedented.  Historically what the Minister is saying may be correct but this is the first occasion that this House has had a proposal before it to change a company in the agricultural field from State ownership to public ownership. What I am saying to the Minister is let us break that mould, to use an expression which was bandied about by the Minister's partners in Coalition.  Let us break the mould &mdash; let us break the sod, as one might say, and do something new, something different, something that will be of tremendous benefit.  I agree with the overall content of the Bill but, of all the things we could do in this Bill, <Col N="18" /> what I am suggesting now would be the most progressive.</P>
      <P>Before we finish with this section let me, on a point of clarification, refer to two other points.  The Bill refers to the company and to the holding company.  I am slightly confused.  When the Bill was read on Second Stage we were led to believe that the name of the company would be Greenvale.  Lo and behold, last week we were told that the name of the company was to be Greencore.  There has been a change of name within a few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the company to be called Greencore or will the Minister have another surprise in store for us today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not want to take the Deputy by surprise at this hour of the morning.  I will not have any other surprises in store for him.  The explanation for the change that is referred to, which does not feature in the Bill in any event, is that when a search was conducted in the Register of Companies it was found that some other small company somewhere already had the name Greenvale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  All the shares in the Holding Company acquired by the Minister for Finance in accordance with subsection (1) will be transferred to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and thenceforth the Minister for Agriculture and Food will be solely responsible as the Government's representative in the new company with the primary responsibility for the development of agriculture and the food industry.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The proposal in this amendment was discussed during the course of our debate on section 1 on the interpretation of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.  I have no intention of pressing this amendment to a vote as I have said as much as I wish to say on it; the vote we have just taken will suffice and we have made our points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Deasy wishes control of the shareholding in the company to be held by the Department of Agriculture and Food, then either amendment No. 2 in my name or amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Sherlock would be more appropriate.  He should not be concerned about whether it is the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture and Food who will have control.  It is not simply for ideological reasons that we believe the Minister for Agriculture and Food should be the majority shareholder in the company; it is simply because we believe it would be in the best interests of agriculture, the growers and employees if he held the majority shareholding.  I will refer to this point when we are debating my amendment. I cannot agree with Deputy Deasy's amendment.  My amendment <Col N="22" /> deals more appropriately with the problems referred to by Deputy Deasy in regad to the interpretation of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>For much the same reasons, I will not be supporting this amendment.  As I said earlier, I find it difficult to understand the position taken by the Fine Gael Party on this issue in view of the fact that they have gone holus-bolus for the privatisation of the Sugar Company.  The figures now show that the company are very profitable and naturally private enterprise will want to get their hands on it.  The 1990 report disclosed that profits of £22 million were made, an increase of 30 per cent over the previous year, and turn-over jumped from £215 million to more than £271 million.  The amendment proposes that the Minister for Agriculture and Food should benefit from any dividends accruing from the shareholding in the new company, whatever its name will be &mdash; I do not think the Minister or the Government have yet decided on a name.  The Fine Gael stance on this issue is very ambiguous to say the least of it.</P>

      <P>There is nothing ambiguous about the Fine Gael stance on this Bill.  When we were in Government we pushed very strongly for an improvement in the finances of the Sugar Company. The Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government pumped a massive amount of money into the company.  We expected the company to become profitable, which they did.  There were closures but the fact is that they are no longer a liability to the taxpayer.  The Workers' Party should be delighted that the company are no longer a liability but are a profit making concern.</P>

This is not specifically referred to in the Bill, but I recollect that in this Second Stage speech he referred specifically to figures.  I think he said that 45 per cent of the shares would be held by the Minister for Finance &mdash; I do not think it was 51 per cent &mdash; and that this figure would decrease as time went by.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 25 to 29, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a)  The Minister shall at all times maintain his equitable holding in the Holding Company at at least 51 per cent of the total equitable shares of that Company.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Minister shall retain 15 per cent of the equitable shares for the beet growers and for the employees of the Company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section is the core section of the Bill. It deals with the changeover of a public company to a part-privatised company and the method the Minister intends to use to do that.  My amendment is quite clear.  I propose that the Minister should hold the controlling interest in this company since it has been decided that he is going down the road of privatisation.  The simple solution to the problem is for the Minister to declare that he will hold 51 per cent of the total equitable shares of the company.  Paragraph (b) of the amendment proposes that the Minister retain a further 15 per cent of the equitable shares for the beet growers and employees of the company.  That means that in total 66 per cent of the shares would be held by the Minister, the employees and the growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section the Minister is trying to walk on both sides of the street at the same time, the public sector side and the private industry side.  He is trying to give the impression to those of us who are concerned about who will control the company in the future that the company will be safe in his hands, that because he will hold a number of shares control of the company will remain with him.  On the other hand he knows that the institutional investors, the people in the Stock Exchange, people who are interested in grabbing as many successful public companies as they can will perhaps draw back if they find that control of the company <Col N="25" /> remains in the public sector.  We have to come clean in this area and say whether it will be public or private.</P>
    <P>My whole approach in this amendment is to ensure that the Minister will retain control of the company.  I do not propose this simply for ideological reasons but for strategic and national interests.  The amendment is simple.  It signals to investors that the Government have a legitimate right to protect the Sugar Company, the beet growers and the employees from an unwelcome bid.  I know this may not be on the horizon now but it certainly cannot be ruled out in the next decade.  A further question will arise in the near future when the Sugar Company will look for new equity funds.  As a 51 per cent shareholder, the Government will have to take up their share entitlement. Without a specific Government commitment to retain a majority shareholding, the Government will fall back on this so-called golden share as a protection. This mechanism has already been the subject of criticism by the European Commission in the case of British Telecom and it will not stand the real test in the European Court of Justice.  If it comes to a conflict between the majority of shareholders and the Government if, for example, they try to stop a foreign takeover, the matter certainly will be referred to the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>Leaving all questions of ideology aside the Sugar Company, one of the Irish food companies which at present cannot be bought out by a multinational, will be put in jeopardy if this section is passed.  If the Minister is serious about retaining control of the company for the development of the food industry he should, at the very minimum, have written into the Articles of Association a provision for double voting rights for the Government, beet growers and employees provided they retain 30 per cent of the total shares of the company in the event of a takeover bid.  This would not stop institutions from investing in the company.  It did not stop them from buying into non-share issues of the employee-management owned National Freight Consortium in Britain <Col N="26" /> which went on the Stock Exchange in 1989.  It would certainly be a way in which the Minister could ensure that this company would remain within the controlling interest of the Irish people through the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by putting forward his convoluted proposal for privatisation of the company, has caused a lot of problems for himself and the Irish public.  As I have said, he has given the impression that the company will remain in public ownership while, at the same time, clearly signalling that after 1992 there is no guarantee that that will be the case. The proposition that institutional industries will not accept majority shares held by interests other than private investors is a great threat.  Institutional investors look at the track records of a company before investing &mdash; mainly profit growth, sales growth, capital growth in value of shares and the dividends received.  The Minister should understand that the company under his control will attract private investors because they have performed well, and that is the bottom line for people who invest in industry.  As I have said, it is factors such as profit growth, sales growth, capital growth and dividends received that will attract the private shareholder.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us at this stage why he has put forward the proposal to sell off the shares in the company.  He should demonstrate to the public that he will hold the majority interest in the company by taking on board the amendment in my name.  In that way there would be no confusion and no loss of interest by the private sector in investing in the remainder of the shares of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party support the amendment.  The Sugar Company have had their ups and downs since the establishment of the company.  Many of their problems have originated from Government interference.  A great example of that was the setting up of Erin Foods by the then Managing Director, Lieutenant Michael Joe Costello.  In this country there is great potential for the <Col N="27" /> development of the food industry but yet that company were restricted in the marketplace to 10 per cent of the home market.  Therefore, from day one the prospects of establishing the company in the food market were very restricted.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems of the Sugar Company resulted from Government instructions to keep the factories open. Reference was made to that in the debate on the closure of the Tuam sugar factory some years ago.  Beet was not being grown in the Tuam area and it was costing the company £3 million per annum to keep that factory open.  Against that background there has been a remarkable recovery by the Sugar Company in recent years.  I have given the figures of profits for previous years.  We have now reached a point where we have a viable Sugar Company that do not require taxpayers' money for support.  With the changes in EC Structural Funds the Sugar Company are the best company to promote a viable food industry.  If we do not develop our own product there is very little prospect of creating jobs for the 240,000 people who are unemployed at present.  We have the land to produce the product and the workforce, all it requires is the capital. The company who are about to be handed over to private enterprise are a viable one, that cannot be denied.  Consequently, why should the State not retain 51 per cent of the shares in the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure, when the Minister is replying, he will help to allay the fears of the workers because, in a company, there is capital, raw material and a workforce. The Irish Sugar Company have a workforce second to none, I know that from experience as I worked on the factory floor at Mallow Sugar Factory and I saw it developing technically.  That resulted in a massive increase in throughput which has made the factory very efficient.  A few short years ago, when it became necessary for the workforce, through their unions, to make a stand on particular matters relating to conditions and pay, it was decided that a certain course of action would be taken.  The threat held over the workforce &mdash; and the company <Col N="28" />&mdash; was that the company were ready to import sugar, we were told they had it in the port of Dublin ready to distribute if the situation continued.  If the Minister and the State do not retain 51 per cent of the shares of this company, what is to stop the company from importing sugar? Nothing; the danger is that profit will be their motivation and goal and it could well be that it would be cheaper to import sugar, with the result that we should lose our quota of 200,000 tonnes.  Something in excess of that figure is produced but where would the workforce go?  What would happen to the hauliers and the many agencies who benefited from the production and manufacture of sugar in our own country?  We have the land to produce the beet which is the raw material for sugar and nobody can deny that the company have made great strides to make the industry modern and efficient.  I know that the introduction of technology meant that jobs were sacrified and, consequently, the only way to secure the industry is for the State to retain 51 per cent of the shares in the holding company.  For that reason, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment although it does not go far enough and that is why I am opposed to the whole section.  The reason for opposing it is different from the stance taken by the Labour Party and The Workers' Party.  The Green Party are not opposed, <i>per se,</i> to private enterprise and are not in favour <i>per se</i> of State enterprise.  The situation here calls for a partnership between growers, employees and the consumer; this is a unique opportunity to set up a completely different type of structure where all these separate interests would be properly and fairly represented so that each interest would receive a fair deal from the industry.  The employees would get a fair wage, plus a share of the profits, the growers would get a fair price for their produce and fair treatment from the company, which has not always been the case in the past and the consumers would be protected against a possibly rapacious private <Col N="29" /> industry in a monopoly which might be in a position to exploit the consumer by charging excessive prices for sugar.  Furthermore, as Deputy Sherlock pointed out, the other side of the coin is that we want to stop imports of sugar when the world price of sugar drops temporarily below our prices.  This will safeguard the interests of the employees and the growers and, in the long term, benefit the consumer.</P>
      <P>There is a slight error in Deputy Kavanagh's amendment in that he twice refers to the word &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; when referring to holdings.  With respect, that should be &ldquo;equity&rdquo; and perhaps that could be looked at.  His proposal is in two parts, he would like to see 100 per cent instead of 51 per cent and he should like to see 15 per cent of the shares available to growers and employees.  I commend that principle to the House but the problem is that, if these shares were to be fully transferable in the normal way &mdash; the way in which companies work &mdash; I wonder if the employees and growers would retain them or if they would sell them on the open market.  We do not know who will own these shares, they could all finish up in the ownership of the one person or corporation.  With some reservations, I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Garland said that the Minister should have a holding of 100 per cent. How could a company be privatised if that is the case?  It would take a lot of mathematical calculations to figure it out. On Second Stage the question arose of the golden share and of how it will stand up in Europe.  Can the Minister confidently say that he does not have any worries in that regard and that it will stand up?  It is important that it does.</P>

      <P>Subsection (b) says that the Minister shall retain 15 per cent of the equitable shares for the beet growers and for the employees of the company.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate the breakdown in this regard?  Will it be 15 per cent for each of them or will it to 10 per cent and 5 per cent or 8 per cent and 7 per cent?  To whom will the different percentages apply?</P>
      <P>I certainly could not support subsection (a), that the Minister shall retain 51 per cent of the holding company because that would mean overall State control which would be contrary to the whole purpose of the Bill.  I have no compunction about saying that I would much prefer to see a board of directors running a public company instead of having the Department of Finance in the driving seat.  It would be much better to see a group of people, who understand the industry and who are capable of running it, with overall control.  The whole thing would be sterile and useless if we maintain the situation which pertained in the past.</P>
      <P>I asked a question when we were discussing the previous amendment and the Minister said he would answer it when we were discussing this one.  The question was in relation to the amount of the shareholding which will initially be invested in the Minister for Finance and how that shareholding will decline as years go by. What does he envisage the value of the company would be if they were floated on the Stock Exchange today?  One financial correspondent in, I think, the <i>Irish Independent</i> said the Bill was being introduced in the Dáil today &mdash; he is about one month behind time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would be the value of the company on the Stock Exchange?  Has that value been affected in any way by the overall decline in the Stock Exchange over the past six or eight months?  I note <Col N="31" /> a very positive change in the trend of prices on the Stock Exchange in the past couple of weeks.  They are returning to previous levels.  Will that have any effect on the flotation value?  Can the Minister give us any estimate?  How much of that money will be paid back into the Exchequer to compensate the Exchequer for the money loaned to the company over the years?  How much of that money will be retained by the Exchequer to offset the national debt and how much will be reinvested to promote a vibrant and new horticultural industry?</P>

One either supports the retention of control of this company in Irish hands and directed by the Irish Government or one does not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Fine Gael stance on this because I consider the Bill to be tantamount to a betrayal of the national interest.  I cannot for the life or me see, from reading the Minister's Second Stage speech or anything he has said so far, how he can justify selling such a key, strategic company currently in Irish hands.  The arguments we have heard simply do not stand up.  One <Col N="32" /> cannot do the kind of house keeping exercise Deputy Deasy invites us to contemplate &mdash; he referred to this so-called drain on the taxpayer as if it was the most serious crime &mdash; or take this in isolation from the economic significance of the company.  Deputy Garland made a fair point and Deputy Deasy knows this; 2,000 workers have lost their jobs in the Irish Sugar Company.  What do they represent? They represent at least a £20 million drain on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone and the obligation to pay them social welfare, apart from the infrastructural role and social dimension of the company throughout the country.  One cannot take in isolation the fact that investment had to be raised from the State and put into this company to help them stand on their own.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Kavanagh's amendment for the same reason he advanced, not for any ideological reasons.  They are a State company.  Despite obstacles put in their way at various stages, they are a State company who have played a key role in the Irish economy and have overcome adversity in recent times to present themselves with the kind of balance sheet they have today.  The managing director of that company makes the point that he will need additional capital in order to expand the company, to diversify into related areas in order to create more employment.  I am all in favour of that, and if he requires additional capital then that capital should be provided by the State with no apologies.  I will tell Deputy Deasy and the Minister why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I caught a glimpse last night of Deputy Deasy's leader, Deputy John Bruton, on TV and heard him argue that Irish industrial policy is a costly failure and suggesting a shift in emphasis and so on.  Of course, he is right.  We have spent on average about £800 million per annum through the IDA and other agencies to attract foreign industry.  It is essential that we continue to attract foreign industry, but alone it has not provided jobs for our people.  What is so sacred about the £800 million that it cannot be diverted into one of our major, significant companies? <Col N="33" /> Why is there this automatic block on that being done?</P>
    <P>State companies certainly swallowed up a great deal of taxpayers' capital in the past.  It was willingly given out although there were major structural difficulties in some of the companies.  There were deficiencies and featherbedding resulting in part from canvassing of politicians to get jobs for people where there were not jobs.  Of course there were inefficiencies but one goes from that extreme to the extreme of taking up the policy position that, no matter what the argument, no matter what the company, and no matter what the economic case made, the Government are not going to provide another shilling of public equity for expansion purposes in any State company. I cannot understand the swing from one end of the barometer where dubious investments were made in the past to a situation that, no matter what case can be made, the sacred principle with the new Coalition Government is that they will advance no capital.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our experience in the food industry, the fact that we are talking about our major natural resource as the raw material, that the private sector has not managed to develop it sufficiently, and that the major investment decision taken in recent years &mdash; the Goodman Plan &mdash; collaspsed, why not take the other significant indigenous Irish company who are there and allow them to expand, develop and diversify?  That is the opportunity Deputy Kavanagh's amendment seeks to retain for us, the Irish people, through the Government.  If we retain 51 per cent of the holding in this company we retain control and we give an Irish Government at any stage in the future the sovereignty and authority to take what decisions considered to be in the best interests of the Irish people and of job creation at home.  Otherwise we are not going to retain that control.  I invite the Minister to address the question again and to assure us that through the use of the golden share that is going to be the case.  I do not accept that that is going to be the case.  Control is going to pass out of our hands on this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> The experience I referred to on Second Stage of Britoil and Jaguar in the UK tends to show that the golden share alone is an insufficient mechanism to rely on.  I do not know at this stage whether the golden share will be deemed contrary to EC competition law.  There has been no finding on that yet but it may well prove to be the case.  In moving the amendment Deputy Kavanagh referred to the position in British Telecom.  We cannot rely on the use of the golden share to retain control for us.  Meanwhile, control of a major Irish indigenous food company is passing out of our control.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture and Food talks to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but it was my understanding that there was general agreement in the House.  This has been underlined by the belated publication of the triennial report on industrial performance.  The publication of that report underlined the emerging consensus in this House that our existing industrial policy is a costly failure and that it is not providing the jobs we need.</P>
    <P>Here we have a major State company which we can develop as we think fit and we want to sell it off.  It is a tragedy, a betrayal of the national interest.  The Government cannot defend it.  We will regret it in the future.  I do not understand how Fianna Fáil, having regard to their traditional position on State companies up to the 1987 general election, where The Taoiseach felt compelled to give the general secretary of Congress an undertaking that they would not undermine our major State commercial companies, could now do a complete turnabout from that position and decide to sell this company off, saving that it is only the first of many.</P>

      <P>The answer to that is that nobody is perfect.  Deputy Deasy raised a question about the flotation at this time and in these circumstances.  The Minister should address that.  All the advice the Government are getting is that they could not possibly have picked a worse time for this flotation and that the company is likely to achieve a third of what would have been achieved a little more than a year ago if the company had been floated then.  I cannot see why the Government are so determined in such unpropitious circumstances to proceed with this flotation.  It may well be that the equity markets have risen in the last few weeks, but the fact is that they have fallen back about one-third over recent months. I do not see why we should want to sell a valuable public asset for a song.</P>
      <P>What impact will £50 million or £60 million have in the context of a national debt of £25 billion?  At best it will amount to about a penny in the £ taxation for taxpayers if used for that purpose, and the Government say it will not be used for that purpose.  All the reasons and arguments make the case for supporting Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.  If the Government feel compelled for some reason they have not logically explained, to sell off shares in this company, the amendment which would see a majority stake being held in Irish hands should be adopted to ensure public control over such an important company in the future.</P>

    <P>What is being proposed is partial privatisation, not the selling off of a valuable public asset for a song.  I would oppose that as vigorously, and perhaps more vigorously, than Deputy Rabbitte.  I suspect that Members of Fine Gael would also oppose that.  That is not what we are doing, and I do not accept what those who want to undermine us are doing by trying to create the wrong impression among the public.  They will not be allowed to distort reality.  Apart from the special share, the Articles and Memorandum of Association ensure that no one interest or consortium may acquire more than 15 per cent of the shareholding in the new holding company.  I would <Col N="38" /> have to tell those who pretend, for the purposes of their ideological arguments or hangups, that it is not there; that guarantee is there.

      <P>With regard to the suggestion that this is inappropriate at this time, since this company was launched, Fianna Fáil in Government have shown a total and vigorous commitment to this company and others. When this company was first established in the thirties the circumstances were different from those which exist today.  There was a necessary period of protectionism here to support the infant industries of Ireland.  There was no native capital or entrepreneurship or capacity in the international markets.  It was a different world and a different time.  Companies such as this one were set up specifically to supply what could not be supplied by the private sector.  No one in that sector had the expertise or the market familiarity which are so vitally important.  We are now 60 years on and the reality is that it is the markets, and not protection, which are going to determine the success of any enterprise, be it private or State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a welcome turnaround in the affairs of the company during the past two years: They have returned to profitability for the first time in many years, and the House should unite in welcoming this.  I should point out to Deputy Rabbitte, and I know that Deputy Deasy is conscious of this, that this turnaround was not achieved without massive contributions during the years from the taxpayer about whom we are all concerned. Deputy Rabbitte made the point that over £800 million has been made available by the IDA to companies setting up <Col N="39" /> here but I should point out to him that during the years £65.5 million has been provided to Siúicre Éireann by the taxpayer and £59 million of this was contributed in the eighties alone by both administrations.  Given their track record the company feel very confident, and I believe the workers also, that with new partners, ventures and opportunities in the internal market that they can get involved in a new range of activities in the food industry, under the new State holding company that I have mentioned, Greencore, and realise their full potential which they would not be able to do if they continued to be exclusively State-controlled and dependent on the taxpayer constantly providing more money. At some stage the Labour Party and The Workers' Party are going to have to square their own circle.  Yes, we want more money for the health service, social welfare, education and all the other social priorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and for roads, but at the same time we would still have to say to the taxpayer that he must continue to put more money in when the reality is that if we adopt this new, unique and dynamic approach we can attract the markets to participate, thus generating more funds both for the company and the taxpayer, while bringing about a situation where, sooner rather than later, we can start reducing the level of taxation about which the Labour Party and The Workers' Party and all other parties are concerned.

      <P>I was replying to comments made on the salt mines before you came into the House, and I felt it was appropriate to reply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked what percentage the Minister for Finance will hold following the flotation, and the answer is 45 per cent. I should also point out that the company will raise additional capital through rights issues and the Minister will have the option of increasing his holding to maintain that 45 per cent.  That is a very important element of the legislation.  We do not want to put any restriction, in terms of their market capacity, on the new holding company.  We want to answer that the holding of the Minister for Finance can be adjusted and this is without reference to the protection which exists by way of the special share.  The taking up of rights <Col N="41" /> at a particular time will depend on the circumstances obtaining at that time. Deputy Sherlock suggested &mdash; and I want to put this out of court immediately &mdash; that we would lose our 200,000 tonnes quota&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister guarantee it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I should make it clear to him that I and my party in Government would not want me to introduce this legislation if there was any remote risk that this could happen.  It is not reasonable or appropriate for Deputy Sherlock when discussing this subject to throw that red herring across at me or for Deputy Rabbitte to suggest that we are selling the whole thing for a song.  We have no proposal or intention to dispose of our 200,000 tonnes quota. In case there might be any doubt about it I want to make it quite clear &mdash; we will deal with this on the next section &mdash; that the special share which will remain with the Minister for Agriculture and Food has been included to guarantee that the quota cannot be disposed of.  I do not need to take issue with any of the arguments on just how important the quota is; it is a huge resource and is like a national milk quota in the hands of one. I do not want to see that national quota being lost to the country.  That is the reason I have included a special provision in this legislation to ensure that it cannot happen.  What we are doing here is getting the balance right.  We are going for partnership, with support from the markets, on the basis of very secure State involvement without affecting the management of a company who have proved themselves to be very vigorous in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me mention in that connection that turnover for the year ended September 1990 was £271 million.  That was the best performance achieved by this firm as a State company.  The one thing that should be remembered is that the company are confident that in the new venture they can do much better.  Let us look at two other food companies in Ireland who are <Col N="42" /> not in receipt of one penny from the taxpayer &mdash; the Kerry Group and Avonmore. Both of those have turnovers well in excess of the figure reached by Siúicre Éireann with the input of very considerable State funding.  I am not trying to denigrate what Siúicre Éireann have done but merely demonstrating that those companies who are free to go to the markets to seek participation, which is what Siúicre Éireann want to be able to do as part of the Greencore operation, have shown that there is huge potential for Irish food companies.  I want the State-involved company to be in the same position to go out vigorously and confidently to do the same thing.  I want to see the same level of growth and security for employees and beet growers.  We are all concerned that the taxpayer should receive a dividend, that the workers are guaranteed and the markets sustained.  I hope this clears up the real issues.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not reply to some questions about the likely value of the company when floated on the Stock Exchange.  I do not expect the Minister to be absolutely accurate but perhaps he could give some estimate.  Deputy Rabbitte said it would be sold off for a song. Business interests who have a knowledge of the market tell me that the recession in the stock market will not make much difference, if any.  The Minister might confirm or deny that and give us some figure.  How much of the money raised will go back to the Exchequer in compensation for money given over the years to the company?  How much of that money will be retained within the Exchequer for other purposes and how much will be reinvested in the horticultural industry?  It was clearly stated on Second Stage that the idea was to raise money on the Stock Exchange so that the company could be expanded and we could reduce annual imports of vegetables and fruit which could be produced <Col N="43" /> at home.  The value of such imports is in the region of £200 million or £250 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me to give an estimate of the value and it would not be appropriate.  I understand the Deputy's interest, which I share.  The response from the markets will determine the value.  I do not want to engage in a guessing game.  The advice we have is that the attitude of the market towards the new holding company is very positive. What Deputy Rabbitte is suggesting is not the case.  Indications are that the market response will be very positive indeed.  Beyond that I do not think I should go.  The range of figures talked about would move towards the more optimistic rather than the lower order. Regarding the disposal of the funds raised, the Deputy will appreciate that this arises under another section.  Among the purposes underlying this move is to ensure that the taxpayer, the company, the workers and the beet growers will all be in a better position.  We will relieve the taxpayer of a burden.  That is still the Government's intention.</P>

      <P>What section deals with it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Garland has an amendment to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Garland for his support on this amendment. I was completely with him in wanting 100 per cent of this company to be retained but we failed at Second Stage because Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats outnumber us in this House.  That is a fact of life which I have to accept.  The best compromise for the people working in the industry and the growers, as well as for the development of the industry in the national interest, would be for the State to retain 51 per cent, as specified in my amendment.  That is also the reason I suggest 15 per cent should be reserved for the growers and employees.  The Minister also believes that the people involved in the industry should hold part of the equity.  I know <Col N="44" /> discussions are going on between both those interests and we are leaving some flexibility to the Minister in this regard. The consultations between the trade union movement, the IFA and the Beet Growers' Association will work out a reasonable share.  I am not suggesting that these shares should be handed out freely to employees and growers.  They will have to pay for them but I expect there will be certain preferential treatment. I leave this to the wisdom and good sense of the people involved in the discussions.  We will accept an assurance from the Minister on what is to happen in this area.  Unfortunately in his reply he did not discuss that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed in the Minister's reply.  The best way to treat all concerned is to retain 51 per cent in State ownership to safeguard the national interest.  The Minister says this is a partial privatisation.  The part that is being privatised is what concerns me because I do not accept that the safeguards provided will enable the Government to retain control.  The Minister states that no interest or consortium can hold more than 15 per cent of the shares but there could be several consortia or interests, each of which would hold 15 per cent.  The Minister claims this is dealt with in the memorandum and articles of association.  We are not discussing the memorandum and articles of association and I cannot table an amendment thereto.  It need never come before the House.  My concern is that we cannot tie down this Bill to ensure there will not be changes.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us a short history of this company set up 60 years ago when times were different and the State had to make up for the lack of incentive in the private sector.  That is the history of the great public companies including the ESB, CIE and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only four short years ago that the Taoiseach told us that position still held with regard to this company and to <Col N="45" /> all the semi-State companies and they were safe with Fianna Fáil.  I will remind the Minister that around that time he told the people of north Tipperary that the company in that area was safe in his hands.  So that we do not have a Minister promising that things will be quite safe under his direction, whether it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or whoever, the best safeguard is to incorporate it in the Bill so that no matter what regime is in power or what changes take place in Ministries, the Bill can be referrd to.  That is why I said the Minister's response was not only disappointing but did not allay any of the fears I had tried to present during the course of my presentation.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will hold a 45 per cent shareholding and will have an option to increase his holding to maintain that 45 per cent shareholding should the company expand their interests.  However, it will still be 45 per cent but the &ldquo;golden&rdquo; or &ldquo;special&rdquo; share is the hope we have for maintaining control of the company. The Minister did not say, and this is where my suspicions and concerns lie, the &ldquo;special&rdquo; share can be changed, and has been changed, in Britain.  I give the recent examples of Jaguar, British Telecom and National Freight Services. During my contribution on the introduction of the amendment I said that in the context of 1992 the provisions of the &ldquo;golden&rdquo; or &ldquo;special&rdquo; share may be found to be against Community rules by the European Court of Justice.  If that happens where will we be then?  The special share will not matter &mdash; the Minister did not comment on that, but I hope he will come back to that point again and assure us that what I am saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister has tabled an amendment so I will leave it at that and we can discuss it then.</P>
      <P>The Minister demonstrated the success of the co-ops in the private sector &mdash; how they developed and expanded and the level of profit they have achieved simply because they were in the private sector. However, I think what has happened within the public sector Sugar Company over the past four years is phenomenal indeed and has certainly shown that dynamic direction, a good board, a first class workforce and good supplies can make all the difference to a viable company. The Sugar Company are getting back on their feet into making profits.  By various means of raising funds to achieve their hopes and aspirations, whether by joint venture or otherwise, there are all sorts of options open to the company besides the simple option of selling part of the company to meet their equity requirements.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna, a semi-State company are in considerable trouble.  The method used to finance Bord na Móna is now causing problems and is hampering their efforts to turn around the company. These are the debts that have to be paid which grew up during bad times.  Money was thrown into the company and interest accrued, the company which now has a great product and dynamic direction, is being hamstrung trying to pay the interest on the debt.</P>
      <P>The decision has been made to sell off B &amp; I.  What did the Minister do about their debt?  He decided to write off all £20 million or £30 million and then hands the company over to the private sector. That would certainly solve the problems of companies that are tied by historic debts when they try to keep the company afloat in bad times.  The only way the company could raise money was through the banks.  The sugar company are also trying to get out of the debt they got into some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ideology aside, the sugar company is one of the food companies that cannot be bought by a multinational.  The Minister told us how succesful the co-operatives <Col N="47" /> are, but they can be bought by multinationals because their membership can make the decision.  If the Minister is saying that under the provisions of this Bill the Sugar Company will be in a similar position to the co-operative, then he is saying that at some time in the future an international food combine could buy a very considerable share of the Sugar Company, in fact, several could each buy 15 per cent of the shareholding.</P>
    <P>I am far from convinced by the Minister's proposals in this section, which is the key section.  I hope the Minister will accept that what I am saying is in good faith.  I think the Minister's proposals have caused concern to people who are interested in keeping the company in Irish hands rather than allaying their fears that the company is saved, because from what the Minister has said today it certainly is not.</P>

      <P>The Minister made no statement in his reply which would allay the fears that have been expressed if more than 51 per cent of the shares are held other than by the State, that the Minister can guarantee the security of our sugar quota.  If the Minister could assure us that our sugar quota was safe, that would be fair enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but there is no question that he has done that.  I am quite sure that if this question had been taken on board by the Minister or by those drafting the Bill we would not now have subsections 2 (3) and 2 (4).  Section 2 (3) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister, or his nominees may hold for as long as he thinks fit shares in the Holding Company...</P>
      <P>and section 2 (4) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food or his nominees, following consultation with the Minister, may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, dispose of by redemption or otherwise, in <Col N="48" /> accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of Association...</P>
    <P>Why were these matters not taken into consideration when drafting the Bill?  The Minister referred to the £56 million equity capital which was put in by the State, but the company's labour saving profits were secured profits in 1984-85 &mdash; it cost £48,000 for each job destroyed &mdash; and the company's investment yielded a return of £20 million last year, an increase on the previous year's profits of £2 million.</P>
    <P>From 1984-85 to 1986 the company, because of political expediency, retained Tuam sugar factory which cost in excess of £13 million, and the same applied to Thurles.  When we eventually came to rationalisation, we saw a further delay. Since the State invested in the company it must be encouraging to see that the company bought a one-third share in James Budget and Sons, the second largest sugar wholesalers in the UK.  Is that not a clear indication that the company on their own were going places at that time?  They bought a controlling interest in the edible oils manufacturer, James Daly, and acquired a half share in Odlums.  They also, through something that should never have happened, had to buy back their interest in Sugar Distributors. A couple of years ago the Sugar Company manufactured sugar from the production of beet on our land and then control of sugar distribution went into private hands.  That was rectified a few years ago and the company now have control of Sugar Distributors Limited as well.  Does all this not indicate that the Sugar Company are a viable company who, through their own investment and State investment, made such progress in broadening and consolidating their base over the last couple of years?  Why then is it necessary to sell off more than 51 per cent of the shares of this company?</P>
    <P>Paragraph (2) (b) of amendment No. 2 reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall retain 15 per cent of the equity shares for the beet growers and for the employees of the company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> How do we know that the employees of the company are interested?  I have had meetings with the employees of the company and discussed a proposal of the company that emanated from the Department of Finance.  The fact is employees cannot afford to buy shares. How can they?  From mid-January until the end of June employees are on a 39 hour week.  There is no way they can afford to buy shares.  The Minister for Finance intends to offer each qualifying employee approximately £250 worth of free shares.  The company have made representations to try to have them tax free, but were advised that they will be seen as an element of employment and therefore will be taxable.  The present attitude of the employees or the general body of workers in the factory is that they cannot afford a shareholding.  If the Minister wants to know what they think at the moment, they have no confidence that there is any future for them in the sugar industry.</P>
    <P>It is most extraordinary that the Minister for Agriculture and Food came into this House last week on the Second Stage debate and twice referred to Greenvale as the name of the new company.  The Minister did not realise that Greenvale plc, is a subsidiary of the Irish Sugar Company.  As a matter of fact, the issue was raised quite recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was doing that on the advice of the Sugar Company at the time and subsequently &mdash; there is no great mystique to it &mdash; the Sugar Company decided they wanted to go ahead with the name Greencore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Greenvale was already a subsidiary of the Sugar Company so we wanted to run away from that in case those whom we want to invest would be frightened off by it.  Let us say that at present an issue has been raised in regard to Dairygold putting dairy nuts into the Greenvale bags and disposing of them under Greenvale which is a subsidiary of the Sugar Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago it was necessary to bring to the attention of the then Minister <Col N="50" /> for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, the fact that a new company had come into Little Island in Cork.  I said this on Second Stage, and I will repeat it.  That company, which is about the sixth largest in the world &mdash; Ferucci, an Italian company manufacturing a sweetener from wheat &mdash; at that time got the support of Ceimicí Teoranta and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not consulted with the Minister for Agriculture.  In that area of Cork we had a company manufacturing a sweetener which was a threat to the Sugar Company at the time.  It had to be restricted and I am glad to say that having made the effort when I was in the Dáil in 1982 to get the then chief executive officer, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce around the table, some effort was made to restrict the amount of activity that company could engage in.  It was a threat to the Irish sugar industry because it was in the sweetener business.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister justify selling off more than 51 per cent of the shares of the company at this tme when it is already expanding its role, when it has already shown that it is a viable company, when it has been rationalised at the behest of the Government and when the consequence would be that he could not guarantee that the sugar quota which has been referred to as being so vital to the economy of this country can be protected? Any group holding the majority shareholding, if they can import sugar cheaper than it is being manufactured here, will very likely do that and there will be nothing in this legislation to stop them doing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that there are subsequent amendments which address the issue of the special share, and I will be very happy to address that when we reach it.  For the moment I will confine myself to the issue that is relevant to the second part of Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.</P>
      <P>I am very much in sympathy with the principle enshrined in Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.  I have already indicated in discussions with union representatives and the beet growers' representatives not only my readiness but my determination to ensure that they could have participation in the equity of Greencore, not just because of the representations made today, but because of my confidence in the contribution they can make in the future.  I am privileged to be the first Minister of this Government to ask, in the confident knowledge that I will get it, for the support of the House for provisions that will provide special equity shareholding for both workers and beet growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are discussions going on between the trade unions and the company. Some matters are emerging.  At the same time the House will appreciate that it is not appropriate to specifically write into the legislation actual amounts or details of how the special equity preferred participation will be made available.  I should like to inform Deputy Kavanagh and the House that we will be making provision on the advice and recommendations of the Government.  I have met the ICTU and also the beet growers and have indicated to them that we would want to see such preference being made available.  I am glad to say that the dividends will not be subject to taxation when the matter is finally worked out.  The company are prepared &mdash; and this is part of the issue &mdash; to make loans available to the workforce to acquire the shares at 10 per cent &mdash; and, as Deputies will be <Col N="52" /> aware, 10 per cent is very much less than the going rate at present &mdash; and the interest on the loan will be tax deductible. This is a very definite indication to recognise the contribution the workers have made and which, no doubt, they will make in the future.  I have not gone into the details of the amount because it would not be appropriate as it is still a matter between the company, the workers and the unions but those special arrangements demonstrate clearly that the special preference will give the workers participation at a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Deputy Sherlock that I would be surprised and disappointed if the workers who have built up the company in partnership and who have a great capacity to build up the company in future in partnership, and who have been given this opportunity were to say: &ldquo;We are not interested, we do not want to have any part in this new dynamic&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Everything this Government does proves we are interested in the shareholding democracy. Our <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a partnership with the trade unions and employers.  The same principle is coming across here.  It is important that I would make one other observation, lest there be a doubt &mdash; though it is not immediately relevant &mdash; because Deputy Sherlock made the comment that the fact that workers are in the same position to get as big, healthy and vigorous as the co-operatives means they <Col N="53" /> can be taken up by the multinationals. The co-operatives to which I have referred, far from being swallowed up by the multinationals, are very vigorously in the takeover trade themselves.</P>

      <P>It is not just in Ireland but it could be in Germany, France or America and I expect to visit the latter over the St. Patrick's Day period.  Much of my time during that period will be spent visiting the actual developments, acquisitions and expansions of the co-operatives concerned in the United States.  It is important that the Irish people know that.  Deputy Sherlock may have got the impression that we are being swallowed up by others but I am anxious to demonstrate that we are in an era now where we will be confident, vigorous and competitive enough to go out and do some of the swallowing up ourselves, which is precisely what is happening with the companies to which I have referred. I have no doubt that Greencore can do exactly the same.  That is why this is a very important step.  I hope the assurances I have given Deputy Kavanagh on the precise points demonstate my support for the principle he wants to enshrine in the legislation.  Equally, I must tell him I have been advised that it is inappropriate to make specific provision in legislation of the kind he refers to but it is a matter of agreement between the company, the unions and the beet growers.</P>
      <P>In relation to there being no liability to taxation I want to make it clear that the discounted elements of the shares will not be subject to taxation; the dividends in the normal course will be subject to taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has notified the House of his intentions for St. Patrick's weekend and I have no doubt he will work hard on behalf of the agricultural industry.  If this section were accepted the Minister would retain 51 per cent of the total equity shares in the company.  That would run contrary to the purpose of the Bill and would negative its effect.  It is my view that the company have been spancelled, stymied and stifled from taking their own initiatives and, as a result, during the years they have gone into decay and have not reached their full potential.  In relation to the shares, the Minister will be conscious of the fact that the workers, in partnership with the management of the company, have brought about whatever success they have achieved and they are the principal people to be looked after under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In regard to people who have given a lifetime of dedicated service to the company, to those who were made redundant prematurely or who lost employment through no fault of their own, is there any provision to give them preference in the purchase of equity shares?  A number of these people would have redundancy money and would be in a position to purchase those shares.  I am sure the Minister is conscious of the fact that there are many such people in Thurles and in Tuam.  I am aware from discussions with him that they have an affinity with the company which they would like to retain. This would be a major gesture and would compensate them in some small way for the trauma they have suffered.  I am aware that negotiations are still taking place at this late stage but can the Minister outline the broad principle of the breakdown of the percentage shares, for example, what percentage is being set aside for the growers and what percentage is being set aside for the workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point distinguishes our position on this Bill.  I sympathise with Deputy Lowry when he asks that the share option be made available to the redundant former workers of the Sugar Company.  I have no quibble with that.  The first thing that should be made available to the Sugar Company workers is jobs.  My main point in this argument is that the Sugar Company could be used as a vehicle for job creation and I do not think the Minister has addressed the question of control.  This is the critical amendment, with the next amendment from my colleague, Deputy Sherlock. After that, we can debate the niceties of it for as long as we like.  The important point is that we are dealing with the question of whether control will be retained in Irish hands through the Irish Government of the day.  Deputy Kavanagh's amendment is critical.</P>
      <P>From the arguments I have heard him make, the Minister has apparently decided not to address that question.  He drew analogies with successful companies in the food sector such as the Kerry group and Avonmore.  Nobody on this side of the House has any quibble with that.  They are successful companies and my only regret is that there are not more of them.  However, this has nothing to do with the fact that we are letting control of this indigenous company in State ownership who have trimmed themselves and are capable of identifying opportunities in the market, to industrialise agriculture and create jobs, pass away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this was not what was being done, that it was not privatisation and was only part privatisation. He suggested we are ignoring his 15 per cent ceiling.  The Minister knows that control of any company around the boardroom does not operate that way.  A 15 per cent ceiling has nothing to do with how control is exercised in a practical manner in terms of any corporate decision.  It does not impact on it at all. The Minister knows that in some critical decision those who are calling the tune financially will put it to him with his minority stake that he calls a golden share, <Col N="56" /> that this is the way they want to go.  He will have to dance to that tune; he will have no alternative.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Deasy, the Minister seems to make a virtue of the importance of getting this company off the back of the taxpayer, how they can do different things and will not be any burden on the taxpayer.  He went back to the origins of the Sugar Company to justify that position and said times have changed.  I want to point out to the Minister that even if he were to take it much later than that, there are fewer people employed in manufacturing now than there were at the beginning of industrialisation in this country in the sixties.  That is the issue. We can make the Sugar Company trim and slim but how many people will be employed by them?  They may not be a drain on the taxpayer but, as Deputy Kavanagh pointed out the problem with many public enterprises is the debt-equity ratio.  The debt-equity ratio has always been so punitive that repayment of the debt schedule for public companies was such that it strangled their possibilities to diversify or develop.  That debt-equity ratio was wrong in the case of the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>Even though it is now envisaged that no more taxpayers' money will be put into this company I wonder what the position is in regard to the other side of the equation, employment.  Taxpayers are already paying an enormous amount of money in attempts to create jobs.  We have a ready made vehicle which could be exploited for that purpose.  I should like to ask the Minister why he was so enthusiastic, with his Cabinet colleagues, to pledge an inordinate amount of State money and priority preference lines of credit to, for example, the Goodman operation?  Presumably he did this because he saw it as a possibility to develop the agricultural sector and create jobs in the beef sector in particular.  I presume that is the reason he did this.  I am not imputing any other reasons to the Minister.  I do not want to get into the kind of exchange we had earlier because I know how sensitive the Minister is in terms of his personal integrity.  The rest <Col N="57" /> of us in this House are all very venal but the Minister is perfect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making on the amendment is that if we are prepared to put money into, for example, the Goodman experiment in the food sector why should we have such a hang-up about putting money into the company we own on behalf of the Irish people? That is a very pertinent point and I should like to hear the Minister's views on it.  If we are prepared to use taxpayers' money to develop private industry why are we shying away from putting taxpayers' money into the Sugar Company to allow <Col N="58" /> them to develop?  That question has not been addressed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh assured us that the motivation behind his amendment is not ideological, but I believe the purpose of the Government in privatising this company is ideological.  It is not so long ago since the Taoiseach denied here the public statements made by the chairman of the Progressive Democrats outside the House about the number of public enterprises which were to be sold off during the term of office of the Government. The Taoiseach and other Ministers pooh-poohed those statements but we can now see that they are true.  We have already dealt with Irish Life and now it is Irish Sugar.  The decision has been made in principle in the case of the B &amp; I and it only has to be put through this House and there is ICC.  The tail is wagging the dog.  It is an ideological question not an economic one.</P>
      <P>I never thought I would see the day when Fianna Fáil, who claim to recognise and foster the role the State sector played in the development of this economy, would be won over by the arguments of Mr. Michael McDowell who does not even sit in this House.  This will be to the detriment of Irish workers and that is why I used the phrase, &ldquo;betrayal of the national interest&rdquo;.  Even a substantial wing of the Tory Party in Britain have described privatisation as selling off the family silver.  Basically this is what we are doing here because control will pass out of our hands into the hands of whatever combination that develops when the market takes up the shares in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not impressed by the Minister's sweetner about how he can come into this House as the first Minister to give shares at preference prices to workers in a State company.  My God, should we all be thankful to him for selling off a company owned by the Irish people in the name of the Minister for Finance and enabeling the Minister to make a small portion of the shares available at preferential rates to workers and beet growers? Should we all bow the knee and say, <Col N="59" /> what a generous far-sighted Minister he is,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not feel like giving the Minister any credit for doing this.</P>

      <P>Times may very well have changed but the biggest problem still facing us is the creation of jobs for our people.  Yesterday morning Fine Gael tried to have the House adjourned so that we could debate the latest unemployment figures. Only six weeks ago it was predicted in the budget that the level of unemployment would be 228,000.  There are now 245,000 people unemployed.  That is what this argument is about.  It is not about some technical arrangement on the Stock Exchange; it is about a vehicle that is capable of creating jobs.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I shall do that, but allow me to conclude.  The example we seem to be following is that of our neighbouring island.  I would like to refer briefly to an assessment of that in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 April 1990.  A financial commentator in a major article on privatisation in the British experience make the following point:</P>
      <P>The winner from privatisation in the UK where those who bought the shares well below market prices the management of the newly privatised companies, financial institutions, professional advisers and the Government. The losers are less visible, being the general taxpayers, and workers in the companies.</P>
      <P>That commentator gave examples of 12 State companies in drawing that conclusion. He said:</P>
      <P>An examination of the UK privatisation programme shows that there were far greater efficiency gains in public enterprises prior to privatisation than since, and the remaining public enterprises outperformed private industry as a whole on a number of criteria.  The transformation of public sector monopolies into private ones has not led to the expected improvements in services, but to higher profits at the expense of the consumer.</P>
      <P>We have seen that, for example, in British Telecom to which Deputy Kavanagh referred.  The consumer is getting a worse deal, a more expensive deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see an argument on economic grounds.  If the Minister has such an argument I would plead with him to at least put it on the record of the House because that is the only argument that makes sense.  If the Minister has an argument on economic grounds that justifies defeating Deputy Kavanagh's amendment, that is <Col N="61" /> allowing control of the Sugar Company to pass out of Irish hands, it should be put on the record of the House.</P>

      <P>I can assure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will do that, but in the interests of the company there are certain statements I have to correct. Deputy Rabbitte has again said we are selling off the Irish Sugar Company, but I want to totally and utterly reject that. It is false.  It is not going to serve any purpose for Deputy Rabbitte to keep repeating that phrase.  He knows quite well it is not true to say that the Sugar Company is being sold off.  The second point relates to the attitude of the Sugar Company to what has been happening and what can be done in the markets.  I am glad to record that the Sugar Company are very confident that in this new agreement we are proposing in this legislation they can grow and expand in the marketplace, they can move on an acquisition trail and they can demonstrate from the point of view of their management efficiency, marketing, worker capacity, the relationship between workers and company and the beet growers that they can do that.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to accept that those who never wanted to acknowledge achievement should be allowed get away with saying that we will be swallowed up, that we will have to dance, as Deputy Rabbitte put it, to the tune of others.  He would like to have that conveyed.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the new arrangements will not enable Greencore, with the contribution of management, workers and beet growers, to set a dynamic pattern of growth.  The Deputy asked me for evidence and I will give it to him.  When the Sugar Company were constrained by being totally State dependent, taxpayer dependent, the consequence we saw over the years since the seventies, before Deputy Rabbitte came into this House, was not expansion in employment, about which we are all concerned, but quite the opposite.  In a period of about 15 years of total State dependency the numbers employed by the Sugar Company dropped by about 50 per cent, from about 3,000 to just over 1,500.  If people want to see that pattern continue as a result of the company being prevented from developing a vigorous, dynamic marketing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to respond to some points in Deputy Kavanagh's amendment and to Deputy Lowry but first I would like to reply to the second point made by Deputy Rabbitte.  He implied that the Government are not prepared to put money into the company, but the facts quite clearly show the opposite is true.  In the last decade the taxpayer, the Government, this Administration and the previous Administration have put £59 million into this company. That demonstrates that what Deputy Rabbitte suggested is not founded on fact.  I am prepared to engage in discussion on this matter any time provided we adhere to the facts and we can draw whatever conclusions we like, but if we start from a false premise, we can draw any conclusion.  I am not prepared to leave that false premise on the record.  I would like to say very clearly that I can assure Deputy Rabbitte, and anybody else in the House who said we have been won over by the arguments of &mdash; I think he said &mdash; Deputy Michael McDowell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Lowry made a precise and important suggestion, that those workers who, during the period of total State dependency of the company, had lost their jobs could perhaps pay for shares through their redundancy lump sum payments.  There is a degree of persuasion in that argument, as those who were with the company over the years made a major contribution; I will put Deputy Lowry's suggestion to the company and the unions because, as the Deputy is aware, these matters are <Col N="65" /> decided in consultation with the management and the unions and between the management and the beet growers.  I cannot take a decision in regard to what should be done.  I will ask the company to look at it as favourably as possible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Patience is required in <Col N="67" /> this business too.  The Minister said that the Government will hold 45 per cent of shares in the company, which leave 55 per cent for someone else.  The Minister has not said exactly how the other 55 per cent will be distributed between private investors, growers and the employees. The second part of my amendment stipulates &mdash; again the Minister has not dealt with the point &mdash; that 15 per cent should be divided between growers and employees.  He has not given a figure in that regard.  Will his 45 per cent holding be partly given to the growers and the employees, leaving the remainder for the private investors?  That is what we have been trying to elicit from the Minister but he has totally avoided it since we started to debate this amendment over an hour and a half ago.  If the Minister said that he intended to privatise the company because he intended to make 55 per cent of the shares available to the private sector we would all know where we stood. A holding of 51 per cent means that it will be in public ownership although part privatised.  If the figure is 45 per cent the Minister should accept that it is total privatisation because the control of the company will be in the hands of the 55 per cent equity shareholders.  If the Minister accepts this amendment, then I will know that he introduced a Bill dealing with part privatisation.  However, he has not admitted that is what he is trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, on the one hand, he has the pressures of the chairman and certain directors in the company telling him that the flotation of this company on the Stock Exchange &mdash; of less than 51 per cent of the shares &mdash; will certainly not attract the investors which they would like to attract and that he should be careful not to admit in this House that he will retain control over more than 50 per cent of the shares.  This is the nub of the amendment.  Will the Minister keep control of the company?  Obviously, from what he has done in the Bill, he is saying he will not.  He will justify that to the institutional investors, investment banks and other people who deal with the Stock <Col N="68" /> Exchange and who will float this company when the Bill is passed.  The Minister will then tell the workers and the growers that he has made arrangements for them and that he will let them take a certain amount of equity in the company, make shares available at a preferential rate and supply loans to buy them.  However, what the Minister has been trying to avoid saying for the past two hours is that he will sell more than 50 per cent of the company.  We are entitled to know exactly what he will do because, it is in the interest of the nation, of the food industry and of employment in the company, because if the Minister gets away with it another Minister will do the same in relation to one of the other State companies. Will the Minister give us a breakdown of what he is doing with these shares?  How much is he retaining for the growers and employees?  Will it be part of the 45 per cent or in addition to it? Has he a figure in mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is sympathetic to the proposal I put forward, will he give a definite commitment in relation to it and quantify it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be able to deal with all the points in one minute.  I will give a commitment to Deputy Lowry that I will take up his proposal with the company.  However, I cannot quantify it at present.  The matter, obviously, is one which I will pursue.  In reply to Deputy Kavanagh, the shares of the workers and the beet growers will be in addition to the 45 per cent.  The amount envisaged is the subject of consultation and that is why I did not want to go into detail.  In case somebody says I am trying to hold back, it will be 10 per cent extra, which means 55 per cent which will not be available on the open market.  The special share, which surfaced during the course of the discussion, will be discussed later and I do not want to go into detail about it now because many of the comments and observations &mdash; particularly by Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; in terms of control will be dealt with then.  The special share which I, the Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="69" /> Food, will hold will be in addition to those.  I will deal with the special share in full when we come to it in the legislation.</P>

      <P>The National Heritage Council are a non-statutory voluntary council appointed by and reporting to the Taoiseach.  The role and functions of the council are: to formulate policies and priorities to identify, protect, preserve, enhance and increase awareness of Ireland's heritage in the specific areas of archaeology, architecture, flora, fauna, heritage gardens and certain inland waterways; to promote among the general public an interest and pride in our heritage and to facilitate the appreciation and enjoyment of it; to work closely with and to make recommendations to Government Departments, planning authorities, public bodies and State companies in relation to all matters coming within the council's general area of responsibility and to ensure the co-ordination of all activities in the heritage field; to decide on the distribution of moneys allocated for heritage work subject to the approval of the Taoiseach, and to decide on the priorities for such expenditure and to advise the Government on the legislation to establish a statutory heritage council.</P>
      <P>I intend to introduce legislation this year to establish a statutory heritage council.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the council were established in 1988 on a non-statutory basis, will the Taoiseach not accept it is time they were put on a proper statutory basis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Taoiseach stated &mdash; I presume this will be part of the legislation &mdash; that he proposes that part of the function of the National Heritage <Col N="71" /> Council is to identify the archaeological heritage.  Does that not almost directly overlap the function of the Office of Public Works in regard to national monuments?  Further, let me ask him in the same fashion, to the extent that the National Heritage Council allocate money for archaeological excavations, does that not cut across existing allocations for archaeological excavations by the Office of Public Works through and with the assistance of the Royal Irish Academy?</P>

The National Heritage Council work in the closest possible co-operation with the Office of Public Works and in many respects the Office of Public Works are the agent of the National Heritage Council in various areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the reply I got yesterday to 14 questions <Col N="73" /> for written reply covering the whole range of Government Departments the biggest employer of disabled persons were the Department of Defence with 4.68 per cent and the lowest were the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications with 0.47 per cent?  Is he aware there is a great need in some Departments to increase the percentage of disabled persons?  What targets have the Government set for the employment of disabled persons in Government Departments?  What target is he hoping to achieve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The target is a longstanding one of 3 per cent.  I accept that in some Departments the situation is not satisfactory.  To some extent that arises from the embargo on public service recruitment.  The Deputy can readily appreciate that the embargo would have a restricting and damaging effect on the employment of disabled persons.  At the moment we are considering that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a timescale at this stage because a number of factors affect the situation. The Deputy for instance, instanced the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.  That is a newly formed Department and therefore probably suffered more in this regard under the embargo.  I assure the Deputy that the impact of the embargo is being studied and we hope to take some action on it fairly soon.</P>

As I said in the House last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is joint Co-Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, has given assiduous and diligent attention at all times to Northern Ireland matters, which are, of course, for consideration also in the wider context of Anglo-Irish relations.</P>

The Secretary of State, also in the same context, mentioned his difficulty with regard to the trade union leaders.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a submission from FLAC which calls for further expenditure on legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already explained on a number of occasions, it is the intention to extend the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a phased basis as scarce financial resources permit.  In pursuance of that policy, I obtained the Government's agreement to substantial increases in the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board for 1990 and 1991.  The recent increase, <Col N="82" /> which brings the grant to nearly £2.5 million, will enable the board to open further law centres this year.</P>
    <P>So long as the State scheme of civil legal aid remains in need of further resources, it seems to me that any funds available to me for legal aid must be devoted to that scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication of the Minister's reply is that he has rejected the first ground of the submission from FLAC which is to partly fund the Coolock Law Centre.  Is he now telling the House that he has no proposals to aid or assist that centre which, because of the work it does, saves his own scheme a substantial work load on the north side of the city of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully acknowledge that the Coolock Law Centre are doing an excellent job.  It was for this reason that the Minister for Social Welfare, through the Combat Poverty Agency, committed himself to providing funding for the law centre for a period of three years.  I recognise that there is need for extra funding for the civil legal aid scheme throughout the country and it was with this in mind that since 1989 I achieved an increase of nearly £1 million in funding for the civil legal aid scheme to enable the Legal Aid Board to open new offices, to extend full-time offices and a number of part-time offices and to employ extra solicitors in providing advice on the new rape legislation. There is a commitment but I am afraid unlimited funding is not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than dwell on this matter I urge the Minister to look again at the needs of the Coolock Law Centre in particular because a little extra would go a long distance for that centre. Would he indicate if he has made any proposals to the Legal Aid Board on the way the additional funding should be spent and on where centres might be opened?  The Minister is no doubt aware that in their submission FLAC proposed a major new centre for Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Although not on a <Col N="83" /> statutory footing, it is up to the Legal Aid Board to decide where the centres should be located and how the new money will be spent.  At present I am considering a proposal that three new permanent centres should be provided and that some of the temporary centres should be expanded.  However, I do not have the final say and it is up to the board to decide where they should open centres.</P>

I recognise that this is not sufficient but I also recognise that civil legal aid can be provided in other ways.  I am looking at a couple of ideas and I have had discussions with a number of groups.  I will speak about this in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen media reports of the survey on under-age drinking referred to in the first question.  I am seeking a full report on the findings of the survey and it would be inappropriate for me to comment until I have had an opportunity to study the report.</P>
      <P>With regard to prosecution of juvenile offenders under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, I am informed by the Garda authorities that records of prosecutions are not maintained in such a way as to permit immediate identification of those involving juvenile offenders.  I have asked the gardaí to compile the relevant figures and I will make them available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under-age drinking were included in the 1988 Act.  In essence, the Act is designed to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to lawfully purchase alcohol, or to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to monitor carefully the operation of the controls contained in the Act.  I am glad to say that there are some indications that the controls are having the desired effect and I shall continue to keep the matter under review.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, legislation alone cannot be expected to solve the problem of under-age drinking.  A broader approach, having regard to the social, cultural and economic factors involved, is required.  Gardaí are playing a prominent role in organising local programmes to deal with the abuse of alcohol and other substances by young people and they are willing to help with such local initiatives wherever these are contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> My colleague, the Minister for Health, has in a reply to a Question by Deputy Tom Kitt on 25 October 1990, set out details of programmes for the education of young people in regard to alcohol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the findings of the national survey which disclosed that the average age at which children begin drinking has fallen to twelve and a half years and that two-thirds of the pupils surveyed disclosed that they had never had any formal advice or education in relation to alcohol?  Will the Minister explain why the regulations for the introduction of identity cards, as provided for under the 1988 Act, have not been made?  Will he also inform the House why the order in relation to the sale of alcohol in supermarkets has not been brought into being, despite the fact that this Act went through in 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Act is major legislation which is in many ways the benchmark for legislation in this area.  Section 40 gives the Minister power to make regulations providing for the issue of age cards.  Two matters will greatly influence my decision on a national age card scheme.  First, the extensive range of controls contained in the 1988 Act is being monitored to see how well they are working and early indications are that they are having an effect.  A national age card scheme could only be justified if it could be shown that it would make an impact on the problem of under-age drinking.  There is no evidence that it would add significantly to the effects of the curbs which were introduced in 1988. Because of the social and behavioural aspects of the problem, any legislative curbs can only have a limited effect. Second, because the problem is primarily one for society to tackle, albeit with as much help as the Government and agencies can offer, I am monitoring the situation.  In relation to identity cards, there has been tremendous interest shown in several parts of the country. There are some very successful examples &mdash; in Greystones, for instance &mdash; of communities running their own local identity <Col N="86" /> card schemes.  I believe that is the way forward.  I will admit a personal reluctance to introduce a scheme whereby every young person would have to carry an ID card, such a scheme being operated by the Garda on behalf of the State.  I am very reluctant to move on this matter. Regarding the whole question of under-age drinking, it is a major social problem which affects families.  In some cases parents drink to excess and allow their children to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of moderation, self-control and abstinence is an important part of alcohol education programmes.  This is not just about legislation. Regarding the implementation of that section of the Act dealing with the sale of alcohol within supermarkets, there has been considerable discussion between the trade and my Department. The Deputy will be aware of concern expressed by the trade at the coming into force of the Act.  This concern has increased ever since.  I am conscious of the need for implementation but I want to bring in something which is sensible, reasonable and workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised at the Minister's reply.  It is over three years since the Act was brought into being. He says he has a hang-up about people carrying identity cards.  I would ask him whether it is worse to carry an alcohol problem or an identity card.  The Act provides for the issue of identity cards from his Department on a voluntary basis.  In view of the fact that the Minister did not get a chance to study this survey, I will tell him that 50 per cent of 15 year old girls abuse alcohol, while 50 per cent of 15 year old boys admitted that they took their first drink to get drunk.  It is extraordinary that the Minister should say that the provisions of the 1988 Act are working when the survey clearly shows that alcohol abuse among young people is on the increase.  Will the Minister make the regulations provided for in the 1988 Act for the issue of voluntary <Col N="87" /> ID cards and also arrange for the introduction of some sort of educational programme, particularly in our schools, relating to the abuse of alcohol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already in operation a programme of Garda visits to schools which is being extended throughout the country.  There is a full-time juvenile liaison service within the Garda Síochána co-ordinating the national effort and working very well.  I am slightly taken aback by the extreme language used by the Deputy who seems to suggest that the carrying of ID cards alone will prevent the problem of alcoholism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in favour of the issue of cards on a co-ordinated voluntary basis involving the local community. I have been trying to encourage such schemes around the country.  It is interesting to note that the survey to which the Deputy refers also shows that the young people involved took their first drinks either in the presence of their parents or in their own homes without the permission or knowledge of their parents. No ID scheme will stop that problem.  I share the Deputy's deep concern about the abuse of alcohol by young people but society as a whole has a responsibility, as well as legislators.  I reiterate that I have strong personal reservations about the idea of every young person being forced to have an ID card.</P>

      <P>I have seen a newspaper report on the Childline statistics.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Law Reform Commission's report on child sexual abuse is concerned, a Bill dealing with evidence in criminal matters is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department. That Bill will take account of the commission's recommendations made in that report regarding the giving of evidence by children in sexual abuse cases.  The other matters dealt with in the report which come within my area of responsibility are being examined in my Department as a matter of urgency and legislative proposals which I will have in relation to them will be announced in the normal way as soon as possible.</P>

Would the Minister agree that we should consider making it obligatory for doctors and health workers to report cases of child sexual abuse, as recommended in the Law Reform Commission's report?  In view of the increase of 11,000 calls this year as against last year, would the Minister agree that we cannot await this legislation any longer? Would the Minister also explain why it is taking his Department so long to produce this legislation in view of the fact that the Law Reform Commission have produced a very detailed report on child sexual abuse?  I would like to hear the Minister's views, particularly on the obligation on people such as doctors and solicitors to report child sexual abuse cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much merit in what the Deputy said.  The areas in the report that fall to my responsibility are the whole question of barring orders, covered in recommendations 28-33, which recommend a radical extension of barring order law in a number of directions. That is being examined in detail at present.  The other sections and recommendations 34-47, and court proceeding recommendation No. 62, deal with criminal law and unlawful sexual intercourse. I can assure the Deputy that this is receiving urgent attention in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that legislation will be brought forward by me. In relation to evidence in child sexual abuse cases, covered by recommendations 48-61, as I have already said, legislation in that regard is very well advanced and I hope to be in a position to introduce it very shortly.  I share the Deputy's concern and every right thinking person would, that whatever protection society and the State can provide for children to safeguard them against abuse, whether sexual or otherwise, should be provided and I can assure the Deputy that I will not be delaying this legislation.  This report, as the Deputy knows, only became available in the <Col N="90" /> autumn of last year and I can assure him that I am doing everything I possibly can to bring into effect the sections for which I have responsibility.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="91" /> Law Reform Commission were requested by the Attorney General to examine conveyancing law and practice in areas where this could lead to savings for house purchasers.  They have produced two reports in this area to date and these will be considered in my Department in the normal way, along with further reports which are expected from the commission in connection with this matter.  Any proposals for legislation in this area will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>
      <P>My Department are also responsible for the administration of the 25 local land registries throughout the country.  The offices in Galway, Roscommon, Sligo and Castlebar are linked to the central Land Registry computer system in Dublin, for the purpose of dealing with new folios.  This facility will be extended and the result will be a more streamlined and efficient service to local applicants for Land Registry folios which are required for conveyancing and other purposes.</P>
      <P>In relation to probate, the recording and processing of probate and administration work is computerised in the Central Probate Office in the Four Courts, Dublin, and the system is working satisfactorily and efficiently.  My Department are planning to link the 14 district probate offices to the computer in Dublin.  This link will allow district offices to deal more promptly with applications for grants of probate and letters of administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>First let me say I am glad to hear that certain positive steps have been taken.  May I ask the Minister when he would expect the contents of the report to be put into operation?  Would the Minister agree also that the delays in this area are causing great public concern and are causing great difficulties in certain commercial activities?  There are delays of nine months to a year in some cases of conveyancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Deputy.  The legislation will come as soon as possible.  These reports are among a number of reports <Col N="92" /> from the Law Reform Commission which are being worked on at present.  I assure the Deputy that I share his concern on the effect these delays have on commercial operations throughout the country.  However, much work has been done since we discussed this in this House early last year and late the year previous to that.  I am pleased to be able to say to the Deputy that in dealings which cover all operations of Land Registry, etc., we had 91,381 dealings in 1989 and we had 92,627 dealings last year, an increase of 1.4 per cent but most importantly from the delay point of view the output from the offices in 1989 was 72,668 dealings and in 1990 the figure rose to 93,000, an increase of 28 per cent.  There has been a considerable increase in the output from the Department and I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating the Registrar and all concerned in the registries for the work they have put in. There has been a decrease in the backlog &mdash; although the backlog is still unacceptably high &mdash; but it is being tackled.  The Deputy will be aware that the decision to establish the registries as a semi-State operation has already been taken and work on the preparation of that is already underway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reaffirmation of the decision &mdash; I wondered whether it had been lost in the original answer &mdash; that an independent semi-State body will be established incorporating the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  Would the Minister agree that the area of conveyancing is probably one of the most closed of all closed shops <i>vis-à-vis</i> the legal profession, and solicitors, in particular, and that unless the Minister brings in amending legislation dealing with the rules of conveyancing, we will never break that monopoly? Do the Minister's proposals for legislation include recognition of the Fair Trade Commission report which clearly and strongly recommends the breaking up of the conspiracy of the professions in regard to conveyancing?  Finally, could the Minister give us an indication as to when the independent semi-autonomous <Col N="93" /> body dealing with the Land Registry and other matters will be established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on the establishment of the semi-State structure and the legislation for it is well advanced.  A group, including civil servants and outsiders, are looking at the registry in preparation for the establishment of the semi-State structure. Work is well advanced.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposal to amend the law to allow people other than solicitors to practise conveyancing, which is really what the Deputy is getting at, I pointed out in a reply on 19 February last that the recommendations and conclusions of the 1990 Fair Trade Commission report on the legal profession about the provision of a conveyancing service are being examined and the decisions reached will be announced in the normal way in due course.  With regard to the Deputy's point about the commission's report, let me say there was no unanimous recommendation about the removal of the present restrictions on non-solicitors providing conveyancing services for reward.  The commission's chairman favoured the ending of the restricting, but only after the process of land transfer has been simplified.  The other commission member did not favour the creation of a new class of licensed conveyancer so there was no strong recommendation from the Fair Trade Commission on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the major obstacles to any house purchaser is the whole question of bridging loans and the interest paid for the duration of the bridging finance?  Would the Minister clarify once and for all whether he agrees with the opinion given in the commission's report that there should be a separate class of conveyancing clerk?  There are two options in the report and may I ask the Minister which option he favours?  Would he also react to the opinion around the country that there is no political will to make real changes in the professional conspiracy that Deputy McCartan says exists?</P>

      <P>In regard to the problems created for young couples and others buying homes because of bridging finance, of course I am aware of them, as any Deputy in this House dealing with constituents would be.  Everything that can be done should be done to reduce those delays.  That is what I am attempting to do with the speeding up of the Land Registry operations and also in the new Solicitors Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he is being unfairly complimentary to himself when he speaks of the fact that the backlog in the Land Registry has been in any way diminished in the past 12 months.  Is the Minister aware that the simple process of photocopying a map can take anything up to six months and that the issue of a land certificate, a three page document, can take anything up to seven months?  Could the Minister not be more precise as to the nature of his reforms?  Is he further aware that if a person owns his land, house or whatever for a period of 40 years and an application is made to the Land Registry for the issue of the title documents, he is presumed to be dead?  Such is the cumbersome and farcical nature of our conveyancing procedures that an owner of land for 40 years must produce a certificate that he is alive and that he is entitled to his title documents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the operation of the Land Registry, I think it is reasonable to be complimentary to the registrar, to the staff and, indirectly to myself.  If there has been a 28 per cent increase in the work rate of the office, that is reasonable within 12 months and I think they are to be congratulated on it.  The fact is that the Deputy's party were in Government for many years and nothing was done about it.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the legislation on juvenile crime to include a range of alternative penalties to detention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a wide range of alternatives to custody available to the courts for the purpose of dealing with offenders &mdash; including juvenile offenders.  For example, all the alternatives recommended at paragraph 2.12 of the Whitaker report were already in place at the time of publication of that report, with the exception of provision for the confiscation of assets in certain cases.  The House will be aware that I am at present considering proposals for the introduction of such confiscation measures and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in that regard in the near future.</P>
      <P>The use of alternatives to custody has expanded considerably since the Whitaker report was published and there is ample evidence of the extensive use of such alternatives in the case of juvenile offenders in particular.  At present there are over three times as many offenders under the age of 21 on alternatives of various kinds as there are in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not, I think, be fully appreciated that a high proportion of juvenile <Col N="96" /> offenders in custody have already been through a range of alternatives in respect of earlier offences.  In other words, custodial sanctions tend, broadly speaking, to be used as a last resort, though there may of course be exceptions.  It is an unfortunate fact of life, however, that alternatives to custody do not work in the case of certain very persistent offenders and that they would simply be inappropriate in the case of serious offenders &mdash; some of whom, incidentially, are juveniles. In such cases it becomes essential in the interest of protecting the offenders concerned and the community in general to apply a custodial sanction.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy and the House that I strongly favour the use of alternatives to custody, whenever possible. That is why, as part of his law enforcement package for 1991, the Minister for Justice announced plans for the recruitment of 31 additional probation and welfare staff, for assignment to the task of providing special supervision for about 200 offenders, including juvenile offenders, in the community.  Two drop-in centres will also be provided for these offenders &mdash; one in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
    <P>Given the fact that the range of alternatives to custody already in place appears to be quite adequate and that they are being widely used, I do not have proposals at this time for further legislative provision in this regard &mdash; with the possible exception of provision for confiscation of assets to which I referred earlier.  I shall, however, keep the matter under review and if any legislative change appears to be desirable, announcements will be made in the usual way.</P>
    <P>While it is not an alternative to custody as such, inasmuch as it is not an alternative penalty available to the courts, it is relevant to mention also the Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme, which provides for persons aged 17 years or younger being cautioned and supervised, as an alternative to prosecution.</P>

      <P>In 1989, the number of <Col N="97" /> new cases dealt with under the scheme was 2,716.  Last December the Minister for Justice announced a number of improvements in the operation of the scheme, including the establishment of a national juvenile liaison office to oversee the operation of this scheme throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was motivated by the fact that at regular intervals chronic cases come before the court and the justices discover that there is no place available for them.  For example, there was a report in yesterday's paper about a chronic case in Dún Laoghaire, a 13 year old boy for whom there was no place available and who was sent back to the community.  Surely the Minister should ensure that chronic cases like that are sent to places of detention suitable to their difficulties where they can get a modicum of assistance at least.  The Minister has thrown some beautiful figures in our direction but the system he is operating at the moment is not catering for the type of client it should be catering for.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent warning issued by the Prison Officers' Association that they will initiate industrial action next year if prison conditions are not substantially improved for both inmates and staff; if his attention has been drawn to the particular concern expressed by both prison staff and prisoners about the lack of in-cell toilet facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the statement made by the Prison Officers' Association and when the Minister for Justice met them on 10 December last, prior to announcing his law enforcement package for 1991, he informed them of his plans for the general improvement of prison accommodation.</P>
      <P>In the current year our Department will spend in the region of £8 million on building and maintenance in prisons.</P>
      <P>Sums of this magnitude have, in fact, been expended on such works year-in year-out over a number of years.  While part of this expenditure has arisen from the need to upgrade certain security featues in prisons, a considerable amount of it has also been directed towards the general improvement of physical conditions.</P>
      <P>The specific improvement referred to by the Prison Officers' Association, and now by the Deputy, is the provision of in-cell toilet facilities.  The Minister for Justice dealt with this matter in announcing the 1991 law enforcement package.  For the purpose of dealing with the Deputy's question, it would perhaps be best to quote from the statement issued at the time by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke.  He said:</P>
      <P>The provision of in-cell sanitation in all prisons has understandably been the subject of long standing demand from various sources.  Technical advice in the past was generally to the effect that it would be next to impossible to provide it in older institutions.  At my request, the whole matter has been examined afresh and I am glad to say that due to technological advances, it is now possible to make progress in this regard.  I am pleased to announce the following: (1) All new prison accommodation being planned includes the provision of in-cell sanitation.</P>

      <P>(2) the new unit in Mountjoy Prison for offenders with infectious diseases who need specialist care includes provision for in-cell sanitation and construction of this unit will proceed in 1991; (3) plans for a replacement block in Limerick Prison includes in-cell sanitation; (4) in-cell sanitation will now be provided as part of the total refurbishment of St. Patrick's Institution and Mountjoy's Women's Prison; (5) Wheatfield and Fort Michel already have this facility; 24-hour access to toilets is provided in open centres and the training unit; (6) between work completed and now planned, about 40% of offenders will have 24-hour access to toilets within about two years &mdash; this will represent a major advance on the situation which applied in the past.  I am now examining the possibilities for further progress in this regard.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister of State whether the Minister's meeting with the Prison Officers' Association on 10 December 1990 succeeded in lifting the threat issued by the association of industrial action in the coming year and whether it is intended to continue meeting with them to liaise on this important issue?  Secondly, would he not consider it desirable to set a time schedule now for the introduction of in-cell toilet facilities for all prisoners in the State in a set period as happened in the United Kingdom? There they have set a period of seven years and in Scotland they set a period of three years.  We should show that we are serious in our attempt to end the filthy Victorian habits of asking grown adults to stand in long queues with buckets of slop as they move to the one receptacle to dispose of it in the morning and evening.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a media report of 19 February 1991 relating a cancer link with the use of radar guns for speed checks; if he will confirm that no such risk is attached to the use of this type of equipment by the Garda, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that the speed detection equipment used by the gardaí is in any way harmful to the health of those using it.  I am aware of a recent media report which indicates that a study in America found that some radar speed meter devices used by police forces there <Col N="104" /> may emit excessive radiation affecting its users.  I am assured that the type of equipment referred to in the media report is not in use here.  The new hand-held &ldquo;speed guns&rdquo; being introduced on the force at present are the most modern such devices available and have been developed and tested for safety and other purposes by Government authorities in the UK.</P>
      <P>The speed detection devices used by the gardaí are in widespread use by police forces in other member states of the European Community and the Garda authorities are not aware of any difficulties encountered on health grounds with this equipment in these countries.</P>
      <P>The suitability and safety of equipment in general that is used by members of the Garda Síochána is, of course, the subject of ongoing attention and regular assessment. Speed detection equipment is no exception in this regard and, while there is nothing to suggest that any such equipment in use by the Garda poses any threat to members of the force who use it, I can confirm that as part of the process of ongoing assessment to which I have referred, an examination of safety aspects of this equipment is being conducted by those professionally qualified to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to create any anxiety about the report which appeared in the newspaper, although at the time it created a great deal of anxiety among members of the Garda and their families. Can the Minister say whether the equipment used by the Garda Síochána and to which he referred, is made in the United States?  The Minister said he was not aware of any harmful effects this equipment might have.  May I ask him how he was made aware that the equipment was not harmful?  He said an examination is now being undertaken.  I assume he will know when the examination is completed what effects this equipment may have. That is the information I want to elicit from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The equipment used here is not the same as the equipment used in <Col N="105" /> the US.  It is supplied here by an agent from the company who supply Garda equipment generally in the Dublin region.  There are many different models of speed detection equipment on the market both in the UK and the US but the equipment used here is not used in the US.</P>
      <P>With regard to where the equipment is manufactured, I will have to come back to the Deputy on that point.  So far as any threat to the health of gardaí is concerned, as I indicated in my reply there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that any of the types of speed detection equipment used by the Garda is in any way harmful to health.  The Deputy will be aware that the equipment is, firstly, used outside, it is a handgun and, secondly, detection is not within the confines of cars, it is outside cars.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is exposure to radiation everywhere.  I am not an expert on the subject but radiation can come from equipment such as televisions, radios and computers.  I understand that the equipment being used by the Garda is perfectly safe.  As I said, as part of an ongoing assessment an examination of the safety aspects of the equipment is being conducted by those professionally qualified to do so.</P>

May I put it to the Minister that the use of this equipment will have absolutely no effect until such time as he makes a commitment to outlaw the use of radar detectors and that irrespective of the type of modern radar equipment he puts at the disposal of the Garda Síochána it will be rendered completely useless due to the widespread use of radar detectors?  I have raised this issue with the Minister on numerous occasions in the past and he has made promises both inside and outside the House.  May I ask him when this difficulty will be tackled?</P>

      <P>So far as the operation of <Col N="106" /> speed traps, speed guns and radar detectors is concerned, the figures available to me do not substantiate the accusation made by the Deputy that there is a failure to prosecute.  The number of prosecutions indicate that this equipment is proving to be very successful.  I have great faith that with the increased manpower and equipment we will see considerable improvements in safety on our roads in the period ahead.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether there is a growing problem of domestic violence against women and that women are very often intimidated into not pressing charges; and if he has any proposals to deal with this problem.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is very difficult to assess accurately the full extent of the problem of domestic violence against women in this country.  For a variety of reasons many such incidents are not reported to the Garda and even where formal complaints are made victims are often reluctant to come forward and give evidence in court against a spouse or partner. I understand, however, that failure to do so can very often be attributed to social factors, such as financial dependence, or not wishing to break up a family unit, rather than to intimidation.</P>
      <P>While a prosecution may be taken in such cases without the co-operation of the victim herself where there is sufficient evidence available otherwise, in practice the victim's evidence is very often crucial to the successful prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Domestic violence against women is totally unacceptable in any civilised society and the full protection of the law must be afforded to women who find <Col N="107" /> themselves in such situations.  Successive Ministers for Justice have recognised the need to afford greater protection to spouses and children and have, in recent years, introduced a number of measures with this in mind.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are also very alert to the problems referred to by the Deputy and gardaí have, in recent years, undergone specialised training to enable them to deal sympathetically and effectively with the victims of domestic violence. This should give confidence to such victims to approach their local gardaí for assistance if and when required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there is growing concern at the increase in the level of domestic violence.  Would the Minister agree that because of fear or stress very often women will not press charges and, therefore, nothing happens to the culprits?  For that reason, would the Minister consider urgently amending the law whereby the Garda must prosecute in cases of domestic violence?  Is the Minister aware that in countries where this has been done the number of incidents of domestic violence has dropped by up to 40 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the reported incidents of family disputes, it is extremely difficult to quantify the extent of the problem.  However, as an indicator, I can say that in the 12 month period from 1 November 1989 to 31 October 1990 the Garda responded to approximately 3,500 calls involving family disputes in the Dublin metropolitan area alone.  In the four month period from 4 November 1990 to 28 February 1991 the Garda responded to approximately 1,508 such calls.  These are appalling figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's suggestion, it comes down to making spouses compellable as witnesses for the prosecution in cases of domestic violence.  In many cases the evidence of the spouse is needed for a successful prosecution. There is an argument in favour of making this compellable but I must say I am <Col N="108" /> not convinced about it because in many instances cases are not followed up as the people involved are anxious to hold the family unit together.  I will have the Deputy's suggestion examined in detail and if he would like to come back to me in the House on it I would be delighted to respond to him.</P>
    <P>With regard to the measures which have been taken in the past by various Ministers, as the Deputy knows there have been changes in the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act and in the barring and protection orders under it.  The gardaí have the power to arrest without warrant in cases where there is reasonable cause for believing that a spouse is committing or has committed an offence under that Act.  These are very important powers.  Recently we discussed in the House the question of rape within marriage.  I am very pleased that that legislation has been passed and now has the force of law, backed up by assistance from the State through the Civil Legal Aid Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he will give careful consideration to the recent report entitled <i>Sexual Violence Against Women</i> published by the Council of Europe in which they make a number of recommendations?  Can the Minister say if he is satisfied that our police stations are properly equipped so that women who make complaints can be sensitively dealt with?  The Minister said that there are a number of training programmes for the Garda but is he satisfied that facilities in stations enable women to make their complaints in a confidential way and have them dealt with sensitively?  In other words, does he think that separate rooms should be provided for such women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable sums of public money are provided each year for the improvement of police accommodation. I agree with the Deputy that there is always room for improvement in relation to the facilities provided.  We try <Col N="109" /> as far as possible to provide the greatest privacy, care and attention for women who are normally in a very distressed state when they come into stations to report such incidents.  As I have already said, the Garda are very alert to the problem. They have undergone specialised training, and that training is being updated all the time.  They want to deal as sympathetically and as effectively as possible with the victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question on European initiatives in this area, on 14-15 March Ireland will be represented by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, at the first international conference of European Ministers on the subject of physical and sexual violence against women.  One of the aims of this conference is to agree a solemn final declaration on policies to deal with such violence, and signatories will commit themselves to taking policy initiatives to tackle physical and sexual violence against women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to continue the points I was making before I reported progress.  I want to reassure the House that it is the intention of the Government to give full recognition to the special position of the workers and beet growers in making available to them preference shares at discount rates.  In addition the company have agreed, in consultation with the Government &mdash; this is very significant &mdash; to make loans available to the workers at 10 per cent interest rate for the purchase of the shares, which will in any event be at a preferred level and not at the level that would prevail on the open market.  As I mentioned already, the interest on these loans will be tax deductible.  I mentioned that particularly to Deputy Sherlock who was understandably anxious to be reassured that workers would be not only interested in but able to acquire the shares.</P>
      <P>I addressed another point from Deputy Kavanagh and I will reiterate the position so that there will be no doubt as to the exact breakdown of shareholding.  The shareholding of the Minister for Finance will be 45 per cent.  In addition, the Minister for Agriculture and Food will hold a special share &mdash; we will debate that in a moment when we come to that section &mdash; which gives power to protect a whole range of issues that will ensure that the interests of the company, the workers and the beet growers cannot be undermined. When dealing with the special shares I will outline in detail what they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition &mdash; this is unprecedented, although what we are doing is new and therefore everything in that regard is unprecedented &mdash; shares will be made available to the workers and beet growers at a preferred level.  Discussions are continuing on an additional percentage to be made available to one or other of these <Col N="147" /> categories.  I hope that clearly demonstrates that the Government are getting the balance right.  We want to have sufficient shares to offer to the market on flotation.  We want to be able to attract funds for the development of this new company, Greencore, and also to return a dividend to shareholders.  This is the purpose of this exercise.  From what I have just said it should be evident that we have not only demonstrated our goodwill but much more than that, because it is not just a matter of soft words and sweet music: we have put it into practical, binding effect in most instances in terms of the legislation I am now asking the House to adopt but also supplemented by the articles of association of the company.  It should be clear that any talk of the sugar quota being disposed of &mdash; we will come to that in a moment &mdash; is out.  I cannot stop people from suggesting it but it is not even a remote risk.  There is no fear of multinationals gobbling up the company with workers and beet growers not being protected.  I hope I have demonstrated that what I always proposed to do &mdash; and Deputy Kavanagh's suggestions &mdash; are exactly in line.</P>

      <P>I hoped that my proposals and those of the Minister were in line and he was cleared, to some extent, exactly what the various holdings will be between the State and the private sector. If the Minister reads the explanatory memorandum he will see that this section also provides for the sale or disposal of shares held by the Minister in the holding company, following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to such specified persons and on such terms and conditions as the Minister may prescribe by regulation pursuant to this section. I assume that refers to employees and growers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone to extreme lengths when the matter could have been simplified if he had adopted <Col N="148" /> my amendment.  It is clear, from what the Minister said, that he will hold 45 per cent of the shares which cannot, under this Bill, be sold to the private sector. However, his successor may have a different attitude.  There could be a reshuffle and the Minister might go to the top of the class&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We might get a Progressive Democrat Minister who might have a totally different attitude from that of Minister O'Kennedy.  We are not trying to drag out this debate but, when the discussion is over, I want to be able to tell people who have come to me with their problems in relation to it that they need not worry because the Minister assured the House that he is holding on to 5 per cent and that no one can take that away and sell it in the Stock Exchange or anywhere else.  I want to be able to say that 10 per cent or more will go to the growers and employees and that there will be a special share to ensure even greater protection.</P>
      <P>We will shortly debate the special share so I will not speak about it now but I have many reservations in regard to it and its adequacy in future, particularly after 1992.  I know that the Minister believes that rights are built into the Bill and our concerns taken on board but it would have been much easier to do what we proposed, that he would hold 51 per cent of the shares and that there would be 15 per cent &mdash; or something approaching that &mdash; for the growers and workers.  I am not reassured that the Minister will not be able to sell part or all of his holding in the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I still stick by what I said earlier today.  Having discussed the matter with workers, it is clear that very often they are not in a position to take out loans or to pay additional taxes.  If the Minister wants to be specific and, as this is such an important matter, why was it not written into the Bill?  Will the Minister table an amendment to this effect so that we will see exactly what is in legislation instead of leaving it in mid air?</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that he would refer to the protection of the sugar quota and I await his reply to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that every detail cannot be included in legislation. We have entered into an agreement between the company and the workers but there are legal instruments in the articles of association, to which I referred already, which will cover the matter.  The Minister for Finance will be giving an undertaking in the prospectus in respect of the shares he holds.  I do not think I can go much further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question arose earlier regarding collusion between groups of shareholders; that is specifically prohibited under the articles of memorandum of association and, even in this legislation, it is quite clear that I have the power, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to prevent <Col N="150" /> the accumulation of shares above 15 per cent in the hands of any one individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating legislation which, we contend, has serious implications for the country and yet the Minister referred to articles of association which will contain the answers to some of the problems we raised.  Why have we not been supplied with a copy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock made a crucial point.  Before I came into the House I checked with the Bills Office as to whether they had seen the memorandum and articles of association but they do not know any more about it than I do.  I want to preface my remarks by saying that I am not questioning for one minute the Minister's veracity and I hope he will listen to me patiently.  So much of this hinges on the fact that section 2 empowers the Minister to do certain things subject to the memorandum and articles of association of the holding company. Having regard to the importance of this measure, it is asking us to accept a great deal to take some of the major questions with which the Minister dealt and sidelined by saying that they are adequately dealt with in the memorandum and articles of association.  We have not seen it and we do not know whether they are, for example, I would be very glad &mdash; at the risk of testing the Minister's patience &mdash; if he would again take us through the shareholding.  He made the point that collusion will be prohibited but I cannot see, practically or commercially, how that can be done.  I am all ears if the Minister wishes to explain.  Will the Minister again explain how the 45 per cent will be retained by the Government?  Surely, as Deputy Sherlock and Deputy Kavanagh said, the situation can change?  Let me give an instance; the whole purpose of this exercise is &mdash; at least partially &mdash; to raise funds for the diversification of the Sugar Company for their development and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose at any stage there is a rights issue or whatever as very probably there will be, and the new holding company <Col N="151" /> decide to raise money is the Minister going to subscribe to maintain the State's holding at whatever level it is when we enact this measure?  I understood the whole essence of the case was that there would be no further demands on the taxpayer. That was the merit of the agreement between the Minister and Deputy Deasy, but surely if we are to subscribe to maintain our stakeholding at what it is now, as is most probable, it will require an injection of funds by the taxpayer to maintain that stateholding.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of not taking the Minister at his word.  He has said he will be the first Minister to cause a flotation of a State company, but major elements of the pig-in-the-poke we are supposed to buy are side-lined away either in the memorandum and articles of association or in the protocol by the Minister for Finance to regulate the flotation.  That is asking us for a giant leap of faith in the circumstances.  I see no commitment to maintaining the level of the stakeholding at this stage.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain again how it is going to be 45 per cent in any event.  What we have heard so far is too vague, too hazy in terms of the commitments we have to date.  I have a second point about whether the 10 per cent will be subscribed by beet growers, workers and so on.  I would like clarification on the amount being retained in ownership by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated today, and I will repeat this in case it was not picked up by any Member or by Members generally, that the time of the flotation is the point at which the Minister for Finance will acquire his 45 per cent.  He cannot acquire 45 per cent in a company who have not been floated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At that point the Minister for Finance will acquire the 45 per cent but at what price or value I cannot say definitely because that will depend on the market flotation.  That is the clear position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> Everything about this legislation is, of course, new and, therefore, if I say something unprecedented is being done that is understandable.  The second point is that it is the intention of the Minister for Finance at that time to indicate the position clearly in the prospectus of the company so that all who have any interest in acquiring any equity will be aware of the position of the Minister for Finance. What more can one do?</P>
    <P>Many of the apprehensions discussed relate to the special share.  I said the special share is in addition to what is there in the name of the Minister for Finance which is a standard interest the Minister for Finance has in all State companies in any event.  As regards the workers and beet growers lest there be any doubt about it let me say the 10 per cent already designated is in addition to the 45 per cent held by the Minister for Finance.  There is in addition a likely 5 per cent increase over and above that 10 per cent in respect of one or other of those categories on terms perhaps slightly different from those involved in the 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>All that must indicate that we are concerned with not the holus-bolus sale of Irish Sugar but only part of it.  When I said we were talking about a restructuring in partial privatisation that was by no means gilding the lily.  That is what is involved and the restructuring and partial privatisation uniquely and quite properly have inbuilt guarantees for equity for the very first time for the workers of the Sugar Company.  Like other Members I have met those workers for a variety of reasons over recent years and I think they will welcome this greatly.</P>
    <P>I have now the figures for employment in the company when they were totally State dependent over the last number of years.  I hope the experience in terms of employment will be much more positive in the new dynamic we are introducing than it has been.  In 1981 there were 3,378 employees and by 1989 that had reduced to 1,556.  It increased to 1,757 last year but that was due in the main to the acquisition of Odlums by Siúicre Éireann,. Nobody, from whatever viewpoint, <Col N="153" /> would want to see that pattern continuing. We have an opportunity of literally ensuring the interests of all concerned and at the same time allowing Siúicre Éireann get out to the markets where there will be a great reception for them to expand to new ventures, new activities, new partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions on what the Minister said.  First, the Minister will find in my amendment that I was asking him at subsection 2 (a) that &ldquo;The Minister shall at all times maintain his equitable holding in the Holding Company at at least 51 per cent.&rdquo;  The Minister has told us he is going to take 45 per cent.  Section 2 (3) provides&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, the Minister for Finance will have the 45 per cent.  I will have the special share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can accept the guarantees the Minister is giving us today when I read in section 2 (3) that the Minister may sell &ldquo;... by redemption or otherwise, on such terms and conditions, including preferential terms and conditions, as he thinks fit, all or any of such shares&rdquo;.  That is the kernel of the difference between what he is suggesting in the Bill and what I am suggesting in the amendment.  We want shares to be maintained in the hands of the Minister for Finance for all time, whereas the Minister is saying in the Bill that at some future date he may change his mind and do whatever he likes.  That would be the position if the Bill goes through as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to leave the House under any illusion.  It is not the intention of the Bill to provide that something will be frozen in aspic for all time, that the Minister for Finance must hold that figure for ever and a day.  That may be the inclination but I am not prepared to say in the light of possible market developments that the Minister for Finance will specifically and absolutely hold on to 45 per cent of the shares. I am saying the Minister will make a <Col N="154" /> statement in the prospectus.  Apart from anything else, the market is not as rigid as a rock.  One has to have the capacity and flexibility to maximise the opportunities. I am not going to suggest for one moment that the Minister for Finance will divorce himself from that reality.  I do not want to leave the House under any illusion about it.</P>
      <P>Having said that, let me say that the guarantees about which Deputy Kavanagh is understandably concerned, do not attach to the amount of shareholding held by the Minister for Finance. The guarantees are written in the special share, and into the right of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in consultation to prevent the accumulation of shares above 15 per cent with any one shareholder.  One cannot get any better guarantee than that.</P>
      <P>Having regard to what I have already said in relation to the amounts being made available for the workers, the beet growers and so on, the total tied up would amount to 60 per cent; we are talking about floating 40 per cent.  Supposing an opportunity arose for a partner to develop somewhere in Europe, or wherever else, surely it would not be in the interests of the House, the workers or anybody else to say &ldquo;you cannot budge, because the Minister for Finance will insist, and he has no intention of reducing the 45 per cent&rdquo;.  There has to be something to float on the markets to enable the new company to have a degree of manoeuvrability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if that were to be the case and there was a possibility of something like that happening, we are not so hidebound that a change could not be made in the law?  I thank the Minister for at long last coming out and telling the House that there is a possibility that the 45 per cent can reduce.  What we are trying to do in my amendment is to prevent that happening.  At least we have that straight, and that is why my amendment stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this morning, I was chided for perhaps making a drafting error.  I might <Col N="155" /> as well try to deal with it now and perhaps the Chair can help me.  With the best advice from the Bills Office I was told that &ldquo;equitable holding&rdquo; was the proper term and not &ldquo;equity holding&rdquo;.  Deputy Garland tells me that it should be &ldquo;equity holding&rdquo;.  I know that will not stop the Minister opposing this amendment but if that is a problem in the drafting, I got it from another source.</P>

I believe that there are a small number of independent shareholders but nobody seems to know who they are. Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us who these apparently ghost shareholders are, because we will hear later about ghost sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was my clear impression during the Second Stage Reading that the Minister for Finance was to initially have a 45 per <Col N="156" /> cent holding in the new company but that that 45 per cent could and probably would be reduced as the new company became firmly established.  It is common sense that if there was a likely acquisition of another food company, which it would be in the interests of the new Greencore company to acquire, and they needed £20 million or £40 million for the acquisition of that company, one way of raising the funds would be to sell off some of the shares.  For argument sake, I would estimate the value of this company on the Stock Exchange at approximately £200 million, which would make 1 per cent worth approximately £2 million.  If one wanted to raise £20 million one might sell 10 per cent and so on.  I do not see why we should fudge an issue like that.  We should all be clear and say it out straight.</P>

I thought the Deputy said he had got advice from the Chair but I gather it was from the Bills Office which is a different matter.  Having looked at the Deputy's amendment it seems to me that the word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; is the appropriate word.  The House can agree that we substitute the word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; in place of the word &ldquo;equitable&rdquo;.  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a minor detail compared to what was revealed by the Minister in his latest statement.  As the debate continues and as the questions are put, more and more is being revealed.  What has now been revealed is that the 45 per cent shareholding could be reduced.  If it can be reduced at all, why can it not be wiped out completely?  I will give an example.  In November 1988 my party were invited to meet Mr. Goodman and his executive.  On that occasion the Thurles factory was being debated, and Mr. Goodman made it clear to us that his interest was in buying into the Irish Sugar <Col N="157" /> Company.  He was about to acquire a majority shareholding in Beresford, the British sugar company.  If he had done that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>He was near enough to it.  If this legislation had been there at that time it was open to him to acquire the Irish Sugar Company, and where would we be now?  Where would the Irish Sugar Company be now?  It would be down the tube and we would be importing sugar.  That is the problem we have with this legislation, unless the guarantee can be given.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was addressing the House last he produced a document which gave the figures relating to the number of reductions in the numbers of employees.  We know that.  That is old hat.  We know the number of employees was reduced from over 3,000 to 1,500.</P>

      <P>I stated that in September 1989 the Government, having considered a report on the series of options put to them for the company, decided that further analysis should be undertaken.  Accordingly, a small <i>ad hoc</i> group was set up comprising representatives of my own Department, the Department of Finance, the IDA and Siúicre Éireann to prepare a report on all the options for the company's future, including diversification with minimum financial risk.  The options were &mdash; I want the House to understand the reason I cannot use the term which Deputy Deasy suggests I should use: first, the continuation of the present activities and structures, which is the option the Labour Party and The Workers' Party prefer; second, total privatisation &mdash; I am not saying that that is the option which Deputy Deasy has suggested but he has said that he would use that term; and the third option was partial privatisation and commercial development of the company <Col N="159" /> while retaining a degree of State control over their sugar operations and the sugar quota.</P>
      <P>The Government deliberately decided of those three options that they would go for option No. 3.  That is the reason &mdash; I have done this already and I do not think it is necessary for me to do so again &mdash; I resist the suggestion that we are going for option No. 2.  I have given the reasons we are not going for that option.  Let me say to those Deputies who have spoken about the risk of our being swallowed up &mdash; I have said this so often I suppose I should not repeat myself again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is to elucidate detail.  I never wanted to give the impression that the figure of 45 per cent is fixed for ever more and I have no difficulty in acknowledging &mdash; Deputy Deasy argued persuasively in favour of the line I had adopted myself &mdash; that 45 per cent is the figure at which the Minister will buy in but I also said to Deputy Kavanagh, and Deputy Deasy agreed that this is desirable, having regard to the commitments already given to the workers, that if the only way of raising extra money to introduce a new dynamic development policy is for the Minister for Finance to dispose of shares at a particular time we do not want to see anything frozen in aspic at this time.  That having been said, when the company is floated the Minister for Finance will indicate in the prospectus his intentions for a specific period in relation to the figure of 45 per cent.  It would not be in the interests of anybody at this time to say anymore than that.  One can say all they like about technology but the facts are there.  The last thing that the unions want, and I have discussed this with them many times, is a continuation of this.  They have no ideological hang-ups and are concerned only about jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, and we will deal with this matter next, the real control lies in the special shareholding which will be <Col N="160" /> held by the Minister for Agriculture and Food &mdash; which is not at the amount of 45 per cent which will be held by the Minister for Finance &mdash; and which will protect the assets of the company, including the quota and a range of other matters.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to lay emphasis on the 15 per cent limit, on the fact that collusion will not be tolerated under the articles of association and that no one element or group will be able to combine together to acquire more than 15 per cent.  I think all the guarantees are there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to say if, in the event of a situation of the kind put forward by Deputy Deasy arises, he would give a commitment that the Government would subscribe to maintain their shareholding.  He did not answer the question at the time but has answered it since in reply to Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Sherlock.  We may as well be clear about this matter at this stage because I cannot understand why the Minister continues to talk in terms of part privatisation when we get him that far. As Deputy Deasy has said and I agree with him on this, what we are talking about is the privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company.  There is no point in dressing it up &mdash; Tadhg an dhá thaobh. It would suit Fianna Fáil to bring both sides of the road with them.  The fact of the matter is that we are on a slippery slope and a controlling interest will be disposed of.  As soon as the inevitable demand for more funds arises we will not maintain our stakeholding at 45 per cent and it will gradually be diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may well have a point when he says that for the remainder of this debate we should focus on the question of the special share but since Deputy Kavanagh's amendment relates to the question of what control we would have over critical issues like the quota and job creation, perhaps he could at this juncture of the debate say that we need have no concerns about control, that this will all be protected by the special share. I cannot see, once we formerly divest ourselves of a majority shareholding in <Col N="161" /> the company, how we are going to maintain control.  It is not acceptable for the Minister's Department to draft, complete and amend the memorandum and articles of association in preparation for the floatation without lodging them in the Dáil Library so that the rest of us can read them and give an informed response in this House to the articles of faith which he is asking us to believe.  He may well be right but why are the articles of association not available to us so that we can read them?</P>

      <P>I did not ask for them to be brought within the legislative framework.  All I asked is that they be made available in the Dáil Library so that we can read them as this is a critical question.  The Minister is quite right, if I did not have contacts with the trade union movement I would not even know about the figure of 45 per cent; he chose to give that commitment in advance to them.  We are being asked to study this legislation as Members of this House and not on the basis of what we have been advised outside of it.  I agree with Deputy Deasy when he says that what we are voting for <Col N="162" /> is the privatisation of the Sugar Company. It is perfectly legitimate for us on these benches and the Minister to hold our points of view but it is not fair for the Minister to allege that the Members on these benches are not concerned about the employment trend, that somehow we approve of the trend that he outlined and that we oppose a reversal of that trend so that more jobs can be created by the Sugar Company and in the food sector. That is not our objective for all of the reasons &mdash; and I do not want to take up the time of the House &mdash; that we put forward before progress was reported earlier today.  Our primary concern is that we should maintain control over this segment of the food industry because we could use it as a vehicle for job creation. That is the critical issue.  I will take some convincing that we will have any control after this debate.</P>

I would also remind the House that there are other amendments that will be reached and we can have a discussion on the section.  I would suggest that the time has come when we should endeavour to dispose of this amendment, otherwise the Chair will have to be reminding Deputies and the Minister that they are guilty of repetition and discussing matter which is not pertinent to the amendment.</P>

      <P>We will now deal with amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Sherlock.  May I draw the attention of the Members of the House and ask for their indulgence while I suggest that as amendments Nos. 5, 6, 9, and 19 to 21, inclusive, are related and amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are consequential on amendment No. 6, it is proposed with the agreement of the House to take amendments Nos. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 20 and 21 together for discussion purposes, but as we have indicated in the past, separate questions may be put on any of the subsequent amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (2), line 29, after &ldquo;Holding Company.&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Such share shall not be disposed of by the Minister for Agriculture and Food or his nominees, nor shall it be so used as to diminish the said Minister's legal or equitable holding within the Holding Company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The all-important issue which we are confronting is the protection of the sugar quota.  Our sugar quota is 200,000 tonnes. The sugar is manufactured from the beet grown in our own fields and the back-up service given to the growers by the Sugar Company over the years is second to none, with the result that we have a very high quality product and the spin-off from that is very large indeed.</P>
      <P>The proposed shareholding in the new company has been debated at length and we are still not happy about what the exact position is. Section 2 proposes that the Minister, following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, will be able to exchange any shares of the company for the time being vested in him or his nominees for shares in the holding company, and acquire from time to time, by subscription, purchase, capitalisation issues or otherwise any share or shares in the holding company.  According to section 2 (2) it shall be lawful for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to acquire by subscription, purchase, capitalisation issue or otherwise and to hold upon, and subject to, the memorandum and articles of association of the holding company, a special share which shall be issued by the holding company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therein lies the kernel of the issue that we are now debating.  According to the <Col N="167" /> memorandum and articles of association of the holding company the Minister shall hold a special share which shall be issued by the holding company.  In the amendment I am proposing that the Minister shall not dispose of that special share. We have to ask ourselves &mdash; and I hope it will be stated clearly, categorically and unequivocally &mdash; whether it is legal under EC law for the State to insert in this legislation a provision for a special shareholding. If that is so and a guarantee can be given by the Minister to that effect, one would have to say, that perhaps the protection of the quota would to some extent be safeguarded in that the Minister cannot dispose of that share because it would be in the legislation.  Whether or not it would be referred back to the Oireachtas is another matter.  It is important that we are advised of what is contained in the memorandum and articles of association of the holding company because it is under those terms that a special share shall issue.  If that is not embodied in the legislation how do we know what control the Minister can exercise? It is, therefore, very important that all that information be given to the House this evening.</P>
    <P>It must also be stated clearly that the situation I talked about in the previous discussion will not come about, that a company which has a controlling share in a new company, Greencore, will in fact be a company with control of our sugar quota.  What does the sugar quota mean to Ireland?  It means that the production of sugar is guaranteed by EC law provided that we have a company that is prepared to manufacture sugar here. There is nothing to stop any company from importing sugar if they can do it at a cheaper rate than it is being made here. We export a certain amount of sugar from that seed quota, or we have done so in previous years, so what is to stop any company importing sugar?  Therein lies the whole kernal of the issue, in this particular matter of the special share which the Minister, according to section 2 and the articles of and memorandum of association, will be holding.  The question, <Col N="168" /> therefore, is does that stand up under EC law?  Is it legal and, if so, will it be written into this Bill that the Minister holding such share will not dispose of it, consequently giving some hope that the interest of the Irish sugar industry and of the people of Ireland will be protected under this new legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 3, are in my name.  The purpose of these amendments is to put beyond any doubt what I undertook on Second Stage, namely, that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will not dispose of the special share or of any of the protections that fall from that special share.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I would introduce an amendment to leave that beyond any doubt.  To simplify matters, what I am effectively doing in these various amendments, because some are consequential amendments, is deleting the provision which, on the face of it, would enable the Minister to dispose of the share.  Accordingly there is no right provided for in the legislation for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to dispose of the special share.  The advice given to me by the Attorney General is that that is the best way to give effect to the intention we had, namely, to make it clear to the House that the protection of this special share was, from the Government's point, an integral and essential part of the legislation.  I do not need to say why it was introduced originally.  Incidentally, it was introduced on legal advice for what is called completeness. Now that we have made it clear to them that whatever completeness represents, we want to have clarity beyond yea or nay, it is coming before the House in this form.  In any event I agreed in my consultations with the beet growers, the unions and the workers over a long period that provision should be made in the Bill that the special share would be there to protect these interests. Now I want to go a step further and make it clear that it cannot be disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock asked what was involved in the special share?  First, we must ensure that none of the following <Col N="169" /> consequences can arise without prior consent of the special shareholder, namely, the Minister for Agriculture and Food &mdash; incidentally, these will be enshrined in the articles of association of the company: any change in certain specified articles of association of the company &mdash; those that relate to control and direction &mdash; cannot be made without the consent in writing of the special shareholder, and thus, clearly something which we would all be most concerned about, the winding up of the company, cannot be done without the consent of the special shareholder; the sale of more than 49 per cent of Siúicre Éireann which, following the stock exchange flotation, will now be a subsidiary company of Greencore plc &mdash; in other words anything that would tend to give a controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann &mdash; cannot be achieved without such consent in writing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be vested in Siúicre Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Siúicre Éireann as such will not hold shares in Greencore. I will confirm the precise position in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disposal of specified sugar assets, including the Irish sugar quota, held by Siúicre Éireann cannot take place without the prior consent of the special shareholder. I do not need to tell the House the significance of the sugar quota.  The quota which is distributed among member states of the European Community at guaranteed prices is a vital national asset and we do not intend to allow it to become a tradeable commodity in the market.  That cannot be disposed of in any way without the consent in writing of the special shareholder. In addition, even the creation of a new class of shares in the company cannot be achieved without the consent in writing of the special shareholder.  Finally &mdash; and I have mentioned this already as being part of the commitment and I touched on it in the course of the equity breakdown &mdash; the building up by one shareholder or a consortium or shareholders, other than the Minister for Finance, of more than a <Col N="170" /> 15 per cent shareholding in the company after flotation, cannot be achieved without the consent in writing of the special shareholder.  These points are dealt with in detail in the articles of association of Greencore.  The House will appreciate that until such time as this legislation is passed those articles cannot be a legal binding document because they only take their authority from the legislation we are passing now.  The articles it is intended to include are in draft and they are the articles to which I referred to Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked what Siúicre Éireann will hold.  On the establishment of the new company, Greencore, Siúicre Éireann will be a subsidiary of that company and will be controlled by it.  The Minister's shares in Siúicre Éireann will be transferred to Greencore subject to all the conditions and regulations, I outlined during the last discussion on equity participation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I can add anything to clarify the position beyond giving this formal public, deliberate, commitment on my own part and on the part of the Government, namely, that this special share is a crucial element in the Government's approach to this new arrangement not only by way of protection, which is very important, but also as the means to maintain a Government supervisory role &mdash; which is all we ever had &mdash; in the direction of a company that in its new formation will have new opportunities in the markets.  For that reason it is not there to be a constraint; that would be to give the wrong impression, although constraints are built into it.  It is there to demonstrate clearly that this Minister and all succeeding Ministers will be bound by the same terms. If down the line in ten, 20 or 30 years on, for one reason or another, another Government with another intention in respect of the protection of the special share want to put that different intention into practice, they will have to come back before the Oireachtas and ask them to get rid of that provision.  The amendments I propose are in harmony with amendment No. 3 which has been proposed by <Col N="171" /> Deputy Sherlock, and for that reason they should commend themselves to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>What guarantees can the Minister give that this special share will safeguard the future of the sugar quota? What has been the European experience, particularly in Britain and France where they have adopted this green share?  Is it foolproof?  Can it be overturned by a decision of the European Court and could the whole sugar industry be thrown into chaos because of a possible future decision of the European Court?  Is there any danger of that happening and to what lengths has the Minister gone to placate the House and illustrate to us that this cannot happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the best legal advice available to us and that is, in the first instance, that it will protect the national quota.  We asked that this would be framed in such a way as to guarantee that.  So far as European law is concerned, I am advised that there is no objection to this provision provided it is not used in a discriminatory way so as to give an advantage to an interest in any member state over another.  That, of course, is a principle of European law.  If it was to be used to give a discriminatory advantage to Britain over Holland, Holland over Denmark or <i>vice versa</i> then, of course, in terms of competition law and the internal market they would say that this is not an acceptable application in harmony with European law.  The best legal advice I have received, which is the term normally used, indicates that not only will this formula protect our quota but it will not discriminate against European laws.  It is for this reason we asked for this formula.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my amendment was defeated, the golden share is the only means by which the national interest in the Sugar Company can be protected. The Government have indicated that they will not retain a majority shareholding in the company.  In this event the <Col N="172" /> protection of our national interest in the company will depend on the golden share.  I am afraid I have to say that the points made by the Minister up to now have made me even more concerned about this issue.  He said that the best legal advice he has received has indicated that everything will be safe.  I am sure the British Government used the best legal advice available to them in the case of the Birmingham Six, and we know what happened in that case.</P>
      <P>We will now have to depend on the golden share to ensure that our sugar quota is maintained and that the interests of the workers and growers and the national interest are protected.  This is the first time the golden share is being tried here.  This is being done at a time when evidence from across the water, where much of the thinking behind legislation brought before this House originates &mdash; I know this having been spokesman on Justice for the Labour Party for the past year and a half &mdash; has shown that the golden share has failed to protect the British Government's interests in particular companies and when Ministers changed, the thinking in regard to the golden share changed.  This is of concern to me.</P>

    <P>Deputy Deasy is now becoming concerned that our quota could be put in jeopardy.  He asked the Minister to give an assurance that Community legislation, national legislation and the memorandum and articles of association to which the Minister so often refers will be sufficient to ensure that our national interest in the Sugar Company will be maintained.  As Deputy Sherlock said, it is crucial that our quota is protected. Discussions are taking place on the GATT and the Common Agricultural Policy and changes will be made.  Our quota could be changed in the discussions in which the Minister will be involved over the coming months.  However, that is a slightly different matter.  Can the Minister say if our 200,000 tonne quota will be maintained or if it may be changed in the discussions which will take place? In a European context, if a majority of <Col N="173" /> countries go against the Minister's argument about the need to maintain our quota, will the quota be varied?  I hope the Minister can answer that question. This issue is germane to the debate on the Bill before us today.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Single European Market, the markets which will be open to this country after 1992 and the competition we will face.  The Minister has assured us that predators from outside the country will not be able to get their hands on the Sugar Company.  If this is the case, then I do not know why there is a need for a European Court of Justice.  When different countries disagree the case is usually sent to the European Court of Justice where generally the Community interest is put above the national interest in the final analysis.  If it is felt that the golden share interferes with the Community interest the safeguards provided in this Bill and the memorandum and articles of association could be put at nought in a year's time if a case is taken to the court by independent companies who are interested in the sugar quota or taking shares in the Sugar Company. I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that this cannot happen.  As has been seen in the case of British Telecom and companies in Britain, when other interests come into play the golden share can be varied.  This means that the provision the Minister is including in the Bill might mean nothing.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the golden share is all it is being held up to be by the Minister. It will only act as a very flimsy protection. There is no use harking back to a battle which has been lost, but I had provided for adequate protection in my amendment.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Murphy law can apply and so can Kavanagh's law.  It does not work out either.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty about our quota. Our 2 per cent quota is very small in a European context.  As I said in my Second Stage speech, France would take this up if they could get their hands on it.  It is very important that the quota system remains in place.  Whether the company are semi-private or private there is a danger that the Minister might decide to get rid of the quota system and if that were to happen there would be a difficulty. You cannot have a sugar industry without beet.  If the beet is grown in France it would be very difficult to swim across the Irish Sea, or up the river Shannon or the river Barrow, with beet in your mouth.  If the EC ever decide to do away with the beet quota the Minister can swim towards some place else.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Minister said he is quite satisfied from legal advice that the special share will protect the quote and so on as long as it <Col N="175" /> does not conflict with the interests of some other nation.  Can I take it that when the Minister says he has got legal advice he has got the best European legal advice?  That is the one part of the Bill I would have difficulty with.  Despite the protestations of other Deputies I am genuinely concerned about this Bill.  Perhaps it is of more concern to me than to many other Deputies, a part from my colleague here and Deputy Sherlock.  We come from areas that are very much involved in the growing of beet and the production of sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tease out this matter a little further.  I repeat that it is improper to ask us to deal with this legislation when we cannot refer to the articles of association.  The Minister said we cannot so refer because it is not a legally binding document until such time as this Bill is enacted.  There must be a draft in existence that conforms to what the Minister expects will be the shape of the legislation when it comes through this process and it would be helpful if we could see that.  I would like the Minister to explain how, as regards the ceiling of 15 per cent on any shareholder, collusion is prohibited?  If the articles are available I would like the Minister to put on the record of the House the precise article that prevents that happening.  In the normal cut and thrust of commercial life it is quite unclear as to how that would be feasible.  If the Minister says it prohibits collusion then I take his word for it, but I would like to hear precisely the formula of words that has been devised to achieve that purpose.</P>
      <P>Secondly, on the question of the inability to create new shares without the assent of the special shareholder, is the Minister referring to Siúicre Éireann or to the holding company in terms of the creation of new shares?  The Minister said that if any Government in the future do not agree with this provision they reserve the right to come back to the Oireachtas to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="176" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is self-evident. It applies to any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to put to the Minister is probably similarly self-evident, which is that no change is necessary. For example there is a 49 per cent ceiling on shares that may be held by Siúicre Éireann.  If the Minister of the day decides to give his assent the matter would not require to be brought before this House.  Is that not right?  If a case is put to the Minister of the day on any of the prohibitions enshrined in the articles of association the Minister of the day, as the special shareholder, may decide on the merits of the case to give his assent, in which case there is no necessity to bring it before this House.</P>
      <P>On the question of the efficacy of the golden share, the Minister is asking us to make an enormous act of faith in this critical regard &mdash; I agree with Deputy Browne that it is critical.  The Minister said he takes on board the import of Deputy Sherlock's amendment, but I find it difficult to understand why that was not taken on board <i>ab initio</i> if, as he says, it is so critical.  It would mean, for example, the excision of section 4 (2) (a) (iii) which provides that the Minister can dispose of the special share.  I am curious to know the thinking behind that in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The critical point is there is no finding, as I understand it, in European law that confirms the Minister's hopes, aspirations or affirmations in this regard.  There have been cases where the efficacy of the golden share has been called into question &mdash; we referred to them during the earlier debate &mdash; but there has been no finding that would enable the Minister to answer Deputy Browne's question by saying: Yes, I can tell you this will not be found to be in breach of European competition law.  That seems to leave a very big question mark over the entire venture in which we are engaged.  As sure as Deputy Kavanagh has instanced, this will be challenged by some major company for their own corporate interest. In that context and especially in single market conditions I would like to be <Col N="177" /> assured that the Minister has something stronger to go on than the opinion of the Attorney General, European lawyers and so on.  This is a major concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister earlier if he would give us the examples of the issuing of such shares in companies in Britain and France where I believe this idea originated.  How long has it been in operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised specifically by Deputy Deasy covers the last point made by Deputy Rabbitte. While there are of course special shares of this type existing in other countries, the Commission has not on any occasion taken issue with these special shares or the provision of them.  The Commission, being the custodians of the treaties and the law of the European Community, has indicated to us that it would not be its intention to raise the question of the compatibility of this with European law.  That is the best guarantee we have been given. Deputy Rabbitte said that cases may arise but no such cases have arisen.  I cannot speculate on what might happen in whatever circumstances at whatever time.  The best guarantee in all of this is the guarantee of the <i>res acta</i> of what has been done, of the establishment law, of the attitude of the guardians of the treaty, namely, the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission has not seen fit and do not propose to challenge the existence of special shares, and the indications are that it will not do so on this basis, subject to what I indicated to the House.  The Commission would of course &mdash; we would hardly have to wait for it to tell us &mdash; challenge the operation of the special share or other reserved powers of any Government in regard to any legislation if it were operated in a discriminatory manner between member states, in a way that would not be consistent with the treaties of the European Community.  We would hardly need the Commission to tell us that as soon as we would attempt to do that it would immediately activate its rights and obligations.  Again I indicate <Col N="178" /> there is no such intention and there is no reason that should happen in this case.</P>
    <P>The special share protects the company from takeover and this is what we are really concerned about.  I listened to the concerns expressed on Second Stage and &mdash; maybe unusually for a Minister &mdash; I decided that, in case there was a doubt in anyone's mind, in the House or outside it, I would bring in specific amendments to prevent the Minister for Agriculture and Food disposing of the special share. Because I did that it is a little disingenuous for the Deputy to labour the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Minister for Agriculture and Food were, at any time, to attempt to dispose of the special share and the powers that go with it, he would have to come back to this House to seek authority which does not exist at present. I never intended to have power to divest of something which I wanted to hold on to, put that way it seems contradictory, and I am now preventing myself &mdash; or a successor &mdash; from divesting himself of the special share.  That is the only guarantee I can ever give in respect of the important element in this share.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte addressed some other precise points.  The new shares about which we are talking and the protection against new shares being created are in respect of the holding company. The holding company is new and everything we are doing here is in respect of regulating the conditions under which the holding company can operate without interfering directly in its business or management. We are putting a legislative framework at the base of the holding company and the new shares refer to shares in the holding company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made about a political decision in the European Community in relation to the quota.  I wish to make two points in that regard; it is not for me to always represent the consistency of the European Community but it would be extraordinarily inconsistent of the European Community, which itself decided <Col N="179" /> that it would allocate national quotas between member states, to collude in breaking down the basis of the decisions which it took or to say that Ireland is discriminating against member states because it will not allow the quota &mdash; allocated nationally by Council decision &mdash; by doing so.  It would make no sense. The quota exists irrespective of whether this legislation is put through.  It must be self-evident that the golden share can only protect the quota there at any one time.  It does not mean that I can wave this legislation at the Commission or the Council of Ministers &mdash; I wish I could &mdash; and say that if there is any proposal to reduce the quota across the European Community Ireland's quota cannot be touched.  Am I to say that they can touch the Greeks, the Danes, the Dutch, the Germans, the French and the Italians?  It would be nonsensical to say that our quota could not be touched because I have a special share written into law. That would be nonsensical and I would have to rely on a more persuasive argument. There is no such proposal before us at this stage in the price negotiations, while there is a proposal to reduce the quota in the dairy sector, there is no proposal to reduce the quota in the sugar sector.  There is a proposal to reduce the price by 5 per cent which I am consistently resisting because, quite clearly, the sugar regime is self-financing and there is no justification for reducing its price by 5 per cent.  We will be arguing that for months.</P>
    <P>Of course, I cannot guarantee that, at some stage, the Commission may not suggest that there should be a reduction in the price of food all round.  However, I will fight that battle when it comes.  I just want to make it clear to the House that the rights of the special share are not in any way diminished or enhanced by any decision in respect of quota reductions which might arise.  If situations arise from time to time in other member states where Governments for their own reasons &mdash; and that is a matter for them &mdash; decide to take certain actions not to rely on the special share, that is their <Col N="180" /> decision in respect of their companies. There may have been one exceptional case &mdash; Jaguar &mdash; where the British Government decided to waive their rights because they wanted to facilitate a takeover as the company were in financial trouble.  However, that is another matter and it was done deliberately for that reason.  I do not have any such intention. I do not mean just me personally because I have had equal experience on both sides of the House for over 25 years and I acknowledge that I was never satisfied when a Minister assured me of his intention in regard to any matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made myself clear.  The quota is allocated on a national basis to member states by Council decision.  Our national quota resides with us and the nominee at this point is the Sugar Company.  Nobody can <Col N="181" /> take that quota from us.  I never said &mdash; it would be foolish to say &mdash; that the quotas in Europe cannot be proportionately reduced.  How could I say that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>My fear is not the protection of the quota from outside. Because of the system within the EC we are entitled to a sugar quota and I am concerned about the protection of the quota from inside our own country.  A new holding company is now being set up in which the Irish Sugar Company, as the Minister said, will be only a subsidiary as in the case of Greenvale plc.  Smaller divisions within the Irish Sugar Company are also subsidiaries.  The Minister did not deal with the supposed ban on collusion between the groups of people who would have the majority shareholding in that holding company.  Therefore, what is contained in the articles of association to indicate that that position is strengthened? Will the Minister clarify that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am equally satisfied that the special share poses the same obligations in respect of any domestic control, collusion or otherwise, as it does in respect of any control consortium that would arise between national and extra-national interests.  Of course it must, and it does, otherwise it would discriminate in any event.  I take Deputy Sherlock's point.  This was not framed just against any would-be invaders exclusively from outside the territory of this green island, far from it.  This is there to protect against <Col N="182" /> any collusion or takeover in respect of the basic share of the company.  That is why it is there.  I am not dismissing the possibility that somewhere along the line someone, internally or otherwise, would put his eye on the special share.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the facts.  We know the sugar operations are the core of this company and their great asset at the moment, before, as it is hoped, they launch into new ventures.  Let us face it, they have been a one-product company. They had the sugar operation, then Erin Foods and then Tuam Engineering, but not the diversity we would all like to see involved in a whole range of activities in that area.  The core is the sugar operation and no doubt as a result of the substantial restructuring and capital investment this is what will generate the substantial profits. I believe they can generate much more profit than they have done.  It is not for me; I am not managing director nor have I any designs on so being, but the whole range of issues, product development and market penetration in areas where the Sugar Company have not been involved can now be achieved and I want to see that.  I think Deputy Sherlock from his own experience will have some ideas in that direction too.  I want to see that core asset, without which they can do none of these things, being developed.  I have no doubt also that with the substantial profits that can be developed potential shareholders will view the profits of the sugar operations particularly as a major benefit, especially as they would generate a strong cash flow which could be used to strengthen the overall company. We are simply creating an opportunity to use this core to develop the assets of the company and secure the interests of the employees and, for that matter, the growers.  That is why the quota I am protecting in this special share is the key to everything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a relatively minor point.  The Minister did not reply to a question I put to him about existing shareholders in the present Sugar Company. Most of us would have assumed that the Minister for Finance was the <Col N="183" /> sole shareholder in the company, but I understand that is not the case, that there are a number of other shareholders, that their shareholding does not come to anything considerable but nevertheless they exist.  What percentage have those people overall?  I want to know the number of shares the Minister has, the number of shares these people have and what becomes of the shares these people have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are £500,000 in preference shares in the first instance in the existing company and these are held by various shareholders.  The intention is to make an attractive offer to these shareholders for their shares.  That is the extent of the shareholding this minute. With a view to gathering in those areas the intention is to make an attractive offer so that we can then have a greater degree of control of the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are preference shares only.  You cannot compare preference shareholdings to ordinary shareholdings, but for what it is worth I am told if £66 million or thereabouts is the ordinary shareholding we are talking about less than 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>On the next point which has been referred to a few times, I want to leave no loose threads hanging as far as the articles of association and the 15 per cent limit are concerned.  All I can say here is there are detailed provisions in the draft articles of association, extending over five pages, relating to the 15 per cent limit.  If Deputies do not have their copies of this draft, though there is no precedent for bringing in a document which has no legal effect at this point, I have no reservations about getting a copy of such draft as is there available for Deputies' perusal on the basis that it has no binding legal effect at this stage.  Perhaps it will enable Deputies to see the provisions that are there.  I have perused it and I can assure Deputies there are some very detailed provisions in it.</P>

      <Col N="184" /> In regard to a point Deputy Sherlock raised, I have been informed that the reference he made to Greenvale plc is inaccurate.

      <P>The Minister's amendment No. 9 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister for Agriculture and Food shall not dispose of the special share referred to in subsection (2) of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment I propose reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Shares shall not be disposed of by the Minister for Agriculture and Food or his nominee, nor shall it be so used as to diminish the said Minister's legal or equitable holding within the Holding Company.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are both moving for the same effect but the advice from the Attorney General is that it is preferable to provide separately at the end of the section that the special share may not be sold.  That is why I am proposing amendment No. 9.  The purpose of the Deputy's amendment after &ldquo;nominee&rdquo; is not clear because we are not talking about ordinary equity shareholding but about a share that resides only in the Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="186" /> Food and there is no question of a nominee in respect of this share.  With regard to ordinary shares the Minister could have a nominee just like everybody else. I will not have a legal or equitable holding in that sense within the holding company other than the special share which we are now protecting in the Bill.  The advice to me is that I am doing it in the right way.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's proposal to delete subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) would not just affect the special share.  I do not know whether or not that was the Deputy's intention.  The effect of the Deputy's amendment is that the Minister for Finance would not be able to dispose of the shares which he will acquire in the new holding company.  We dealt with that issue earlier.  Here we are dealing with the special share and the rights and obligations that go with it.  I indicated that the Minister for Finance will acquire up to 45 per cent in shares. Deputy Kavanagh said that he would like to see that frozen in granite.  I said I would not see it frozen in aspic.  For that reason the Deputy's amendment here is unacceptable although I understand what the Deputy is trying to get at.  The Deputy does not have the benefit of draftsmen and officials to work on it.  His amendment is not relevant to the section.</P>

      <P>According to the Minister's amendment No. 9 the Minister for Agriculture and Food shall not dispose of the special share referred to in subsection (2).  A special share is being provided for in section 2 (2) and is subject to the memorandum and articles of association of the holding company.  I wonder if on Report Stage the Minister will agree to write in what is contained in the articles of association which gives effect to the special shareholding on which such emphasis is now being placed, and which is accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear that if I was to introduce in this enabling legislation all the details that are in the articles of association, this Bill and others like it, would be unduly and unnecessarily complicated.  I have outlined specifically here today the purpose of the special share.  Its purpose is very clear and I cannot and will not walk away from that.  It is not a matter of opinion. The provisions to which I have referred today are included in the articles of association.  I think that should be enough and I cannot incorporate all of these things into them.</P>

Does the Minister intend to hand this operation to one of the private companies who generally deal with the private sector in the disposing of shares in new or existing companies?  They take pages in the newspapers setting out the details.  Are we entitled to discuss this matter at this stage?  I seek some assurances from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy.  It is very unrealistic that we should insist on the Minister holding his 45 per cent shareholding in future years. If we are realistic we must recognise that gradually we will move to a position where the Minister's shareholding will almost certainly fall short of 45 per cent. There is no point in trying to gloss over that fact.  This provision should remain in the Bill so that the Minister and his successors will be able to ensure that extra investment can be made.</P>

      <P>I will not drag out the debate on this amendment.  I am surprised and concerned that the Minister will not give some detail about the mechanism of the flotation and that we cannot discuss it at this stage.  The Government of which I was a member had to make very tough decisions to slim down this company and make it profitable.  In the past four years it has moved from being a loss-making venture to being a very profitable company.  I know the flotation will be a success and it is important to know the method by which the shares will be sold off.  We must ensure that nobody will make a killing by buying in one day and selling the next, as has happened in Britain.  The Minister should at least comment on that concern.</P>

My understanding is that it will be advertised widely in the newspapers but I am not prepared to state here that this is the only way it may be notified or advertised. Regarding comments about the Minister's holding 45 per cent, let me assure the House that the Minister for Finance might within months dispose of his shareholding. Senator Bradford mentioned this and did not object to the possibility. Let me assure the House that the institutions who would be interested in acquiring shares would not expect or even wish that the Minister would dispose of his shareholding within months of the flotation.  As I indicated already to the House when we discussed this matter earlier, it is the intention of the Minister for Finance &mdash; as distinct from the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who has the special share &mdash; to issue a statement to accompany the prospectus which will say that he does not intend to dispose of any shareholding within two years.  On that basis the matter is quite public and clear, and with regard to the acquisition of other shares, the matter will be advertised fully in the national newspapers.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised that Deputy Deasy is not supporting this amendment because he wants to retain this section in the Bill.  He has made it very clear that he is in favour of full privatisation of the Sugar Company, and putting no restrictions whatsoever on them in the free market.  However, I am amazed that the Minister whom I heard today proudly boast that he has never used the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; and that his purpose is not the privatisation of the Sugar Company and that he certainly does not intend to privatise the Sugar Company.  He made this point very clearly today, but I could not follow his argument because he is privatising the major part of it, but this section means full privatisation.</P>

      <P>We will have a guarantee from the Minister for Finance that the shareholding will not be sold within two years, if the Minister is still there in two years, but after two years the remainder of the company will be privatised.  It will be privatised with the exception of the Minister for Agriculture and Food's golden share.  All the rest will go.  That is full privatisation and it goes in the face of everything the Minister said all day long today.  In view of what the Minister has said, that it is not his intention to fully privatise the Sugar Company, I cannot understand why the Minister still retains this section where the Minister for Finance could dispose of all the remaining shares after a period of two years, or in fact immediately if there is a change in the Minister for Finance.  This is the Minister for Finance's intention at present but we do not know what would be the intention of the next Minister for Finance.  After two years you have full privatisation.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food hangs on to his golden share but we do not know how long that will last.  The Minister could bring the matter before the House and he would certainly have the full suport of the Fine Gael Party to dispose of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this section will mean the full privatisation of the Sugar Company.  I understood that was what the Minister intended at the beginning but the Minister has said all day today that it was not his intention at all but that the Minister for Finance was retaining 45 per cent and therefore we should not be worried about the privatisation of the Sugar Company. On Second Stage I pointed out the dangers for growers and workers in the event of full privatisation without restrictions in terms of the free market and the importation of sugar.  They could do anything they wished to do as long as they made a profit, which is the purpose of the free market.  Whether it would interfere with growers or ended the guarantees to the growers or workers would not matter once the company was making a profit and was not a burden on the State.  In fact there is hardly a private company in the country that is not a <Col N="194" /> burden on the State.  Everyone of them are getting far more in terms of grants and tax breaks than all the semi-State companies have ever got.</P>

      <P>They get handouts from the State which are public knowledge and are acknowledged but we do not see any record of the amounts in tax breaks and grants that are given to private companies.  I am making the point that the Minister will not save money by privatising the company and this will clearly involve full privatisation of the Sugar Company.  This company has been a tremendous benefit to growers, workers and the economy and are now in a position to repay any Government grants which they got in the past.  In fact they could be repaying the £50 million which they had got from the State and this would be of benefit to the Exchequer.  I am dealing specifically with this amendment, which I thought the Minister would accept in view of the points he made in the debate this morning and this afternoon.

      <P>I am a little surprised at the coyness of the Minister in regard to the object of the Bill.  I thought his party, and certainly his partners in Government and the main Opposition party are all quite clear in their ambition to privatise this company and others.  I did not think it was a matter of trying to do it in any surreptitious way. I thought it was quite public and open that this is now their policy and that they wanted to privatise this company, which is one of a list of companies which they had earmarked to bring revenue into the Government coffers this year to soften the effects of the Exchequer borrowing requirement by the end of the year,</P>
      <P>I wish to pursue slightly further the points raised by my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, on the actual mechanism of privatisation.  Will the Minister give us some indication at least as to how he will arrive at the share price for the company.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, referred to it and the Minister replied in relation to the mechanism for flotation but he was reluctant at that stage to give details of the mechanism and he <Col N="196" /> said it was inappropriate.  I am trying to get as much information as I can from the Minister.  If the Minister is going to privatise the company, which is clearly the case, as he has the overwhelming support of the Members of this House, both Fine Gael and the members of both parties in Government, will the Minister give us an assurance that at least the taxpayer is going to get value for money and that it will not be, as we have seen so vividly across the water a bonanza for private investors.  What mechanism will the Minister use to protect the rights of the State and individual taxpayers to get the best value out of the flotation.  Could the Minister give us an indication of the advice he has got or what committees he has put in place to advise him on the share valuation.  Can the Minister give us any information as to how he will arrive at a share price for this company?</P>

      <P>I have also dealt with this matter hours ago before Deputy Howlin arrived and I do not feel I should be asked to repeat myself at this point, particularly when it is not relevant.  I did say long ago this matter would be advertised publicly, that it would be open to all concerned to apply for shares.  I also <Col N="197" /> said &mdash; and I will finish on this note &mdash; that I would not now, and could not now place a valuation on the shares in advance.

      <P>I had a discussion with my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, who has been here since morning, and I understand from other Deputies that the specific question I asked in relation to the mechanism for valuing the shares has not been made clear.  I understand the Minister will advertise.  What mechanism will be put in place to value the shares and how is the Minister going to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer in this regard?  It is a simple, straightforward question.  Is the Minister afraid to answer it; and could he do that without insulting Deputies?</P>

      <P>In regard to what the Minister may do and what he may not do, the Government and the Minister are subject to the same conditions and restrictions as every other Member.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is where, perhaps, the Minister should look for a break because he now seems to be bereft of any ideas of what will happen in the future.  We are talking about the interests of the sugar industry and the employees and the growers.  What does appear to have happened, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is that a Bill was drafted by the people who were qualified to do so but all they had in mind was to draft a Bill for the privatisation of the Sugar Company and to try to keep out of that Bill what would be regarded as contentious matters that might be raised in this case by left wing parties who are speaking in the interests in the sugar industry, the growers and the workers.  That is the situation.  Even the Minister alluded to that, inadvertently I would say.  In drafting the legislation they wanted to create this impression.  This section, which I am <Col N="198" /> seeking to delete by amendment, refers to the Minister or his nominees.  When I was speaking previously nominees did not enter into it but now the nominees can become part of the structure.  The Minister may, for as long as he thinks fit, hold shares in the holding company.  The Minister said, within the last half an hour, that 45 per cent of the shares in that holding company would be held by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>

It is unbelievable that the Minister <Col N="200" /> now gets up and says again that neither he nor his Government have any intention of privatising the Sugar Company.  The duplicity of it is so sickening.  Why can the Minister not be straight and honest like Deputy Deasy.  Be straight and honest.  The Minister is privatising the company.

      <P>That is what you would love but the real headline tomorrow will be that the Minister is not privatising the Sugar Company, he is just giving it away to some private company. The Minister's 45 per cent will go in two years.  That is what this section means and, apparently, it will not happen for two years.  This means that the remainder can be sold and Deputy Deasy is quite <Col N="202" /> happy with that because he knows it is privatisation.</P>

      <P>But the Minister gets up and says hypocritically that this is not privatisation and that the Government made a very specific decision.  If the Government made that decision then the Minister is going against their decision by allowing this section to stand.  This section means that after two years the company will be completely privatised. Through the provisions of this Bill it will be slightly more than half privatised but if we allow this section to stand full privatisation can take place.  That is our main argument.  This is the reason I cannot understand the Minister's hypocrisy in saying that it does not mean privatisation. He should get up and say &ldquo;yes, we are privatising the Sugar Company, I will hold a little golden share and that is it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The 45 per cent being held by the Government is welcome and it is right that it should be held by them. In the long term I do not expect it to continue and, eventually, we will see full privatisation of the Sugar Company.  The 55 per cent is a welcome development because we are all aware of the difficulties experienced by the company over the years when they were starved for capital. As I stated in the House recently they will gain access to the market and if they have new enterprises they will have no problem in securing funding because people have confidence in the company. The way to proceed is through the stock <Col N="204" /> market and that is the trend throughout the western world today.  Anybody who talks about being opposed to privatisation is taking a backward step. There is no doubt that if one wants growth in business one must have access to the market for capital and the market is the Stock Exchange.  That is the way forward.</P>

      <P>I am sorry but you have not clarified the position clearly.  I think I am still in order in talking about the privatisation or otherwise of the company. Under this subsection the Minister will sell off shares and we are trying to prevent him doing that.  Therefore, we are proposing an amendment.  I thought I had put down an amendment but, apparently, I have not but I agree with what the amendment before us is trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can argue that there is something less than part-privatisation or whole privatisation involved.  It is privatisation because we have learned from the Minister, after many long hours of teasing out, that this 45 per cent is not a solid figure which he will hold on to.  It will be reduced whether to 30 per cent of whatever; it can be reduced to nil if the Minister for Finance so desires or if the privatisation goes so well and other interests come in.  The Minister said earlier if a company has to be bought which would be of benefit, then the method used would be to sell off part of the 45 per cent.  This is the reason the Minister was wrong in not agreeing with Deputy Deasy and saying, we are going to privatise the Sugar Company. The chief executive of the company, Mr. Comerford, as far back as 1989, when he was interviewed in <i>Aspect</i> magazine, in a question and answer session, said he was on record as having said that the company <Col N="206" /> could operate much better in private hands.  He was referring to the closure of the Thurles sugar factory when interviewed by <i>Aspect</i> magazine.</P>
    <P>I have paid tribute to the skills of Mr. Comerford in directing this company through a very difficult time and bringing them to profitability but he is on record as saying that the company would be much better in private hands.  The Minister is saying the Government have made a decision and we will not be privy to that for another 30 years but, perhaps, the Minister will bring it in and show it to us. He said the decision was that the 45 per cent will not be reduced below that level. We cannot be sure it will be contained in the prospectus or memorandum and articles of association which is being offered to us.  I would have thought I was in order in discussing the method of flotation and the level that will be cast when the company goes public so that we could have some knowledge of the guarantees and safeguards the Minister will bring in to ensure the public will have a right to buy whatever shares they wish and that the best price will be obtained for the shares.  That was my concern and the point I was trying to make in the discussion.</P>

      <P>As long ago as 25 October 1990 in a press release issued on behalf of the Government the Government's decision for partial privatisation was announced. The decision which I am authorised to bring before this House by means of this legislation is the decision for partial privatisation.  I do not want to get into further arguments.  I have given the reasons today.  For people to say that it is this or that which it is not is just flying in the face of the Government decision on which this legislation is based.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am primarily contributing to the debate to support the proposal put before the House by Deputy McGinley last night that the best way in which we can give representation to our citizens abroad in this Oireachtas is via the medium of the Seanad.  Deputy McGinley has gone into the merits of this proposal in great detail and I do not intend to repeat them now.</P>
      <P>It is worth nothing that Ireland is unique in the EC and indeed among a large number of democracies worldwide in not having some form of voting for its citizens overseas.  Therefore, it was an awful revelation to hear the Minister say last night, at the end of a long rubbishing of the Labour Bill before us, and I quote: &ldquo;I must oppose the Bill at this stage for reasons of principle&rdquo;&mdash; that is the important point &mdash;&ldquo;practicality and administrative reality&rdquo;.  The Government are opposed in principle to giving votes to our citizens overseas.  Because the grounds on which votes should be given to emigrants have been well covered by previous speakers, and no doubt will be similarly well covered by several speakers to follow, I want to deal with the broader question of emigration from this country, a social phenomenon taking place all around us with the most profound ramifications for the wrong kind of social change.</P>
      <P>This phenomenon has been completely ignored by the Government.  I suppose that is not surprising given their record. The Government regard the export of our people and the problems they bring away with them as pure gain.  It is not to our credit that within this Parliament the problem has been largely ignored.</P>
      <P>When the first head count of next April's national census is published it will, I predict, frighten people but only confirm what many of us have been saying for a long time.  If time allows, I hope to refer later to some figures which will illustrate that point better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration has long been a feature of Irish society.  Indeed, it has become a <Col N="208" /> structural feature of our cultural inheritance. Because it is so closely linked with a major historical event on this island the Great Famine, there is a lasting association here in the popular consciousness between emigration and misery.</P>
    <P>Aside from what happened in the 19th century there has been in this century five great movements of people out of this country.  However, it is the most recent one, which has cost us thousands of our young qualified people such as engineers, technicians, nurses, teachers, doctors, etc., of which we should be most ashamed.  At the time of previous emigrations or massive out-movements of our people it was difficult, because of a lack of knowledge of economic affairs or economic forecasting to predict such happenings.  However, in the post-Keynesan world and with the way better communications has increased our knowledge and influence over the global economy it is thoroughly shameful that emigration should again revisit us in the latter part of the 20th century, this time decimating the most productive sector of our population.</P>
    <P>Many people warned us from the early seventies that because of the baby-boom in the sixties and early seventies we would need unprecedented levels of job creation to give them employment when they reached working age in the eighties. We were well warned then to plan for this. However, what we did in terms of planning and action at a crucially important time during the mid-to late seventies was to engage in a colossal act of blundering populist madness that could not be more at variance with the national interest at the time.  Despite the enormous price we are now paying for this appalling set of blunders it is a sad commentary, perhaps on all of us, that most of the people guilty of this sabotage are alive and well and sitting in the ministerial and Government benches opposite us today.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to point out that in 1981 the proportion of our population at work was 33.3 per cent of total.  Yet ten years later in 1991 the proportion of the population at work is about 30.5 per cent of total.  Therefore, we have a situation <Col N="209" /> where those at work must now support an average of 2.25 others in addition to providing for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting but damning to note that despite the effect of recession in the UK on the numbers of people leaving Ireland, we are still losing at least 500 people every week, which is about the size of a fairly large primary or secondary school.  It is interesting too to note that while the Government have no plan to stem numbers forced to go, they seem on the other hand to have a plan to keep the people moving out.  The Central Statistics Office make no bones about the fact that they estimate that between 15,000 and 35,000 people per year will leave this country in all of the years between now and the end of this century and the ESRI agree with these figures.</P>
    <P>Since the last census figures we have related to 1986, we have to rely on surveys, observations and some guesswork to know what is happening emigrationwise. The Irish Episcopal Commission on Emigrants carried out a survey last year which showed, among other things, that there are parishes in the west of Ireland where the population is now disappearing at the rate of 6 per cent per annum. Another startling figure which shows what is happening &mdash; it is a pity the Minister, Deputy Flynn, is not here as this would be of interest to him &mdash; is that for the register of all electors for County Mayo for the year ending 15 April 1986, which indicates that there were 83,254 persons registered to vote.  However, on the register of electors for the year ending 15 April 1991 just five years later, there are 79,111 people registered to vote.  That is a dramatic drop of 4,143 persons in five years, and it is only an indication of what is happening because the register of electors cannot reflect the numbers of people up to and often over 18 years of age, and as we all know, this is the age group among which there is the greatest propensity to emigrate.  I should also point out that in the same period in my own county of Roscommon there was a drop of just under 1,000 in the number of persons registered to vote.  This also indicates what is happening in these western <Col N="210" /> counties where the population was already so attenuated and weakened by previous emigrations.</P>
    <P>In terms of social effects, this leaves a very undesirable imbalance in the population structure of Irish villages and towns.  As I have said, Counties Mayo and Roscommon lost almost 6 per cent or more of their population last year, and the figures for previous years are similar. As someone said to me recently, this phenomenon is similar in effect to a whole generation going to war.  Anyone who visits the airport in the Minister's constituency on a Friday evening all see hundreds of heads of households returning from England being greeted by their young children.  This shows in a very real way the level of hardship being imposed on many families by emigration.  It also means the loss of the most vital resource of any country, its youth.  It is estimated that 47 per cent of 18 to 25 year olds will leave Ireland within the next 25 years if present trends continue.  Translate that into UK figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to make just one more point.  Since there are 6.17 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 in Britain, this would mean a loss of three million of the people in that age group, and that would not be acceptable. The long term effects of this haemorrhage of the population structure and the implications for social planning are incalculable because the young people who are leaving are mostly of marriageable age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal is a highly emotive one.  It is purely a symbolic gesture to our emigrants.  On the surface it reads fairly well and it sounds extremely reasonable, but it would be almost impossible to deliver on.  In concluding last night, Deputy Connor said the Minister said he opposes the Bill at this stage. He did, and quite rightly so.  He said he opposes it on grounds of principle, of practicality and of administrative reality. <Col N="211" /> It would be an easy option for the Government to take the same casual approach that appears to have been taken in the drafting of the Bill.  We could do what might appear to be the popular thing and grant the request for a vote to some of our emigrants.  It would be an easy option to totally ignore the logistical difficulties involved.  It would be easy to play down the practical difficulties we would be faced with in policing any such scheme and ensuring the integrity of the voter.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not taken that course. He has spelled out the practical difficulties involved.  He pointed out that the Bill as drafted is weak and makes no attempt whatsoever to address these difficulties. He said that when ever a proposal for legislation is presented in the House it is incumbent on the promoters of the measure to ensure that the proposal is coherent and workable and that it addresses in a reasonable way the topic involved.  I suggest that every Member of this House is particularly knowledgeable of the difficulties in running elections. They are all aware of potential abuses and restrictions placed on voters here, not to talk of those abroad.  Deputy McGinley spelled out much stronger than did the Minister the difficulties and the possible disruption if there was any looseness in policing the voters and the votes, which is most important.  I will come back to these points later because they are of critical importance.  They are central to the principle of extending the franchise to Irish citizens who no longer live within the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>On the principle of extending the vote, while there might appear to be continued support from our emigrants, the facts were very clearly enunciated by Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan on his return from a comprehensive visit to major cities in the UK.  He said the emigrants were not in the least interested in having a vote in Irish elections.  I remember his quote at the time because I was a little surprised by it, but I took it as being an honest and straightforward assessment of what he had experienced in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worked abroad in 1960-61 and I would <Col N="212" /> honestly say that at that age I had not much interest in elections in Ireland.  I think that reflects the views of the average person abroad.  There are groups who may be more involved or may take more of an interest in these matters, but the average emigrant is not interested in having a vote in Ireland, as Deputy O'Sullivan discovered.  There may be different reasons for this.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said these people may feel let down by successive Irish Governments, but the more likely reason is the one I have given &mdash; that they simply get on with what they are doing and become involved in local issues in the land of their adoption, something we have continually encouraged them to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan went further last night and commented on the two Presidents of Irish heritage who came here to address us.  It is safe to say that the reason those people got to the top was that their forefathers did not continually look over their shoulders and say they wanted a vote in Ireland.  They voted and played a part in their countries of adoption.</P>
    <P>We should provide opportunities at home so that people do not have to emigrate. Deputy Connor launched into a tirade on the economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Practical help should be given to our emigrants.  We can say that <Col N="213" /> £800,000 is being made available this year, as against £86,000 in 1984, to assist the organisations who help people who are living on the side of the road or in bad circumstances abroad, but what is needed is practical help.  People who make a conscious decision to emigrate should be given advice and assistance. There are four different Departments working in this area &mdash; Education, Labour, Social Welfare and Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I do not want to suggest that there is an ulterior motive behind anybody's actions, but when parties or individuals draft Bills there is obviously some motive behind it, be it genuine concern for reform or possibly that the proposed legislation will be to their political advantage. I suspect that the latter is involved as far as this the Labour Party Bill is concerned.  The thinking is probably that most emigrants who would qualify for a vote here are young people who feel bitter because they could not find a job at home, and therefore would be likely to vote against the Government of the day if they had the opportunity to do so. The Labour Party would be well advised to think twice before coming to that conclusion. Our emigrants are not fools.  The majority of those who emigrated in recent years did so as a direct consequence of the economic disaster inflicted on the country by the Government of which the Labour Party were a vital part.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Kavanagh criticised the Minister on the division of constituencies. If we are to get into that field, away from the emigrants, the Labour Party have nothing to be proud of.  As part of a previous Government they were responsible for the famous &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo; which sought to ensure a large number of extra Dáil seats.  That point was mentioned last night and it has to be answered.  In fact, it has the direct opposite effect.  Even if the numerous flaws were removed from the present Bill, I am confident the proposers would bitterly regret having moved it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could almost have classed myself as an emigrant in mid-Cork back in 1977 <Col N="214" /> when, as a city councillor, I found it necessary to contest a Dáil election where the boundaries included the Kerry and Limerick borders as well as University College, Cork, in the centre of the city.  It ill behoves Deputy Kavanagh or anybody else to tell us that somebody is now getting it wrong.</P>
    <P>We must look into the question of whether people living abroad really want to vote.  It is worth noting that even at home, with convenient polling stations, there is usually a 70 per cent turnout who bother to exercise their franchise.  When we take into account the youth of the emigrant population, I question the balance that would be left in this country if we extended the vote.</P>
    <P>We must look at our system in isolation. Last night Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, quite rightly, talked about various other nations and how they deal with the situation.  We have a different, much more democratic, system in this country. In many cases a tiny fraction of the population decides the Members to be returned in any particular constituency. I mention that because of the proportion of people voting and the numbers of absent voters; we must bear in mind what extended voting would mean.</P>
    <P>Last night the Labour Party near misses in the European elections were mentioned.  Indeed, the matter went to the Supreme Court because, after counting many votes, there was only a tiny difference between the candidates. Deputy Spring also won an election by a matter of a few votes.</P>
    <P>In 1982 I sat with two of my colleagues waiting to see who would win the last seat.  When the transfers were counted down to the 11th and 12th votes out of 196,000 votes there were only five votes separating the candidates.  I mention that as a specific example of how fine the balance is in our system.  In the United Kingdom candidates generally win by 30,000 or 40,000 votes but they have a totally different system from ours.  It is not good enough to quote how the United Kingdom deal with votes in regard to emigrants and to say that we should do the same.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> The Minister mentioned the reality of the situation in dealing with transferable votes and how one's real choice is passed on.  In 1982 in Cork, as I said, the 11th and 12th votes were being counted and it was a frightening experience for a politician to see how finely tuned the system was.  What it means in relation to this is that we have had very close elections and a tiny handful of people could literally change the Government.  Some people might say that is a good thing but it would not be democracy.  We have a multi-seat constituency system, a transferable vote and the ultimate in proportional representation which we must bear in mind when making suggestions to extend the vote outside the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the practicality of the system.  Perhaps we could introduce a two-tier system in which people outside the country would not have to register before a given date and could not be struck off the electoral register as hundreds of Irish people living at home are.  They end up with no vote although they have never left the country.  It is not spelt out in the Bill how we would deal with votes for emigrants but I presume that there would not be the same policing of the electorate.  Different restrictions would apply to them.  We tried the postal vote here and people claimed that there were enormous abuses in relation to it although I am not in a position to verify that.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy McGinley pointed out how far round the world you would have to extend the vote which would include registering and checking people. Very often, in this kind of debate, we switch off when we get to the edge of the United Kingdom.  Of course, if we adopt this Bill every continent will be involved. There is no point in saying that we could have an arrangement with the United Kingdom whereby they would check our voters; every single country where Irish people reside would have to have the means of checking the votes.</P>
    <P>In the past the system was abused in many ways, including impersonation. People have worked to try to improve <Col N="216" /> this situation.  Of course it is very difficult to control.  People have argued that our administrators abroad are entitled to vote but, if they do, they are under the personal supervision of a member of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Another reason for not comparing Ireland to the countries listed is that, generally speaking, we tend to have an election every two years and seven months.  Indeed we had three in 18 months in the early eighties.  The Minister spelt out the practical difficulties last night of getting ballot papers to people, getting them back and trying to ensure that they are all counted.  In the past the islands three miles off our coast were storm bound and the counting was held up with the result that they now vote early.  I can imagine the returning officer in a constituency telling us that he was waiting for the last box from Honolulu and that he could not conclude the count. It is mind-boggling to think of the practical difficulties involved.  It is not just a question of extending the vote to Washington or Birmingham, we must extend it to any country in which an Irish person has lived for 15 years.</P>

      <P>It was quoted by the Deputy's colleague last night, not by me, and I thanked him for it because I would not have thought of it.  Like Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, I met our colleagues in the UK because I am on the inter-parliamentary body and I have been trying to get as much information as possible. Many people over there do not think it would be a good thing to extend the vote.  Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan said that nobody had any interest in it.  The main reason for not extending it, according to people in the United Kingdom, is that it would mean that the people had two votes, one in the British system and one in the Irish system.  That is the principle of it and I am opposed to anybody having two votes.  I am sure other difficulties mentioned last night will be dealt <Col N="217" /> with by other speakers, but that is the main reason I oppose the Bill.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael said the measure would put three Members into the Seanad.  They will need to define practical methods of applying that but at least they have brought in something different.  Like everybody else they are anxious to give some kind of recognition to people living abroad but they see the difficulties of enabling them to vote for Dáil Éireann. Figures for different constituencies and the possible imbalance were mentioned last night and I agree with what was said. We heard some fairly emotive speeches on this.  Each speaker is entitled to pad out his speech but most of the contributions last night proposing this Bill did not deal with the Bill as such or its mechanisms but simply said that the Minister would work out methods of dealing with the proposals and the legislation could be brought in.  I know I am paraphrasing but basically that is what was said.  The Minister could work out the fine points and then implement the legislation. I am sure the Minister and his advisers do not believe it can be implemented or that it is practical.</P>

None of us in this House would show any disrespect whatsoever to any of our emigrants in any country, and not just for political reasons.  We express our concern by practical means, supplying cash where necessary and applying political muscle in the US and elsewhere. That is the kind of practical help we can give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night speakers referred to the economic factor and to bringing borrowing under control.  That is crucial. Many of our people have emigrated as a result of the doubling of the national debt, from £12.25 million to £24.75 million between 1983 to 1987.  In 1983 and 1984 Cork &mdash; which you, Chairman, <Col N="218" /> Deputy O'Sullivan and I represent &mdash; lost 5,700 jobs in 37 companies because of interest and inflation rates.  The companies said they could not compete and so had to go to the wall.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but in fairness Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan said last night that the people he met abroad were from Cork North-Central and that they had to emigrate because of losing their jobs in Cork at that time.  I have said how we can address the difficulties emigrants face and how we can work together as we did last week here on the agreement for the next three years or, better still, for ten years.  That is how to work together for our young people and to get this country moving properly.  We must put our minds to that.  We sympathise with our emigrants and we wish to assist them.  We have many means of doing that, including the British-Irish Parliamentary tier and so on.  Ministers are working directly towards this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the local context in which we are preparing for elections at the moment there are fairly restrictive guidelines.  The register must be checked and people must be available to vote at the appointed place.  Fines are laid down for giving false information, for fiddling with returns or voting twice for malpractice generally. The courts are there to deal with such matters.  If somebody out in Guatemala or any place one likes to mention were to default in that way, what practical steps do we take to deal with that?  How can we police those offences?  How can we punish them?  People might say it is only a small thing but it is a very big thing considering that five votes can decide who occupies a Dáil seat, as happened in the case of the Leader of one of the main Opposition parties.  Every vote counts, probably more in the Irish context than in other elections because of the system <Col N="219" /> we use.  We have a reasonably small voting population.  For historical reasons we have many emigrants and there is an imbalance.  People should not be able to fiddle the voting system either at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the vote to non-nationals residing here has been dealt with in other circumstances and any possible improvements in the system have been brought about here.  There is a will here to extend the franchise.  Many people lose their vote here because, for instance, they are hospitalised at election time.  We have not been able to deal satisfactorily with that aspect.  Up to two or three years ago many people who were incapable of leaving their homes were prevented from voting but nobody bothered about that.  It was not an emotive issue.</P>
    <P>Last month we were checking draft registers.  This may not mean much to the uninitiated but for those of us involved in politics it is a fairly serious business. We get the draft register of the electorate in each of our constituencies and we have to check it and ensure that people are registered thereon.  Would there be such a system abroad if we could extend the franchise?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, our aim must be to ensure that we provide an environment in which fewer people are forced to emigrate and that those who have emigrated get every possible assistance &mdash; financial support or support of any type they may seek &mdash; and any guidance they need, and that we continue the good work that has been done in this regard, particularly in the recent past.  We would be conscious of our people and would be there to help them.  I echo a point made by another speaker last night.  If it is sacrosanct that our emigrants should get the vote, why do we decide that after 15 years and three months they are not entitled to a vote? If it is critically important to get a vote, what suddenly changes after 15 years and three months?  If the principle is right it should be there for all time.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The <Col N="220" /> Workers' Party I welcome this measure and express our support for the principle of the Bill.  The Workers' Party were the first party to raise this issue and press for the provision of postal votes for emigrants. I have a copy of a statement issued by Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla on 8 February 1983 in which he called for a postal vote for emigrants in the European elections which were then due.  It is worth recalling that in 1983 the European Parliament passed a motion calling for the provision of postal voting facilities, and that the parliament spokesman on a uniform electoral system, Mr. Seitlinger visited Ireland to discuss the matter with the Dáil parties.  At that time only The Workers' Party supported the implementation of the European Parliament resolution and it was mainly opposed by the Fine Gael/Labour Government and the main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil.  I welcome the change in attitude since then.</P>
      <P>I understand that all parties in the House, other than Fianna Fáil, have expressed their support for the principle of giving emigrants votes in some form or another.  The provision of votes for citizens living abroad is now very much the norm in democratic countries.  It is not at all unusual to see advertisements in Irish newspapers inviting citizens of the US, the UK or Germany, resident here, to apply for postal votes for their elections.  Why should we not extend similar facilities to our people living abroad?</P>
      <P>The recent history of this State shows that Fianna Fáil have always been the last to come out in support of reforms in almost every area of Irish life.  Once again they are displaying their essentially conservative nature by opposing this Bill. This is all the more extraordinary, given the way in which this country has been afflicted by emigration over such a long period.  There is probably no other country in the world on which emigration has such a major impact, stretching over two centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration has had a major impact not just on our economy but on almost all aspects of Irish life.  There is surely not a family in this country which does not have <Col N="221" /> members or relatives living abroad.  Its impact has always been felt on our culture, on our way of talking, on our literature, drama, music and song.  Those who grew up in the sixties and seventies hear horror stories of mass emigration during the thirties and fifties, and we thanked God that at least those terrible times were over.  Little did we know that emigration would return again in the eighties on a level as bad or worse than anything seen in the earlier decades.  Little could we have believed that in the eighties some 200,000 people, or more than 5 per cent of the population, would again be forced to emigrate because of economic need. There is surely no greater indictment of our record as an independent state than that after 70 years of self-government emigration has continued at such a rate.</P>

      <P>Over the past number of decades ritual expressions of concern about the welfare of our emigrants have become part of our political culture. Unfortunately they have been nothing more than a ritual &mdash; the Government Minister appearing for the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York, or an occasional ministerial speech to a county association in London, a few special programmes on RTE, and the odd plea to the US to give us a few more visas.  We, as a society have assured emigrants that we still consider them to be part of the great Irish family, that we want them to retain their Irish culture and identity, and that we hope they will come back some day to make a contribution to Irish society.  However, we have not done anything that would help them maintain their cultural or political links with us.  The provision of postal votes for our emigrants would be one of the most effective ways of ensuring the retention of links with the home country.  It would ensure that emigrants would still have a voice in the way in which the country is run and <Col N="222" /> it would also ensure that Governments, and political parties, could not ignore the issue of emigration and the economic factors which led to it.</P>
      <P>There are technical problems in any system designed to provide postal voting for emigrants, and steps must be taken to ensure that it is not abused.  The Labour Party in this Bill have set out one possible procedure which may or may not be the best method.  The most important thing at this stage is to secure support for the principle of giving the vote to emigrants. We can on Committee Stage consider in detail the Labour Party proposals.  I urge the Government to reconsider their opposition to the Bill.  I urge them not to oppose it at the end of Second Stage but to introduce whatever amendments they wish on Committee Stage.  If we do not move soon there is every possibility that the European Community will force us to move, at least in relation to European elections, because our existing postal voting system is so restricted and not available to emigrants.</P>
      <P>Many of those who leave Ireland do not qualify for inclusion in the register of the new country of residence for several years, although they may remain on the Irish electoral register for some time.  As there is not a general postal voting system here they are effectively disenfranchised in European elections and denied a say in the composition of the European Parliament which is taking on an increasingly important and powerful role.  A case to the European Court could well result in a decision which would force the Irish Government to provide postal voting facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main reasons why the Government are opposed to granting postal voting to our emigrants.  The main reason is the fear that those who have been driven out of their own country by the Government's disastrous economic policies will not be favourably disposed to those in power and will vote for Opposition parties rather than the Government. There may also be a fear that when our emigrants see how politics operate in other countries and when they see a political system where the electorate is <Col N="223" /> offered a real choice between the parties of the left and the right, they will no longer be impressed by the phoney difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>This modest proposal to grant postal votes to those who emigrated within the previous 15 years and had applied for inclusion on the electoral register in the constituency of former residence has to be considered against the likelihood that emigration will continue at a substantial level in the immediate future.  Indeed, emigration has been and remains a fundamental part of right wing economic and political strategy.  Over the years we have seen some conservative politicians praise emigration and state that the Government were not at all worried that 40,000 people were emigrating each year.  We saw right wing academics like Dr. Edward Walshe, the President of the University of Limerick, positively encouraging people to emigrate.</P>
    <P>Government Ministers would privately admit that their entire economic strategy would be thrown into chaos if emigration ended or was even substantially reduced. Hence the note of panic in recent Government statements accompanying the worsening monthly unemployment figures, which try to blame returning emigrants. Indeed, a most telling indictment of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Programme for Government is that it included just five lines on emigrants' welfare and not one line on how emigration might be stopped, despite it being agreed in a year in which 45,000 people emigrated.</P>
    <P>The Government, and the other parties of the right, see emigrants not as a loss but as a potential drain on resources if they remain at home.  They see emigration as a pressure valve taking the pressure off them to create jobs, to provide housing, education, health services and social welfare.  They know that many of those who are now emigrating would, if they remained at home, seek fundamental economic, social and political changes in the structure of our society, <Col N="224" /> changes which would threaten the privileged position of the small elite who control so much of the wealth, run the economy and exercise such a disproportionate influence over Irish life.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that successive Governments did nothing to discourage the mass exodus of those who could and should have such a role to play in the development of the country.  Apart from the humanitarian considerations, economic sense dictates that having spent so much public money in educating young people, we should harness their talents and expertise by providing jobs at home. Some of those who emigrate return but many more are lost to the country forever. Hundreds of thousands of those who have emigrated are still working in Britain or the United States.  Emigration will continue to be a feature of Irish life as long as the Government insist on relying on the same policies which have proven to be so unsuccessful in the past.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the political consequences of emigration.  In my view it has reinforced conservatism in this country.  Very often it has been the people with ideas, the people who wanted change and the people with get up and go who did just that &mdash; they got up and left.  Many of them are to be found in the trade union movements in the countries to which they have emigrated, in particular the United Kingdom and the United States, where they have become involved in politics, generally in the politics of change.  Very few Irish emigrants have become involved in conservative politics in countries abroad.  In every generation the State has sent the people who could have brought about social and economic change, and who could have demanded it.</P>
    <P>Emigration has often been referred to as an escape valve for the social pressures which inevitably build up from poverty and unemployment.  It was convenient for Governments to let this happen because it was a case of out of sight, out of mind.  A government could have all the advantages of emigration &mdash; money sent home, tourism generated and a leg in the door of the politics of other states, <Col N="225" /> in particular the United States &mdash; but none of the disadvantages because when an emigrant stepped on the boat or plane he or she lost his or her political rights.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about political rights.  We may feel concerned or sentimental about emigration but we cannot ignore the fact that our emigrants still have political rights in this State.  These political rights are based on two things, the circumstances which caused those people to emigrate and the economic and social circumstances. I would emphasise at this point that it has not always been economic circumstances which forces people to emigrate but rather a sense of despair at the social conservatism which has existed in this country, some of which was evident after the divorce referendum some years ago.  Second, since most emigrants, even those who have been away for a very long time, want to return, they have a political right to a say on the shape of the country in which they ultimately hope to live.  These political rights will not be ignored by the emigrants themselves.</P>
    <P>Gone are the days when emigrants made little or no political demands on this State.  Today's emigrant is better educated, more informed, more confident and better organised.  The Government may vote down this proposal next week but the issue of votes for emigrants will not go away.  Emigrants themselves are compaigning for it and I believe they will not stop until they succeed.</P>
    <P>Emigrants will not be impressed by the speech made by the Minister for the Environment yesterday evening when he offered several reasons this Bill should be voted down.  First, he quoted the Constitution refuting the argument that the vote should apply to citizens who have emigrated within the past 15 years.  He quoted the section of the Constitution which states that all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law, but where does that leave the citizen who emigrated?  Surely, he or she could equally claim under Article 41 of the Constitution that to deny them the right to vote is unconstitutional.  Article 16.2 of the Constitution states that every citizen, without distinction of sex, who have <Col N="226" /> reached the age of 18 years and who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of Members of Dáil Eireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for Members of Dáil Éireann.  At the very least this clearly enables the Legislature to enact laws which would include the right to vote for emigrants.  I think, therefore, that the constitutional argument can be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>The Minister's next argument was that the proposal would add 250,000 people to the electoral register and if the United States system was used, the number of non-resident voters could exceed those at home.  What the Minister is really saying is that if we gave the vote to emigrants we would distort the outcome of elections.  Deputy Dennehy referred to the same matter tonight but that is a very partisan political argument and cannot justify the denial of votes to emigrants. Indeed, it is an undemocratic argument to deny someone the vote because one fears how they will use it or how it will influence the outcome of elections.  The reality, of course, is that not all emigrants would avail of the vote but they should have the right to that choice.</P>
    <P>The Minister also questioned whether emigrants want the vote and suggested that some emigrants and emigrant organisations are fearful that if granted the right to vote here they may lose the right to vote in the United Kingdom &mdash; the one person, one vote principle, as the Minister put it, the one man, one vote principle.  This is an important point, especially in the context of the European elections, but it can be resolved quite simply by permitting the emigrant to opt to vote either here or in the United Kingdom. That would not be impossible to administer given the state of modern technology.</P>
    <P>The Minister's next argument is the converse of the no taxation without representation principle.  He stated &ldquo;from the practical viewpoint an emigrant's living standards are determined by conditions in the host country&rdquo;.  He, therefore, concludes that the right to vote <Col N="227" /> should be the host country, but this is a very debatable point.  The emigrant, ultimately, may take the view that his or her present living standard and quality of life have been determined not by the host country but by unemployment and the conditions at home which forced him to leave.  It is those conditions he politically wants to influence by having the vote so that he can return home to employment and a decent standard of living.  There are many emigrants who have been fleeced by taxation in Ireland, robbed of their employment, forced to emigrate and lost the right to be represented where all this happened.  Ultimately, it is the emigrants who should decide whether they wish to vote in their country of origin or in the host country.</P>
    <P>Various practical reasons have been raised, such as the difficulty in printing ballot papers, getting them to the host countries on time and the integrity of the electoral process and so on.  Let me offer one immediate practical proposal which could reduce some ot these practical difficulties. If we had Sunday voting there are many emigrants, especially in the United Kingdom, who would come home to vote.  We know that a feature of recent emigration is the increased frequency of journeys home.  Many emigrants could insure that their visit home would coincide with the weekend of an election, but this is not possible when elections are held mid-week.</P>
    <P>For those who cannot make it home the answer lies in an extension of the postal voting system.  What would be wrong with a system where emigrants would apply to be registered on a special emigrants register for each Dáil or Euro constituency and where a polling scheme could then be devised based on those registers and polling offices appointed in the normal way?  If it is practical to set up polling stations with just one ballot box in private houses in remote parts of rural Ireland, surely it is possible to establish polling stations in the main centres of emigrant population staffed by embassy personnel or by other qualified personnel?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> The difficulty which has been raised about the access of political parties and candidates to emigrant voters could be overcome by an extended system for postal canvassing.  If the voter is on a register of electors, with an address on the register, then the voter will be reached by candidates or by political parties.</P>
    <P>These are excuses for inactivity, not reasons to refuse emigrants the vote.  I believe that what we have to deal with in the first place is the principle.  Do we or do we not want to extend to emigrants, many of whom have been forced to leave because of the economic and social policies pursued by Governments, the right to have a political say in their homeland? There is a fundamental political rights issue involved.  The Government should accept the principle of this Bill and not oppose it on Second Stage.  The practical and administrative difficulties can be dealt with at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for giving me some of his time and I am pleased that The Workers' Party have cooperated with us in this regard.  I am sure it can be reciprocated.</P>
      <P>It was most interesting to hear the differences between Deputy Dennehy's and Deputy Gilmore's contributions.  Deputy Gilmore was reflecting much more accurately than Deputy Dennehy the views, policy and main drive behind this proposed legislation.  We are very pleased that The Workers' Party are supporting this Bill and I hope all the other parties will also support it, including the party in coalition with Fianna Fáil, who effectively indicated on many occasions that they would support giving the vote to emigrants.  It will be interesting to see what happens on the vote next week.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, on his work and effort in the preparation of this Bill.  It was not an easy task and he has acquitted himself very well in producing his first Bill as spokesman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore was right when he spoke about the principle of the vote.  I <Col N="229" /> can well understand that the Government are at all times reluctant to accept an Opposition Bill and would prefer to bring forward their own legislation.  That would be normal tactics.  On the other hand, the Government have, to their credit, accepted two Fine Gael Bills during the present Dáil.  This is a very simple proposal which is being made complicated. I have never heard so many arguments being manufactured to complicate something which is not a complicated issue.  It has been said, for example, that the vote is not given to any people outside the country.  That is inaccurate since all serving Irish troops in the Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East have been able to vote at successive elections and a very high proportion of them have voted.  I would accept that there is not a straight comparison between a battalion of Irish troops at one location in the Lebanon and a battalion of emigrants spread all over London, a city of 11 million people. If it can be done in one circumstance surely it can be done in the other.</P>
    <P>Another argument which has been advanced is that there is the possibility of some form of fraud or dishonesty.  That is a deplorable approach by a Minister whose Government have been responsible during the past four years for the high level of emigration.  They are now saying that if they give a vote to these young people whom they have forced out of the country they will act in a dishonest way.  Being dishonest in terms of voting is nothing new.  People have broken the rules in every election since the State was founded.  People have been prosecuted for trying to vote on more than one occasion, as the Government parties and the Opposition parties know.  I do not see the difference between giving an emigrant a postal vote and giving a person a vote at home.  I do not see how we can accuse people of being dishonest before we accept the principle of giving them a vote.</P>
    <P>There is no reason people could not be asked to produce a passport.  Most Irish citizens living abroad still hold their Irish passports.  There is no reason the returning officer in most countries could not be <Col N="230" /> the Irish Embassy or the Consulate.  It would be quite easy to organise.</P>
    <P>It was also said that there might be delays in getting the ballot papers back. I never heard such ridiculous nonsense. We live at a time of high technology satellite recording and worldwide publication in the media of events as they are happening.  We were able to see the war in the Middle East taking place day by day and hour by hour, yet it is said that emigrants cannot have a vote because we might not be able to get the ballot papers back in time.  How low can we stoop to deprive emigrants of a constitutional right?</P>
    <P>Sunday voting would facilitate people at home and abroad.  The Minister in the course of the debate responded in a positive way to that proposal.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the right of Irish people abroad to vote in European elections.  I believe it will not be long before the European Parliament ensure that every citizen of a member state has the right to vote.  I was on the losing side of the argument made by Deputy Dennehy.  I polled almost 86,000 votes and finished up losing by ten.  If the emigrants had had a vote, I would have won. The year before last my wife and I, together with other people from my native town, Drogheda, went to a function which we organised in a pub in London.  There were supposed to be about 50 people coming but when we arrived the place was packed to the doors. It was a full house.  We organised the same function last year, together with other public representatives in Drogheda, at a larger location where 1,000 people turned up.  There were many young people and quite a number who were not so young.  They came because they wanted to meet each other and to meet us.  They came because we went to the trouble of travelling there to indicate to them that we had not forgotten about them.  We did not go for their votes since they did not have votes.  My guess is that if they did have the vote there would not have been many Deputies in this Chamber that night because the bulk of them would have been in that function room. <Col N="231" /> The people who attended would have had the right to decide what was to happen in Louth and in Meath and in the Minister's constituency where there is the highest level of emigration.</P>
    <P>I have on occasions been in the Minister's constituency doing some fishing and talking to people who have come home from America, Canada and the United Kingdom.  They all asked why they could not have a vote, the same right Americans have in American elections or other Europeans have in their national or European elections.  I could not give them an answer.  We now have an opportunity to give them that right by passing this simple and uncomplicated Bill.  I would like to thank Deputy Gilmore for giving me some of his time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this is a unique opportunity for us to indicate to our emigrant sons and daughters that we have not forgotten them.  I have two children in London, and they came home to vote in the last election.  Of course, they may have had a greater interest than most.</P>

      <P>Last night I listened to the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, propose the extension of voting rights to emigrants.  He said the Bill would rectify a situation which had been allowed to continue for far too long and also contained powers to curb any abuse.  The Deputy described the exodus of thousands of our people and, in fairness to him, he acknowledged that the problem has been with us for almost 150 years.  Listening to some of the other Deputies one might be forgiven for thinking that the problems only began in 1987. It is very common for Members on the Opposition benches to lacerate the Government and accuse them of being the cause of the dreadful exodus of our people.  History shows that emigration was with us even when we did not have our own Government.  It is a fact of life, whether we like it or not and regardless of what party or parties were in office, and it is still with us.  The Labour Party, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrates &mdash; even if in a different form &mdash; all had the opportunity to govern during the past 20 years and we must accept that we have failed to prevent enforced emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will always be voluntary emigration. I am not sure that there are statistics available in this regard but I am quite convinced that the number of people emigrating of their own free will has increased dramatically in the past few years.  More people are educated today <Col N="233" /> and they are anxious to travel and experience life in other parts of the world. While everyone would accept that voluntary emigration is a good thing and can prove a valuable and pleasant experience, enforced emigration is a traumatic experience.  We are all familiar with the situation.  I expect there are few people who have not had a member of their family or a relation who has had to emigrate. Deputy Bell mentioned that two of his children are working in London.  If nothing else, this debate indicates the seriousness of the Government in dealing with the problem of emigration and that we are prepared to tackle the problems our emigrants face when they leave our shores.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have all had some experience of emigration we have seen men leaving their wives and families in search of work so as to put bread on the table or the young man or young woman unable to find their first job going away in search of their first pay packet.  When the Government took office in 1987 they recognised the seriousnes of the situation and immediately set about creating a climate which would be conducive to job creation and thus stem the emigration trail.  There is no doubt but that we have been successful in creating that climate and thousands of new jobs have come on stream.  However, though they have not been as plentiful as we would have wished, our policies are paying dividends and the rate of emigration has fallen substantially. We are familiar with the case of people who emigrated and have now returned home &mdash; people who travelled to London or New York in search of work and possibly enjoyed a few years of fruitful employment.  While the economies in Britain and the United States boomed during the second half of the eighties they are experiencing a slow down at present and jobs that were previously so plentiful have dried up in recent times leaving some of our people with no option but to return home.</P>
    <P>It has to be accepted also that the new confidence prevailing in Ireland is proving to be a major incentive for people to return home.  The Minister for the <Col N="234" /> Environment, Deputy Flynn, indicated in his contribution last night the two major ways the Government are showing their concern for emigrants.  First and most important is the Government commitment to remove as far as possible the root causes of involuntary emigration; second, to provide emigrants with the practical support and back up facilities they need.  The majority of our emigrants are still travelling to Britain and our embassy in London ensures us that the various welfare and advice centres are providing support for the work being carried out for the good of these emigrants. Our Government were not found wanting when it came to advising our American friends in Congress of the most beneficial legislation for our emigrants. We sought to improve the advice and welfare services available to Irish men and women on their arrival in the States. Our Government provided hard cash in that respect.</P>
    <P>We must closely examine this Private Members' Bill which proposes to extend voting rights to all emigrants provided they have not been gone for more than 15 years.  As my colleague, Deputy Dennehy, mentioned it is hard to understand how you could put a time limit of 15 years on those eligible to vote.  If, say, a man who emigrated many years ago comes home for a week's holiday, does that mean he can start afresh.</P>

      <P>Another major fault of the Bill is that the implementation arrangements were completely ignored.  I see the implementation of the Bill as being the most difficult aspect of it.  We have to accept that our emigrants are right around the world, are in 150 or 160 countries, as Deputy McGinley mentioned last night.  Possibly 250,000 Irish people have emigrated during the past 15 years.  It would be a very difficult job to try to include them on our registers in the 41 constituencies.  Would we have to create a new job for embassies locating Irish people to put them on the register?</P>

      <P>If Irish emigrants in London had a vote here, when it came to a European election they would be in a position to elect, maybe, Deputy Bell and some other member from England. It is something that the Europeans would not be too happy with that any man would be given an opportunity to elect members from two different countries.</P>
      <P>In his address last night the Minister stated that the Federation of Irish Societies in 1989 rejected a proposal to give the vote to Irish emigrants in Dáil elections and while our intentions here might be good &mdash; and I am sure they are &mdash; we would have to accept the federation's view on it.  Although we would like to think in the House here that we are very much in touch with the emigrants, I am sure the federation would be a little bit closer to them.</P>
      <P>Earlier I mentioned compiling the register.  It is not something that we should dismiss very easily.  It would be a very difficult job to do.  All one has to do is listen to radio programmes, for example, at Christmas time and hear requests coming in from some of the Irish people who have emigrated to know that they are living in every corner of the world.  It would be almost impossible to compile a register that would give all our emigrants a chance to vote.  Another worry I would have is the cost.  Who would we pay to compile the register? Who would we pay to run the election? Where would the voting take place?</P>

      <P>I am not happy with it. This is my opportunity to express my reservations.  I have a number of reservations, and that is one of them.  I am delighted to hear that Deputy Bell was in London a few times during the last few years.  When it came to running an election and canvassing our emigrants we would have to travel a little further than London.  The integrity of the elections is another serious issue which must be addressed.  As Deputy Bell said, we have found it very difficult to keep our elections straight here and to keep people from voting more than once.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any party that will have difficulties in elections in the future, it is Deputy Shatter's party; one only has to look at the way opinion polls are going.  Deputy Shatter should not crow too loudly.</P>
      <P>We must accept that the Garda have played a major part in ensuring that our elections are run smoothly and properly. If voting were to take place in various centres around the world we could not expect the same sort of co-operation from the police forces there.  We could not expect a foreign force to show the same interest as our own Garda.  If the boot were on the other foot and we were to allow Australians in this country to vote in an Australian election, I am sure we would not go out of our way to prevent any abuses at the polling booths.</P>
      <P>I should have mentioned earlier, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I wanted to share some of my time on Tuesday night next with Deputy Brennan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.  The Minister stated last night that any abuses <Col N="238" /> that might take place would be outside the reach of our courts and there would be no way we could remedy a problem like that.  When the security is not available to the polling station it would be only natural to expect that people would abuse the system.</P>
      <P>I would have to oppose this Bill purely for practical and administrative purposes. While I have to compliment Deputy O'Sullivan on introducing this Bill, it is obvious that he has not studied the practicalities of it.  It is just not feasible to allow our emigants to vote.  No matter how good his intentions, I feel that for our emigrants the main priority is to return home and our main aim here as a Government should be to provide a climate that would attract our people back home again.  We have been lucky that when things were very bad here and there were no jobs to be found there was always the chance of a job in London, New York or Boston.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell mentioned that a number of our people outside the country are entitled to vote.  He mentioned in particular our troops abroad.  The troops in the Lebanon have a facility where they can vote in an election.  There is no comparison between our emigrants and the troops, in that the troops could easily be accounted for, being in a very confined area, whereas it would be a big job trying to locate emigrants.  Deputy Bell found it difficult to accept defeat in the last European election and is convinced in his own mind that if the emigrants had a vote he would be in Brussels or Strasbourg tonight and not in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Minister's reply on this amendment and from this side of the House reference has been made to the amount of capital which the State has put into the company since the early eighties and various figures have been given.  The fact that it has done so and the company is now in a profit-making situation is all the more reason the company should be retained in public ownership.  My amendment proposes the deletion of subsection (3) which allows the Minister, or his nominee, to dispose of the shares.  It is important that I give an example of the interest we are talking about in the Sugar Company.  In 1989 and in 1990 we were told &mdash; and there is no secret about it &mdash; that the Finnish sugar company were interested in the Irish Sugar Company.  Finn Sugar Limited issued a statement to the effect that while their interest was indicated in general terms to the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; it is the same Minister for Agriculture and Food who is here this evening &mdash; they were an established public company with interests in over 60 countries.  It is a pity the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not present now.  The information leaked to the workforce in Mallow, Carlow and all the other areas at the time that this company were likely to buy the Irish Sugar Company.  If the Bill is passed and the company is privatised this amendment which proposes the deletion of subsection (3) of section 2 would not allow the Minister to dispose of his shares.  This is a very wide-ranging power contained in subsection (3) which states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, or his nominees, may hold for as long as he thinks fit shares in the Holding Company for the time being vested in him or his nominees and may, from time to time, if he considers it appropriate to do so following consultation with the Minister for <Col N="240" /> Agriculture and Food, sell, exchange or dispose of, whether by redemption or otherwise, on such terms and conditions, including preferential terms and conditions, as he thinks fit ...</P>
    <P>I think it is reasonable, in view of the emphasis being placed by the Minister on the fact that the Minister will have 45 per cent of the shares, that at least he would not have the power to dispose of such shares.  I refer to the next subsection to prove the point I am making.  The next subsection would give the Minister the power to dispose of the special share which has been referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is proposing to delete that subsection but the fact is that it was put into the Bill.  Had there been no opposition that subsection would still be part of the Bill.  That is why it is necessary to argue out the terms and conditions, the amendments, the sections and subsection of the Bill to the point where we will have at the end of the day, if it is passed, a Bill which will protect the interests of the growers and the industry generally.  The deletion of subsection (3) would satisfy me.  I think I have made points which are sufficiently valid to get agreement on that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 1 to 5, to delete subsection (4).</P>
      <P>As I understand it the other amendments in my name are consequential on amendment No. 5.  We have already debated this issue.  The House will be aware that the purpose of this amendment is to put a specific provision in the Bill preventing the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the office I hold at present, from disposing of the special share because of the special provisions which attach to that share protecting the rights of workers and the core asset of the company, namely, the sugar quota, as well as a range of other matters that I have already explained in detail.</P>
      <P>I agreed after Second Stage, in response to some observations made from all sides of the House, to introduce this amendment so that there would be no doubt that it was not my intention to dispose of the special share.  I am now inserting this amendment, with the other amendments which state that the Minister for Agriculture and Food shall not dispose of the special share referred to in subsection (2) of this section.  That is not just a statement of intention; it is a mandatory obligation.  The other amendments in my name follow directly from that.</P>

      <P>This amendment is not simply in the Minister's name; it is also in Deputy Sherlock's and mine.  We put down this amendment which is consequential on an earlier amendment in my name.  If that amendment had been <Col N="244" /> successful there would have been no need for this amendment, but obviously that was not the case.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that he cannot dispose of the special share.  We expressed our reservations in this regard.  This amendment is a consequence of the discussions we had. Obviously the Minister discussed the matter after the Bill was printed and saw the weakness in this area.  Even though it is only a concession, this amendment is welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In proposing this amendment I gave consideration to the meaning of the subsection.  Subsection (4) is of great concern.  It reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food or his nominees following consultation with the Minister may, if he considers it appropriate to do so, dispose of by redemption or otherwise, in accordance with the memorandum and articles of association of the Holding Company the special share referred to in <i>subsection (2)</i> of this section.</P>
      <P>Again the memorandum and articles of association of the holding company are referred to.  The Minister has now agreed to delete that and we accept it but in drafting the Bill, reference is made again to the memorandum and articles of association.  It is in accordance with that that the special share referred to is being given to the Minister.  We are still at a loss to know what back up there will be for that special share.  This amendment calls for the deletion of that subsection and we support it.  I would like the Minister to briefly say what he proposes to do about informing us on the memorandum and articles of association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated already that when the legislation is passed the memorandum and articles of association will be passed into formal law on the basis of this legislation.  Before that they have no legal effect because they are <Col N="245" /> only in draft.  I have indicated already to the House that I can make available to Deputies the draft of the memorandum and articles of association, but it is only when this Bill is passed that they will have any binding legal effect.  I could not say that I would be bound by anything that is not of binding legal effect.</P>
      <P>I said I proposed this amendment as a consequence of observations made on Second Stage.  I want to make it very clear that it is also a consequence of direct consultations which I and the Minister for Labour had over a period with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on a variety of issues.  I should like to express my appreciation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for their positive and reasonable approach during the course of these discussions.  They also welcome the fact that I am introducing this amendment.</P>

      <P>We were advised by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that many of the matters we wanted to discuss would be appropriate to this section.  We have had a very long discussion but I should like to remind the House that we have been unsuccessful in achieving the holding of the company in the public sector in the way we wanted.  We wanted the Minister to assure us that there would be a holding of a 51 per cent stake for as long as the company exist.  Indeed we wanted it to be set in granite and the 45 per cent which has been accepted by the House is a variable amount which can only reduce over the years.  It is not acceptable to the Labour Party who have endeavoured to make changes which would ensure that this company would be kept, as far as possible, in the public sector and that the Minister &mdash; and his nominees on the board &mdash; would have overall control of the company.  We tabled amendments to improve the Bill and to ensure that the State, the growers and the general public would have their best interests copperfastened in this Bill. By refusing to accept the amendments the Minister will, in time, probably have to admit in this House that he made a mistake.  Time will show whether he or the Labour Party were right.  All that could be achieved in this company could be done with a 51 per cent holding instead of having a minority shareholding by the Government.  For that reason, we intend to oppose the section.</P>

      <P>The longer the debate <Col N="247" /> continues, the more concerned one becomes at the type of legislation which we are about to enact and the consequences which will follow without having the built-in safeguards required, in particular the straightforward safeguard of the State holding 51 per cent of the shareholding.</P>
      <P>A few minutes ago I mentioned Finn Sugar and the interest they had in the sugar industry in 1990.  One can never stand up here and express fears without having good grounds for doing so.  I oppose the section &mdash; and the legislation generally &mdash; because our sugar industry at present is under threat from surplus sugar in Europe.</P>
      <P>I also mentioned earlier in the debate the involvement of Ceimicí Teoranta with Ferruzzi, the Italian sugar manufacturing company.  They are one of the eight largest companies in the world and are established in Little Island, Cork. Why did the Government stop that company buying into the industry?  Ceimicí Teoranta originally had a 40 per cent share which was watered down to 20 per cent when it came to be sold.  The Sugar Company's move was blocked by the Government so Wheat Industries, a subsidiary of Ferruzzi, are in direct competition with the Sugar Company for industrial sugar.  If the Minister can contradict that statement let him do so. Massive multinational companies are waiting to get their hands on the Sugar Company and the bottom line was that the sugar industry must become efficient. We have heard about the paltry input by the State over the eighties when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, paltry in comparison to what has been spent, as Deputy Mac Giolla said, on private enterprise.  The Minister was asking the company to carry industries which were no longer viable and I refer to Tuam, the Minister's area, and others, where it was decided to tell the company to rationalise. However, when they wanted to do so they were blocked and, consequently, <Col N="248" /> they carried that burden.  We should remember that the capital equity put in by the State has been used to good effect. How did the company buy into Odlums? The Sugar Company is profitable but it is now proposed to sell the majority shares. There is nothing to stop the multinationals to which I referred buying in because they are already based in this country.  If the Minister wants to deny what I am saying he is entitled to do so but he knows he cannot.  I have been interested in this matter since the early eighties.  I could go on but, for the reasons I stated, we are opposing the section and the Bill generally.</P>

      <P>There is clearly a difference of principle between us and I am not surprised that Deputy Sherlock and Deputy Kavanagh are opposing this section on the basis of that principle. However, my case rests when Deputy Sherlock said that a contribution by the taxpayer in less than ten years of £60 million to one company is a paltry sum. I do not know whether Deputy Sherlock takes the view that the taxpayers have unlimited funds to pour into every company. Because of our confidence that this new proposal &mdash; and the new structure for Siúicre Éireann under the new company &mdash; can save the taxpayer the continuing burden, we introduced this legislation.  Like Deputy Sherlock, I want to see tax reduced and, at the same time, to launch into new markets in an atmosphere very different from when the Sugar Company were established in the protected thirties.  That is what we are achieving.  Deputy Sherlock takes the view that a sum of £60 million is paltry. It is anything but.</P>

      <P>As I indicated, the quota decision of the EC under the Council is in no way affected by what we do here.  What we do will neither increase nor decrease the quota that was decided <Col N="249" /> by the Council of Ministers a long time ago.  While there may be proposals from time to time to reduce quotas on any front, be it sugar, dairy or whatever, I will deal with them when they arise at the Council of Ministers.  What we are doing here has no relevance at all to that quota.</P>

Had he agreed to that I may not have pressed my opposition to this section.  As he has not agreed I am pressing my opposition to section 2.</P>

      <P>I observe that amendments Nos. 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 form a composite proposal, and amendment No. 27 and substitute amendment No. 28 are alternative proposals.

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;All employees of Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. and its subsidiaries shall become members of the staff of the Holding Company upon the transfer of undertaking from Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. to the Holding Company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will speak to the other amendments. Amendment No. 12 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Each employee on being transferred to the Holding Company shall hold his/her office or employment on the same terms and under the same conditions as applied to his/her contract of employment immediately prior to the transfer and while in the service of the Holding Company the said terms and conditions shall not be less favourable to him/her than those prevailing immediately prior to the transfer save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with the trade  unions or staff associations representing such employees.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 states:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;The trade unions and staff associations recognised as representing the employees by Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. and its subsidiaries shall be likewise recognised by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Until such time as the scales of pay and terms and conditions of employment and any other benefits, including rights and privileges, obligations and any other arrangements applying to employees so transferred are varied resultant from negotiations with the trade unions or staff associations concerned, the conditions which prior to the transfer had been negotiated on their behalf and applying at the time of the transfer, shall continue to apply to them save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with the trade unions or staff associations representing such employees.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Any authority exercised by a member of the staff of Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. shall continue to be exercised by him within the Holding Company until the same is varied by the management of the said Holding <Col N="253" /> Company.  If such variation works to the detriment of the status or pay and conditions of the said staff member within the Holding Company it shall be null and void unless the said variation shall have been negotiated with the trade union or staff association representing the said staff member.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These are all reasonable requests to make on behalf of the employees of Siúicre Éireann.  They are in accordance with the normal terms and conditions of employment which have been negotiated by the staff associations or unions involved. There should be no interruption in the continuity of employment.  It is my understanding that the workers have put in a demand that the current rates of pay and conditions of employment should continue to apply, that the company should continue to recognise the existing trade unions, that the existing procedures for determining the rates of pay and conditions of employment should continue to be followed and that the redundancy terms for the company should continue to be those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conference.  The company have acknowledged that this is the current position and they have no plans to change the terms.</P>
    <P>As could have been expected, when the workers first realised 12 months ago that the company was to be privatised they feared that they would be made redundant.  The question which then arose was what terms would be offered. The company pointed out that there was no agreement on the terms to be offered. Reference was then made to the 1981 agreement.  The Minister has stated many times in this debate that he and his representatives have held lengthy discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on behalf of the employees.  If the Minister recognises that the workers have a legitimate and valid claim to have the amendments inserted there should be no problem in accepting them.</P>

      <P>For the information of the House, I wish to repeat <Col N="254" /> the amendments that we have decided to discuss together.  They are as follows: amendment No. 10 in the name of Deputy Sherlock, which is immediately under discussion, together with amendments Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, 27 and substitute amendment No. 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 27 in my name sets out to achieve what Deputy Sherlock is seeking.  Deputies will recall that I indicated when replying on Second Stage that the advice available to me was that provisions in European legislation would guarantee this and that because of the overriding provisions in European law there was no need to insert in our law specific provisions of the kind Deputy Sherlock has addressed.  Even though that was the advice made available to me, I felt for another reason that it had to be made very clear that workers could have recourse directly to our own courts under legislation passed by ourselves.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier today, I have held exhaustive consultations, along with my colleague, the Minister for Labour, with the trade unions on this issue.  I think the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would agree that we had a very rational and reasonable discussion with them over a period of weeks and months and that because of the views they expressed, in addition to the views expressed here on Second Stage, I undertook to introduce an amendment to ensure that the workers of Siúicre Éireann would have the same rights in the new holding company.  I would now like to refer to the amendment in my name, amendment No. 27.  I think that Deputy Deasy, in deference to him, has an amendment along the same lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For once, we appear to be <i>ad idem</i> in this House.  My amendment reads that &ldquo;every person who immediately before the transfer date was <Col N="255" /> an employee of the Company, shall, on the transfer date, enjoy the same rights (including the rights under a pension or superannuation scheme of the company) and be subject to the same obligations as he enjoyed and was subject to immediately before the said date.&rdquo;  The amendment then goes on, lest there be any doubt, to make specific reference to things that people might otherwise say are excluded.  The amendment states that &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; means any pension, annuity, lump sum, gratuity or other like payment give on retirement or payable after retirement in respect of past service or on or in connection with death during service or after retirement; that &ldquo;company&rdquo; includes any subsidiary of the company and, as a consequence, the range of activities the new holding company might get involved in; that &ldquo;pension or superannuation scheme of the Company&rdquo; means a scheme, arrangement or fund established in connection with the business of the company for the provision of benefit for the employees of the company or their dependants on their retirement or death &mdash; that is an important element of the amendment; that &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;&mdash; I felt it was necessary to put this in &mdash; has the meaning assigned to it by section 155 of the Companies Act, 1963; that &ldquo;transfer date&rdquo;&mdash; and this is stating the obvious &mdash; means the date on which the Minister transfers his shares in the company to the holding company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there are some matters, and I want to acknowledge this, such as trade union rights in relation to negotiation which are not appropriate to legislation. I am advised that these things cannot be covered by legislation as they related to the relationship between worker and employer.  As I understand it, the company &mdash; and we have discussed this with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; they can express their own view but they have certainly expressed a positive response to me &mdash; have indicated their readiness to enter into formal agreement with the trade unions which would be registered in the Labour Court and in <Col N="256" /> the new Labour Relations Commission. This would be a binding commitment.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies can see that I have done what I said I would do as I have always acknowledged &mdash; I have never said anything other than this &mdash; that the workers have a major role to play in the company, and I hope that, if possible, they will have an even more dynamic role to play in the new holding company.  It is very much a partnership issue.  I want to demonstrate the commitment of the Government and my commitment by putting in this provision.  I hope that commends itself to the House and that the amendment can be accepted on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has obviously had long discussions with the trade union movement and a measure of agreement has been arrived at.  Since the Minister has given an assurance to the unions, I would think that my amendment would be far more comprehensive in giving recognition to the points of agreement than the Minister's amendment. The Minister's amendment provides that every person who immediately before the transfer date was an employee of the company shall, on the transfer date, enjoy the same rights and so on.  My amendment provides that all employees of Siúicre Éireann cpt. and its subsidiaries shall become members of the staff of the holding company on the transfer to the holding company.</P>
      <P>If I were a worker in the Sugar Company I would regard the provision in my amendment as far more watertight. There is quite a difference in saying that a worker shall become an employee of the holding company.  I would have expected the Minister to mention my amendment and to say why it is not acceptable to him.  It is far more comprehensive in protecting the rights of the workers and they would feel much happier if he were to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two areas of difficulty with the Minister's amendment.  The first relates to the pension fund.  The Ceann Comhairle instructed me that that part of my amendment could not be discussed in <Col N="257" /> the House because it would require the Minister to spend extra money.  Nevertheless we know there is a considerable deficit in the pension fund running into many millions of pounds.  I am prepared to accept assurances from the Minister on the record of the House that before the transfer the shortfall will be made good.  The company have made considerable sums and that assurance should be given before any arrangements are made.  I cannot introduce an amendment on this matter but it would be fair and reasonable to ask for that assurance.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to redundancy. The Minister gives certain assurances in his amendment but they are not of the proper strength to meet the needs of workers who may find themselves being made redundant when this new company takes over.  Under the old agreement dating back as far as 1981 members of staff who were made redundant as a result of the closures in Tuam, Thurles or elsewhere, were entitled to five weeks' redundancy pay for each year of service plus statutory redundancy.  I cannot see that the Minister has given assurances in his amendment.  This is one of the most important variations between what I am trying to achieve and the Minister's amendment.  If the words &ldquo;same rights&rdquo; in the Minister's amendment include that assurance it may satisfy the trade union movement and the workers. I should like to see that assurance in the document to be endorsed by the Minister and lodged with the Labour Relations Commission.  The Minister should clarify his rights and obligations and the rights of the employees in the company.</P>
    <P>I think we can all agree that the discussions which have taken place between the Minister and the unions amply cover the concerns of everybody working in that industry.  The 1,715 workers in the company are entitled to know that they will become members of the new company. Each of them is entitled to the assurance that if, for whatever reason, he is made redundant he will get the same benefits as have been available since <Col N="258" /> 1981.  His pension rights must not be jeopardised by the fact that there is a shortfall in the pension fund.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can tell me why he cannot accept the much more comprehensive amendment in my name.  I could not include that part which was ruled out by the Chair.  If we had an assurance that all that is contained in my amendment is acceptable, then we could get on with the remainder of the debate, without the same performance we had on section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> This is a very important section covering the rights and entitlements of workers in the new company.  The Minister has covered the position quite well and Deputy Kavanagh seems to be copperfastening the matter by providing that they shall continue to be employees of the company. The rights of the workers seem to be protected and if Deputy Kavanagh's amendment copperfastens their position, that is all the better.  I welcome the protection of the workers' rights because they have kept the company out of the red, and they have the expertise to continued to do so.  They must be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give in some detail the assurances being sought.  I hope it will be clear that these assurances cover the range of issues which have been dealt with.  We cannot include in legislation every detail of every contract of employment. If we did, each Bill would be cluttered up.  Workers are covered by the protections available under the industrial relations code.  In addition there are some special provisions relating to rights on the transfer date.  I have introduced this amendment because of the concern that was expressed here.  It is appropriate that there should be such detailed provisions and protections for workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to indicate to the House what is covered in the proposed agreement between the workers and the company. This draft agreement in relation to employee conditions which will operate immediately after the restructuring of the <Col N="259" /> company contains the following commitments: no interruption in continuity of employment; current rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply; the company will continue to recognise existing trade unions; existing procedures for determining rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>At this time the company have no proposals to offer redundancy terms different from those presently being offered, which are the terms that emerged from conciliation conferences in 1981.  Privatisation will not give rise to changes in continuity of employment in subsidiary companies or to existing procedures for determining rates of pay or conditions of employment in those companies.  Within 30 days of vesting day, moneys to be transferred into the manual pension scheme to cover pre-1984 pensions as determined by the scheme's actuary &mdash; pre-1984 service in the manual scheme &mdash; will be funded on a phased basis over a five year period from 1991 in accordance with the advice of the scheme's actuary.</P>
    <P>As I indicated already this agreement will be registered with the Labour Court under section 27 of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act and both parties agree to formally lodge a copy of this agreement with the Labour Relations Commission and to request the commission to consider themselves the guardians of the agreement.  That covers the first point pretty extensively.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note I have referred to pensions and I want to copperfasten the position with regard to them subject to the fact that we cannot put every detail of what is being done by way of binding commitment and obligation into legislation, as there would be figures appearing all over the place.  There is provision that the pension fund will be fully remunerated and that £4.7 million will be paid into the fund now and the balance of £5.3 million will be paid over the next few years.  The company have agreed, and the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is £4.7 million now and the balance of £5.3 million over the next five years.  The company have agreed to this.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Labour and I have had a direct hand in all of these discussions.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Finance will in any event copperfasten this by acknowledging it formally to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In other words he will acknowledge the contributions to the pension fund.  Again, I do not want to put words into the mouth of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or the representatives of the workers but it has been clearly indicated to us during our discussions with them that those terms and arrangements satisfy their preoccupations on those issues.</P>
      <P>There will be no proposal to offer redundancy terms different from those at present being offered.  I have specifically brought in amendments to put matters beyond doubt but I have been advised legally that there are certain matters that are not appropriate for legislation.  I have to act on that advice and in this instance I can say only that it is right but I have arranged these formal binding agreements in the interests of the management as well as the workers because if we do not have a happy, reassured, confident workforce there will not be a dynamic company.  I have no interest in seeing the workforce of the new holding company having doubts, apprehensions or distrust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh's amendment would in some instances mean a direct and immediate transfer of all the employees of Siúicre Éireann to the new company. The Attorney General has pointed out to me however, and this is quite obvious, that this would immediately require that <Col N="261" /> all the employees of Siúicre Éireann would become direct employees of the new company.  That will not be the case. In fact, most of them will remain employees of Siúicre Éireann which will, of course, be a subsidiary of the new holding company and their rights will be automatically and immediately protected. There is no suggestion that all of the employees will be transferred to the new company; they will remain employees of Siúicre Éireann, which will be a direct subsidiary of the holding company. For that reason I have been advised that Deputy Kavanagh's amendment is inappropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek clarification from the Minister on some points.  I understand from what the Minister said in reply to Deputy Kavanagh's amendment that he had legal advice, that his amendment No. 27 to new section 6 is as far as he can go, but this legislation is quite short and there is no great detail necessary.  I will be making the point in relation to Deputy Kavanagh's amendment on the rights of employees, which must be extremely important, that I see no reason why the draft agreement between the company and the unions cannot be incorporated in the legislation. I wish to state this very strongly and if the Minister is not prepared to take it on board, he might consider it again on Report Stage.  The employees of the Sugar Company must have certain fears and worries in relation to what happened in other State companies that have become semi-State or otherwise in recent weeks.  It is quite reasonable for them to seek statutory protection in the new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the draft agreement the Minister read out may I ask him what are the present terms of redundancy being offered by the company?  He said the company had no proposals to offer redundancy at present but would he outline to us the present rates?  Second, I find it extraordinary that the Minister in his discussions on the flotation of this company is not in a position to clear the decks.  The idea of £5.3 million being paid <Col N="262" /> over five years is quite extraordinary. Why can it not be done now?  Why does the Minister not go all the way, clear the decks and put that into the legislation?  If the company run into difficulties what guarantee do we have that this money will be paid?  Why can it not be done now?  What are the restrictions on the Minister for not doing that?</P>
    <P>In relation to the document which will be registered with the new body, the Labour Relations Commission, why can the Minister not incorporate that in the legislation, as practically all of it is taken care of in Deputy Kavanagh's amendment which is far more comprehensive and is not in any way an encumbrance on the legislation because the Bill is quite short and sharp in terms of detail.  For example, section 6 (4) as proposed by Deputy Kavanagh states:</P>
    <P>The trade unions and staff associations recognised as representing the employees by Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. and its subsidiaries shall be likewise recognised by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>This is extremely important.  I cannot see any reason &mdash; obviously, I do not have access to the advice of the Attorney General, as the Minister has &mdash; why the section as proposed by Deputy Kavanagh cannot be incorporated into the Bill.  Certainly, from the reasons the Minister gave I do not think he has any strong objections to the proposed section.  Deputy Kavanagh's amendment is a lot stronger in protecting the employees and is more clear and detailed.  I would say to the Minister that even at this stage, if he needs to give it further consideration he should consider coming back here on Report Stage to strengthen it.  He and his advisers have made an effort to come some way to meet the problems and the difficulties that were highlighted here on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I still have some difficulty recognising why the Bill cannot be more comprehensive. In particular, this would appear to be the start of a series of privatisations the Government have in <Col N="263" /> mind, and I would say it is extremely important that workers' rights are protected, and seen to be protected.  I see no reason they should not have protection under the legislation and not in draft agreements or otherwise to be lodged with the Labour Court or with the Labour Relations Commission.  It is extremely important that the workers' rights which, in fairness, the Minister would seem to be protecting, &mdash; although there is some difference between Deputy Kavanagh's amendment and his own &mdash; would be protected in legislation, thereby setting the correct precedent for any further legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> There is one question I forgot to ask the Minister a while ago and Deputy Spring reminded me of it.  In regard to the Labour Relations Commission, at one stage, I was told that the workers were quite worried about the agreement being lodged with them because six months' notice on either side would terminate any agreement.  Is that true?  If so, does it have any significance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>First, I have to say to Deputy Spring that, while I am prepared to look at anything at any stage, as I have already demonstrated, I do not anticipate that my view on this will change. However, I do not want to give the impression that I have a rigid, orthodox, irremovable view on it.  We have specified all protections in detail where we think detail appropriate.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are satisfied with our efforts, although I do not suggest that if they, for one reason or another, have other things to say in relation to any particular aspect of it that they have no right to say so.  I want to say to Deputy Spring &mdash; and I hope this will reassure him &mdash; he knows these are matters for contract between employer and employee in the normal course and the State sets the framework in legislation to protect workers' rights.  That has gone on for the last 20 years particularly and that framework is very important in addition <Col N="264" /> to the ordinary common law rights that apply to employees.</P>
      <P>In addition, those provisions apply to State companies as they do to private companies.  There was no provision specifically in the legislation setting up the Sugar Company or in the various sugar Acts over the years of the detail that Deputy Spring is suggesting I should put in now.  None of those details is in the corpus of laws and statutes dealing with the Sugar Company for the obvious reason that it was not contemplated or appropriate.</P>

      <P>What I am saying is that there have been other developments, and I am happy to see them develop.  I grew up and played at the side of the street as well.  I did not grow up with employers, let me tell the Deputy. I grew up and hurled with youngsters who worked from 14 years of age in the factory in Nenagh.  I know the feelings and the security that is required, and I know the employees in the Sugar Company perhaps more than I would have known management. That is why I am very definitely, apart from my own personal background, aware of the need for these protections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the House can accept from me in trust that it is not a matter of excluding something that was already there because it is not even in the existing laws relating to the Sugar Company.  What we are doing here is adding provisions that were not in the existing legislation.  Yes, the unions had, over a period of years, negotiated agreements with management. Sometimes there were tensions and frustrations, but the last thing that would be appropriate would be to introduce here specific details and conditions of service on every item in a general framework of law.  If Deputies reflect on it, they will acknowledge that they could not reasonably be expected to go farther than they have gone.  Otherwise our role here would become the role of direct intermediary between employer and <Col N="265" /> employee in every case, and I think the unions and the employers are best equipped to do that job themselves.  I do not think I can add any more to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  The Minister read out the terms of the draft agreement.  &ldquo;The company has at this time no proposals to offer redundancy terms different from those at present being offered which are those terms which emerged from conciliation conferences in 1981&rdquo;.  He is now telling me that negotiations are going on between the unions and the company to vary those terms.  I have asked the Minister if he would now put on the record of the House what terms are being offered because, as night follows day, within a matter of time, terms will be on the table and I think we should now have them in this House as a matter of record.  That is all I am asking the Minister for.  I would say, with respect, that the terms should be put on <Col N="266" /> the record of this House.  Otherwise this agreement has no meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to put on the record of the House the outcome of negotiations which are at present being conducted between the company and the trade unions.  It is as simple as that.  The unions are in direct negotiation with the company at this time and I think it is really asking too much that I should be asked to go into all the detail of what they should, might or could do.  That is a matter for them and that is where they are at this moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is so concerned about the rights of the great workforce he is talking about, why not copperfasten their conditions in this changeover, and particularly in the matter of redundancy?  I repeat workers are concerned that there would be redundancies. Why have they had to contend with a situation over the last two years where the company have denied that an agreement exists?  What they did say was that they had redundancy terms, but they have denied that an agreement exists. What is contained in the document from which the Minister has now quoted is very vague.  The company acknowledged that there is a current position and have no plans to change the terms: they did not say agreement.  There is a vast difference there and the Minister is not fooling anybody when he says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot let that go on the record.  I have not tried to fool anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not say that, just because these are written into a document and the Minister reads them into the record of the Dáil, that will copperfasten the conditions which the employees desire, and that has to do very definitely with the redundancy agreement which was negotiated in 1981, reviewed in 1986 in the Labour Court and there was no question that the company unilaterally withdraw from an agreement that was made in 1981.  They are now <Col N="267" /> saying there are terms.  That is different from agreement.  That is enough about that.</P>
      <P>By means of my amendment it is reasonable to press that the employees of Siúicre Éireann and their subsidiaries shall become members of the staff of the holding company on the transfer of undertakings.  The Minister implied that Siúicre Éireann would be a subsidiary of the new holding company and that the employees would be employees of Siúicre Éireann.  The Minister will have to clarify that position because the new holding company will have complete control of the sugar industry and all employees will be transferred to the new company and will have a new contract of employment.</P>
      <P>If this is not a transfer which is provided for in Statutory Instrument 306/80, Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations, 1980, why has the Minister not referred to that? That is a European statutory regulation introduced by a Minister of his own party who was in the European Council at the time.  Why is that not written into the legislation we are about to enact which concerns the rights, privileges and conditions of employment of 1,700 people in this company?  The Minister said those people would be employees of the Sugar Company; that is not correct.  They would be employees of the new holding company. Consequently, in my proposed amendment, I am asking that all employees of Siúicre Éireann and its subsidiaries shall become members of the staff of the new holding company.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sugar Company have many subsidiaries, but the employees of the subsidiaries are employees of the Sugar Company; but the subsidiaries have their own boards of management.  That position needs to be clarified.  Workers are observing this situation and know when their rights are infringed.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely atrocious that the Minister would come into the House and tell us that the company have withheld a sum of £10 million.</P>

      <P>On a point of accuracy I did not say that.  It is a sad and regrettable feature of some elements in this debate that where significant guarantees and protections are built in, which did not exist previously, some Deputies, such as Deputy Sherlock, want to distort that by saying we are failing to give protection. I want to tell Deputy Sherlock &mdash; and some Members of his party &mdash; that his attempt to distort is not doing a service to the workers, and they know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the boss of the Irish Sugar Company.  Can he tell me why this issue did not come before the board of the Irish Sugar Company? How is it that the issue of privatisation was not discussed by the board of the Irish Sugar Company?  It has been handled right through by the Minister. Have the board been asked to make a decision?  If the Minister, who is the boss of the Irish Sugar Company holding the majority share, says that over the years the company withheld that amount of money from the pension fund, then I would respectfully suggest that this is a very serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quote from a document from a group I accompanied when Siúicre Éireann cpt manual workers pension scheme of 1984 was being negotiated.  Up to 1984 the workers in the Irish Sugar Company paid into the Irish Sugar Workers Gratuity Society contributions which were deducted from their wages, and the pension paid to retiring members was deemed to have been a non-contributory pension but the funds which the <Col N="269" /> workers contributed were transferred automatically to the new pension scheme when the new deed was drawn up in 1984. The commencement date means the date on which the funding of the scheme shall commence which shall be the date on which the Sugar Workers Gratuity Society is dissolved in accordance with the provisions of the Friendly Society Act, 1896, and on which the funds of the said society are transferred to the trustees.  Who is trying to cod whom? That money was contributed by the workers.  If that amount was outstanding to fund the pre-1984 pension scheme, there must have been something radically wrong if the workers were told their money was invested in gilt edge securities and that the company were putting in their pound of flesh to back up the workers' contributions.  That should be the subject of a full investigation.  To say that moneys will be put in is simply holding out a carrot to workers when we are enacting legislation which could have such a detrimental effect on their future livelihood.  This is a matter about which I am very concerned, because I have a copy of the document.</P>
    <P>The pension scheme established by the said resolution on 4 June 1959 was subsequently terminated under the terms of the deeds and rules of that scheme. Where did that money go?  Is the Minister saying the kitty was empty, and that there were no funds in the scheme to provide their pensions?  I cannot accept that or that the amount outstanding is £10 million &mdash; remember, I am referring to the pre-1984 pension scheme.  Since then, the Sugar Company could not say they are withholding any moneys and will put in money because since 1984 a contributory pension scheme was operated by the company.</P>
    <P>There are many unresolved issues. There is no point in the Minister saying they are negotiating with Congress.  If that is the outcome of negotiations, it is not good enough to say that the agreement will be registered with the Labour Court. The redundancy agreement was registered with the Labour Court in 1981, because it was negotiated as a result of <Col N="270" /> the usual procedure and the company wanted to withdraw from it.  As I said, many issues of concern have arisen under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I will be pressing amendment No. 10 which is reasonable in view of the fact that in Statutory Instrument 306/80 the Minister referred to is the Minister for Labour.  Normally it would apply in the case of transactions between companies other than State of semi-State companies. However, as there will be State involvement in this take-over.  The Minister must build into the legislation the conditions which should apply to such take-overs so that the rights, privileges, etc. of employees will be preserved.  I will be pressing my amendment.</P>

      <P>Some very forceful arguments have been made about the pension fund.  I welcome the fact that this fund will be funded with a sum of £4.7 million immediately and a further £5.3 million over the next five years.  This further proves that part privatisation is the way forward for this company.  If it were not for such funding during difficult times the company would not have been able to operate.  It was a secure way of funding the company as the Government had shares in it.  The company have had cash flow problems and I welcome the commitment given by the Minister that he will provide funding for them.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> As the Deputy knows, negotiations are taking place today.  In fact, they went on so long that people who were coming to see me could not get in.  However, that is beside the point.  I hope the unions are negotiating for improvements for the workers.  Perhaps the conditions of workers will be improved after today. Therefore, maybe it is as well that a provision has not been written into the Bill yet.  Does the six months time limit in regard to agreements with the Labour Relations Commission still hold?</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is because I was a trade union official for 12 years that I am a little more suspicious of the answers given by the Minister than I might otherwise be.  The Minister told the House that the pension fund will receive £4.7 million now and £5.3 million over the next five years, giving a total of £10 million.  Can the Minister tell us what the deficit in the pension fund is at present? I believe it is a good deal more than £10 million.  That is a reasonable question to ask and I think there must be a straight answer to it.  If the Minister does not have that information with him now I will ask him again next week when I am sure we will be here again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the note on the pension scheme in the report gives rise to a number of questions and to suspicion. The Minister should prepare a statement between now and next week on this important area: how it will be funded, the amount of the shortfall and why the funding has to be phased in over a certain period although the trade unions have asked him to make up the shortfall now.  The phasing-in process is of some concern to me.  As Deputy Spring has said, the Minister indicated that in two years' time he could have sold off some or all of his shares in the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>That point was clearly made here.  If this is the case the sum of £5.3 million, which I do not believe is adequate to make up the shortfall, might never be paid.  I ask the Minister to get the answers to these questions between now and the next day.  I am also worried about what will happen on the redundancy side.  I hope the Minister will be able to confirm the next day whether the redundancy terms offered in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983 are the same as those in the document which he will lodge with the Labour Relations Commission and which he will endorse as Minister for Food and Agriculture.  I hope we will get the answers to these questions next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>The news of the impending redundancies in Farah was received with consternation in both Ballyhaunis and Kiltimagh.  This firm is a very important one in the area employing approximately 150 people in each town with an average individual income of approximately £150 per week, and a total weekly pay packet of approximately £25,000 in each town.  It is the only industrial employment available in Kiltimagh and any significant drop in numbers employed there would be a serious blow to the economy of the town and district.  Any significant reduction in the numbers employed at the Ballyhaunis plant would be an equally serious blow to the economy of that town and its hinterland.  The company are a prestigious one, their product first class, their management second to none and their workforce in both factories excellent, giving the management complete satisfaction.  Indeed, they recently took on additional personnel and the present difficulty is completely outside the control of the company.  The fears are that the redundancies sought now are only the thin end of the wedge and that down the road, as has been the pattern in other cases, a closure will be announced.  The hope is that the present <Col N="276" /> action will be confined to redundancies only, with as few of those as possible.</P>
      <P>The firm's present difficulties stem chiefly from the current slump in the British market which was their chief outlet.  I know the Minister, and the IDA, will do all in their power to assist this firm over its present difficulties, but I would ask them both to redouble their efforts in this case as the loss of any jobs in Mayo is far more socially and economically serious than in many other places because of the low employment base in the county already.</P>
      <P>This county is threatened with wholesale depopulation due to widespread migration and emigration arising out of lack of jobs there.  Indeed, Mayo was one of the very few counties that lost population in the last intercensual period. Despite a growth of over 40,000 in industrial employment nationally since 1987 there are fewer people in jobs now &mdash; almost 1,000 fewer &mdash; in Mayo than there were in the early eighties.  This is despite the heroic efforts of Mr. Tom Hyland, Regional IDA manager and his staff and others like Mr. Sean Smyth and his county development team and of course Údarás na Gaeltachta.  I know it is a difficult time to attract industry and I congratulate the IDA who are doing a great job in the circumstances, but of whatever little industry comes here, the bigger and more developed centres get the lion's share and there appears to be nothing left for places like County Mayo which is relatively remote and underdeveloped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background that I am asking the Minister and the IDA not only to ensure that Farah get over their present crisis but to have a close look at our part of the country and see if it would not be possible to give some special treatment to that area to encourage job creation.  Clearly it is the most depressed area of the country and the area now most in need of help.  Present schemes will not improve the situation significantly as they are now administered, unless the agencies administering them are directed to make whatever funds are <Col N="277" /> available for development more accessible to the people, firms and organisations in Mayo and in the north Connacht area generally.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Morley for giving me some of his time and to thank the Minister for coming to the House to deal with this matter.  In the last three weeks 1,000 people have been put on short time work in Mayo. There have been nine factory closures in the county in the last two years.  If ever there was a black triangle industrially it is Mayo at present, due in no way to the workforce of the county.  They are totally committed, as in this case.  I urge the Minister to intervene at the highest possible level, and not just by meeting members of the management of the enterprise in question when passing through England.  What is needed is direct intervention with the management in El Paso.  I urge the Minister to send somebody from the IDA post haste to ensure that everything humanly possible is done to impress upon the management the urgency and necessity of keeping this enterprise in place.  We are not witnessing the death of a town; we are witnessing another chapter in the death of a county. It can and must be arrested and I urge the Minister to use his good offices and power to ensure that Farah in Kiltimagh, Ballyhaunis and Galway is not another chapter in the sad industrial history of Mayo and Connacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been keeping myself informed of the situation affecting Farah Manufacturing (Ireland) Ltd., and I share the Deputy's concern at recent developments which have led to the proposal by the US parent company to implement redundancies at the Farah plants in Kiltimagh, Ballyhaunis, and Galway, affecting some 145 employees overall.  The House will realise, of course, that in the case of any enterprise a decision of this type is a matter essentially for the owners and management of that enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> Farah's Irish operations were established in 1981 with a takeover of the former Wrangler plants at Galway and Ballyhaunis.  In 1985 the company expanded their operation with the establishment of their plant in Kiltimagh. Farah currently employ 419 people at their Irish plants in the production of mens trousers, primarily for sale in the UK.  Unfortunately, a large part of the problem is that almost the entire market for the output of the three plants is in the United Kingdom which is in recession at the moment.  In February this year the company were forced to introduce short working time &mdash; three day week &mdash; owing to the recession in the UK, which had led to a downturn in sales and to the build up of unacceptable high stock levels. Unfortunately, the continuing adverse trading conditions on the UK market have exacerbated the company's problems and have now led to the announcments of the redundancies to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the adverse impact both economically and socially of the loss of 145 jobs as a result of the proposed redundancies.  I can understand the disappointment of those who are being made redundant and I sympathise with their situation.  However, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the company must react to the market situation, and it is better that the necessary corrective action is taken now since delay could lead to the necessity for more drastic action at a later stage.  In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that the IDA are maintaining close contact with developments and every effort is being made to safeguard the maximum number of jobs possible at the three Irish plants.</P>
    <P>Considerable resources have been employed in the past decade by the State to help clothing companies to adapt to changing market opportunities and to restructure in order to increase their competitiveness. A wide range of measures is in place and being implemented on an ongoing basis to address the weaknesses identified in the sector, which include lack of scale, lack of attention to marketing and lack of finance.  The <Col N="279" /> measures in place include financial packages with increased emphasis on State support for marketing and technology; marketing initiatives &mdash; home and export &mdash; company development planning; training programmes and so on and involve the state agencies working very closely with the sector.</P>
    <P>The major challenges facing the Irish clothing industry in the future are the completion of the internal market in 1992 and the longer-term phasing out of the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA), which permits developed countries to maintain quota restrictions against low-cost imports from developing countries.</P>
    <P>The clothing industry must prepare itself to meet these challenges, and the increased competition from low cost sources which they will bring, by increasing its competitiveness and developing its export markets.  It will be necessary for the sector to place increased emphasis on management and marketing functions and to exploit the advantages of quality and quick response to the needs of the consumer in order to remain competitive in the face of the inevitable increase in imports from low cost sources.</P>
    <P>While the support agencies play an important role in helping the industry to develop and expand, much of the initiative rests with the industry itself to exploit new markets and to be competitive on the home market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you for affording me the opportunity of raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>The Victorian conditions in the Swords health centre at present are an utter disgrace. It was built nearly 100 years ago and may have been adequate as a health centre some 40 years ago when Swords had a population of 1,000.  However, it is totally deficient at present as Swords now has a population of 20,000 people and the health centre caters for a wider catchment area in excess of 30,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> This narrow, two storey building on the main street is small and obviously overcrowded.  The two public toilets are out of doors and do not have any hot water.  Imagine a health centre without hot water to wash one's hands.  Heating is totally inadequate and is provided by electric heaters which are a hazard because of young children running around.</P>
    <P>The health centre offers no privacy whatsoever to mothers with children needing feeding and changing facilities or to patients waiting to see the doctors and other professional people.  I have visited the centre on many occasions and witnessed first-hand these appalling conditions. Clinics, such as the one dealing with immunisation of children, are regularly held in the centre and, because of overcrowding, I have witnessed mothers with their children in prams queuing on the stairs, in narrow hallways and often out on the streets.  Is this the way to encourage parents to have their children immunised against illnesses we want to eradicate?</P>
    <P>I have spoken to some parents who opted to go private notwithstanding the fact that they could ill afford to do so because they did not want to risk their children's health in the cold health centre.  A dental service is provided daily in a single room upstairs which is totally inadequate to meet the requirements of the area with a child population of over 4,000.  In any other area this figure would warrant three full-time dental surgeons. Is it any wonder that there is such a long list of schoolchildren awaiting dental treatment?</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly placed a special emphasis on a community based, adult psychiatric service.  In Swords this is provided in the health centre; the lack of facilities puts this whole policy at risk. Two doctors attend the clinic every Friday, one of whom consults in a room which is basically a converted cupboard 3 feet square.  Apart from the doctors, five professional people provide a very sensitive service in a room no larger than 10 feet square.  In this restricted area injections are given, consultations take <Col N="281" /> place and a pharmacist dispenses drugs. Given the nature of the illnesses and the patients requirements this is important. It is not unusual for patients to be interviewed in waiting rooms, hallways, streets and indeed in nearby cafes.</P>
    <P>I have been reliably informed by GPs in the area that, in view of the condition of the health centre, St. It's Hospital, which administers the service, have threatened to withdraw from the health centre.  In all probability, it would mean that the service would revert to the hospital about six miles away.  I wish to thank and compliment all the health professional people working in the present facility who, under very trying conditions, continue to provide the best service possible.</P>
    <P>I understand that the cost of a new centre would be in the region of £600,000. A major portion of this amount could be recouped by the sale of the existing building which is on a prime location in the centre of Swords.  I assure the Minister that I am not being alarmist, that is not my style.  These are the facts and urgent decisions must be taken this year regarding a capital allocation from the Department towards the provision of a new health centre.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> contains provision for additional capital investment in the health service over the course of the programme.  The Government and the social partners have agreed the programme which has, as one of its key <Col N="282" /> strategies, the development of greater social rights and improved health and community services for all the population. The programme lays particular emphasis on primary care and other community-based services.  The programme reiterates the Government's policy that health problems should be addressed at an appropriate level.</P>
      <P>Future developments will cover the elderly, people with physical or mental handicap and psychiatric patients, to enable those already living in the community to continue to do so and to enable others in long stay institutions to move back into the community.  A seven year programme is planned to give effect to the improvements in community-based and associated services.  There will be additional capital investment of £100 million at 1990 prices over the course of the programme.  Provision will be made within that amount to enable a major programme of health centre development to be completed over the seven year period.</P>
      <P>I am particularly conscious of the fact that new health centres are urgently required, especially in larger urban areas, and that many of our smaller rural health centres are in need of extension and refurbishment.  The prioritising, timing and financing of the various projects to be included in this major capital programme are at present being finalised within my Department.  It is being examined by my technical staff to ensure that appropriate facilities are put in place to meet present and future needs.</P>
      <P>In relation to present needs, I am aware that the existing health centre at Swords is inadequate to meet the needs of the area.  As the Deputy is aware, the health board have already purchased a central site for the construction of a new health centre.  I also wish to take this opportunity to point out that this matter has been the subject of continuous discussions between the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon and, latterly, with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already stated, this important project is the subject of urgent review within my Department.  I should also like <Col N="283" /> to point out to Deputy Owen that her party had the opportunity from 1982-87 to provide a centre but failed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that the Government did not see fit to make a statement to the House, as was previously the case with B &amp; I and Irish Shipping, when dealing with such an important matter, and that we are dealing with this issue by way of Adjournment Debate.  The Government should not have sold all the shares of the B &amp; I Line plc. at this time.  Even the most enthusiastic Thatcherites in Britain always understood that some State companies in the commercial area performed strategic roles in the national interest.  In such cases a golden share was retained. This may only be a nominal holding of one share with no day to day involvement. However it would mean that the Government could exercise control or a veto if circumstances of a resale arose.</P>
      <P>If difficulties arise in future there is now no guarantee that we can avoid foreign control of all shipping services in and out of this island.  This is both shortsighted and dangerous.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believe that a pre-condition of any sale should have been the retention of a golden share in the B &amp; I line. The B &amp; I line operate on vital strategic shipping routes on the Irish Sea.  With 80 per cent of all our exports leaving by sea, it is vital that the routes are maintained and that there is effective competition for passenger and cargo shipping services. The Government would never have acquired the B &amp; I line in 1965 but for these facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is logical that Irish Ferries would want to obtain a short sea route to complement their sailings between Ireland and the Continent.  There are obvious savings especially in regard to shore-based <Col N="284" /> activities, such as marketing and management, which can be pooled between the two companies.  In principle, therefore, we are not opposed to Irish Ferries merging with the B &amp; I Lines.  The fact that Irish Ferries are registered in the Republic of Ireland and are controlled by Irish business interests is essential. Irish Ferries are an efficient and viable business.  Their commercial approach will benefit the B &amp; I Line.</P>
    <P>However, this proposed sale raises a number of serious questions to which the Government have not responded.  The Government must clarify whether all current routes will be maintained, whether job rationalisation will be on a viable basis.  Will there be an employee shareholding option for the personnel in the company?  What commitments of investment have been incorporated into the deal?  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, has failed to give any answers to date to those critical questions.  His failure to do so thus far indicates a total lack of understanding of the position of the 900 staff of the B &amp; I Line, the shipping agents, tour operators and exporters who must have answers to these crucial questions.</P>
    <P>My only reservation about the Irish Continental Group is their size and capacity.  Their total revenue last year was £40 million with profits of £2.39 million.  They have investments to make in their own fleet replacement operating on continental routes.  To this must now be added the requirement of over £50 million in new car ferries for the B &amp; I line.  Unless cast iron commitments are given to carry out fleet replacement this deal will fail.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the only other short sea route operated by the Irish Continental group was their Belfast-Liverpool car ferry.  That operation lost money for several years despite restructuring and was eventually closed last October.  This country cannot afford a repeat performance on the central or southern corridor. Some commentators have suggested that the Government may have got the worst of all deals in this.  Having invested over the years £110 million for <Col N="285" /> reason of trade and tourism, they got a cheque in return for only £6.5 million. They have no guarantees for the future.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will be tabling amendments when this legislation comes before the Dáil to ensure these shipping links are maintained in Irish control.  The only comments the Minister has made in defence of his determination simply to get rid of the B &amp; I Line have been selective ones from the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report.  I call on the Minister to publish this report in full so that the public will know the number of interested purchases and the real options open to the Government.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe any job reductions should be on a voluntary and negotiated basis.  Moreover, employees who are asked to undertake new work practices must be entitled to a shareholding in the company so they can benefit from this reorganisation through a share in the profits. The Minister has failed to come clean on any of these issues and I hope the Minister of State will now make a comprehensive statement to allay the fears of shipping agents, tour operators, exporters, those who deal with visitors to the country and, most of all, the 900 employees who have been dealt with in such a cavalier fashion to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the passage through the Oireachtas of the B &amp; I Line Act, 1990 in March last year the Minister for Tourism and Transport announced his intention to carry out a review of the future options for B &amp; I with the main objective of determining how soon the company's dependence on Exchequer financial support could be ended.  SKC Corporate Finance Ltd. were commissioned to advise on how this could best be done having regard to the need for adequate capacity and competition in the provision of passenger and freight shipping services.  Having assessed the feasibility and financial implications of a number of options, the consultants came out strongly in favour <Col N="286" /> of a disposal of the B &amp; I as the best option.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the consultants' report last September, the Government decided to request SKC Corporate Finance Ltd. to carry out the additional assignment of exploring the level of interest which existed among potential purchasers of B &amp; I.  SKC had extensive discussions with a number of interested parties.  A prerequisite to all the proposals made to them entailed the State assuming responsibility for most of all of the company's very substantial long term debt.  A significant reduction in the workforce was also an integral part of each of these proposals.</P>
      <P>Having considered each of the offers made by the interested parties for the company, the consultants strongly recommended that the Government pursue the offer of the Irish Continental Group.  In their view this would offer a firm prospect of assuring a strong, strategic shipping line under the Irish flag of sufficient scale to compete internationally. Last week the Minister announced that the Government had signed a memorandum of agreement with the Irish Continental Group following several months of complex negotiations. This decision, subject to the Oireachtas enacting the necessary legislation, the completion of due diligence procedures and approval by ICG shareholders, will enable ICG to acquire full ownership of the B &amp; I.  The Minister will deal with the financial implications for the Exchequer and other relevant matters in more detail when the forthcoming legislation in relation to the B &amp; I Line comes before the House for consideration, which I expect will be in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's specific queries about future employment in the B &amp; I Line, it is the case, as I have mentioned, that a significant reduction in the workforce was an integral part of all the proposals received for the B &amp; I Line by the consultants.  Indeed, I should mention that the B &amp; I group of unions also explicitly stated that they accepted the need for further rationalisation.  The necessary rationalisation measures to <Col N="287" /> ensure the future success of the company will be a matter for negotiation between the Irish Continental Group and the unions concerned.</P>
    <P>ICG are at present preparing their future plans in regard to the future operations of the B &amp; I and their subsequent development.  Final decisions cannot be taken until the due diligence process currently under way has been completed.  I know, however, that the Irish Continental Group are committed to the creation and development of a dynamic shipping group and of the company's plan to make the necessary investment in the amalgamated group over the next few years.  I remind the Deputy that, as the Minister stated recently, SKC Corporate Finance Ltd. have advised that if the Government insisted on imposing a golden share clause in the agreement or on retaining a strategic shareholding in the company this would not be acceptable to the potential purchasers.  At the same time I emphasise that the absence of a shareholding control does not mean the Government have no influence on the activities of our shipping industry and in particular on the maintenance of adequate shipping services for our exporters.  They have both legislative and regulatory powers, for example, under the mergers and monopolies legislation as well as persuasive powers as a Government.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government are satisfied that their decision to accept the offer of ICG for the purchase of a shareholding in the B &amp; I Line will create a strong Irish company of the scale required to compete internationally.  The Government hope the B &amp; I workforce will participate, probably also as shareholders, in this new entity and in their future development.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear one minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Social Welfare and to the Minister for Justice. <Col N="288" /> I propose to call on Deputy Jim Higgins Deputy Brian O'Shea and Deputy Ted Nealon to make one-minute statements appropriate to the Minister for Social Welfare in the first instance, to be followed by statements appropriate to the Minister for Justice by Deputy Nora Owen and Deputy Jim Higgins.  The Deputies are entitled to one minute in respect of each matter and the Ministers or Ministers of State replying have five minutes between them for that purpose. I call now on Deputy Jim Higgins to make his statement.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance was a major innovation eagerly awaited, but I am afraid badly discredited to date. It requires major overhauling.  It is something that makes common sense but unfortunately the manner in which it has been introduced and handled by the Minister leaves its reputation very badly dented.  The principle of keeping someone out of hospital, looking after them at home and being paid for it, is a good and humanitarian principle.  However, I understood that there was reciprocation in the EC.</P>
      <P>We know there is a large interchange of population between Great Britain and here.  I understood that if a UK pensioner came here he or she was entitled to all benefits.  At present a UK retirement pensioner can get the free electricity allowance, free travel allowance, free TV allowance and free telephone allowance in certain circumstances. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the Minister in the recent budget extended the scope of the carer's allowance to cover DPMA, invalidity pension holders, the majority of whom are our own, who were born here, went to the UK and brought back pensions here, are not entitled to benefit at a time when they need care must.  I urge the Minister to do the decent thing and extend the scope of the scheme to include UK retirement pensioners who are domiciled here.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister for Social Welfare to extend entitlement <Col N="289" /> under the free travel scheme administered by his Department to those widows under the age of 66 who would qualify on health grounds for invalidity pension or disabled person's maintenance allowance.  As the Minister knows, invalidity pension and disabled person's maintenance allowance are two qualifying payments, but for different reasons widows cannot qualify for them.  I am aware of widows whose mobility is very badly impaired and they cannot afford public transport to go about their normal business, be it social or domestic, and they are not able to visit married sons and daughters and grandchildren.  I put it to the Minister that this is a relatively small group.  It would not cost a great deal of money to do this and it would greatly improve the quality of life of these people.</P>

      <P>Everyone accepts that there was a drastic fall in farm incomes in 1990.  The official figures are around 15 per cent, some figures indicate it was 20 per cent, some indicate 40 per cent and I saw a few well documented cases relating to north Connacht farmers which indicated that the fall was 50 per cent.  Whatever the average figure was, it was much greater in the west, because they do not have economies of scale.  This year all the signs from Brussels and home are that we will have a repeat of that drop.  The Department of Agriculture and Food accept this but, unfortunately, the Department of Social Welfare do not understand the situation, or for some other reason, will not accept this in calculating farmers' incomes for unemployment assistance and for noncontributory old age pension benefits. They are still doing their calculations as if the downturn in incomes had never happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are losing out on their dole and old age pensions because of imaginary incomes based on now historic prices.  The result is widespread hardship and poverty in the farming community. All Deputies from the west agree on this. We would ask the Minister to get the message across to his Department and <Col N="290" /> have the calculations done on a current basis.</P>

      <P>The 1986 Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act allowed people to apply for Irish citizenship if they could prove that as far back as their great grandparents came from Ireland.  The closing date for applications was 31 December 1986, and applications had not only to be lodged, but registered by that date.  In early 1987, the Attorney General advised the Department of Justice that a small amendment was required to allow for the huge number of applications which could not be registered before 31 December 1986.  As many as 10,000 applications were received in New York alone.  The matter is now one of great embarrassment for this country because recently, on a Marian Finucane show, an American Congressman from New York, Mr. Ray McGrath, reminded Ireland of the numerous lobbies to give &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; visas to Irish citizens.  I would ask the Minister not to continue dealing with this amendment through a general amendment for Irish citizenship but to take it separately, to bring in the one line amendment and give citizenship to these people who have been waiting for four years.</P>

      <P>Twenty thousand people died directly from alcohol over the last 20 years, more than 1,000 per-annum. We can add to this the hospitalization, misery, suffering, marriage breakdown, deprivation, teenage pregnancy and abortion along with fragmentation of families, drunken driving offences and resulting deaths.  One can visit any public house on a Friday night and find that the vast majority of people in crowded public houses are under 18 years of age.  The fines are derisory.  The 1988 Intoxicating Liquor Bill makes provision for ID cards.  This can work, that has been proved, and it will work here. Where there is a will there is a way. The investment is worthwhile.  If it does something to mitigate the scourge on Irish society, which is drinking among young people which leads to alcoholism, <Col N="291" /> I urge the Minister to implement this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The new carer's allowance, which I introduced last November, was a major innovation and has been widely welcomed.  It provides a direct payment to people on low incomes who provided full-time care and attention to invalided social welfare pensioners.</P>
      <P>In general, the allowance is payable to people who are providing full-time care and attention to social welfare pensioners aged 66 years or over or to recipients of invalidity pension or blind pension regardless of their age.</P>
      <P>As announced in this year's budget, the scheme is being extended to cover carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance and those similar persons who receive a pension from another member state of the EC or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.  As a result of that extension, persons providing full-time care and attention to incapacitated recipients of UK retirement pensions who are over 66 years will be brought within the scope of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition the personal rate is being increased to £50.  I am surprised Deputy Higgins was not aware of this.  It is in the speech I made in the House and it is on the record.  It is wasting the time of the House to bring up something which is already agreed in the budget and is coming in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all permanent residents of the State aged 66 years and over &mdash; including widow pensioners &mdash; blind persons aged 18 years and over, and persons receiving <Col N="292" /> social welfare-type payments as permanently incapacitated persons.  Widow pensioners under 66 are not entitled to free travel.  An extension of the free travel scheme to include widow pensioners under 66 on disability grounds would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  I do not accept that there has been any failure on the part of my Department to re-examine the means of any claimants whose income from farming has fallen.  Means from farming for unemployment assistance purposes are assessed under specific provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.  I am satisfied that the legislation has the flexibility to deal with changes in farming incomes.</P>
      <P>The relevant legislation provides that the yearly value of any advantage accruing to the claimant from the use of property &mdash; other than property personally used and enjoyed by the claimant, such as a dwelling &mdash; is assessable as means.</P>
      <P>The value of the yearly advantage is essentially based on the income from the farm less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The basis of the calculation is the net income from the farm over the 12 months preceding the date of the investigation, adjusted where necessary, to reflect significant changes in farm prices or any other factors which would impact on farm income.  This means that in assessing means, account is taken of the current level of and emerging trends in farm incomes.</P>
      <P>Any smallholder in receipt of unemployment assistance who considers that he may now be entitled to a higher payment because of a reduction in his means due to a decline in farm incomes, may apply, in the normal way, to have his means reassessed.  Smallholders who consider that they might be eligible for unemployment assistance as a result of a fall in their incomes should also apply to the local offices of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relevant legislation and the interpretation of this legislation are kept under review to ensure that it accurately reflects changing circumstances.  For example, in July last I removed the value <Col N="293" /> of farm produce consumed by the household from the assessment of means.  I also excluded from the means assessment the net income accruing to a household in a Gaeltacht area from providing accommodation for students pursuing Irish language courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986 amended the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, by providing that, as from its coming into force, citizens of other countries, one of whose grandparents had been born in Ireland, could register as Irish citizens.  Prior to the enactment of that Act, the fact of a great-grandparent having been born here also enabled a person to register as an Irish citizen.  The Act provided a period of grace, of six months to the end of 1986, enabling those who had not registered as Irish citizens on the basis of the birth in Ireland of one of their great grandparents to do so.  Over 4,200 persons were so registered but approximately 4,000 registrations were not completed before the expiry of the period of grace.  As the period of grace expired on 31 December 1986 the legal basis allowing the granting of citizenship to those applicants ended on that date.  The Deputy's party were in Government at that time and I cannot understand how they did not then extend the period of grace.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice indicated in his reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Owen on 27 November last that he is considering a number of changes to the legislation governing Irish citizenship. When the necessary consultations have been concluded we expect to be in a position to make proposals for legislative change to the Government. Any such proposals decided on by the Government will be announced in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Higgins, section 40 of the 1988 Intoxicating Liquor Act empowers the Minister for Justice to make regulations for the provision of a voluntary national age-card scheme.  We have the matter under consideration. <Col N="294" /> However, before going on to provide for such a scheme we want to monitor and evaluate the existing extensive legislative controls dealing with alcohol abuse by young persons.  There is already some evidence to show that the wideranging measures introduced by the 1988 Act are beginning to prove effective on their own. I doubt if Deputy Higgins's colleague and neighbour, the national president of the VFI, would agree with his statements here tonight.</P>
    <P>Another point that we have to consider is the development of local community-based voluntary identity card schemes. Several such schemes are now operating very successfully.  They generally come about as a result of an initiative by local vintners and the Garda, with parents and the local community in general playing their part.  Typically, cards are stamped and authenticated by the Garda where the applicants are aged 18 or over.  I think that schemes of this nature with a strong community involvement are probably a much better way of tackling the problem rather than the introduction of a national scheme and could usefully be copied elsewhere around the country.  I note that this is also the trend in England due to the initiative taken by the drinks industry itself under the auspices of the Portman group.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government have asked the advisory council on health promotion, with whom I was involved when Minister of State at the Department of Health, to prepare a national alcohol policy.  The policy will be broadly based to include historical, cultural, economic and legal factors relevant to the use and abuse of alcohol.  It will also cover matters such as education, advertising, prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies.  It is relevant to the matter under discussion that the council have been asked particularly to cover the issues of youth and alcohol and the role of parents and family.  I think that it would be preferable to await the outcome of the work of the advisory council before <Col N="295" /> considering further the matter of identity cards.</P>

      <Col N="111" /> In selecting offenders for intensive supervision consideration will be given to factors such as the nature of the offence, previous convictions and periods in custody, patterns of offending behaviour, as well as social background and home circumstances.  Those who are in custody will be selected for inclusion in this programme through the normal screening processes operated in prisons and places of detention and will then be permitted conditional temporary release under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  An offender before the courts, who has been found guilty of criminal offences, will be the subject of a thorough and comprehensive pre-sentence report by the probation and welfare service which will then propose to the court, if satisfied as to the offender's suitability, that he or she be placed on a probation order with a specified condition requiring him or her to participate in this programme.</P>

      <P>Coillte Teoranta and the IDA are continuing discussion with potential investors towards the establishment of a third pulpmill in Ireland.  The location is one of many matters to be considered and will ultimately be decided by the eventual investors, having regard to all the strategic factors involved.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme is designed to assist households who are dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowance of £5 per week is payable for a 26 week period from mid-October to mid-April.  Almost 225,000 <Col N="123" /> households are currently in receipt of the allowance at an estimated cost of £29.1 million in 1991.  This is in addition to expenditure of £5.8 million this year on smokeless fuel allowance which I introduced last year to help low income households meet the additional costs arising from the ban on bituminous coal in built up areas of Dublin.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to a fuel allowance is that the claimant must live alone or only with dependants, other eligible recipients or a person on unemployment assistance.  Consequently, the allowance would not be payable where a member of the household is in employment.</P>

      <P>The comparative information requested by the Deputy, in so far as it is available, is given in the following table. Data since 1980 are also included for reference purposes.  As far as 1988 is concerned, the drop in the percentage is caused by a lower level of growth in social welfare expenditure due, <i>inter alia,</i> to a substantial reduction in expenditure on sickness payments and in the numbers of unemployed, coupled with a substantial level of growth in gross domestic product.</P>

      <P>The 1990 EC free food scheme operated in the two week period commencing Monday, 18 February 1991.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin area, the distribution of free beef under the scheme was, as in previous years, handled by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Qualified claimants were given the free beef on presentation of an official advice notice issued from the employment exchange which dealt with the claimant.</P>
      <P>Every effort was made to ensure that only those claimants entitled to receive the free beef did so.  To this end, and following consultation with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, it was agreed that in Dublin, claimants to unemployment assistance who were entitled to the free beef would be given a separate notice on each of the two weeks for which the scheme operated.  To reduce the risk of fraud, the notices were of a different colour for the two weeks concerned.  In addition, all advice notices issued were endorsed with the relevant employment exchange stamp.  The arrangements made were designed to minimise certain risks observed in previous schemes of this nature.</P>
      <P>To date, there have been no reports of fraudulent claiming under the recent scheme.  If the Deputy is aware of any incidents of fraudulent claiming I would be grateful if he would supply my Department with further details so that procedures can be reviewed in the event of the EC free food scheme operating again.</P>

      <P>The grant-in-aid payable to the Legal Aid Board for 1991 is close to £2.5 million. That is an increase of more than £300,000 over last year's allocation and of almost £0.9 million over the 1989 allocation. Last year a substantial number of solicitor posts were sanctioned for the board and most of their administrative vacancies were filled.  In addition, four law centres which, up to then were temporarily funded, were put on a permanent basis of Exchequer funding.  This year also the board will be opening additional full-time and part-time law centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This shows that the Government are serious about the development of the legal aid scheme on a phased basis and in <Col N="129" /> line with what we can afford to pay.  I am confident that with these improvements the board will be better able to meet the demand for their services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in producing these reports was due to staffing difficulties in the board's head office, particularly in the <Col N="130" /> years 1987 and 1988.  As I have already indicated, vacancies in that area have been filled and the backlogs of work are now being cleared.</P>
    <P>The board's cash surplus at the end of 1990 is accounted for by the usual carryover expenses in a grant-aided body and by savings on pay accounted for by the slower than anticipated filling of administrative and solicitor posts.</P>

      <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the chairman of the Legal Aid Board informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights on 4 October 1990 that the board had a present quota of 35 solicitors but had only managed to fill 33 of these places; and that the Legal Aid Board advertised on two occasions during 1990 to fill these vacancies without success.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board are no different from any other employer of solicitors and they experience difficulties from time to time in obtaining suitable legal personnel, particularly in areas outside Dublin.  I am not aware that this is a serious problem for the board and I do not foresee that the recruitment of the extra solicitors this year which has been authorised by the Government will be impeded.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of crimes reported from Kingswood Heights in 1990 shows a reduction of about one-third on the corresponding figures for 1988 and 1989.  The Garda authorities attribute this reduction primarily to the operation of the community policing scheme in the area and assure me that the necessary resources will continue to be allocated to the scheme to ensure its further success.  The other factor to which they attribute the reduction is increased patrolling of the area at key times, which is continuing.</P>

These estimates take account of both public and private expenditure.

      <P>The Government have coherent plans for the development of the health services <Col N="139" /> which are based on the recommendations of a number of working groups which have reported in recent years.  These groups have considered the development of particular services as well as the broader issues of the funding, structure and management of the services.</P>
      <P>The Government are now implementing their plans in a structured way. The implementation began in February 1990 with the announcement, in the Dáil, of the action plan.  The health commitments of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Development</i> represent the latest initiative in furthering the implementation of our plans.</P>
      <P>The Opposition parties have had ample opportunity to contribute to the process of developing health policy through the many Dáil debates which have been held on the health services, the latest of which was last week, and also in their own policy responses to recent reports.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 96, 97, 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Connaught Regional Airport is owned and operated by a private limited company, Connaught Airport Development Company Limited.  The company have an authorised share capital of £100 divided into 100 shares of £1 each.  Ten shares have been issued to date.  The names of the registered shareholders and the current directors are as follows:</P>

      <P>Mr. Michael Honan</P>
      <P>Mr. Peter Hanley</P>
      <P>Mr. John Mahon</P>
      <P>Mr. Des Mahon</P>
      <P>Mr. James Ryan</P>
      <P>Mr. Seamus Monaghan</P>
      <P>Mr. John Dillon</P>
      <P>Mr. Cathal Duffy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to establish a trust whereby the ownership of the airport would be vested voluntarily in a board of trustees by means of a deed of trust is not being proceeded with at this stage. Revised proposals for the restructuring of Connaught Airport Development <Col N="144" /> Company Ltd., and to provide for the future development of the airport are currently under consideration by the Government.  I hope to be in a position to announce details at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The total area of land owned by the company is 545 acres.  None of this land has been sold.  No fixed assets of the company may be disposed of without my prior permission for so long as the company is in receipt of Exchequer grant aid.</P>
    <P>State grants amounting to £9.858 million have been provided towards the development of the airport.  This investment is protected by means of grant agreements dated 28 August 1981 and 13 December 1982 between the Minister for Transport and Connaught Airport Development Company Limited, which provide that the grant will be revoked in the event, <i>inter alia</i>, that the company are wound up or cease, without the Minister's consent, to carry on the undertaking.</P>
