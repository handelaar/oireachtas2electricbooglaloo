      <Quest>the person who now has ministerial responsibility for women's affairs including the compiling and presenting of progress reports from Government Departments to (1) the Oireachtas and (2) European, United Nations and other international fora.</Quest>

      <P>The achievement of equal status and equal opportunities for women is a matter which arises across the whole range of Government policy-making. For this reason, the terms of reference of all members of Government are to advance the position and status of women in all aspects of their responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1987, a Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, had a monitoring and co-ordinating role on all aspects of Government policy as they affect women.  On 15 November 1991, I announced certain changes at Minister of State level and, in doing so, I also made it clear that the Government will reallocate responsibilities among Ministers of State in the near <Col N="806" /> future.  An announcement in relation to this reallocation will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's statement that it is also the responsibility of every Government Department to introduce an equality policy, what affirmative action is taking place at Government Department level? Will a report on the monitoring of such progress be presented to the Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights in the near future, as was hoped when Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn held office?</P>

      <P>Chairpersons and ordinary members are appointed to State boards because of their capacity for and commitment to the work of the board. The integrity and discretion of board members are relied on under successive Governments to avoid any activity which might adversely reflect on their position as a board member.  No more than my predecessors, I do not envisage a specific directive on the matter of political activity.</P>
      <P>Civil servants, however, appointed to State boards remain subject to the terms of their employment which exclude political activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the House on 15 November, the Government will make an appointment to the remaining vacancy for a Minister of State and will reallocate responsibilities among Ministers of State in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Leyden, already has responsibility for foreign trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Taoiseach's replies to Questions Nos, 1 and 3 that he intends to reallocate portfolios. Given the increased demands on Ministers in the context of our European involvement and also given the unprecedented level of unemployment and the necessity of increasing opportunities in export markets, would the Taoiseach not agree that ideally we should have a Cabinet Minister responsible for foreign trade but since that opportunity is not available we should have a junior Minister with that responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has primary responsibility for foreign trade and he is assisted by a Minister of State.  I recognise the importance of foreign trade, but I believe that the present arrangements allocate sufficient importance to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In many other states, particularly in the Nordic countries, there are specific Ministers with responsibility exclusively for foreign trade.  This allows the Minister the opportunity of spending far more time seeking out markets and assisting the bodies charged with <Col N="808" /> developing foreign trade and opportunities for exports.  Given the other demands on the Minister for Industry and Commerce at present, he does not have the time available to look for export opportunities which might alleviate the level of unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has picked a very bad time to make that point because the Minister for Industry and Commerce is at this moment in South Africa exploring the possibilities for trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs also has a mandate in that area.  Countries allocate responsibility in their own way.  In our case we have a special semi-State body, the Trade Board, to promote foreign trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is not in a position to accede to Deputy Spring's request, given that the bishops in the west called a special conference to highlight the depopulation of rural Ireland, particularly in the west, and also given that the Taoiseach's birthplace is now without a holder of ministerial office, would he consider the appointment of a Minister of State for western development, with a co-ordinating and monitoring role in respect of the various agencies in that region?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That sheep was allowed to stray.  Has the Taoiseach considered <Col N="809" /> the institutional link between the Department for Industry and Commerce, who are responsible for trade, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, who have responsibility for embassies, in view of the need to develop the trade role of the embassies?  Is there a need to establish a ministry of state bridging Foreign Affairs and Industry and Commerce as Departments to bring them closer together in the promotion of trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an ongoing argument which is settled in different ways by different Administrations.</P>
      <P>I suppose there is an argument for putting foreign trade under the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That would have some advantages.  On the other hand, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has much more detailed knowledge of our capacity to export and the areas in which we would be seeking market outlets.  On balance, it has always been decided that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have primary responsibility at Government level for foreign trade. There is, of course, close co-ordination between the two Departments.  In fact, all our embassies play a very important role in facilitating the development of exports.  For instance, there is always close co-operation between the embassy in a particular country and the trade board as it is now called.  In fact, some years ago I instituted a programme whereby there would be an &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo;, one centre, in every major city where all the agencies connected with promoting Irish interests could be found. That programme is proceeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Taoiseach that he might consider the appointment of the same Minister of State at both Departments as a way of establishing a bridge between the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider looking at the situation because I am convinced &mdash; and I hope he takes congnisance of this &mdash; that there are further opportunities for establishing and developing exports and that this could be <Col N="810" /> achieved with the help of a Minister who has full-time responsibility for this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to have practical suggestions from any Deputy in that area because it is crucially important. As a country, we live by our exports.  I cannot think of any other country where such a high percentage of the total economy is in the external area.  A very high percentage of our gross national output is exported.  Therefore, this area is crucial to our whole economic progress and job creation, and I would be very glad to hear any ideas Deputies might have with regard to additional avenues that could be explored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 5 and Question No. 40 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, I welcome and indeed encourage active support from all citizens for the Garda Síochána in the fight against crime.  Such support is the essence of progressive policing measures like community policing and of successful community initiatives in crime prevention such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert which promote and channel public support for the Garda Síochána in a lawful manner with due regard for the rights of all citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Self-help crime prevention measures of this kind, which are undertaken in co-operation with the Garda and within the law, are quite a different matter from vigilanteism.  My position in relation to vigilante-type groups is already well known.  Self-appointed groups of would-be enforcers of the law, who in reality undermine the rule of law, have no place in a democratic society.  The Garda Síochána is the only legally constituted police force in this State and any attempt <Col N="812" /> by individuals or groups to take the law into their own hands will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>We are all too well aware of the dangers inherent in vigilante-type activities and I am sure that Deputies on all sides of this House will strongly disapprove of such activities and be anxious to discourage anybody who might be so misguided as to contemplate engaging in them.  For that reason it is essential that we all adhere to strict accuracy and maintain a sense of proportion in what we say about policing matters and do not inadvertently undermine public confidence in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is simply untrue to assert that in rural areas growing numbers of civilian groups are being formed to patrol and protect their communities.  I am aware, as are the Garda authorities, that some people came together recently in the Bunclody area to keep an eye on premises and so on at night following an increase in burglaries in the town.  However, there was no question of those concerned acting as vigilantes or taking on anything in the nature of a law-enforcement role. They were all known to the Garda as responsible, well-intentioned members of the community who simply decided to keep a close watch on things at a time when they were worried about burglaries and who decided also to keep the Garda informed of what they had observed.  The situation which gave rise to their concern has, I am glad to say, been handled in the meantime by resolute and effective Garda endeavour.</P>
    <P>It would be quite misplaced to seek to make any connection between the activities of the Bunclody group and the opening hours of rural Garda stations.  There has been no reduction in the opening hours of Bunclody station and my information is that an extension of opening hours there would only serve to reduce the level of outdoor Garda patrolling in the area.  I fail to understand how it can be seriously suggested that a member of the Garda Síochána can more effectively discharge his role of preventing and detecting crime by sitting behind a desk in a Garda station for longer than is necessary to provide an office service to <Col N="813" /> the public than by being out on active patrolling and other outdoor operational duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that whether we like it or not people feel safer when there is a Garda station in their town and a Garda presence on the street?  The Bunclody group, whom I did not refer to solely in my question, have made it clear in correspondence that they established this patrol group because of the lack of Garda presence on the streets of Bunclody. Would the Minister not agree that if he persists in standing over a reduction in Garda numbers of 900 over the past five years there is a danger that this trend will continue?  Finally, would he agree that the events on the outskirts of Dublin over the past number of days will give rise to a great deal of alarm?  The fire brigade action now being taken of redeploying gardaí to other stations in Dublin to satisfy a need at a particular time will lead to outbreaks of violence in other areas, with the result that gardaí will have to be moved from one place to another. This all leads back to the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the overall number of gardaí, the Government are now engaged in their second major recruitment programme under which 13,500 young people applied for the positions advertised and 1,000 have been recruited.  The written tests have been completed and the interview process is now under way.  At present a completion programme is under way at the training college in Templemore for those who were recruited initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be misleading if I were to agree with what the Deputy suggested in relation to Bunclody.  My information is <Col N="814" /> that many people in the Bunclody area are of the view that there has been enough misleading comment about their situation.  To put matters into perspective in regard to Bunclody, 48 indictable crimes were reported to the end of October this year and 22 of these have already been detected.  Most of these crimes were either burglaries or larcenies, with a high proportion of them attributable to one young person who is now the subject of a court order.  I am not suggesting that 48 crimes in what was previously a relatively tranquil area is not a matter for concern. It is a matter for concern, but appropriate measures have been taken by the Garda and the situation is now in hands. Obviously, I cannot give details of the further measures being taken.</P>
    <P>As regards the situation in west Dublin, this is not a fire brigade operation. The Garda have been very active in that area.  I visited Killinarden and Ronanstown as far back as last May.  A number of initiatives and preventative action were taken at that time with the co-operation of the local communities, local schools and local business communities. Throughout the summer various projects were undertaken.</P>
    <P>Various projects are underway in the Cherry Orchard area.  I can tell the Deputy &mdash; it may come up later in a Special Notice Question, if it has been allowed &mdash; that in some suburban estates, not just within Dublin, but throughout the country particular problems have arisen.</P>
    <P>I have a meeting this evening with the Garda Commissioner, his two deputies and the full assistant commissioner ranks of the Force.  The Government have decided to nominate an assistant secretary in the Department of Health, Social Welfare, Labour, the Environment and Justice to see how we can have a comprehensive response because throwing police at the problem will not solve it.  The problems in some of these areas go far deeper than just policing.</P>
    <P>In Ronanstown there are about 4,500 houses with a population of about 24,000, some of the finest people one could wish to meet, but there is a problem in the <Col N="815" /> area and it needs a comprehensive approach and that comprehensive approach, which is already under way, is being further expanded by actions taken by myself on behalf of the Government.</P>

      <P>I assume the question refers to a paper delivered at a recent seminar by the Director of Public Prosecutions which related primarily to our criminal procedure rather than our corpus of criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> In the past seven years or so, significant progress has been made in the reform of criminal law and procedure.  Starting with the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, quite a long list of important legislation in the sphere of criminal law and procedure has been enacted.  In the period since I assumed office as Minister for Justice that list includes the following: the Video Recordings Act, 1989; the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989; the Criminal Justice Act, 1990; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990; the Larceny Act, 1990; the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990; the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990; the Courts Act, 1991; and the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that many other important Bills in the criminal law area are in the pipeline as already announced in the <i>Review of the Joint Programme for Government 1989-1993.</i> The most important of these are an Extradition Amendment Bill, a Criminal Evidence Bill, a Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Bill, a Criminal Insanity Bill, a Juvenile Justice Bill, a Criminal Law Bill and a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous) Bill.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission are putting the final touches to their report on the law of dishonesty.  I have already stated in this House that it is the Government's intention to make whatever changes are necessary to modernise this area of the criminal law as soon as the commission's recommendations have been received.</P>
    <P>Added to all this is the other important impending work of the Law Reform Commission in the criminal law sphere, which was referred to by the President of the Commission in his address to the recent seminar attended by the Director of Public Prosecutions, particularly its review of the important area of offences against the person.</P>
    <P>What has been done and is being done constitutes a substantial and systematic programme of reform of criminal law and procedure and I intend to carry forward this programme as speedily as possible</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 7 and 9 and Questions Nos. 12, 19 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has already been announced, the Government have approved the preparation of legislation which will include provision for the amendment of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, in the light of the Supreme Court judgments of 15 November in the Magee, McKee and Sloan cases.  Details of the legislation will be published in the ordinary way when it has been finalised and approved by the Government and, as the Taoiseach indicated in the House last <Col N="818" /> Thursday, it will be introduced in the House as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is not an ordinary piece of legislation, that it has wide-ranging consequences for relationships between North and South?  In view of the serious loophole that exists in our extradition laws, does he not accept that to say publication of this legislation will be announced in the ordinary way is unsatisfactory? Is he not big enough to accept the fact that there is a Bill on the Order Paper in the name of the then spokesman on Justice, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, which was published by Fine Gael on 28 June 1990 which actually closes the loophole confirmed by the recent Supreme Court decision?  Finally, does he accept that perception in this whole area is very important in relation to the difficulties in Northern Ireland?  Does he accept that as long as people feel there is a safe haven across the Border for those who engage in terrorist activities, such as the possession of machine guns with intent to endanger life or to store explosives &mdash; even though I have to admit there is nobody in this House who accepts that that should happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is no desire to make a political football out of this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that perception in this area is very important.  The Deputy will concede that on the basis of the Supreme Court making a judgment in three cases &mdash; which were the first major test of the 1987 Act &mdash; and if having <Col N="819" /> decided on a Friday in relation to it, the Government decided on Wednesday, on Thursday of last week to make the changes to close loopholes, there can be no perception of a safe haven here.  The 1987 Act is in place and it would have been premature until it had been fully tested by the courts to have made any changes.  Deputies should not lose sight of the fact that the 1987 Act gives full effect to the obligations we assumed when we signed the European convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and accords fully with international norms in the limitations it places on political offence exceptions for extradition purposes.  Indeed, it is important to remember that Ireland is one of only eight countries to have acceded to the convention without entering a reservation. The remaining 14 parties have entered reservations which have the effect of making their legislation in this area less stringent than ours.  I can assure the Deputy there will be no delay in bringing forward this legislation but it has to be carefully drafted to ensure that it complies with our Constitution.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy also that we have in place the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act and I recommend &mdash; and have publicly recommended to the UK authorities &mdash; that we make greater use of it.  On the 16 occasions it has been used it has proved successful on 13 occasions. I make this point publicly on all occasions when we discuss this matter at Anglo-Irish level.  Apart from the changes in the law here, it will be necessary to introduce legislation in the United Kingdom Parliament on the rule of specialty because the Deputy, like myself, would have a strong view that if a citizen of this State is to be extradited he or she should only be brought before the court on the specific charges for which they were extradiated and that no changes in those charges can take place.  It is a complex area but I can assure the Deputy that within a week of the Supreme Court making its judgment on the 1987 Act, immediate action was taken by me and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister would like to give the impression of speed of action on the part of the Government, would he not accept that the judgment of the Supreme Court to which he referred could not have taken this Government by surprise and that documents which his partners in Government prepared some two years ago would have advised him fully on that aspect?  Would the Minister also agree there are other glaring loopholes in the legislation that need attention?</P>
      <P>Will the Government, in this legislation, for the first time, provide for a statutory definition of a political offence?  Will the problems such as those which arose in the Ellis case, be dealt with, so that the rule of specialty will be given statutory power?  Are the Government giving any regard to the proposition that in all extradition matters, in order to protect our constitutional rights, at least the <i>prima facie</i> case should be established in this State before a person is extradited?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to await the publication of the Bill to see what is included and excluded and he will have the opportunity in a, no doubt, detailed Committee Stage to make suggestions to improve the legislation. With regard to the Government not being ready to handle a situation, depending on a decision of the Supreme Court, this legislation was only brought in in 1987. It was important to have it fully tested through the courts.  It was tested and the judgment was handed down.  Within one week of the judgment the Government passed proposals which are now with the parliamentary draftsmen to prepare a Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister was quick with his statement, but it is action we need in this case.  Will the Minister agree that following the High Court decision nearly 12 months ago it would have been prudent for any <Col N="821" /> Government to have legislation prepared in case the Supreme Court confirmed the High Court decision, so that we could be seen to act quickly and effectively to deal with terrorism?  Will the Minister accept that if an Opposition party can produce a Private Members' Bill which clearly covers the loopholes in the question, the Government with the resources available to them should be able to produce similar legislation in a very short time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it was not merely a statement that was made, but a decision taken by the Government in relation to recommendations I put to the Government. The parliamentary draftsman is working on the Bill which will be introduced in this House.  I am as committed and as determined as any Member to ensure that we have the legislation as rapidly as possible so that those engaged in terrorist crimes cannot claim political extemption for them here.</P>

      <P>My first question was an attempt, in the orderly fashion of this House, to elicit information with regard to the Minister's views on these important matters.  It is hard to accept the Minister's reply that I should wait until Committee Stage when, inevitably, I will not find the Minister present as he was not present during Committee Stage of a Bill from his Department for some considerable time.  What are the Minister's views on information being given outside the House?  Is it intended that the role of the Attorney General will now be supplanted by the High Court in any new legislation?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if, in the light of the award of £196,500 made by the High Court on 18 November 1991 to a Garda attached to the Carriage Office, who was subjected to a campaign of intimidation and threats after refusing to take part in the issuing of bogus taxi licences, he will outline the steps which were taken to identify those responsible for this campaign; the disciplinary or other steps which were taken against those involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of dealing fully with the Deputy's question I think it would be helpful if I were to distinguish between the steps taken in relation to the irregularities which occurred in the Carriage Office and those taken in relation to the intimidation and threats which followed.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the irregularities in the Carriage Office referred to in the question first came to light in September 1982.  Following an internal investigation by the Garda authorities criminal proceedings were instituted against four members of the Force resulting in three convictions. One of the three members convicted had retired before the court proceedings and two were dismissed from the Force following their convictions.  The fourth member concerned was found to have been in breach of disciplinary regulations and a penalty was imposed under those regulations.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that following the occurrences referred to in the question, revised procedures and arrangements were introduced in the Carriage Office and that these are working satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> With regard to the intimidation and threats I understand from the Garda authorities that these were made by way of anonymous letters and telephone calls. The matter was fully investigated but it was not possible to obtain sufficient evidence to initiate proceedings.</P>
    <P>I should say at this point, that it has never been the practice to disclose publicly, details of Garda investigations or of the outcome of Garda disciplinary proceedings, which under the regulations in question are required to be held in private, save in singular instances where there are exceptional circumstances such as to warrant a departure from that practice. I am satisfied that the disclosure to the House of the information I have just given is warranted in the quite exceptional circumstances existing in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a very disturbing and tragic case for the affected garda.  Is the Minister satisfied that all the forged taxi licences have been accounted for? Given that the forged licences in 1981, when the event occurred, were valued at approximately £5,000 and that licences are now valued at £30,000 to £40,000, has the Minister taken sufficient steps in the Carriage Office to prevent a recurrence of these events?  Will the Minister comment on reports that there are mixed views in the senior ranks of the Garda about large settlements to gardaí, that gardaí are doing their duty and they might question the large settlements?</P>

I am assured by the Garda authorities that following the occurrences referred to in the question, revised procedures and arrangements were introduced in the Carriage Office immediately and that these are now working satisfactorily. With regard to the licences, I do not have that information available to me but I will get it and I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>

    <P>As regards the question of legislation, I have already announced my intention to introduce legislation with a view to amending the law in relation to criminal insanity.  This commitment has been reaffirmed in the <i>Programme for Government <Col N="826" /> 1989-1993.</i> The legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the current stopgap arrangement is not a satisfactory way in which to deal with these matters?  Would he advise the House whether the legislation, when it comes before the House, will provide for these issues to be determined by a court or a committee sitting in public where all parties concerned can be represented and the decisions arrived at in open forum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate from the replies I gave earlier that I cannot divulge specific details of proposed legislation at this stage.  However, I can say that certain areas are being examined in the context of the legislation. These include the procedures for determining the release of guilty but insane persons as well as the provisions about fitness to plead at a criminal trial, a possible change in the verdict of guilty but insane, the introduction of a right of appeal against such verdicts, the definition of the right of insanity, and the possibility of introducing the concept of guilty but with diminished responsibility.</P>
      <P>I accept that legislation is the ideal solution to this.  However, the courts had decided in relation to two cases and I felt that it was far preferable that I would have the benefit of some qualified and independent advice in making a judgment as to the release or continued detention of applicants.  With that in mind I appointed an advisory committee and I want to take the opportunity in the House of commending them and thanking them for the work they have carried out on behalf of the Government and the people.  The committee comprises Mr. John Hedigan, a distinguished senior counsel who acts as chairman, Dr. John Owens the chief psychiatrist of St. Davnett's Hospital in Monaghan and Dr. Michael Loftus, a general medical practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, to get the best possible advice <Col N="827" /> the Government, on my recommendation, decided on the terms of reference under which the committee are acting.  In the absence of the legislation it is important that they operate effectively, and I think the terms of reference are broad enough.  Let me remind the House that the terms of reference of the committee are to advise the Minister for Justice whether or not the applicant is suffering from any mental disorder warranting his continued detention in the public and private interest, including the question of whether he would be a potential danger to any member of the public if released and, having regard to any relevant information, material, or submissions as may be tendered to or come to the notice of the committee, including any information, material or submissions tendered by or on behalf of the applicant. In one case the committee have recommended to me, and through me to the Government, that one of the applicants should be detained.  I accepted that.  In the other case they recommended release and I fully accepted that as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the great deal of public unrest in relation to some of these cases where individuals were found to be guilty but insane, but insane at the time of committing the offence and sane at the time of the trial?  Would the Minister agree that operating under legislation dating back to 1883 &mdash; I think it is the Trial of Lunatics Act &mdash; is most unsatisfactory? Can the Minister give some comfort to the victims of crime, the relatives who suffered a great deal, particularly in relation to the Donegal case, that legislation will be amended and that those who are found to be guilty but insane, instead of being convicted on a murder charge could at least be convicted on a manslaughter charge?  Would the Minister agree that if that were to happen it would then be a matter for the courts to impose a sentence as distinct from asking the Minister or the Government of the day to make a decision whether somebody should be released from the Central <Col N="828" /> Mental Hospital where they should never have been in the first place?  Would he agree that it is very difficult to stand over a situation where somebody is committed to the Central Mental Hospital although the senior psychiatrist in that hospital has given evidence to the effect that the person is sane at the time that the court is sending the person there?</P>

      <P>I fully accept that the legislation needs to be updated.  That is why I am preparing legislation to introduce in this House.  I fully accept that it is the deeply and strongly held view on all sides of the House that the legislation should be changed.  I hope for a speedy passage of the legislation when I bring it forward. I do share the Deputy's concern about the natural worries and the natural feelings of families of people who have lost loved ones as a result of a crime.  That is why I am bringing forward amending legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that there are 19 people currently in detention as a result of guilty but insane verdicts.  What is the motor mechanism of cases being brought before the committee? Can an applicant, of his or her own motion, initiate a reconsideration by the Committee or is it done by reference to the courts or the Minister exclusively?</P>
      <P>The other question I want to ask is in regard to the Henchy committee report which has been before the Government since 1988.  I do not say that as a criticism of the present Minister but could he indicate in word or in a sentence why that report has never been acted upon to date?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is also widespread public concern that the verdict of guilty but insane may be brought in wrongly in some court cases?  Would the Minister agree that psychiatrists asked to give evidence in such court cases have differed and are engaging in what can be best described at retrospective rationalisations and that the determination as to whether someone was insane at the time of a crime who is clearly sane at the time of the court case may very much depend on what the accused tells the psychiatrist as much as on what is seen at the time?  Would the Minister, in the context of such legislation, look at the possibility of putting in place a mechanism whereby a group of two or three psychiatrists have to give evidence to a court with regard to the sanity of someone at the time of the commission of a crime where it is alleged that there is a possibility that they were insane?  Would the Minister finally agree that it is not satisfactory that such cases be determined simply on the basis of evidence given by one psychiatrist who projects possible sanity and another who projects possible insanity and the matter then being left to a jury or, in certain cases, to a judge alone to determine? There is a particular difficulty in this area and there is a general public concern that people are evading proper convictions for murder and manslaughter by bringing in this type of verdict.</P>

      <P>At present there are about 2,200 persons in custody in our prisons. In recent years a new institution, which accommodates 320 persons, was provided at Wheatfield and work is currently in progress on the provision of a new unit at Mountjoy and the refurbishment of St. Patrick's Institution which, when completd, will provide accommodation for over 100 more offenders.  Since 1987 there has been a total investment of £31 million in the prison building programme which is, I think, a clear indication of my commitment in this regard.</P>
      <P>The question of whether further accommodation needs to be provided in the prison system is a matter that I keep under continual review, having regard also, of course, to the need to refurbish on a phased basis much of the existing accommodation.  I am satisfied that with the developments in relation to prison accommodation which I have mentioned, together with the operation of a range of alternatives to imprisonment, reasonable provision is being made to cater for the numbers of persons who are being sentenced to imprisonment, community service or non-custodial supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In thanking the Minister for the information on the number of places, 2,200, may I ask him if he will agree that approximately 7,000 persons occupy those 2,200 places annually and that this means the present policy could not possibly be working?  Will he agree, therefore, it is important that the people who should be in prison should stay there to serve their sentence?  Will the Minister agree that during their term of imprisonment they should be given some help and training so that they will fit back into society on release and not find themselves back in prison within a short time? During the weekend in my constituency a lady with four children was put into Mountjoy for five days for the non-payment of a fine of £230 for not having a television licence.  I estimate it cost the <Col N="831" /> taxpayer £500 to keep that lady in prison during the weekend.  The State will not get the £230.  I cannot think of anything more stupid than to send a person to prison at a cost to the taxpayer of £500 when that person should not be there in the first place.  I am not suggesting that some punishment should not be imposed on that person but surely community service work or the payment of a fine by instalments would be a better way as distinct from putting an individual into prison at a cost of £500 to the taxpayer. It is of no benefit to society.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned community service orders, as if it was a novel idea.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1983 provided a scheme whereby offenders can do work in the community as a direct alternative to imprisonment. For the information of the House, I should like to state that to date over 600,000 hours of work have been ordered by the courts.  Over 555,000 hours have been completed, that is, 555,000 hours of work on behalf of the community which <Col N="832" /> would otherwise have been left undone. This work included the provision of footpaths and landscaping at the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook; helping with meals at the Knights of Malta day care centre for the elderly, Clyde Road, Ballsbridge; maintenance and decoration of various locations, including, Whitefriar Street Community Centre, Ballinteer Youth Club, and St. Vincent de Paul, Sunshine House, Balbriggan.  This work certainly would have been left undone had the offenders concerned been sent to prison.  The Deputy does not want to see this happen and I share his view.  I would not like to comment on the specific case mentioned by him as it is a matter for the courts who set down the particular penalty.</P>

Would the Minister agree that the scheme has proved so successful that there is now a need to further extend its use?  Will he agree that in the type of case Deputy Barrett referred to community service should be almost a compulsory form of punishment and that the option of imprisonment should not be available?  Would the Minister agree that the very good work done through community service could be further extended to relieve pressure on the prison service so that the really hardened criminals who require a sentence of imprisonment can be given such a sentence?  Finally, may I ask the Minister, as the question relates to the <Col N="833" /> provision of places of detention for prisoners, if he will agree, in the context of providing places of detention for young people, that his Department and the Department of Education seem to have consistently misled the district justice in Dún Laoghaire, Judge Wine, who has courageously been calling for the provision of proper facilities for over 18 months in conjunction with other members of the District Court?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 37, 43, 50 and 126 together. I am informed by the Central Statistics Office that the total number of suicides in the State for the period from the beginning of 1987 to the end of second quarter of the year is provisionally estimated to have been 1,253.  There have been 22 deaths in custody in prisons from the beginning of 1987 to date, of which five were due to natural causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Out of concern to ensure that everything possible is done to prevent further suicides in prisons, and recognising that the causes of suicide are varied and complex, I established in November 1989 an <Col N="835" /> expert group to advise me on deaths in prison.  The group comprised a wide range of disciplines, including medical, psychological, psychiatric and welfare, together with people who are involved in day-to-day management of prisons.  As the Deputies will be aware, the group recently made their final report and it has been published.  I have accepted the main thrust of the group's findings and future suicide prevention policy will be based on their recommendations.</P>
    <P>The group made 57 recommendations in all.  Four of the main recommendations which were contained in the group's interim report have either already been implemented or are in the course of implementation.  These relate to the extension of medical orderly cover in the closed institutions on a round-the-clock basis, the setting up of a suicide review group in each prison, the review of special observation lists and the examination of the time taken to gain access to cells.</P>
    <P>Twenty-six of the recommendations relate to practice and procedures in the prison system and they are accepted in principle.  A programme for implementation of these recommendations as far as possible is being put in place.  Three recommendations relating to training for staff in suicide prevention measures will be implemented on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations, which relate to improvements in general facilities, to the provision of additional institutions, to changes in design and so on will be taken fully into account in the context of the overall development of the prison system and as resources allow.</P>
    <P>While any suicide in our prisons is a matter for regret, we must be very careful to keep numbers in perspective.  When the base number is very low in the first place an increase of even one from one year to the next can represent a large percentage increase.  Comparisons with other administrations with a quite different size and composition of prisoner population are also hazardous.  The important thing is to recognise that there is a problem as regards deaths in custody <Col N="836" /> and to take measures to deal with it.  That is what I am doing in accepting the main thrust of the group's report and I am satisfied that I am taking the correct course.</P>
    <P>There have been eight deaths in Garda custody since the beginning of 1987.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987 contain detailed instructions in relation to the supervision of persons in Garda custody and the provision of medical assistance to prisoners who are intoxicated, or fail to respond normally to questions or conversation, or appear to be mentally ill. The Garda authorities are carrying out a review of all cell accommodation in Garda stations with a view to eliminating any features which prisoners could use to cause injury to themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that the total number of suicides &mdash; even by modern standards &mdash; seems to be very high?  Will he indicate how it compares with figures for similar population size in other countries?  In relation to the changes proposed for those in custody in Garda stations or prisons, is the Minister satisfied that the changes he introduced &mdash; or will introduce &mdash; will be sufficient to ensure that the public concern which has been expressed regularly in that area will be alleviated so that families and relatives can be reasonably sure that the prisoners will not suffer or be in a situation in which they could commit suicide?</P>

      <P>To try to come to grips with this problem I established the expert group in November 1989 with the wide range of disciplines which I outlined to the House.  They have come forward with a report which I have accepted in principle and, as I said, many of their recommendations are already in place.  It is a very important report and it should go as far as is humanly possible to prevent persons in prison or in Garda stations from injuring themselves even though, of course, it cannot be totally prevented. The 24-hour medical orderly will have <Col N="837" /> a very important role within the prison system in the prevention of suicide.</P>

      <P>In regard to deaths in prisons, will the Minister accept that a number of the contributory factors are that many prisons are antiquated buildings which are grossly overcrowded and provide very little useful employment?  In response to those considerations will the Minister accept the recommendations of the special committee that all prison cells and buildings should be brightened, that a new prison for women be provided and cells redesigned and restructured?  Those three fundamental issues put a huge onus <Col N="838" /> on the Minister to concentrate entirely on refurbishment rather than on building new institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the old buildings are part of the problem.  For example, people have committed suicide by hanging using the bars of the cells. With that in mind, in the new unit which has been developed in St. Patrick's Institution we have installed a new prototype window which was specifically designed to tackle that problem.  The type of measures to which the Deputy referred, brightening and so on, including in-cell sanitation, have all been provided.  As I said earlier, since 1987 we have spent £31 million of taxpayers' money on refurbishment and expansion of the prison system.  In regard to the other measures to which the Deputy referred, Wheatfield Prison is an example of how bright colours help; the same will be done on a phased basis in the remainder of the prisons.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is not free of ambiguity and it would require detailed research to produce data which would satisfy the various interpretations to which it is open.  Given the current pressures on the Garda Síochána, I do not consider that it would be proper to commit them to research projects of this kind.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will have no difficulty in accepting my approach on this matter and the reasons for it and I trust that he will regard his information requirements as being adequately met if I give him the information which has been extracted from the available records by the Garda concerning cases of murder or manslaughter in the period 1980-90 in which proceedings were commenced against the spouses, common law husbands or boyfriends of the victim.  There were 24 such cases involving 15 male and nine female defendants, of whom 21 were the spouses of the victim.  All the females and all but three of the males were found guilty of either murder or manslaughter. Of the remaining three males, two were incapable of pleading due to insanity, and the case against the third was struck out.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that, in a relatively small country, it is a disturbing number of cases?  Will he indicate if a spouse or someone in a relationship alerts the Garda Síochána that they believe they are at risk of serious assault, what procedures are in place to ensure that those concerns are taken seriously?  Will the Minister agree that the statistics indicate there is a problem in this regard which needs to be addressed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda are very alert to the problem of domestic violence and take all the appropriate measures to deal with it.  In recent years specialised training has been provided in this area for members of the Force as part of the initial training course for Garda trainees.  Various in-service training courses are also provided.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of the <Col N="840" /> need to deal sympathetically and effectively with the victims of domestic violence and that is being done.  I am looking at the law in relation to the whole question of fear and stress in regard to many women who will not press charges in these sort of cases.  The Garda can and do prosecute in cases of domestic violence without the co-operation of the victim where there is sufficient evidence available to convict otherwise.  In practice, however, the victims' evidence is very often crucial to a successful prosecution. The issues raised by the Deputy boil down to a change in the law to make provision for the spouse of an accused to be compelled to give evidence for the prosecution where the offence charged involves violence or the threat of violence to that spouse.  This issue is being dealt with in a criminal evidence Bill which I will be circulating in the near future.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister may not have the information I am seeking.  Is he in a position to indicate the number of murders or manslaughters during that period so that we would know the proportionate number which relate to domestic and other situations?  Where people have lost their life as a result of domestic violence, can the Minister say how many of the 24 instances mentioned by the Minister derive from family situations in which one or other spouse had obtained a barring order from the courts?</P>

      <P>I do not have a reply to the last part of the Deputy's question. However, I will give the Deputy the murder statistics available to me.  A total of 463 murders were committed here over the last 20 year period and of these 99 cases remain unsolved.  That figure includes the 26 people killed by a bomb explosion in Dublin and seven people killed by a bomb explosion in Monaghan in 1974.  From that information the Deputy will be able to ascertain the number murdered in the period in question and relate that to 24 cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that official figures for indictable crime recorded in 1991 for urban and rural areas are not yet available. However, I am also informed that the indications are that indictable crime has shown an upward trend during the year.  While these indications represent something of a setback in a situation where the trend has been on a steady downward path since the peak levels experienced in the early eighties, it would not be correct to say that they represent a major setback.  According to the Garda there is no question that the offiical figures for this year, when available, will show anything like a return to the levels experienced at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no basis for complaceny either, of course.  Deputies will be aware that a very wide range of plans have been implemented, with success, in recent years on the Garda operational front and that I have also approved the introduction of various community-based initiatives which are making a widely recognised contribution towards dealing <Col N="842" /> with crime problems in particular areas. There has also been a very substantial commitment in the form of increased resources, which is continuing, as well as a range of quite significant developments on the criminal law reform front.</P>
    <P>As we all know, however, crime patterns and trends are the subject of constant variation and it is necessary, in considering further policy options, to look at these matters not only on a year to year basis, but over longer time cycles also.  It is necessary, too, to take account of the complex social changes which can impact adversely on crime figures from time to time, irrespective of what crime prevention and detection strategies are in place, and, above all, to acknowledge that although a law and order response is obviously an essential element in dealing with the problem, it is by no means the total answer.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House, as I have in the past, that the safety and security of our citizens is my chief concern as Minister for Justice and is also one of the top priorities of this Government.  I have been engaged in consultations with the Garda authorities on this matter and will, in fact, be holding a further conference with them today with a view to identifying the specific additional measures which must now be taken to deal with crime, especially in those areas which have contributed most to the variation from the recent trend which seems to be emerging this year.  The advice of other relevant agencies, including the Probation and Welfare Service, will be taken on board as part of this consultation process and my aim will be to put arrangements in place which, on the basis of the best advice available to me, are most likely to ensure that the progress achieved in recent years is maintained and, if possible, improved upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the increase in crime is particularly noticeable in counties adjoining Dublin and that as a result of the increased resources being applied in the city there seems to have been a transfer of crime to these counties where there <Col N="843" /> has not been a similar increase in policing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The crime is very evenly spread across the board as between rural and urban areas.  The new rural community policing scheme which is designed to promote increased Garda community contact in rural areas will provide a more effective response to crime in rural areas. With the introduction of the scheme additional manpower resources have been allocated to the 12 Garda districts in which the scheme has been operating since 23 September.  These additional manpower resources include the allocation of an extra 11 sergeants and 19 gardaí to the districts in question.  Moreover, the allocation of clerical assistants and micro-computers to the newly designed area headquarters Garda stations, together with a reduction in record keeping in smaller Garda stations, has increased the time available to gardaí for outdoor contact with the communities in the districts in which the scheme is operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished to hear the Minister say that figures are not available. In every Garda station in Dublin the figures for the first six months of this year are known.  It is recognised that there has been a drastic increase in the level of crime in the first six months of this year.  Will the Minister agree that it is time he banged on the Taoiseach's table demanding that the level of Garda strength be at least brought up to the 1986 level when there were 900 more gardaí on the streets than is the case today?  Alternatively, would the Minister not set up a criminal law reform commission specifically to update criminal legislation so that those committing these serious crimes can be dealt with in a proper manner?  Will the Minister give a commitment to set up such a commission to consider this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer the questions from Deputies Gilmore, Bruton, Yates, Garland, O'Sullivan and Durkan together.</P>
      <P>From day one the Department had the following four connected operations in progress with regard to this casualty. These four operations are common objectives shared with the other two principals, namely, B &amp; I Line and Dublin Port Authority.</P>
      <P>(a)  Search and Rescue</P>
      <P>(b) Safety of Navigation</P>
      <P>(c) Security of the Vessel &mdash; stabilisation of the declared hazardous cargo on board &mdash; removal of the oil on board and removal of the wreck</P>
      <P>(d) Investigation of the casualty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> To date 50 containers are accounted for.  The B &amp; I have been advised of the need for a side scan sonar search and identification of containers on the sea bed.  Three areas have been identified in order of priority.  They are:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Primary Area 1</i> from the Bailey Lighthouse South then East to Dalkey Island.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Primary Area 2</i> from the Bailey Lighthouse East then North to Lambay Island then West to Portrane.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Primary Area 3</i> outside Areas 1 and 2 from Kish Lighthouse.</P>
    <P>The sonar search will identify anything foreign to the undersea environment.</P>
    <P>Second, the Department have requested B &amp; I to carry out a communication sweep of the shipper-consignee requesting full declaration of the contents of the containers.  The Dublin Port Authority are also carrying out a similar check.  This activity commenced immediately after the accident.</P>
    <P>Third, planning of the salvage operation commenced on Friday last.  No salvage contract has been awarded to date. The B &amp; I Line are awaiting quotes from other salvage companies.  The salvage operation could take 20 to 25 working days.  B &amp; I placed a contract with a salvage group of companies on Saturday last to carry out a reliable verifiable survey of the wreck which is the first step in any salvage operation.  This survey is in progress.</P>
    <P>We are very conscious of the seaman still missing and have impressed on all salvors the need for vigilance and sensitivity.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the area of search is now concentrated at the wreck and on the adjoining beaches and islands.  The Coast and Cliff Rescue Service is carrying our beach searches from Skerries, Dún Laoghaire and Greystones.  The RNLI lifeboats from Dún Laoghaire and Howth have been requested when launched to check the offshore islands and adjoining seas.  The Air Corps have been requested to search when they are in the casualty area.  Passing ships are warned about the containers and are asked to keep a sharp <Col N="849" /> lookout.  Garda sub-aqua teams have almost completed the search of the accommodation of the vessel but due to a combination of bad weather, bad visibility and the status of containers sunk alongside the wreck they have not been able to complete the operation.</P>
    <P>Fifth, the B &amp; I Line have been requested by my Department as a priority to remove the reported 80 tonnes of diesel oil and 15 tonnes of other oils from the wreck as soon as possible thereby preventing, mitigating and eliminating the effects of any further oil pollution. The vessel and surrounding waters have been inspected by the Irish Marine Emergency Service from the air and at sea and only a very slight oil sheen has been noted around the wreck.  The latest inspection was at 11.30 a.m. today, 26 November.  The B &amp; I Line are awaiting confirmation of an oil removal contract which they hope to place this afternoon.</P>
    <P>On Friday morning, 22 November 1991, Capt. Liam Kirwan, Director of Slanu &mdash; the Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department issued a warning notice about the containers being washed ashore.  He strongly advised the general public not to go near any containers washed ashore and requested them to immediately notify local gardaí or the fire brigade services should any of the containers be sighted.  This warning was repeated yesterday by the information officer of my Department.  In fact, I issued a warning in the Dáil on Friday last.  A notice to mariners about dangerous and hazardous containers has been issued and a warning broadcast by coast radio stations.  The carriage of dangerous goods by sea is governed by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code.  This is an international guide prepared by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) for use as the basis for national legislation in pursuance of obligations under Chapter VII of the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention.  Ireland implemented the provisions of SOLAS relating to the carriage of dangerous goods by the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Rules, 1983.  These rules forbid the taking <Col N="850" /> on board for carriage in that ship unless the shipper or the goods has furnished the shipowner or master with a dangerous goods declaration.  Such declaration shall indicate with the correct technical name, the identity of the goods and the United Nations number.  The Rules furthermore require the master of a ship carrying a specific list, manifest or stowage plan to be carried in the ship, setting forth in accordance with the information provided by the skipper, details of the dangerous goods carried in the ship.</P>
    <P>The chemical found on the shore has not yet been positively identified.  All the chemicals found yesterday were collected and destroyed before a detailed analysis could be made.  It is thought that the chemical may be oxobutanoic acid methyl ester, a relatively harmless chemical, which was notified to B &amp; I and listed on a bill of lading.  A shipping agent has identified that chemical as having been on board.  Some more bags were found today and a sample is being forwarded to the consignee for positive identification. The container in which the bags of chemicals were carried has not been identified.</P>
    <P>As far as the cause of the accident is concerned, I have established a preliminary inquiry under the Merchant Shipping Acts into the accident.  In order to prevent any possible recurrence my Department instructed Dublin Port and Docks Board on Saturday to ensure that only one vessel at a time was permitted within one kilometer either side of the number three and four buoy until the conclusions of the report were available.</P>

      <P>I will hear a brief supplementary question from the six Deputies involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the chemical which was found yesterday listed or not on the ship's manifest?  Second, what steps has the Minister taken to have the other substances, and possible chemicals in the other 70 containers, which are unaccounted for, identified?  Were any other substances placed by the shipping agent who is responsible for the butanoic acid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as I said in my reply, the consignee has been checked and there has been an indication that butanoic acid was consigned to him.  I want to tell the House that butanoic acid is not regarded by either the European Community or by my Department as a hazardous chemical. In fact when I checked it out today with scientists from my Department, they indicated that a considerable percentage of it is found in rancid butter, and also &mdash; and I do not want to be facetious about this &mdash; in smelly socks.  That is the kind of acid it is.</P>
      <P>The second point, with regard to the other chemicals, the House knows that the most dangerous one was identified at about 2 o'clock on Saturday morning in my presence.  The Asahi inspector went out to the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> and identified that it was safely lashed on the ship. Since then it has been removed.  Two containers carrying the most serious chemicals have been removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that five days after the accident we have discovered that a toxic item was misrepresented to both Dublin port authorities and B &amp; I?  Does he agree that there can be no proper accident response in an emergency if the authorities conducting that accident response do not know of the hazards involved?  Surely that completely undermines any confidence that the public in Dublin can have that the Minister's Department are properly policing a system of emergency response to such accidents when they occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House, and through the House the people for whom Deputy Bruton has shown concern, that my Department are in full possession of the means to deal with accidents such as this.  Of course, if something is consigned as furniture neither my Department, Dublin port authorities nor B &amp; I can know that in that container there is a chemical such as butanoic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be little <Col N="852" /> reassurance if there was a huge accident as a result of such misinformation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister satisfied with the speed and co-ordination of the rescue services last Thursday night and Friday morning?  Will he confirm that the two helicopters to go to the rescue scene originated from Shannon and an RAF base?  If that is so, why was there no helicopter cover from Baldonnell?  What steps will the Minister take in future to ensure the provision of such immediacy of cover in the context of saving life, which, I understand, would take place within five minutes?  Will he confirm that it took 20 minutes to alert the Dún Laoghaire Lifeboat?  In view of the statements in relation to the co-ordination of the rescue services, will the Minister carry out a full review of the services so that there will not be a repeat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly proud of the rescue services, which &mdash; and this is important in the context of the House and the country &mdash; saved 11 of the crew of the <i>m. v. Kilkenny</i> within 20 minutes. That was a major achievement in a very short time.  Admittedly, the weather was good and the light was reasonably good, but the fact is that 11 people were saved, although, unfortunately, two bodies were recovered after and, even more unfortunate, there is still one sailor missing.  I gather that the sailor who is missing was so concerned about the lives and safety of others that he went around the ship knocking up the crew to tell them that there was danger.</P>

First, will he agree that it is urgently necessary to amend section 86 (2) of the Harbours Act, 1946, to increase the maximum penalty of £10 for the carrying of non-declared toxic materials?  I am surprised the Minister did not comment on a similar, less dangerous incident that occurred on 29 September when there was a leak from a container in Dublin bay.  Only seven weeks ago that incident involved a leak of lithium alluminium hydrate.  Within seven weeks two major incidents occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years the Dublin Institute of Technology qualifications by way of diplomas and certificates have achieved international recognition by educational and professional employers, trade union and other organisations.  A diploma and a certificate from any of the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges has the guaranteed quality mark.  The current liaison between the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and Trinity College, whereby the Dublin Institute of Technology currently have 12 degree courses validated by Trinity College has been a very happy relationship.  The Dublin Institute of Technologys are very grateful to Trinity for providing the facility. However, it is a strange situation that the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges provide the courses, which are recognised as being of degree quality and status, but nevertheless the colleges have to have the degrees validated by a university, in this case Trinity College.  In the Bill the Minister takes unto himself the right to allow these colleges to award degrees in the future.  I fail to see, however, why this cannot be introduced now and why the Minister will not now enshrine in the Bill the right of these colleges to award certificates, diplomas and degrees.  I fail to understand why <Col N="969" /> there should be mystery or mystique about the awarding of degrees.  Surely if the New University of Limerick, formerly the NIHE, and Dublin City University, formerly the NIHE Glasnevin, have been earlier this year bestowed with degree-awarding powers, I cannot see why the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges cannot be given such conferral powers now and not left to the discretion of the Minister at some future date.  Fine Gael will be introducing an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest challenges facing education particularly at second level and, by extension, into third level is the challenge of having our education system meet the employment demands in the real world.  When one examines the technical content at second level one finds that woodwork, metalwork, mechanical drawing, engineering technology are supplied in the bulk of vocational schools. However, quite a substantial number of secondary schools still shy away from vocational or technical content or give a very limited range of choice.  Apart from the fact of meeting the aptitudes, needs and abilities of the pupils, there is the obvious need to meet the growing demands for people with skills and technical training.  It is incredible that there are still approximately 300 second level schools which do not have any technical subjects whatever.  There is an obvious need for a total re-orientation of our second level education, both from the point of view of providing additional technical subjects, new technical subjects and a wider range in the technical curriculum. This is something that will inevitably go to the top of the educational agenda.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems facing the country has been our failure to rise to new challenges.  Our tendency is to buckle beneath the challenges rather than confront them, master them, exploit them to our advantage or see them as opportunities. Our failure to change, to adapt and meet these challenges has marked our performance on many fronts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, less than 20 years ago our farmers were told to <Col N="970" /> produce more milk and beef.  Grants for milking parlours, and drainage to bring more land into production and headage grants were very much the order of the day.  However, all this suddenly changed utterly and there is now a complete U-turn on policy.  Farmers and farm families are now left wallowing in a whirlpool of dismay, uncertainty and indecision. Little diversification has taken place, and we have begun to talk about organic farming almost too late.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly talked ourselves into a top spin about tourism with seminars, studies and stop-go pilot projects. Yet we have failed miserably in the basic task of attracting tourists here.  That is the job we have to do.  We are tremendous at producing global statistics about growth in industry but the truth is that there is no growth in our tourism industry.  The bottom line is that tourists are not coming here.  Yesterday I received in the post a very interesting, glossy, well produced and expensive report produced by the tourist board for my area, the 1990 Ireland West report.  The report is ecstatic about the fact that tourist revenue for the region grew from the 1989 level of £194 million to £217.4 million in 1990.  This is supposed to represent a growth rate of 11.6 per cent.  They pride themselves on achieving their target in relation to overseas visitors.  Any owners of guesthouses and small hotels will tell you that this is arrant nonsense.  There are very few tourists around.  At a time when numbers have actually dropped, the capacity of semi-State organisations to come up with global assertions of growth astounds me.  In fact, to do so is to run from reality.</P>
    <P>I want to see a complete reorientation of education.  We need to steer education away from its massive over-emphasis, particularly at second level and, by extension, at third level on the academic.  I want to see far greater emphasis on the technical.  I see absolutely no reason whatever why vocational schools, community schools, community colleges and comprehensive schools which have in some cases up to £500,000 worth of expensive technical equipment cannot <Col N="971" /> undertake pre-apprenticeship training and the first stage of apprenticeship training at post-junior certificate level, particularly for students who do not have a very strong academic bias but who have a very strong technical and vocational orientation.</P>
    <P>We live in a world where the influence of technology is already very powerful and will continue to grow and dominate.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of meeting educational requirements of providing the necessary courses to seek out, meet and develop the manual and technical skills of students, we must provide the range and options of technical subjects in every post-primary school.  Every school without exception should have a core technical content.  We must elevate the status of technical subjects to its right and proper rung on the educational ladder. In this regard I look with great hope to the new junior certificate subject of technology.  I wish to pay tribute to the inspectors and teachers who have pioneered the subject on to the curriculum and the examination system at junior certificate level.  The subject has enormous potential and it must become a major educational instrument in the years to come.  Even at this stage it is a proven success and it must now be made available in every post-primary school.</P>
    <P>For some reason or other, we as a nation have always managed to have an inferiority complex about technological subjects.  For some reason or other we have by and large shied away from technology. For our own sake we must become increasingly comfortable with technology.  Good jobs in the future will increasingly depend on people who can put that knowledge to work.  We have got to get across the message that low skills lead to low wages and low profits.  The days of high-paying unskilled jobs are gone.  Indeed this is one of the problems increasingly facing the Irish in the building sites in England.  Schools will have to become high performance if we are to achieve the objective of ensuring that everybody who leaves Irish schools has a solid training and the know-how to make <Col N="972" /> their way in the world.  However, thousands of young people who leave school every decade are not competent to face the world.  They have not had their skills and talents determined let alone developed by the system.  Of course, there are far too many drop-outs.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems is that many youngsters fail to see the relevance between what confronts them in the classroom and day-to-day living in the outside world.  They do not believe that the lessons they are learning are connected to the real world or that they will in any way enhance their prospects of employment. A major gap in our system is that employers have never clearly spelt out for educators what they require from students or what students need to know to meet the requirements of the work place, particularly as we move away from the more traditional work to high tech work.  Therefore, we need far more dialogue, contact exchange and interaction between employers and educationalists. At present the world of the employer and the world of the school are like ships in the night, passing each other and each using a different language, one using Morse Code and the other signalling by way of flags.  We look, therefore, to the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and the Regional Technical Colleges to develop a more integrated approach with industry.  We again demand that these colleges be given the resources of which they have been starved up to now in order to do the important job assigned to them.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest indictments of our education system is the big and increasing drop-out rate.  From a social as well as an economic point of view we simply have got to keep our young population in school longer.  It would be very interesting to establish whether any of the youngsters who stole and burned the cars, stoned the fire brigade crews and attacked the gardaí in Neilstown or Ballyfermot attended school last week.  I doubt it very much.  I also doubt if they see any connection whatever between education, learning and living.  Every one of those youngsters probably has a high level of skills, talents, aptitudes and abilities, yet <Col N="973" /> they are condemned to a self-perpetuating life of vandalism.  I know people get rightfully hot under their collars and label them as this, that and the other, but the fact of the matter is that the system had failed them and society has failed them as a consequence.  We are failing to develop the full academic and technical abilities of the poor, the disadvantaged and the minorities.</P>
    <P>We need relevant, practical, attractive education, particularly in areas of high social disadvantage.  This is the key social instrument to getting society in those areas back on an even keel.  That means a practical relevant second-level structure and curriculum.  It also means the establishment of a regional technical college in Dublin in order to take these people through to third level.  One of the outstanding characterisations of the regional technical colleges in the povinces is the manner in which they have opened up access to all ranges of abilities and aptitudes.  The range of post-leaving certificate and diplomas courses available are targeted to all ability categories. Dublin needs at least one new regional technical college as a matter of urgency. How much more socially progressive it would have been to use the £11.7 million wasted on Carysfort in the provision of a business college, on the building of a regional technical college in Dublin.  I fully support training for business but if we want to produce many more Michael Smurfits and Dermot Desmonds, then the business sector should fund this training themselves.</P>
    <P>The point has been made repeatedly that the Smurfit School of Business Studies would have gone ahead in Roebuck, in Belfield, for £5 million and would not have cost the taxpayer a single penny.  It was a scandalous and a wrong decision &mdash; and I know the Minister in his first address to the Seanad defended it &mdash; particularly in the light of the Valuation Office's report last week of a £3.8 million estimate, to lash out £8 million of taxpayers' money for that facility and a further £3.7 million to refurnish it.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I compliment the Minister, in his absence, and I wish him <Col N="974" /> well in his portfolio of Education which is a difficult and challenging post.  We will suspend judgment until we see how he performs but he has our good wishes in that regard.  In this measure he is piloting through one of the most important developments in third level education we have seen in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  I would like also to congratulate the Minister on his promotion and I have no doubt he will be successful in this post.  I have watched him over the years, especially when he was an MEP, when with other party members he briefed us on developments in the EC and he had a very good grasp of the EC at that time.  I pay tribute also, as did other speakers, to the regional technical colleges which have been a success.  We have only to examine the Minister's speech and the statistics he gave us regarding the numbers and the increases, the level of training and the general acceptance of the very high standards by those employers who take on graduates from those colleges.  There has been substantial movement from the academic to the technical and vocational field and now we are getting the right mix.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made in the Minister's speech to the freedom to expand the college facilities and to allow them to have links with the local democratic structures. This is very important in the vocational field.  There are a number of areas about which I would be concerned.  For example, when the national development plan was being drawn up about three years ago, sub-region number six of which my constituency is part, the working group and the advisory group which were representative of practically every facet of the community &mdash; the Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Farmers' Organisation, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Co-operative Organisation and Macra na Feirme &mdash; made a recommendation in relation to educational training.  They recommended measures which would take <Col N="975" /> advantage of existing educational expertise in the region and which had the potential to strengthen indigenous industry and to promote enterprise and development. They mentioned three areas: a precision engineering centre at Sligo Regional Technical College, a regional telecommunications and information technology centre at Letterkenny Regional Technical College and a quality assurance laboratory associated with the fish processing industry.  They recommended also a centre of further education in the Cavan-Monaghan area to develop a range of post-second level education and training programmes geared to local industry and services and enterprise development; centres for the dissemination of European languages and a forestry technology centre for Sligo Regional Technical College.  This is something we welcome.</P>
    <P>A centre geared to local industry and services would be worthwhile but, unfortunately, it has not been set up and I do not think there are any plans to have it implemented.  Twelve months to the day following the announcement on 21 November 1990 I put down a question to the Minister for written reply asking when it was proposed to provide the training centre.  I was told there was a range of post-second level training programmes already in place in the region.  It did not satisfy me or anybody else in the region that that recommendation was not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Cavan College for further studies has been an outstanding success and the Cavan Vocational Education Committee provide some third level courses.  As recently as last week the chief executive officer of the Monaghan Vocational Education Committee said he proposed a new centre which would be closely linked to the needs of future development of local industry including furniture manufacture, food processing, agricultural cooperatives as well as other educational and local needs.  He said this proposal grew out of the success of the committee's post-leaving certificate courses.  He proposed that an expert consultant be <Col N="976" /> appointed to develop the proposal.  While this is desirable it is not what we had asked for or expected.  In that region there were suitable buildings which were formerly used by the Army before they moved to the new Cavan military barracks and we were disappointed that project was not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>It is important that facilities be geared to the needs of the area.  Practically every region has traditional areas of development and manufacturing which require those facilities.  For example, there were many people employed in the footwear industry in the post-war years but now in excess of 90 per cent of our footwear is imported and most of those factories have closed down.  The furniture manufacturing was one of a number of success stories over the years in Monaghan.  In this area there are almost 1,000 people employed in furniture making.  Through the efforts of the IDA in research and development and in new product development they have now built up a massive export market with a number of very efficient firms in the county.  No further development can take place in either woodwork or steelwork without the involvement of the vocational education committees and the colleges.  In the food processing industry where there are in excess of 1,000 people at work, there is a need for continuous courses on food hygiene to be held in vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>We should make more use of the available education facilities across the Border.  One of the best ways in which to develop goodwill and improve community relations is for counties adjacent to the Border to avail of those facilities. There should be co-operation between the two sides and the facilities could be developed further.</P>
    <P>From time to time we hear about a scarcity of particular skills.  Over the years people have complained to me about the scarcity of qualified diesel mechanics.  It makes one think that there is not proper co-ordination between the regional technical colleges and the vocational education committees to ensure a continuing supply of people for <Col N="977" /> these trades.  Most of the regional technical colleges and vocational education committees have plenty of students who would be prolific in these areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement of EC funding under the Leader Programme which has accepted the Cavan-Monaghan plan.  I hope the proposal for a third level education centre for the Cavan-Monaghan area will be acted upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the first visit of the Minister for Education to the House since his appointment I wish him well.  It is an exciting time to take over the Education portfolio.  I am sure the Minister will give it his full endeavour for however long his period of office lasts.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of speakers wish to speak before 7 o'clock, so I will make my remarks brief.  I will address the general thrust of the Bill and will point to some areas about which I am specifically concerned.  If the Minister has an opportunity when replying I trust he will refer to my queries.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the importance of regional colleges because of the college in my home town.  The colleges are a very important part of the infrastructure in towns such as Tralee, Waterford, Limerick and so on.  It is of major importance to Deputies in those constituencies which have colleges, that the colleges are seen to be well funded and to have the support of the Government and all parties in relation to the important roles they play in the towns and counties where they are located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree it is necessary to put the colleges on a statutory basis but I am not sure that the Bill achieves what the former Minister stated as being its objective, to improve the overall governance of colleges, to clarify matters in relation to administration and to deal with the responsiveness of the colleges to the world in which we live.  The Bill is riddled with confusion between the role of the college and the role of the Minister.  That must be addressed on Committee Stage. The Minister will have the opportunity during the debate to outline why the <Col N="978" /> Minister for Education and, indeed, the Minister for Finance in many situations have to have such a hands-on role in relation to the operation of the colleges. Of the nine functions given to the colleges, other than the minimal function of accepting gifts, all are subject to the direct intervention of the Minister.  I am not sure that it is in the interests of education, of the development of education or of the development of colleges that the Minister has such control.  Such a degree of control is unnecessary and undesirable.  This control should rightly be placed in the governing body of the institution.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions in the Bill strike me as being interference with the role of the academic council.  The powers of the academic council in relation to the recommendations they can make to the governing body on the selection, retention or exclusion of students are areas in which the academic council and the governing body should have authority without the necessity of reverting back to the Minister or being subject to the requirements as set out from time to time by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In terms of the regional colleges, the Bill leaves the colleges without the degree of autonomy which these institutions as third level colleges should have.  It is undermining the colleges to some extent to be unprepared to give them the autonomy which they should have.</P>
    <P>Another part of the Bill which has not been clarified relates to continuing education, the functions of regional technical colleges in relation to continuing education or in terms of higher education. That is not clarified in the interpretation section either.  Will the Minister refer to it and more succinctly clarify it than has been done to date?</P>
    <P>I would not oppose the Bill for the sake of opposition but there must be a question mark as to the timing of its introduction, given the challenges facing the new Minister and the promised publication of the Green Paper.  Given the importance of regional colleges in the overall education policy, I would have <Col N="979" /> thought that we should have waited for the Green Paper.  There is a danger that we are about to embark on giving the regional colleges a statutory base and some powers may not be given now which may be shown to be necessary in the Green Paper.  It would have been more workman-like to wait until the debate on the Green Paper has taken place.</P>
    <P>All parties in the House will want to make a contribution on the Green Paper in the context of the development of education and setting out the fundamentals of education for, perhaps, well in to the next century.  That is the major challenge facing the Minister for Education. If there are to be changes in the structure of local educational authorities, and this has been at least hinted at in recent years in terms of the role of the vocational education committees, their structure and their reorganisation, we would have been better to deal with that in the Green Paper rather than having a stab at it now in these Bills.  At one stage we were informed that the Green Paper was to be published in December but, obviously, the Minister is entitled to time to have a look at the Green Paper, at the structures, the philosophy and the control of education.  The debate on all these areas of education is eagerly awaited by people involved in the teaching professions, in the administration of education and by educators in every institution in this country.  It is unfortunate in some respects that we are now outlining this new structure for the regional colleges at a time when we could be looking at the structures in the context of the overall debate.</P>
    <P>Obviously the colleges will play a major role in the education process in this country.  In the generality of education there are still some glaring omissions and inadequacies and I would have thought that we would have to address those in the context of the role of the colleges and, indeed, of the necessity for more regional colleges.</P>
    <P>There are two areas which are worthy of mention and which are hard to address <Col N="980" /> in the context of a Bill which is merely giving the existing colleges statutory status but which need to be addressed. One is the level of qualifications where it appears that we, in Ireland, are doing quite badly in relation to our colleagues in the European Community.  The figures show that whereas 13 per cent of Irish persons are graduating with a degree or other academic qualification, the corresponding figure in Britain is 22 per cent and France 55 per cent.  That would indicate that we have a long way to go to be on a par with our European colleagues.</P>
    <P>The second matter which would have to be addressed in the generality of the debate on education would be access to education, and access to higher levels of education is particularly bad.  It is something we all have responsibility for and we have had major failures in breaking down the barriers and getting better access to the higher education institutions for children of less well off parents.  The figures are quite glaring in this area.  The children of class A parents have a 35 times better opportunity of getting into third level education than the children of unskilled working class parents.  Of all the areas in education, resources, the curriculum or anything else, the question of access is one the Minister should give particular attention to.  Obviously it is more relevant to the provision of a Green Paper than to a Bill which merely deals with the statutory establishment of the regional colleges.</P>
    <P>An aspect that appears in the recent review of the curricula of the regional colleges is the commitment to the liberal arts.  Because of specialisation and the necessity for specialisation, arts generally, and the liberal arts in particular, seem to be neglected in the curriculum for third level education, whereas 40 or 50 years ago, when there was far less pressure in education for many reasons, liberal arts seemed to form a part of all professional education.  In the context of reviewing the curricula for regional colleges, I would like to see liberal arts getting a more pronounced direction as an integral part of scientific and technical <Col N="981" /> education.  There is no reason this should not be the case.</P>
    <P>The question of the economic development of this country is central to the role of the regional colleges.  We can break down the role on a college by college basis but obviously on the question of economic development and partnership between the local community and the college, we must look at the development of enterpreneurial skills, business administration, marketing, engineering and the applied sciences to ensure that our graduates have better skills and more relevant degrees in the context of the marketing which has to be done.  In a country like ours which is particularly orientated to exporting, if we do not have the basic skills we will not be competitive, we will not get to the marketplace and consequently we will not create the jobs this country so badly needs.</P>
    <P>If we get the partnership right, an aspect of this Bill I welcome which has been long overdue is the granting of entitlement to the colleges to engage in research in co-operation with local industry. I believe that one of the very frustrating aspects for local employers and for industry around this country is the way everything has to revert back to Dublin in terms of the research skills available.  Obviously State bodies such as Eolas and others will have to be, broadly speaking, Dublin located but there are high levels of skills available in the science and engineering departments of these colleges and it is absolutely necessary that these skills should be applied at local level, obviously at minimum cost but with maximum efficiency.  That is a very welcome part of this Bill and one which is overdue.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill worry me, for example, section 11 (1) (a), (b) and (c) of the Regional Technical College Bill in the context of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act which passed through this House in 1988, and the duties imposed by that Act on employers. Perhaps the Minister could have a look at these two Acts and inform me if he feels they are consistent because I would be worried that employers would not be <Col N="982" /> able to fulfil the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, in the context of the provisions of section 11 of the Regional Technical College Bill.  It certainly warrants some clarification.</P>
    <P>The duties of the employer are very specific in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.  I find it difficult to reconcile the duties, which are fairly straightforward in terms of references to conditions of employment, which should be in the hands of the employer.  I wonder if it is possible, in the context of the powers of the Minister to reconcile them with the provisions of the prior Act.  That is something the Minister could have a look at.  If he is not in a position to reply today, we could certainly have a look at it on Committee Stage.  I highlight it because I believe there is a possibility, if not a probability, of inconsistency between the provisions.</P>
    <P>Also in relation to the provisions of the Bill, the functions which lie with the new governing body &mdash; for example, the advertising of posts, the interview selection process and the payment of salaries &mdash; the employer, the vocational education committee, is only entitled to access to such reports as the governing body are obliged to provide for the department.  These reports come at the end of the year so that effectively the vocational education committee will not know what is going on inside a college in the course of the 12 months.</P>
    <P>The new part-time workers legislation and the employment equality legislation refer to the employer specifically.  The question I would put to the Minister is how can the vocational education committee monitor the implementation of these Bills where they do not have direct access to the information required and there is no direct reporting on an ongoing basis?  There is a possibility that a case could end up before a Department of Labour tribunal and the vocational education committee in question would not have any prior notice; the first time they would be informed of the problem before the tribunal is, in fact, when they receive a summons from the tribunal.  I am not <Col N="983" /> sure if that is what the Minister has in mind, and perhaps he could clear that up.</P>
    <P>Likewise the Bill would appear to allow the individual colleges, if they so desired, to lay down conditions of employment or rates of pay.  Is this what the Department of Education and the Minister have set out to do?  How will a vocational education committee know how to regulate the correct rates of pay and how will they know that they are being applied?  Is there a generality in relation to grades throughout the country?</P>
    <P>The Bill undermines the conciliation and arbitration machinery which I think we all accept has stood the test of time, particularly in the vocational education committee sector.  There is a danger that that conciliation and arbitration machinery will now be placed in limbo.  I would like to see this matter clarified and to have answered the questions I have raised, including the question of whether these Bills can be reconciled with previous legislation such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the legislation dealing with part-time workers and with employment equality, which is of particular importance in this area.</P>
    <P>We have been informed for quite a long time that the Bill sets out to give autonomy to the colleges in the day-to-day management and to allow them to become involved in research and development and consultancy work in the industrial and commercial sectors. Obviously, these are aspects of the Bill which I would welcome but, unfortunately, while the Minister gives on the one hand, he takes away, on the other hand the ultimate responsibility for admission, academic courses and financial control.  I would like to hear the Minister's reasons for this.  Are there strong reasons?  Do we not have confidence in the capability of the colleges, as they exist, to administer these important aspects and to carry out their day-to-day responsibilities and roles?  We should be expanding and giving responsibility to <Col N="984" /> these colleges and ensuring that they operate in a more localised way.  Unfortunately, these are not the tenets that I see in the Bill and I believe there are many aspects of it that we will need to take a long, hard look at.</P>
    <P>I am not sure &mdash; and perhaps the Minister will address this matter also &mdash; if a particular timetable has been set or if there is a possibility that the Green Paper on education will be published before these Bills are enacted or will the Minister press ahead and seek early enactment of these Bills.  There are good intentions in the Bill but, unfortunately, the Bill dealing with the regional technical colleges falls far short of what was intended originally.  The regional technical colleges, as an instrument in the education brief, are far too important for us to get it wrong.  As things stand at present, there is a danger that we will make many errors on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some assurances will be given in relation to what we can achieve on Committee Stage.  The Labour Party will table many amendments on Committee Stage and we may be able to make an input, depending on the receptivity of the Minister to our suggestions.  The new Minister will probably be receptive and will want the best to come out of the House given that the Bills, as I said, deal with what will be an important aspect of the education brief in the future both nationally and locally in terms of the role the colleges play in the regions.  We must take cognisance of the pressures the regions are under at this time.</P>
    <P>We will be opposing the Second Stage of the Bill but given that the two major parties in the House are supporting it we hope that on Committee Stage we will be able to make constructive amendments in an effort to make it better than it is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill but before I do let me congratulate the new Minister for Education on his appointment.  I have the utmost confidence in his ability to discharge the onerous responsibilities of the Minister for Education and I wish <Col N="985" /> him every success in his new role.  I also wish to pay tribute to the previous Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, for the manner in which she conducted and looked after the affairs of the Department of Education during her tenure as Minister.</P>
      <P>As I said, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and my remarks will be directed mainly towards the role and functions of the regional technical colleges with which I am more familiar.  I commend the previous Minister for introducing this welcome legislation and for the manner in which she sought advice, consulted and took on board a number of recommendations made to her during the negotiations and in drafting these two Bills.  I also compliment her for stating during the course of her speech on Second Stage that she would be willing to make amendments on Committee Stage if it was felt amendments were needed.  I am sure the current Minister will bear the statements made by Deputy O'Rourke in mind.</P>
      <P>The sixties saw a major thrust in the development of technical education in Ireland.  This was initiated by the publication of the <i>Investment in Education</i> document in 1962 and the <i>Training of Technicians in Ireland</i> document in 1964. The then Minister for Education, Dr. Patrick Hillery, proposed the Government's intentions to arrange, with the various vocational education committees, for the provision of a limited number of technical colleges with regional status.</P>
      <P>The present network of regional technical colleges was built between 1970 and 1977, and there is no doubt about the impact these colleges have had on the life of the regions in which they were established.  I must acknowledge the efforts made by public representatives, by County Carlow Vocational Education Committee and, in particular, by the then chief executive officer, Mr. Austin Waldron, to ensure that a regional technical college was sited in Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of these institutes in the various towns brings great life to the towns and regions in which they are <Col N="986" /> located.  The steering committee who advised the Minister in setting up these colleges broadly defined the role of these colleges as being to educate for trade and industry over a spectrum of occupations ranging from craft to professional, notably in engineering and science but also in the commercial, linguistic and other specialities.</P>
    <P>The people who set up and took over at the helm at these institutes were pioneers in education.  Their vigour and enthusiasm during the years has ensured that these institutes of education have now received recognition internationally as establishments which provide firstclass education.  They have during the years consistently sought to increase the range of courses which they provide and have as a result on a yearly basis increased the number of students put through their colleges.  From relatively humble beginnings when they offered leaving certificate courses and apprenticeships they now offer certificate, diploma and graduate courses and, in some cases, post-graduate courses.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting at this stage that the regional technical colleges are 21 years old this year and during that relatively short span of time they have made a remarkable impression on our educational system.  It would be fair at this stage to compliment all Ministers for Education for their generosity and support of this section of third level education during that time.</P>
    <P>The timing of the provision of these regional technical colleges could not have been better.  As the number of young people leaving secondary level education grew and the demand for third level education increased, these institutes were able to cater for that demand.  Our international reputation as a country which looked after its young was enhanced by the quality of our young graduates and school leavers who sought employment in foreign countries.  Their experience in these countries will, I hope, lead to an enhancement of the status of our young graduates.</P>
    <P>Each college and vocational education committee should be complimented for <Col N="987" /> the manner in which they have sought out funding, particularly from the European Regional Fund, for the development of their colleges and their particular courses. Every year one sees a new degree course being provided and new courses developed.  Of late, as funding becomes increasingly more difficult to acquire, there is a slight slow down in the development of the various courses in some of these institutes.</P>
    <P>The contribution that these colleges have made towards the education of our young school leavers is to be commended and the potential which these courses offer to young students is very much appreciated by the young people themselves and by their parents.  The fact that they have never refused to increase the intake of students over the past number of years is testimony to the commitment to third level education of these colleges.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes a long way towards striking a balance between greater freedom and autonomy for the institutes in their day-to-day operations while, at the same time, maintaining their links with the vocational education committees in their regions.  It also constitutes a means by which these institutes can engage in development and consultancy work for business and industry as well as entering into contracts and assignments with companies to develop together the results of their work.</P>
    <P>The flexibility of the courses which the Regional Technical Colleges provide play a vital role in the provision of highly skilled personnel which is essential to our evolving industrial economy.  These institutes are also able to improve the interaction between business and educational establishments which is evidenced by the establishment of the CIM centre in Carlow with the provision of a full-time industrial liaison officer who liaises between industry, commerce and the regional college.  This Bill seeks to retain the RTCs and Dublin Institute of Technology with the vocational education committee structure while establishing them as self-governing institutes. It provides a framework for the operation <Col N="988" /> of the institutes subject to general policy and within the operational programme and budgets drawn up annually by the governing body subject to the approval of the appropriate vocational education committees and the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>It is important to pay tribute to the work of the vocational education committee under whose management the regional technical colleges have grown and developed.  Under their guidance these colleges now have a framework in which they can enter a new phase of growth.  The contribution by the staff of the colleges should not be overlooked, nor should the input of the National Council for Educational Awards which, over the years, have been very supportive and worked closely with the various colleges. Their flexibility in adapting to the changing needs and the continuing strong demand for their expanding range of awards has been a contributory factor to the success of these colleges.</P>
    <P>The Bill as published goes a long way towards giving the institutes greater autonomy and freedom in the conduct of their day-to-day activity and to exploit the potential which they see in the educational and commercial sectors.  If one was to be critical of the regional technical colleges my sole criticism is that their structures are dull and unimaginative. These colleges are the result of architectural thinking of 1969 and 1970 and, if they were being built today, they would be much warmer and appealing to the eye.  When one compares these buildings to third level institutions such as Earlsfort Terrace, Trinity College and UCG, one can immediately see the difference in the design and thinking.  Having said that, I hope in their own time and own way they will become easier to accept.</P>
    <P>I will now digress slightly from the Bill to register my concern at the related role of vocational education committee in the appointment of teachers to various positions in schools within their control.  This is an area of vocational education committee which has concerned me for some time.  All appointments to teaching posts should be made by an independent body <Col N="989" /> such as the Civil Service Commission. The composition of interview boards which select professional teachers for various positions should consist of individuals with the necessary qualifications and background in teaching, education or in the selection of teachers to ensure that there is not the slighest suspicion of favouritism.  For too long, individual teachers have felt that their qualifications and experience in the educational area are not appreciated &mdash; or indeed recognised in some cases &mdash; by some of the individuals who currently sit on vocational education committee interview boards.  Perhaps this matter can be dealt with in more detail when the new education Bill, promised by the Minister for Education, is published.  It is an area to which the Minister should give attention.</P>
    <P>I wish both these Bill every success and a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Nolan's conversion to the thinking of this side of the House because it is only a short time since we brought in a Private Member's Bill to introduce some of the measures he suggested and against which he and his party voted.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague from South Tipperary, Deputy Davern, on his appointment as Minister for Education. I am confident that he has the ability and temperament to successfully conduct the business of this onerous, complex and difficult Ministry.  I wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the regional technical colleges have been one of the great success stories on the Irish education scene in the past three decades. Part of this success stems from the fact that they fulfilled a long felt need for a third level education system which was not available through the existing university structure and which catered for that large segment of the student population for whom the university system did not provide the answer.  The regional technical college provides the bridgehead <Col N="990" /> between the manpower requirements of our growing, technologically-based industries of the seventies and eighties and the educational systems' ability to provide their students with the skills to take up the challenge.  The colleges have succeeded in their task, thanks to the vision of the people who conceived the ideas and those who had the courage to implement them.</P>
    <P>Our regional technical college network must form the basis for the way forward in the future; any legislation to be enacted which will affect the colleges must take cognisance of the history and the background to their advancement thus far and of the reasons for their success. In other words, I am saying that legislation in this instance must be very carefully drafted lest it damage the very thing it sets our to protect.</P>
    <P>Like many of my colleagues in the House, and many educationalists outside it, I welcome the broad general thrust of the Bill, though I would share some of the reservations which have been expressed in regard to the apparent diminution of the role of the vocational education committees.  However, this matter and, indeed, other aspects of the Bill have been critically analysed by several other speakers so, rather than be repetitive, I would like to concentrate on an aspect of the Bill which affects me personally in my capacity as a representative for North Tipperary and which, indeed, also has ramifications for the Minister himself.  I refer to section 3 of the Bill which deals with the formal establishment of the colleges and with the provision which allows other educational establishments to be brought within the ambit of the Bill in future.</P>
    <P>In this context, there is a strange irony in my speaking on this Bill here today representing as I do a constituency which had legitimate and carefully planned aspirations towards having a regional technical college within its bounds.  In fact, not alone was it a constituency aspiration, but a county one.  Seldom, if ever, has a subject united the people of Tipperary as the proposal to establish a regional college in Thurles.  The Minister <Col N="991" /> himself, as a former chairman of South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee, is thoroughly familiar with all aspects of our case and has on many occasions both privately and publicly, expressed his support for the concept of a third level college in Tipperary.  Our case now presents the Minister with an early and invaluable opportunity to set a benchmark for the future thrust of third level education by recognising the validity of our case for a regional college in Thurles, based on a unique concept of rural and business development, and which caters in a very real way for a county which has suffered more than most from the ill fortunes of the economic recession.</P>
    <P>This morning, before coming into the House, I looked again at the map of the country showing the location of the regional technical colleges and I was struck once again by the glaring blank space in the south midlands, in that area occupied principally by County Tipperary. The dots on the map representing the various towns where the colleges are located form the basis for an educational web, but a web which sadly, has no centre.  That centre can, should and must be provided by giving to Thurles and to Tipperary the college it needs, the college it was promised and, above all else, the college which would form a perfect link in the educational chain.  This is not a plea based on emotion and proposed on empty rhetoric; it is a plea based on the reasoned and carefully planned deliberations of all interested educational bodies in the county and put forward in the form of a well documented and excellently constructed proposal.</P>
    <P>The idea for a third level college in Thurles has been mooted and pursued for a number of years now, and seemed to have reached fruition with the purchase of a site for the college in 1987, but then came a series of deliberately orchestrated setbacks with the result that there has been no departmental progress since then.  The people who care, those who see this project as a major priority, have been working on the idea, refining <Col N="992" /> and distilling their proposals to the point where we now have a concept which is original and innovative and which will form the basis of an entirely new approach to third level education.</P>
    <P>Recognising that the regional approach was one of the key factors in the success of the regional technical colleges to date, the promoters of the college, which they have titled Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute, have studied the needs of the region at large.  What has emerged is the need for a rural development institute, emphasising community development, agriculture, forestry, alternative incomegenerating farm enterprises and technology transfer to rural Ireland.  The institute would focus on making third level education accessible and relevant to the rural community.  It would be accessible in physical terms through out-centres in second level schools.  As part of their contracts, staff will have built into their terms of employment specific time for this &ldquo;out-work&rdquo; and there would be a series of bridging programmes to make third level education accessible to people who have not achieved the standard requirements for third level entry.  This is perceived by the promoters as a significant gap in the present system and one which they intend filling.</P>
    <P>Rural development is now a national and European priority, a fact which is recognised internationally.  The main focus of the institute would be on creating and developing in the student body skills and an awareness to match existing and potential business needs.  In some ways, we have a classical catch 22 situation in Tipperary in so far as we need to attract new industry but lack the core skills among our young people to provide a workforce.  This is one of the prime needs which exists and which the institute proposes to fill.</P>
    <P>I must stress the need to prevent further rural depopulation.  Maybe it is overstating the obvious, but it is very valid. Rural Ireland is in serious decline and Tipperary is no different from any other region in that respect.  It is a fact that in many areas of the country the ratio of <Col N="993" /> young to old is altering radically on an almost daily basis and even among those young people who are in a position to remain, all too many of them are forced to travel far afield to further their education and, having done so, have then got no incentive to return.  The institute would provide the framework for the exploration of new business ideas, the development of regional opportunities and the provision of supplementary income possibilities.</P>
    <P>An EC study carried out last year on the future of rural society highlighted the risk that technological innovations are being concentrated on a small number of economic activities, to the detriment of rural society.  A more sympathetic use of new technology in rural development is now imperative and, recognising this, the institute would place special emphasis on information technology and the application of technological advances to farm work, such as for example &ldquo;Airtel Agriline&rdquo;, in addition to using computers for the monitoring of crops and animals.  The institute would be planned in such a way that the mix of programmes in Thurles would adapt to changing national needs and demographic trends.  The existing resources provided by Shannon Development, Teagasc, local industry and services would be used as strategic arms to develop existing business and to attract new industry.</P>
    <P>How is all this to be achieved and where does it fit into the picture being framed by this Bill?  I would like to place on the record of this House the purpose of the proposal for a third-level college in Tipperary, the programmes envisaged in those proposals, the operating procedures, staffing levels, management structures and linkages with other educational establishments.  As will be seen, this is not a proposal for a college to stand in splendid isolation but a college which would enmesh itself into the fabric of life, both town and village, and which would fulfil in a manner not thought of up to now, the principles which motivated the foundation of the regional college system in the first place.</P>
    <P>The mission of the institute, therefore, <Col N="994" /> would be to provide full time and part time third level education programmes oriented towards employment in rural business, to point the way forward for future national measures which would use appropriate technology and enhance our lives and our environment.  These programmes would be tailored to meet the needs of people and business in rural areas and the institute would provide a blueprint for new third level education strategies for the 21st century which would give practical expression to the ideals enshrined in the EC document, &ldquo;The Future of Rural Society&rdquo;.  That is how the institute see their mission.  The putting into practice of these aspirations is something which has received the undivided attention of a great many educationists in the country over the past few years.</P>
    <P>In regard to their operating principles, the institute would be open 14 hours a day for 360 days a year.  This radical step is the first measure of the determination of the proposers of the institute to make it physically accessible to the student body at all times and to make it living and vibrant.  The courses would be flexible and student oriented, geared towards employment and maintaining close links with industry and Government agencies.</P>
    <P>Education would be used as a vehicle for development and to maintain a forward looking profile at all times.  The institute staff would have continuing education as part of their contractual brief, as well as being required to assess rural development needs on an on-going basis by way of close contact with community organisations.  The development of student skills would be enhanced by having work placements during their study term as in the VPT model.</P>
    <P>This would be seen as another aid to fostering strong links with existing businesses and industry and would act as a medium for cross-pollination of ideas and innovations.  The out-centres of which I spoke earlier would be the spokes in the educational wheel whereby the institute would deliver their programmes to the client and to the potential student, forming what one might term a floating <Col N="995" /> campus, providing a feeder service for the greater body of the institute.</P>
    <P>The title of the institute incorporates the ethos envisaged by their promoters, the main focus of the institute being perceived as being on rural business and rural development, these being unified by the common concern for technology transfer.  The programmes would be delivered through full time education of the student body and through the continuing education of those who would use the institute to develop and enhance skills garnered in the work place or on the farm.</P>
    <P>There are five broad areas for which the programmes would cater.  The first is in the business area, which would include agri-business, forestry, marketing, accounting and general business practices and which would provide a sound framework for the progression of the student into other related areas.  The second base of the programmes would be in engineering, a discipline which is envisaged as catering for food production, agricultural, engineering, electronics and construction.  This section makes practical sense because of the long tradition of food and agriculture related businesses in Tipperary generally and in north Tipperary in particular.</P>
    <P>The depredations wreaked on the town of Thurles by the devastation of the sugar industry has been well documented and has been spoken of in this House on many occasions.  The town has not recovered from the trauma brought about by the sugar factory closure.  I see here an opportunity for reparation, a chance for the sugar industry to return to the town some of the dignity which it stripped away from it and to repay some of the terrible price it wreaked by removing the town's most tangible asset.  I call on the sugar company to throw their full weight behind the proposal to establish a college in Thurles but, more than that, to give practical expression to that proposal by offering to finance the faculty of food production by an endowment.  The sugar company are engaged in food production. They have a valued and valuable <Col N="996" /> food processing plant in the town in their Erin Food subsidiary.  What more practical expression of their goodwill towards the town could they make than by offering financial assistance in the establishment of a third-level college which would benefit not just the town but the whole region served by the college?  Such a step forward might well encourage greater participation in serving educational needs by the larger companies and industries who have much to gain from a thriving, vibrant educational network.</P>
    <P>The third base of the proposed programmes is a natural progression of the one just described, covering as it does the broad spectrum of science and, more specifically, food processing technology, natural resources technology, agricultural science, chemistry, biology and environment.  All of these have particular relevance in regard to future trends in agri-business, with the increasing emphasis on the need for environmental controls.</P>
    <P>The fourth base of the programme is one which has particular relevance for the county at present.  It covers the area of humanities and has as one of its aims the imparting of skills in local concerns, the appreciation of and approach to mental handicap being one of them.  I am aware that County Tipperary lags some way behind other regions in the provision of an infrastructure for the treatment and care of mental handicap and is able to cope only because the statutory services are augmented by a huge voluntary input, an input matched by financial contribution from all the parents involved, again on a voluntary basis.  This aspect of the programme would bring about a change in attitudes, a greater understanding of the needs of the individual and the responsibilities of the community. The humanities programme would also incorporate the study of languages, including Irish, and the study of local history, so necessary if the course is to have real application to the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>The fifth base of the programme is in the area of continuing education.  Even <Col N="997" /> a cursory study of countrywide trends indicates that there is a growing demand for education from those who have left second level but who chose, for whatever reason, not to continue to third level. This demand will be catered for by the institute by the provision of one-year courses which would include industrial design, computer-aided design and receptionist skills.  It is envisaged that post-leaving certificate students would comprise a significant proportion of the overall attendance at the college and that they would represent an important segment in the transmission of ideas and needs from community to college and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>As a corollary to this broad base of programmes, the institute would promote a more systematic use of new technology in rural development by means of information technology, and subsequently translating that into the practical application of technology in a &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; situation in farming.  Coupled with this would be the provision of a focal point for EC programmes in rural technology such as the industry-education interaction and rural communications technology programmes.</P>
    <P>With regard to continuing education, it is now recognised that this helps people to cope with change and there is a noticeable international demand for education from those who have left the education system.  Coping with that demand forms an essential part of the national strategy in many advanced economies and one of the most important criteria in the success of continuing education is accessibility &mdash; the convenience of location to the student.  The institute itself and the proposed use of &ldquo;out-centres&rdquo; will solve this problem.  These &ldquo;out-centres&rdquo; would be provided in the second level schools in the institute's catchment area and courses in business and enterprise, applied science and environment, engineering, technology and community development would be offered there.  In addition, the teaching staff would act as advisers or counsellors for local enterprises in the community, out of which would spring <Col N="998" /> further courses suggested by people in the community.</P>
    <P>Another important facet of this aspect of the institute would be the upgrading of business skills within existing enterprises through the solution of practical problems, the provision of follow-up counselling and by being accessible to the people taking the course.</P>
    <P>In order to provide all these programmes the institute would have a broad spectrum of staff.  There would be full-time staff with the appropriate qualifications for teaching at third level. Arrangements would be made with Shannon Development and Teagasc for the part-time secondment of staff with appropriate qualifications and experience; it may even be envisaged that Shannon Development could have a full-time business development officer on campus. There would also be part-time staff drawn from local industry and business.</P>
    <P>There is a very representative and wide ranging corpus of statutory and voluntary organisations to provide the framework of the management structure, among them being the Department of Education, the Office of Science and Technology, Shannon Development, Teagasc, North Tipperary and South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee's, voluntary secondary schools, churches, industry, trade unions and others.  As part of the overall linkage with the broader framework of third level education, the institute would adopt as a matter of policy a programmed approach to linking with the other institutions in the area, including the University of Limerick, University Colleges Cork and Galway, the Garda Training College, Templemore, the College of Art, Commerce and Technology, Limerick, Thomond College, Rockwell Agricultural College, Gurteen Agricultural College, St. Patrick's Diocesan College, Thurles, and others.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish a Tipperary rural and business development institute is well researched.  It identifies and articulates a unique concept and educational requirement, as well as catering for the economic and educational needs of the <Col N="999" /> area.  The institute would contribute to providing further badly needed third level places for students in Ireland.  I would earnestly ask my distinguished fellow Tipperary colleague who now occupies the office of Minister for Education to give this proposal priority, to exercise his ministerial authority to advance its cause and to help us to bring our plans to fruition.</P>
    <P>While all of what I have just said may sound like a local issue in the context of the Bill under discussion, I feel that the point must nonetheless be made.  It is important for us all that the advances made in Irish third level education in the past three decades should be continued and enhanced.  I believe this Bill is a significant and worthwhile step on the road to doing so, just as I passionately believe that the proposals in the Tipperary rural and business development institute plan are not only vital to the well being of my area, but may well prove vital to the future of the whole concept of regional colleges in Ireland.  Those are my thoughts on section 3 of the Bill and the way it affects current events in the development of regional colleges.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, I welcome the Bill in broad terms.  I believe it seeks to give greater autonomy to the colleges, and this is a good feature.  The success of the colleges is partly attributable to their adaptability to the needs of their regions and in order to be able to do this, the managements of the individual colleges must be free to make independent decisions based on measured and quantified local requirements.  I believe the Bill is doing this by devolving authority to the colleges themselves.</P>
    <P>It would also seem from this that the Bill will effectively sever the direct link between the vocational education committee and the college by transferring the powers not delegated to the colleges directly to the Department of Education. This would certainly assist the colleges to conform to the regional concept rather than the local mandate imposed by existing legislation.  But let me caution, there is an ongoing body of experience in the <Col N="1000" /> vocational education sector and this should form an integral part of the advisory body to both the Minister and the college management.  For example in section 6, it should be made clear that the regional nature of the college should be reflected in the composition of the governing body.</P>
    <P>It has been said that development in higher education can, and often does, presage political and administrative change in society in general.  The regional technical college system is an example of now successful the decentralisation of educational opportunity can be.  If it is used as the role model for future progress and for the sensible blancing of local, regional and national interests, then the long term benefits could be very great indeed.  When we look at the figures for student enrolment in regional technical colleges we find that an average 80 per cent of the students come from within the region of each college. This more than anything else highlights the regional nature of the colleges and the need for care in restructuring the system.</P>
    <P>The governing body of any educational establishment should, of its very nature, reflect the academic status of that establishment but in this context should also take cognisance of regional needs and achievements.  This requires awareness of commercial and industrial enterprise in the region in order to maintain the socio-economic balance which is vital to future progress.</P>
    <P>It is a fact, regrettable but nonetheless real, that access to third level education for many students from the lower socioeconomic backgrounds is not a realisable proposition and this must be of concern. It is an area in which the national colleges have a major part to play.  Just over 50 per cent of third level enrolments each year are in the non-university sector and this figure is likely to increase in the future.  With a properly structured approach the regional technical colleges are in a unique position to feel the pulse of educational requirement in a regional basis and to ensure that individual groups or segments of society do not get left <Col N="1001" /> behind.  They can do this by remaining close to their roots, to the people and the students of their own regions.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges are a major component in the broad spectrum of Irish education.  This Bill should consolidate that position but we should be aware of the concerns being voiced by various groups about individual sections in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am very pleased to have heard this morning that Mr. John Slattery, Chief Executive Officer of South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee has been seconded by the Minister to work in the Department of Education. I offer my good wishes to Mr. Slattery coupled with my hope that his professed desire for a college in Thurles will now be allied to the expertise of the Minister in providing a real Tipperary flavour to the next regional college to be added to the list in the First Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>To pick up where Deputy Lowry left off, if there is to be a real Tipperary flavour it may be a little further south than Thurles.  However, that would be the nature of politics in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to welcome Deputy Davern as Minister for Education.  He brings with him years of political experience and skill, all of which I know will be tested in the Department of Education as he tries to balance the conflicting demands that no doubt will be coming from all areas of the educational spectrum.  I have no doubt that he will rise to the occasion and that he will go down in history as an excellent Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Bills in general.  In fact, I have very few complaints with them, although there are one or two points that could perhaps be considered again on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, it is 21 years since the regional technical colleges were founded.  In that time there has been a revolution in education.  Perhaps the title, &ldquo;regional technical colleges&rdquo; is a misnomer now since these institutions provide courses of national importance <Col N="1002" /> and draw students from all over Ireland. Their success is due mainly to the excellence of the staff of the colleges and to the type and variety of courses provided. The Galway Regional Technical College, to name but one, provides a practical course in art that encompasses nearly all levels of art from practical hands-on art work to fairly advanced sculpture and design work.  That course is on a par with anything that can be provided by the NCAD and by many internationally known colleges.</P>
    <P>My own constituency has three Dublin Institute of Technology colleges, at Bolton Street, Cathal Brugha Street and the College of Marketing and Design at Mountjoy Square.  The latter was a rather late entry to the academic scene but Bolton Street and Cathal Brugha Street have been in existence for many years, originally starting as vocational schools for the development of skills in building and building design and in cuisine skills. Bolton Street college now provides a range of construction design courses from pure hands-on appenticeship courses in bricklaying and so on right up to architecture. Their school of architecture is internationally renowned.  The position is similar for Cathal Brugha Street, which was called Coláiste Mhuire le Tíos when it was founded.  These colleges might be regarded as the university of the travel business or the university of the tourism business, such is the range of courses provided by them.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that at this time the colleges be given more independence.  It is the intent of the Bills to provide the colleges with the governing and administrative tools necessary for them to function as third level colleges while at the same time retaining them within the vocational education system.  It is important that the vocational aspect of their work should not be lost sight of as they move towards a third level status.</P>
    <P>While speaking of third level status, on Committee Stage, in relation to section 5 which deals with the functions of the institute and the provision for them to confer, grant or give diplomas, certificates or other educational awards but <Col N="1003" /> not degrees, we should consider including degree awards.  If the colleges are to be raised to third level status, why should they not be able to award degrees?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, a balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Every other third level institution does so.  I personally do not recognise any reason that the colleges should not award degrees.  I hope this matter will be considered on Committee Stage in more detail.  Though it may be a minor point, it is important for the self-respect of the colleges concerned and for the self-respect of the graduates of those colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one third level college in Dublin that is often overlooked yet has probably the biggest single group of students.  I refer to the College of Music which, at any one time, caters for roughly 2,000 students.  The College of Music could be the basis, if it were developed properly, to what I would call a college of the performing arts.  In Dublin we have colleges teaching film, other colleges teaching drama and we have four publicly funded colleges teaching music &mdash; UCD, Trinity, the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the College of Music &mdash; not to mention private colleges around the city.  A college of performing arts, as I would envisage it, would encompass not just the performers but also those who would go on to work in television and radio &mdash; people involved with sound effects and visual effects and those involved with stage design, etc.  Why not have those people under one roof if at all possible?  I know that would be a major undertaking, but every party in the House pay lip service &mdash; I do not mean that in a denigratory way &mdash; to developing the talent of our young people coming through the system.  As I see it, though I may be open to correction, one of the great talents of the Irish people is their artistic talent.  However, an artist has to fight against the odds to develop in this country.  There is no encouragement, good, bad or indifferent.  Perhaps when the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill <Col N="1004" /> and the Regional Technical Colleges Bill are passed the Department of Education could set up a task force to examine the development of the performing arts.  So far as I know, the only regional technical college offering courses in the performing arts is the college in Waterford.  That college has a school of music which is doing great work in training performers. The Royal Irish Academy of Music, Trinity College and the Dublin College of Music have been talking about such courses for years and I gather that they set up a degree course for teaching musicians, a B.Mus. teaching degree, but they are still talking about setting up a performing degree.  Perhaps the Minister would give them a nudge and ensure some movement in that area.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committee have a site in Seán McDermott Street which, I gather, will not be used for the purpose originally intended.  Perhaps it could be designated as a site for a college for the performing arts.  Many years ago, and great credit is due to them for this, the Department of Education set up the National College of Art and Design in the old Power's Distillery.  I do not intend any pun when I say that that has become a powerhouse of artistic thought.  Yet another distillery, which I gather is owned by the Office of Public Works at the moment, Jameson's in Smithfield, is derelict but it is a large site that could, again, be developed as a college for the performing arts.  Other Members have dealt with the Bill in greater detail and have greater overall knowledge of education and our educational establishments.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 9 cater for the appointment of a director rather than a principal of each regional technical college, the existing principal to become the first director, which is as it should be. Perhaps we could examine on Committee Stage the appointment of a director.  The job of the director of any national institute &mdash; which is what the regional technical colleges are becoming &mdash; is so demanding their appointment should be for a limited period of, say, seven years, <Col N="1005" /> under a contract of service rather than an open ended contract to retirement age of 65.  It should be remembered that these colleges will demand of their directors a 24-hour hands-on commitment.  In fact, their role could be compared with that of the Master of a maternity hospital in Dublin, when he or she is appointed for a period of seven years, paid a large salary but is in total financial, academic and clinical control of their hospital. Dublin maternity hospitals have been at the forefront of maternity medicine for over 250 years which I contend is due in no small measure to the method of appointment of their chief executive or director, otherwise known as the Master. It is a method of appointment that has withstood the test of time.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether there is a case to be made for the stablishment of what might be described as a national academic selection board who would vet and recommend appointments above a certain level to the regional technical colleges in that henceforth the appointment of staff will necessitate a degree of sophistication and cohesion.  I ask the Minister to examine that possibility.</P>
    <P>It would appear there is a major change being introduced in section 2 (2) in that a college, with the approval of the Minister along with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, can decide the terms and conditions of holding office or employment.  That provision is not confined merely to new staff but includes existing staff.  In theory that provision could lead to different terms and conditions of employment in different colleges, and indeed in different schools within the same college.  Perhaps we could examine that section on Committee Stage.  One might well ask, are we to have a plethora of colleges under the control of the Department of Education stipulating different guidelines and terms of employment to the same type of staff?  Are we initiating competition between different regional technical colleges?  That may be a theoretical possibility but, once written into the Bill, it could become a practical possibility.</P>
    <P>I welcome both Bills.  They were <Col N="1006" /> needed and will afford the Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technical colleges greater scope for development becoming even more a focus of growth in the cities, towns and counties in which they are located.  Overall, these Bills provide the governing and administrative tools necessary to these colleges to function as third-level colleges to the greater benefit of students generally.</P>

      <P>While grateful to the former Minister for a lucid summary of the development of vocational and technical education here her claim to recognise its maturity does not carry conviction.  For example, she says that, in the 21 years since the regional technical colleges were established, they have developed to the stage at which they can truly be said to have come of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Bills represent, in a symbolic sense the key usually associated with such an event.  Anyone who has read the Bills must feel that this is a key being handed over with the instructions: Of course, you understand, my child, that you must give me back this key every night at 10 o'clock and I shall return it to you in the morning. In other words, the tradition of underestimating any education labelled technical dies hard.  Whether we revert to 1889 or 1930, whether we refer to vocational schools or technical colleges the general opinion held was that students attending them &mdash; at least day pupils &mdash; were regarded as those who were not quite up to the serious academic work of real schools.  The general opinion held was that when a student had reached third-level he or she might obtain a scholarship to university.  I am happy to recall <Col N="1007" /> at least one student who was offered such a scholarship 20 years ago but who preferred to remain in Bolton Street once he knew he could continue his studies just as if he held a university degree.</P>
    <P>The schools now more likely to be called community colleges are undertaking the same good work they used do under another name, that is picking up the children who where short-changed by an overcrowded primary system, giving them the means and confidence to deal with the leaving certificate, hopefully polished off by third-level.  I regret that, to some extent, these colleges have been swallowed up by the traditional academic leaving certificate.  Nonetheless they balance this with equipment and instruction that enable pupils to help build and maintain the structures on which we all depend.  As the Minister said, the development of the regional technical colleges over the years has seen a phasing out of apprentice training and increased involvement in diploma and degree level courses.  At present the vocational education committee third level colleges have approximately 40 per cent of the total enrolment at third level nationwide.</P>
    <P>While the Green Party, in general, welcome these Bills, nonetheless we are disappointed at the degree of centralisation they contain.  Decentralisation is a concept with which everybody in this House would agree.  From time to time I have heard Members of every party in this House say what we have been saying for a very long time, that is, decisions should be taken at the lowest effective level, in other words, supporting the principle of subsidiarity which is manifestly absent from these Bills.  Rather, the dead hand of the Department of Education is to be seen throughout.  I appeal to the Minister to challenge the mandarins in his Department, to ensure that power devolves where it rightly belongs, that is, with the vocational education committees and the principals and staff of the schools.  The vocational education committees nationwide have overseen and taken part in this organic evolution and have acquired expert knowledge.  It is absurd they <Col N="1008" /> should not be considered competent to decide when some other educational institution has reached the stage at which it should be considered a college but rather must wait until &ldquo;the Minister considers&rdquo; the time has come to consult the Minister for Finance and the relevant vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I cannot help remarking that in section 3 (2) of the Regional Technical College Bill, 1991 and some following sections &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; appears in capital letters but the vocational education committees do not.  We contend that the words &ldquo;Minister considers&rdquo; should be amended to read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Vocational Education Committee recommends&rdquo; and we will be tabling an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Throughout section 5 we discover that the regional technical colleges may only provide courses of study, engage in research, enter into arrangements with other institutions, exploit any research, consultancy or development work &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  This is another area in which we will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage.  Of course the colleges must welcome greater scope to exploit research and so on, but permission to do so under unknown conditions which may be laid down by some unknown Minister at some unpredictable time does not match the autonomy appropriate to institutions which have come of age.  It is not acceptable that the Dublin Institute of Technology should be permitted only to give diplomas and educational awards other than degrees.  I understand that the constituent colleges have been awarding degrees by means of a linkage with Trinity College.  Surely this should end.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Davern on his elevation to the office of Minister for Education and I wish him well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> It is very appropriate that, as many of our regional colleges celebrate 21 years of providing third level education, we should be debating a Bill which will give recognition to the tremendous expansion of student numbers, courses, services, and the expertise available in these colleges, and give them the framework for further expansion and autonomy.  The 28,000 students attending these colleges are a testimony to the important role which they have in equipping our young people to fulfil their ambitions and enable them to take their place in society.</P>
    <P>The regional colleges were set up in the late sixties and early seventies to fill a vaccum in the field of technical education. We were at that time preparing to enter into and play our part in a modern Europe.  If we were to become at least partially industrialised we needed to fill the gap in the provision of expertise in the field of technology.  The phenomenal success and dramatic growth of these colleges is ample proof that they fulfilled the expectations.</P>
    <P>The regional colleges were set up under the 1930 Vocational Education Act and were thus under the control of the vocational education committee in their area.  Each college had its own board of management, which was a sub-committee of the County Vocational Education Committee.  Decisions taken by this board of management had to be verified by the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the various vocational education committees who undertook, about 20 years ago, to enter into these unchartered educational waters.  They provided the framework and mechanism for the establishment of our present-day colleges.  It was with their blessing, guidance and enthusiasm that regional colleges developed so successfully and now account for almost 50 per cent of students at third level.</P>
    <P>Everybody now acknowledges that the regional colleges of 1991 are very different from the fledglings which emerged in 1970.  They have larger budgets, bigger staffs, much increased student numbers, a wider range of courses catering for the <Col N="1010" /> needs of business, industry and commerce. The legislation provided in the 1930 Vocational Education Act is no longer adequate to facilitate the many new developments in these colleges.  The links with industry, the research and the development work and the possibility of being involved in limited companies will be developed on a firm legislative base.</P>
    <P>At the time of the establishment of Athlone Regional Technical College, the midlands region was characterised by a high level of dependence on agriculture. Manufacturing activity was in its infancy and the existing textile industry was in decline.  Bord na Móna had a thriving peat industry and, along with the ESB, provided a high level of apprenticeship training.  There was a low level of participation in third level education.</P>
    <P>It was in this atmosphere that Athlone regional college opened its doors in 1970 with a mere 36 full-time students.  It now has an enrolment in excess of 2,200 full-time students and a staff of over 250.  To cater for this huge increase in student and staff numbers, building extensions have been ongoing in the college life, and floor space is now 50 per cent more than the original.</P>
    <P>To my mind Athlone regional college eptomises the ideal of a regional college. Situated at the gateway to the west, with a good number of large provincial towns within easy reach, it is a natural focal point for surrounding counties.  This is reflected in the enrolment at the college for the year 1990-91, which shows that 15 per cent of students come from Westmeath; 5 per cent from Longford; 11 per cent from Offaly; 9 per cent from Roscommon; and 20 per cent from Galway.  This geographical spread demonstrates clearly the important regional significance of this college to the midlands. This third level educational facility is available in what is an ideal central location to draw from a rural catchment area.</P>
    <P>Because Athlone Regional Technical College has developed many specialities, approximately 40 per cent of its student intake is drawn from further afield than from its hinterland.  These speecialities <Col N="1011" /> are in mining, engineering, accountancy, catering, toxicology and plastics.  Indeed the degree in plastics from Athlone is considered to be the premier award in Europe in this field.</P>
    <P>The availability of a highly trained workforce in this region has been a strong incentive to attract industry to locate in the region.  Accordingly, a high volume of overseas investment was secured for the region in the seventies and eighties. Potential investors are impressed by the college and its facilities and by the quality of student graduates from that college.</P>
    <P>We in County Westmeath are delighted to welcome in the area the establishment of the National Polymer Development Centre and in conjunction with the plastics faculty at the regional technical college, we envisage Westmeath as a region to be developed as the plastics manufacturing centre of Ireland. This will, I hope, help to reduce the rising unemployment figures in the county and help reduce the flood of emigration from the area.</P>
    <P>The expertise, commitment and flexibility of the staff at the Athlone Regional Technical College, guarantee the quality and worth of the education provided at the college.  We can be confident that the taxpayer is getting value for their investment in this educational establishment. There is of course need for further investment in this college.  More space is badly needed for staff to undertake their preparation and research. More space is also needed to enhance and enlarge research facilities, particularly extra laboratory space.</P>
    <P>I would appeal particularly to the new Minister for Education to ensure that EC Structural Funds are allocated to help the regions.  The regional colleges serve many of the rural disadvantaged areas and, if regionalisation within the community is to have any meaning, then the regional colleges should get their fair share of Structural Funds.  These colleges, even though they have almost 50 per cent of third level students, get only about 20 per cent of the moneys allocated in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> In welcoming this Bill, I would ask the Minister to give consideration to a number of points.  I welcome the inclusion of a student representative on the board of each regional technical college. In view of the huge numbers attending these colleges, it is particularly important that there should be student representation.  I would suggest that there should be two students on the board so that when one of them moves on, the second will have had time to become familiar with what is happening.  The inclusion of staff members on the board is very important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of representatives from organisations and interest groups on the board and I would implore the Minister to ensure that these are meaningful appointments and not nominated on the basis of political favouritism.</P>
    <P>In situations like that at the Athlone Regional Technical College, when the students come from a number of adjoining counties, I would suggest that recognition be given on the board to vocational education committees from adjoining counties.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to assure the House that where a college develops a commercial venture which proves to be lucrative, the college budget will not be cut by this amount, but rather, that the profit can be used for further reorganisation and development.</P>
    <P>The college should be given the power to award their own certificates and diplomas. This facility is in the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill but is not allowed to the regional technical colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well in office.  It is fair to say that he has always been very pleasant and affable.  I have no doubt he will put his communicative skills to good use in the Department of Education.  He has been thrown in at the deep end in terms of these Bills.  There is also a Green Paper in the offing.  While I imagine this is a daunting task for a new Minister I <Col N="1013" /> have no doubt Deputy Davern will apply himself to the job with enthusiasm.  There are many problems in the education area, for example, the pupil-teacher ratio prefabs and the need for more home-link and guidance teachers.  Unlike the Minister's colleague from County Tipperary, I am not going to give the Minister a shopping list.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome these Bills in that they will give regional technical colleges greater autonomy in their day-to-day operations.  They will also allow the colleges to become involved in research and development and engage in consultive work with industry and business,. This linkage is essential.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, indicated she would give consideration to amendments tabled by this side of the House in Committee Stage.  I have no doubt that the Minister will repeat that commitment.  I look forward to hearing his reply to this debate which will be his maiden speech in this House as Minister for Education.  I hope he will be as receptive as his predecessor to the amendments put down by Opposition members which we believe will strengthen the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a weakness in the Bills it relates to the effect of legislation in the labour area.  The Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, referred to this.  I am referring in particular to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the equality legislation and the part-time workers legislation.  At present the vocational education committees are the employers with ultimate responsibility for regional technical colleges.  Yet the question of answerability and communication between the regional technical colleges, the chief executive officer and the vocational education committee is suspect.  Given the greater autonomy now being devolved on regional technical colleges it is possible that a college could involve their employer, the vocational education committee, in a situation over which they would have no control.  This points to a very obvious weakness in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will put down the necessary amendments to the Bill or <Col N="1014" /> accept opposition amendment,.  People should not be allowed to make deciisons which may not be in the best interests of the college and not answerable at the end of the day.  It is conceivable that the board of a college could make a decision which may untimately embarrass the vocational education committee, their employer.  I hope the Minister will address this obvious weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been levelled at the Bill by the IVEA who represent local authorities regarding its centralised nature.  Practically all the subsections of section 5 begin with the words, &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  I do not think it is the Ministers intention to go against the drift towards decentralisation.  Yet that is precisely what will happen under these Bills.  People have been talking about the need for local democracy.  But these Bills fly in the face of what we have been preaching here for many years in regard to the need for decentralisation.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes account of what transpired in regard to regional technical colleges over the past 21 years.  I welcome this.  The growth of regional technical colleges has been one of the greatest success stories of recent years.  At present 40 per cent of third level students attend regional technical colleges.  That is an indication of the success of these colleges. However, as previous speakers said, we have to make these colleges more accessible to people.  At present many students are unable to attend third level institutions due to a shortage of space and the fact that their families do not have the means to pay for the third level, education. The Minister should address these problems in the coming year.</P>
    <P>There is an imbalance in third level education in that many regional technical colleges are opting to run courses on business studies.  However, the founding fathers of the technical school movement was to foster technical education. If we are to prosper and come to grips with our unemployment problem, it is absolutely essential that people get involved in technical education.  Deputy Garland said technical education was <Col N="1015" /> established for people who were not academically bright.  We need to create an environment which will encourage our brightest students to get involved in technical education.  If we do not have people who can invent and create jobs there will be no jobs for people who are successful in the area of business studies.  For instance, accountants are employed by manufacturers; they depend on each other.  We need to place greater emphasis on technical education in keeping with the original concept.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of accountability.  Up to now vocational education committees were subject to scrutiny by the local government auditor. Under this Bill they will be subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If anything went wrong in the past the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee was questioned by the local government auditor and matters had to be put right.  The success of this system is evident from the fact that after 60 years in existence no major misdemeanour or malpractice has been discovered or highlighted by local government auditors.  Under this Bill the Comptroller and Auditor General will carry out the audit on behalf of the Minister and, if he so desires, the Minister may refer it back to the local chief executive officer or the vocational educational committee.  This could lead to a breakdown in the system.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the research and development and consultancy provisions in the Bill.  We are going into the unknown in this respect.  It seems the Minister may inadvertently act in a heavy-handed manner in this area.  Colleges will have to give two years advance notice of what courses they will offer. There is not sufficient flexibility for the various colleges to react to situations as they arise.  Take, for instance, a firm coming into a particular area &mdash; where, admittedly, there is usually some build up by the IDA &mdash; if certain skills are demanded the local college should be in a position to respond to the individual <Col N="1016" /> needs of that firm.  The Bill could be an impediment to such a development.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to address this matter.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has in mind and how he hopes to deal with amendments.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with all other Deputies in congratulating our new Minister, Deputy Davern, and wish him well.  I thank him also for his successful foray into Sligo last Sunday.  I wish to inform the House that he handled a potentially delicate situation extremely well.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, I welcome the Bills.  The Regional Technical Colleges Bill has particular interest for me as Sligo Regional Technical College has been functioning, indeed flourishing, in my constituency since 1970.  The Sligo college, and the training and education it has provided, has had a major impact on the north-western region.  It has worked well and year after year turned out highly trained and highly motivated graduates &mdash; even though many of them had to exercise their talents and their enthusiasm a long way from Sligo.</P>
      <P>Due recognition should be paid at this stage to the work of the vocational education committees and college boards for their control, guidance and direction over 21 years.  However, I believe the time has come for a review of the colleges and the governing structures.  The Regional Technical Colleges Bill sets about doing this.  It is not perfect and will need wholesale amendment, particularly where it gives power to the Minister, but it is a basis, a start.  I believe the new Minister may be closer to the local democratic structures than was his predecessor, with due respect to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past years the whole scene has changed and this Bill gives formal recognition to those changes, especially the change from the original concept of post-primary education to the colleges <Col N="1017" /> which are mainly third level.  The regional technical colleges are now to be given statutory recognition for the first time.  More power is to be devolved to them.  Academic councils and boards of governors are to be established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Up to now there was too little opportunity for forward planning by the colleges and much of the activity there had by necessity, to be on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Perhaps the Minister would inform us later about the composition of the academic council.  Presumably it will include many of the key personnel from the college concerned.  Also, I would like him to elaborate on the degree of autonomy each college will have in dealing with their own budget.  For example, will finance officers be appointed?  To what extent will the regional aspect of the college be reflected in the governing body?</P>
    <P>At present, Sligo Regional Technical College has two degree courses &mdash; environmental science and quality control, both of which are under the National Council for Education Awards.  The new Bill provides that awards may be conferred by the NCEA or a university within the State.  I wonder would the Minister consider extending that for an regional technical college in a Border area, such as Sligo, where there would be a possibility for similar arrangements to be made with Queens University, Belfast, or the University of Ulster.  I believe that as we approach 1992, that could possibly be a very valuable and imaginative idea and I do not think there are any insurmountable barriers.  Also, the Minister should seek to ensure that there would be a healthy balance in each institution between degree and sub-degree work.</P>
    <P>Sligo Regional Technical College has at present three apprenticeship courses &mdash; toolmaking, for which it is famous, motor engineering and CERT.  FÁS is just down the road, about 100 yards from the regional technical college building. Within 100 yards there are two Departments of State &mdash; Education and Labour &mdash; involved in apprenticeship courses. Has the Minister given any thought to <Col N="1018" /> possible changes in this area, particularly with the huge pressure that exists for places in the regional technical colleges? The existing situation works very well, but we must ask ourselves, in the circumstances, whether it is the most advantageous arrangement.</P>
    <P>Recently we closed a magnificent, refurbished vocational education school in Tubbercurry because of a lack of pupils.  That facility has excellent equipment. Because of the pressure for places at present, consideration should be given to holding apprenticeship courses there on a short term basis.  There is enormous potential there.</P>
    <P>There is a need for retraining regional technical college staff.  This is, I think, universally accepted, especially by the staff members themselves.  What happened in 1970?  Most of the present staff started in that period, many of whom are now in their mid-forties or mid-fifties. They operate in areas where there have been massive developments and there have been few opportunities for retraining. This must be an area of major concern for and major concentration by the new boards and academic councils.  Some staff members would like to be given the option of early retirement.  Staff development is vital and more funds should be channelled into this area.  Colleges can now engage in research and development. This is good, positive, and should be encouraged but a balance must be maintained with teaching always given priority.  I understand this is the trend in other countries.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the headlong rush for jobs and career opportunities &mdash;Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke very well on this topic &mdash;the humanities are not neglected.  With space at a premium in most colleges this could happen with technological domination. For instance, art, art and design, could become a victim and this would be a pity.  Some might regard the humanities, the liberal arts &mdash; to which Deputy Spring referred &mdash; as courses which take up too much of the scarce resources but there must be a balance.  I believe it would be a big mistake to go headlong into the other area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> I note that the board of governors of the college will have to submit an annual plan to the vocational education committee. If the vocational education committee do not like it, and want deletions or additions, who carries the day?  I do not think it is made clear in the Bill.  Do the board of governors have the right to stick with their original plan?  This could be an area of contention.  There are also the totally inadequate and gloomy buildings already referred to in which the regional technical colleges are located and inadequate sports facilities.</P>
    <P>I know that the Regional Technical Colleges, Sligo among them, are destined to play an ever greater and more significant role in education in the future and in the economy of the future.  They have been of enormous benefit to the economy of the north-west and have had spinoffs in different directions with the attraction of industry.  I had the great pleasure of announcing an industry, Shaehan Media Corporation in Hazelwood with a promise of 850 jobs. Already there are 450 employed there now.  The reason for that number of jobs is that the regional technical college provided the skilled labour they needed. That has been the experience of many other areas.  I hope this Bill, suitably amended, will be a major contributor to the future progress of the regional technical colleges.</P>

    <P>I thank those Deputies who in their contributions to this debate, of their contributions to this debate, offered congratulations and good wishes to me on my appointment.  I look forward <Col N="1020" /> with enthusiasm to meeting the challenges and exploiting the opportunities which I have no doubt will come with further developing our educational system.</P>
    <P>I have, of course, read the earlier contributions to this excellent debate and I am very heartened by the degree of support which has been forthcoming for the general thrust and intent of these two important Bills.</P>
    <P>The need to give greater autonomy to the institutions in their day-to-day operation, the statutory establishment of governing bodies and academic councils, the firm foundation being given for involvement in research, consultancy and development work, as well as the exploitation of such work, are among the progressive aspects of the Bills which have been highlighted by quite a number of speakers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahearn in the course of her very positive contribution to the debate raised a number of issues.  I agree with her fully that the title of the colleges should reflect their role in regional as well as national development.  This point has also been made in representations. On the Committee Stage I will be moving an amendment to section 5 (1) of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, to make specific reference to the regional role of the colleges while not in any way diminishing the contribution they have made and will continue to make to national development.</P>
    <P>The Steering Committee on Technical Education defined the role of the colleges as being:</P>
    <P>to educate for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations ranging from craft to professional level, notably in engineering and science, but also in commercial, linguistic and other specialities.</P>
    <P>The committee did not wish that this definition would in any way constrain the development of the colleges.  Indeed, it pointed out that if they are to make their most effective contribution to the needs of society and the economy they must be capable of continuing adaptation to <Col N="1021" /> social, economic and technological changes. This type of adaptation is exactly what has happened and was in no way inhibited by their title of technical colleges. The Regional Technical Colleges Bill, will provide a flexible legislative framework under which further adaptation and development can be fostered and encouraged.  The evolution and development of the colleges over the past 21 years has been achieved as regional technical colleges.  I do not see that we should in any way diminish this achievement or suggest that the title is now inappropriate and needs to be changed to polytechnics.  This is a term which is almost exclusive to a particular range of institutions in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The principal function of the colleges as set out in section 5 (1) of the Bill is to provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State.  It is this broad statement coupled with the quality of the work in the colleges which more than anything else reflects their present role and provides the necessary flexibility for their future development.  The colleges, under their existing titles, as well as the qualifications awarded by the NCEA have over the years achieved international recognition and standing.  Some colleges have linkages and joint programmes of study with sister institutions in Europe and are participating in the European Community Erasmus and Comett programmes. Any difficulties they have in participating in these programmes derive not from their title but from the difficulty for students on relatively short cycle courses spending periods of study abroad.  The Commission of the European Communities is aware of these difficulties and is looking at ways in which they may be alleviated or overcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahearn went on to raise the question of providing for two students on the governing bodies of the colleges.  This point was also referred to by Deputy Gerry Reynolds.  I certainly can accept <Col N="1022" /> their views on this matter and I am prepared to table an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question was also raised by Deputy Ahearn and Deputy Gerry Reynolds, as it has been in representations to the previous Minister, of ensuring an appropriate balance on the governing bodies between representatives of the vocational education committee in whose area the colleges is located i.e. the principal vocational education committee and other vocational education committees in the college region i.e. associated vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the general sentiments of the proposal which is to ensure the involvement of all the vocational education committees in a college region. However, section 6 (4) (b) of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill provides that up to four of the six governing body members nominated by the vocational education committee can, by direction of the Minister, be effectively nominated by other vocational education committees in the college region.  It would be my intention to use this provision to ensure that the appropriate vocational education committees will be represented on the governing bodies of all the colleges.  This provision provides flexibility and, at the same time, can be used to ensure appropriate representation.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of enshrining in the First Schedule to the Bill the names of associated vocational education committees is that it would relate to the present geographical distribution of the colleges.  If a further college or colleges were to be established the schedule of associated vocational education committees would still apply and the Act would have to be amended to alter it.  We should not lock ourselves into this situation and I assure the House that I will use the existing provision in section 6 (4) as intended so as to ensure representation on the governing bodies of the appropriate vocational education committees.  It will be the governing bodies which will be responsible for the preparation of the <Col N="1023" /> operational programmes for the colleges required under section 13 of the Bill.  All of the vocational education committees represented on the governing body would, accordingly, have an input into this process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahearn raised the question of granting degree awarding powers to the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges.  Her view that this should be included in the Bill was supported by Deputies Mac Giolla. Doyle, O'Shea, Kennelly and Browne. A unified Dublin Institute of Technology as envisaged by the Bill would be the second largest third-level institution in the State.</P>
    <P>The International Study Group on Technological Education in its 1987 report noted that:</P>
    <P>Colleges of Dublin Institute of Technology have been making their own academic awards for over forty years. Industry and the professional bodies have recognised these awards and accepted them as basis for appointment to professional positions and admission to membership of professional bodies.</P>
    <P>This is the main reason the Bill provides for the institute awarding its own qualification at sub-degree level.</P>
    <P>The report went on to state:</P>
    <P>The research activities of the Dublin Institute of Technology are wide ranging, as would be expected in an Institute of such diverse character. Collaboration with other researchers and institutions both nationally and internationally, is a common feature of much of the research carried out by the Institute.</P>
    <P>The size of the institute, its history in awarding qualifications and the study group report are among the points being advanced for the granting of degree awarding powers.  Degrees are at present awarding by Trinity College and this will continue for the present.  However, in her speech opening this debate the Minister pointed out that section 5 of both Bills <Col N="1024" /> include a provision that additional functions may be assigned to the regional colleges or the institute by order of the Minister made with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that degree awarding powers could, at the appropriate time, be assigned to the Dublin Institute of Technology under this provision.  The appropriate time will be when the director and the governing body have established the Institute as a single cohesive entity as envisaged by the Bill. I have every confidence this will be achieved within a relatively short term after the Act comes into operation and I will have no hesitation in then presenting the appropriate draft order for approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In fact, to indicate my goodwill in this regard, on Committee Stage, I will table an amendment to section 11 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill to extend the functions of the Academic Council so that it may make recommendations to the governing body on the appointment of external examiners and the conferment of honorary awards.  This would be in line with the 1989 legislation establishing the two universities at Limerick and Dublin and would be appropriate when degree awarding power is granted.</P>
    <P>The situation in the regional technical colleges is somewhat different.  The National Council for Educational Awards is the statutory body entrusted with the approval of courses and the award of qualifications at degree, diploma and certificate level outside the universities. The council is required to ensure that the standard of its qualifications corresponds to relevant standards in the universities.  It has taken its mission seriously and has served the regional technical colleges well with the result that today the quality of the council's qualifications is held in high standing both nationally and internationally.  In these circumstances and given that section 5 (1) (b) of the Bill provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the colleges entering into arrangements with a university for the <Col N="1025" /> award of qualifications, the role of the NCEA should continue in relation to awarding qualifications in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea questioned the appropriateness of introducing these Bills now in the light of a Green Paper on Education. This matter was also referred to by Deputies MacGiolla, Blaney, McGinley and Spring.</P>
    <P>The recently agreed joint Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a Green Paper on Education before the end of the year.  This will be a comprehensive policy discussion document leading to a White Paper and ultimately to an Education Act.  The publication of the Green Paper is intended to initiate a nationwide debate on a whole range of important issues in education.</P>
    <P>This will obviously involve a reasonable period of time after publication so that interested parties may consider the issues raised, make submissions on them and allow the necessary process of dialogue and consultation to take place.  Following detailed examination and consideration of the many views that will no doubt emerge during this period the White Paper will be published which, it is intended, will lead to an Education Act.  This is a very important process since the Education Act will set down a legislative framework for our educational system for many years to come.  While the work will be pressed ahead at all stages as quickly as possible it is of such importance that I am not prepared to lay down an absolute time frame for its completion.</P>
    <P>On the legislative front the most serious deficiencies relate to first and second level education.  A legislative base exists for most of the university sector and while it is somewhat disparate, some of it is of relatively recent origin.  These Bills are in line with those relating to the two newer universities.  The need for a satisfactory legislative basis for the work of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges is well established and accepted.  It has been <Col N="1026" /> promised for many years and it would be inappropriate to delay it further.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Bills we are discussing will serve the needs of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges for the forseeable future and accordingly should go ahead now.  Future legislation in the higher education area will relate to the university sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian O'Shea expressed concern at what is perceived in some quarters to be a diminution in the role of the vocational education committee and a tendency to centralised control by the Minister and the Department.  He also raised the question of public accountability. These points were also raised by Deputies Tomás Mac Giolla, Joe Doyle, Neil Blaney, Eamon Gilmore and Brendan Howlin.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of these Bills is to give increased autonomy to the institutions. The need for this is accepted and of necessity involves a reduction in day-to-day control at both the local and the central level.  It is the governing bodies and not the vocational education committees or the Department who will have the responsibility for the general operation of the institutions on a day-to-day basis.  This is in keeping with the situation in the third level sector generally.  The move to greater self governance by the institutions has been long promised and has been widely welcomed both in and outside this House.</P>
    <P>The impression is being given that these Bills take away all input in relation to the colleges from the vocational education committees.  This is simply not the case.  Vocational education committees will nominate the chairman and over a third of the ordinary members of the governing bodies.  This gives vocational education committees a substantial input into the operation of these bodies which after all will be responsible for the operation of the colleges and for exercising the functions conferred on the colleges in the Bill.  Since the governing bodies must <Col N="1027" /> prepare annually the operational programmes and budgets, vocational education committees will have a significant involvement in this process.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees are also the bodies who will have authority to approve of the programmes and budget either with or without modification and submit them for final approval to the Minister.  Since the governing bodies will be required to operate within the programmes and budgets as approved, the vocational education committee have a fundamental role to play in the process which in effect will provide the overall framework within which the colleges and the institute will be required to operate.</P>
    <P>I am a bit concerned about parts of the contributions of Deputies Mac Giolla and Blaney which could be taken as implying that the undoubted success of the colleges was due only to the vocational education committees operating in the face of difficulties placed in their way by an unapppreciative Department.  While I readily acknowldge the major contribution these bodies have made to the growth and development of the colleges it would be remiss of me not to stress again the enormous contributions of the principals and staff of the institute and of the colleges.  I prefer to think that what we have seen is a successful partnership of all those involved leading to today's situation where these Bills will allow the colleges to go on to a new phase of their development.</P>
    <P>The impression is also being given that control is being centralised in the Minister or the Department.  This view is based mainly on the numbers of times phrases such as &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo; appear in the Bills.  Much play was made of the number of times the Minister is mentioned in section 5 (1) of both Bills in relation to the functions of the colleges and the institute.  Deputy O'Shea in the course of his contribution to the debate raised certain questions as to what would happen in particular circumstances in relation to the involvement in research and consultancy work and in the limited <Col N="1028" /> liability companies.  He also raised the very important question of ensuring that moneys voted by this House for educational purposes are not in some way diverted to subsidise research and consultancy work for business and industry. In raising these questions I feel he proves the point that in some areas related to functions a completely open-ended approval would be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bills are generally in line with the Acts which in 1980 established on a statutory basis the then National Institutes for Higher Education at Limerick and Dublin.  In those Acts, of seven areas mentioned in the sections relating to the functions of the institutes, five of these required either the approval of the Minister or were exercised subject to such conditions as the Minister prescribed.</P>
    <P>These Acts could not be regarded in any way as having impeded the development of these two institutions nor could successive Ministers or the Department be accused of having a heavy hand in their operation as has been suggested would be the case for the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology under these Bills.  In fact the Acts coupled with the partnership between the staff of the institutes, the Higher Education Authority, the National Council of Educational Awards and the Department fostered and encouraged their development to become the universities which they now are since 1989.  It is my firm conviction that these Bills and the partnership of all those involved will similarly facilitate the development of the colleges and the institute.</P>
    <P>I can however assure the House that what would be at issue would be the laying down of a general policy framework under which the institutions would then be free to exercise autonomy in their day-to-day operations.  As I have said, one of the purposes of the Bills is to give this autonomy and there is no intention that either I or my Department will use the provisions in the Bills to inhibit in any way the general development of the colleges in line with Government policy <Col N="1029" /> for the third-level sector as determined from time to time.  I will however look at the Bills again to see if there is, in any way, undue interference in the day-to-day operation of the institutions.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mac Giolla and Doyle raised concerns with regard to including under the provisions of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill only courses of higher education in the College of Music. Deputy O'Shea suggests that this provision may have been included &ldquo;as a wedge to get rid of non-higher education courses in other colleges at a later date&rdquo;. This of course is not the intention. Deputy Mac Giolla in his contribution said that pupils are admitted from the age of five upwards.  I believe that Deputies will appreciate that students from this age group may not appear to readily belong to an institute of technology.</P>
    <P>Despite my reservations on the matter however I have been impressed by the arguments put forward by the Deputies on this question.  I am therefore prepared to put down an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage deleting the reference to courses of higher education in relation to the College of Music in the First Schedule to the Dubin Institute of Technology Bill.  There will be a need to discuss with all the interests involved the delivery of musical education to those students who are essentially first and second level pupils.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of apprenticeships, which was raised by Deputies Mac Giolla and Doyle, I would strongly refute the suggestion that not specifically referring to apprenticeships in the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill is due to lack of knowledge of the situation or lack of appreciation of the very important apprentice training provision in the colleges. The provisions in the Bills aim to give the greatest possible flexibility in encompassing existing course provision and future developments.  The provisions were drawn up bearing in mind the diversity of existing provision and including, of course, the apprenticeships area.  I am satisfied that apprenticeships provision is adequately provided for and I will not be proposing changes in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> Deputy Mac Giolla suggested also that there is a need to put a clause in the Bill to try to promote equality of opportunity in education.  Second chance students were mentioned by Deputy Doyle.  All aspects of educational disadvantage, including the provision of specific programmes for second chance education, are matters for particular attention within the overall strategy for education.</P>
    <P>I therefore welcome Deputy Mac Giolla's suggestion in relation to equality of opportunity and I will table an appropriate amendment to cover this important matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullimore dealt in some detail with the question of Outreach courses. He spoke of supplementary satellites or approved outcentres in which instruction leading to third level qualifications would be provided outside of but in association with and under the supervision of the regional colleges.  This matter was also raised by Deputy Boylan.  Deputy Cullimore would like to see the scope of such outcentres spelled out in the Regional Technical Colleges Bill through more specifics about what outcentres entail, the finance available and how they can be encouraged and developed.  My view on this matter is that very specific provisions on such matters can end up being restrictive and impeding development. The type of provision envisaged by the Deputy, while not specifically referred to, is not precluded either.  For these reasons I am not prepared to change the bills in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle in his contribution relating to the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill raises concerns about academic integrity and in particular the function of academic councils.  He voices particular concerns about section 11 (3) (e) which provides that a function of the Academic Council shall be to make, subject to such requirements as the Minister may specify, recommendations to the governing body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students&rdquo;.  I have already indicated that I am prepared to table an amendment to section 11 of this Bill to provide for academic councils <Col N="1031" /> making recommendations to the governing body on the appointment of external examiners and the conferring of honorary awards.  In order to further dispel any impression of what Deputy Doyle refers to as a &ldquo;hidden agenda&rdquo; I am willing to bring forward a further amendment to section 11 to remove reference to the Minister in section 11 (3) (e).</P>

      <P>I am delighted to bring this Bill before the Dáil.  It is significant in that it is the first Youth Services Bill to be debated in this House since the foundation of the State.  I should like to take this opportunity to thank the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Youth Federation, Foróige, and all the other organisations which helped and advised me with this Bill.  I hope that their interest and time will be rewarded by a generous and positive response from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is introduced to the Dáil as a response to the plight of young people today.  When I say &ldquo;plight&rdquo; I mean the problems being experienced by our youth population in terms of poor economic performance, mass unemployment and worsening social conditions.  Our youth population bears the brunt of all our socio-economic ills.  A few hard facts will bring this home to Deputies.  Despite the current propaganda that our youth population is very much on the decline and that the problems of youth unemployment will soon die a natural death, the latest census figures show that our <Col N="1035" /> youth population remains at 43 per cent, the highest in Europe.  Our youth unemployment rate now runs at 27 per cent, a figure which has been on the increase since early 1990, despite the assurances given by economists and Governments that things were improving.</P>
    <P>The point to note is that the youth unemployment rate is a massive seven percentage points higher than the ordinary unemployment rate which currently runs at about 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since 1982, 280,000 people have emigrated. The vast majority of those emigrating are young people between the ages of 18 and 30 years.  The waste in terms of loss of human resources is staggering and does not bear thinking about, considering the amount of time, money, effort and dedication put into the training and education of young people.  Leaving aside the social implications of emigration, it is a shame that we are at the loss of such a vibrant, educated and useful resource.  It could be said that many of our young people have left a bright future behind them.  Why have our young people become marginalised in society?  Why is the problem of our young people walking the streets without jobs accepted as nothing more than par for the course?  These questions must be answered.  I hope I can provide a framework in this Bill by which we can all work together to solve these problems.</P>
    <P>This Bill is entitled the Youth Services Bill and contains phrases such as &ldquo;youth work&rdquo; and &ldquo;youth services&rdquo;.  How can this Bill benefit young people in Ireland today?  What is youth work?  It is the work carried out by many varied and diverse groups and organisations, including youth and community groups and national and international organisations which involve adults, teenagers and children in developmental programmes designed to better the lot of young people.  All youth work has as the cornerstone of its programme and events the emotional, physical, spiritual and intellectual development of the young person. Youth work is not just about arranging youth discos or running jumble sales or <Col N="1036" /> sponsored walks.  The majority of youth work is carried out with the specific aim of imparting life skills to young people in a coherent and comprehensive manner. Basically youth work is out of school life skills, education for the young person.  It is based on an ethos of empowerment for young persons, equipping them for the transition from home and school to adult and working life.  It is participatory and is highly developed and sophisticated with its own curriculum, teaching and instruction methods as well as very specific aims and aspirations.</P>
    <P>What is the youth service?  The youth service in Ireland has developed rapidly since the sixties.  There are approximately 52 organisations in this country, ranging from the scouts and guides to the Catholic Youth Council, Foróige, the National Youth Federation and Irish language and environmental groups, including exchange organisations, travellers' groups and the National Youth Council of Ireland, the co-ordinating body for voluntary youth organisations.  The youth service, which includes all these voluntary youth organisations and the statutory based organisations, Comhairle le Leas Óige, set up under the auspices of Dublin City Vocational Education Committee, employ approximately 400 full-time youth workers and depend on the involvement of over 40,000 volunteers to help run clubs, drop-in centres and events throughout the country on an ongoing basis.  Over 500,000 young people benefit from youth work provided by these youth organisations on a daily basis.  Funding for the youth service is provided through fund raising activities undertaken by the organisations and the State.  State funding is through the national lottery and amounts to £9.806 million in 1991.  This money is distributed by the youth affairs section of the Department of Education to youth organisations.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the Bill.  What can a Youth Services Bill do for the lot of youth organisations and young people? This Bill is a first, despite numerous policy statements from both sides of the House, including the O'Sullivan report which was brought forward by Deputy <Col N="1037" /> Jim Tunney and the Costello report which was introduced by George Birmingham and Deputy Garrett FitzGerald. The first youth policy document, &ldquo;In Partnership with Youth&rdquo;, was published in 1985 by George Birmingham. None of these documents has been implemented.  Despite numerous statements and election guarantees, nothing has been done to provide a permanent and stable base from which the youth service can operate.  Nothing has been done to provide a platform to ensure that the best possible use of resources is obtained.  This Bill is designed to do just that.  It is designed to copperfasten policy and aspirations into straightforward and meaningful proposals.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 the Government have seen fit to ignore the present dilemma of youth organisations.  Since then their response to the youth service has been to have no youth policy; the only policy is to do nothing and hope the problem will go away.  Youth service funding is allocated on a year to year basis with no guarantees of maintenance of funds on a long term basis.  Youth organisations have to fight year in year out for every penny they get from the State.  Youth service funding depends on a lottery hand-out, despite the obvious educational content of programmes undertaken by youth organisations. While the Minister has to be congratulated for the £10 million made available in 1988 he has done little in this regard since.  This Bill would promote the structure whereby the Department of Finance could measure the valuable work being done in this area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the final degradation visited on youth organisation in 1991 was the broken promise in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that youth services will continue to be provided.  In 1991, 35 youth workers have been made redundant and many organisations, including the National Youth Council of Ireland, have sustained funding cutbacks in the region of 30 to 50 per cent.  Such instability is counter-productive and inhibits development.  The best possible service cannot be provided because the <Col N="1038" /> opportunities of such provision has been blocked by Government at every turn.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very much about co-operation &mdash; co-operation between youth organisations, social services and most particularly Government Departments. This is a vital component.  The Costello report of 1984 referred to this type of co-operation. Indeed, I have often heard the Minister refer to that report as his bible. There is a distinct lack of co-operation between statutory and voluntary organisations. Much of the time, the relationship is one of the funder dictating to the funded, and it remains little more than this.  For example, the Department of Justice, through the Garda, have subcontracted Foróige and the Catholic Youth Council to employ youth workers in Tallaght and Neilstown, County Dublin, yet the Department of Education were completely unaware of this initiative &mdash; a glaring example of lack of co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour certify one set of courses involving Youthreach while the Department of Education certify another. This is yet another glaring example of lack of co-operation between Government Departments.  Perhaps the most reprehensible lack of co-operation is the position of the interdepartmental committee on disadvantaged young people which was set up by the Minister with responsibility for youth and sport but which has not met for over two years. The co-operation envisaged in this Bill is not mere aspiration.  The Bill contains a specific detailed number of measures which can take effect immediately with substantial savings.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a mechanism which provides for co-operation.  In the interests of our young people, this House should act upon the provisions in the Bill.  I would point out that the O'Sullivan report of 1980, the Costello report of 1984 and &ldquo;In Partnership with Youth&rdquo; published in 1985 recommend the establishment of the youth service on a permanent legislative footing.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the Bill in greater detail, drawing attention to certain areas and outlining its aims and aspirations. <Col N="1039" /> Section 1 deals with the interpretation of various phrases, including &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;, &ldquo;youth worker&rdquo; and &ldquo;youth service&rdquo;.  It is important that Deputies pay close attention to the definitions in the introductory section which contains many of the key elements of youth work in this country.</P>
    <P>First, the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; is of tremendous importance since voluntary organisations are the bedrock of the provision of out-of-school education and leisure opportunities for young people. Under this I want the primacy of volunteerism to remain and thus I have sought to emphasise the voluntary nature of much of the youth service.  The principle of subsidiarity must be preserved at all costs.  In the definition &ldquo;youth work&rdquo; I include the moral, spiritual, cultural and general development of the young person which includes the development of social and vocational skills in young people.  Again I wish to emphasise that the definition is based on a perception of youth work as education rather than recreation, although the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  &ldquo;Youth services&rdquo; includes areas such as education, employment, housing, health, welfare and justice, which clearly shows that interdepartmental co-operation is vital if youth services are to be maximised and if we are to cater to the greatest possible extent for young people.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment of the advisory committee on youth work, which will advise the Minister on youth issues and which will have a number of research and advisory roles. The importance of this section is that it lays down a framework for co-operation, which is at the very heart of this Bill.  The committee will consist of 16 members, of whom five will be persons engaged in youth work and selected in consultation with the National Youth Council of Ireland, and Foróige, the National Youth Federation; two will be persons engaged in youth services provided by the State; three will be nominated by the Minister <Col N="1040" /> for Education and five will be representatives of the Departments of Justice, Education, Labour, Social Welfare and Health.  I wish to emphasise that this is, perhaps, the most important section of the Bill, since it is an attempt to draw together for the first time in this country all of those who provide for our young people in order to produce a cohesive policy and an action programme under the auspices of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the current situation whereby different Government Departments are unaware of the work being undertaken by other Departments will be eradicated by this Bill, as it ensures co-operation.  Furthermore, that co-operation is not limited to co-operation between youth organisations or Government Departments, but extends right across the board so that voluntary, statutory and Government Departments are all involved in both the planning and provision of services for young people. The Costello report, published in 1984, recommends the establishment of a national youth advisory committee, as does the O'Sullivan report, published in 1980, and I would like to remind the Minister that this report was brought forward by Deputy Jim Tunney, a member of his own party.</P>
    <P>In Britain the Thompson report, published in August 1982, also called for similar co-ordination.  It suggested that one Government Department should have overall responsibility and pinpointed the Department of Education for such responsibility.  The Bill before us tonight makes this possible.  In Northern Ireland, a report entitled <i>Policy for the Youth Service in Northern Ireland</i>, published in 1987, called for the establishment of a similar national committee. It is clear that I am not alone in thinking that such a committee has to be the cornerstone of the youth service in this country. It is significant that in the submissions to the Costello committee, various groups recommended this type of advisory committee.  I am amazed that it has not been acted upon since then.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a practical section and has <Col N="1041" /> been included for a very specific reason. The Department of Finance seem to be unwilling to fund voluntary youth organisations on a more permanent basis because there is a perception that youth organisations are fly-by-night bodies. Indeed, young people may say the same about some political parties and indeed some politicians.  I hope there is none of them on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see how confident the Minister sounds in a minute.</P>
      <P>It is true that organisations grow, shrink and indeed disintegrate.  But it must be remembered that the youth service and youth organisations have developed substantially over the past 20 years.  Most now hold property and premises and have substantial business commitments, being involved in the ordinary business sector and are indeed run along the lines of an ordinary commercial enterprise, except, of course, that they are non-profitmaking.</P>
      <P>Many organisations are limited by guarantee with charitable status and despite the primary of volunteerism they act substantially and most correctly within the current small business framework. In my view, the worries of the Department of Finance in this regard are needless.  However, in order to ensure that all voluntary youth organisations are regarded as absolutely properly and correctly established, I have proposed this register of voluntary youth organisation, which is similar to that currently in force in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this simple measure should assuage the fears of the Department of Finance and pave the way for a firm commitment to long term secured funding which will allow for long term planning and execution of programmes to the ultimate benefit of the young person, and in particular, to the ultimate benefit of the disadvantaged young person who always needs that much more time and <Col N="1042" /> effort in order to develop the most necessary life and social skills.</P>
    <P>Section 5 was designed with a very specific purpose in mind, that is to allow for the certification of the 40,000-odd volunteers who are needed to operate the youth organisations on a regular basis. While some youth organisations have certification of the volunteers built into their training programmes, it is clear that the aims, aspirations and ethos of the vast majority of youth organisations are similar, so that a common form of certification can be achieved quite easily.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the establishment of local advisory committees.  I recognise that the Minister of State with responsibility for youth and sport, was instrumental in setting up local voluntary youth councils and I do not in any way seek to detract from that initiative; indeed I compliment him on that initiative, and seek to put the current voluntary youth councils on a permanent footing and to establish them throughout the country instead of confining them to the 11 pilot areas, as is currently the case.  I propose that they be set up on a proper statutory basis throughout the country.  I propose also to widen their powers so that they become local advisory committees.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that the establishment of such committees on a permanent basis, dealing as they do with local representation, community empowerment, coupled with statutory and departmental involvement, is only to be welcomed. This would mean a partnership between statutory and voluntary bodies on the ground.  I also believe that when the structure is put in place it will be able to respond in a very constructive manner to the Green Paper on Education currently being prepared by the Minister's Department. May I emphasise once again that the establishment of these committees was recommended in both the O'Sullivan and the Costello reports and in the document, <i>In Partnership With Youth,</i> all of which I have already referred to and I wish to remind Deputy Quill, of the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil's partner in Government, also supported their <Col N="1043" /> establishment I quote from paragraph 4.5 of the Progressive Democrats document on youth policy, entitled <i>A Better Tomorrow,</i> which states:</P>
    <P>Youth work ought to be treated as a developmental area and given funding appropriate to that status.  The funding of youth work should be formally recognised and should form part of the estimates for the Department of Education even though supplementary monies may come from sources such as The National Lottery.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the co-ordination of youth services.  Paragraph 5 (1) states: &ldquo;The Progressive Democrats support the setting up of Local Youth Service Councils on a phased basis, as part of the ongoing development of Youth Policy.&rdquo;  Indeed, within the present Government I have strong support for this concept.</P>

      <P>I am sure if Deputy Quill pushes the concept she will be rewarded, because her party seem to have been successful in most of the things they have asked of this Government. Tonight I appeal to Deputy Quill to urge acceptance of this concept.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention section 7, which is again a simple, practical measure that has not been undertaken.  I take this opportunity to try to rectify what I consider to be a gap in legislation, the amendment of which would be of substantial benefit to youth organisations. Section 7 proposes that those who donate money to voluntary youth organisations may obtain tax relief to the amount of that donation.  That measure would apply to income tax and corporation tax.  The present legislation on tax relief for donations for various groups does not apply to youth organisations, for some strange reason, and section 7 would rectify that curious anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I proposed that amendment to the Finance Bill, 1991.  However, I was very <Col N="1044" /> disappointed, not so much with the reaction of the former Minister, Deputy Reynolds, but with that of some of his backbenchers who asked why youth organisations should have the right to such a concession.  Similar organisations throughout the country enjoy the concession and why should youth organisations not be entitled also?  The measure would provide a major source of finance for them.  It would be a productive measure in that people would be encouraged through tax incentives to invest in local youth clubs and their facilities. I urge the Government to take that concept on board in the next Finance Bill.  A net gain would be investment in youth organisations throughout the country which is so badly required at the moment.  I remember asking midway through my speech what the Youth Services Bill could do for youth organisations and young people.  I have answered the first part of that question adequately and I should now like to turn to the second part of the question.</P>
    <P>It may seem I have been concentrating on the lot of youth organisations and the youth service rather than on young people.  However, I emphasise that every measure and proposal put forward by me today has a direct bearing on young people, whether or not they be involved in youth organisations.  Increased co-operation between the Departments of Education and Labour will mean that fewer young people will fall through the formal education and FÁS nets.  It also means that the division between education and training will be eradicated. Increased co-operation between the Departments of Education, Justice, Health and the Environment and youth organisations means fewer young people will become involved in crime, will become marginalised and will start to live rough.  Indeed, in today's society there are several instances in which that is ocurring. It is rather ironic that the district justices are calling for a measure such as this.</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues will later deal with the plight of young offenders.  District justices point out that in the case <Col N="1045" /> of young offenders there is substantial passing of the buck between the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  That attitude must be eradicated and I feel I am offering a solution to it tonight.  The measures proposed in the Bill link up to ensure: first, that young people's issues and problems are recognised; second, that there is a mechanism whereby such problems can be discussed and, third and most important, that there is a stable and permanent framework of co-operation from which the appropriate response can be planned and executed with all possible efficiency.</P>
    <P>Youth organisations very often provide the only link between young people and society.  All too frequently the young person has left the education system, has no job and has little training or education behind him or her.  In such a marginalised situation, with the dole queue or emigration as the option, many young people have only their youth organisation or their drop-in centre to fall back on. Therefore, it is vital in order to guarantee our own future and a future for our young people, that we prepare the young for the myriad of social and economic problems they will face in the transition from adolescence to adult life.  Youth organisations provide such preparation and it is vital that we offer our wholehearted support to those who attempt to help our young people outside the formal education system.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps ironic that while only 15 per cent of a young person's time is spent in school, £1,290 million is spent on the formal education system, as compared to a mere £9.806 million spent on the informal education system.  As I said, that £9.8 million comes from lottery funding, not from the Estimates.  I leave the House with that simple statistic and ask Members to make up their own minds about the value of youth work to the young person and the community.  In my mind there can be only one answer, that the youth service and youth organisations make an invaluable contribution to our country that is not being recognised.  I <Col N="1046" /> urge the House to support the most valuable work undertaken by voluntary youth organisations.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not just for young people involved in youth services, it is about co-ordinating all the services for young people from all Departments.  If we accept the Bill we will send a signal to young people that we do care, that we are interested, and that we are legislators. The Bill stands on its merits and it should not be rejected because it comes from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me to share his time.  I congratulate Deputy Deenihan on introducing the Youth Services Bill.  We must all admit it is disappointing that so little time is devoted in the House to discussing the matters that affect the lives of our young people.  Tonight Deputy Deenihan and the Fine Gael Party have placed youth as top priority on our political agenda.</P>
      <P>For far too long youth came near the bottom of the list of society's preoccupations. Youth was considered a kind of limbo.  In fact, life really began only when one emerged from youth. Thankfully, times have changed and today youth is to the forefront in their concern for the problems of the world. On the great questions of peace, justice and progress youth has its decisive word to say. that is a welcome change.</P>
      <P>We must realise that in every field of human endeavour, be it political, social, educational or scientific, we must look to the future, not the past, to provide the necessary action, and that future is the territory of youth, this is, indeed, the age of youth, but Irish society does not as yet fully recognise the position of youth. Expression must now be given to the voice of young Ireland.  The Bill before the House this evening aims to ensure that services are available to provide young people with the means to take their rightful place in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an undeniable fact that the future of the nation will depend largely on the <Col N="1047" /> way in which our young people are catered for, physically, socially and educationally. Our present generation of young boys and girls start off with the advantage of good educational opportunities that were not, perhaps, foreseen some decades ago.  Whatever its merits, formal education as we know it today, sadly, does not prepare youth for the world outside the classroom, but it is the environment outside the classroom that will have the greatest influence on the lives and the attitudes of young people. That is why they must be given the opportunity to be involved in out-of-school activities that will benefit themselves and their communities.  The well organised youth club plays a vital function in this regard and the dedicated people who run such clubs are doing this nation a great service.  We must acknowledge the great responsibility they accept and recognise the major influence they can exert on a large segment of our youth.</P>
    <P>There is a conscious need now to educate people generally for leisure as well as for employment.  As developments in modern technology have added considerably to people's leisure time the ability to lead a full life will depend, to an ever increasing extent, on good and valuable use of free time.</P>
    <P>From time to time unfair questions are raised about the leisure activities of youth.  The tragedy of our time is that the misdeeds of a few are highlighted as representing the overall pattern.  Of course, the plain fact of the matter is that in no age had the involvement of youth in worthy causes been so great as at present.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the importance of equality in the overall activities of youth today.  It should not appear unrealistic to hope that in 1991 young men and women be treated equally, be provided with equal opportunities and not be discriminated against on the basis of gender. Despite growing awareness of these issues and improvements in many areas undoubtedly there remains a huge volume of work to be done to ensure such equality of opportunity and of access to all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> In theory there are more options available to young women today than heretofore whereas, in practice, these opportunities are not availed of because the requisite back-up education and encouragement of young women does not exist.  It is not sufficient to open up new opportunities for young women. Indeed, it would be naive to expect young women to avail of such opportunities unless teachers, organisers and employers examined their attitudes and adopted strategies for the recruitment of young women.  The concept of equality needs to be promoted at a very early age.  This is beginning to happen.  For example, books and toys for children are becoming less sexist but the attitudes of adults and educationalists still warrant revision.  The choices for boys and girls in education still differ with many girls' schools still not offering courses in honours mathematics or physics to their students.  I could give many other examples.  Anti-sexist training has never been made available to teachers.  Therefore, it is clear that the participation of women in the workforce is governed very much by attitudes and opinions which come to the fore in the formative years in both primary and secondary schools. For example, teaching practices must in no way encourage stereotyping but rather should act positively against such stereotyping. There should be both in-service and pre-service training of teachers to ensure that equality at primary and second level is not alone encouraged but continued.  Young women often form the majority of entrants to third level education. On the other hand, young women who leave school at a very early age without any qualification tend not to fare quite as well as young men in that category. Very often young women undertake unpaid work at home, looking after younger brothers and sisters or parents and become part of the hidden unemployed. They also have less access to services in this area than their young male counterparts.</P>
    <P>While FÁS, the national training agency, have operated a positive action programme for women in recent years &mdash;<Col N="1049" /> something I welcome &mdash; there remain a number of areas in which young women are under-represented, particularly in relation to apprenticeships.  There is a need for a more aggressive marketing approach to be adopted to encourage more women to enter non-traditional areas of work.</P>
    <P>The history of Irish youth services in general is one which has had a male focus. In the forties the aim of the then new youth service was primarily geared to keeping young men off the streets and out of trouble.  Young women were invisible in that they were not found at street corners and, therefore, not considered to be in need of a youth service.  Over the years gradually young women became involved in youth clubs but such clubs' activities did not change to reflect their needs.  In many cases young women became passive observers and were often criticised for non-participation.  At that stage it was still not recognised that the girls' sub-culture was different from that of boys in what was perceived then as a general youth sub-culture.  Over the past ten to 15 years more young women have come into contact with the youth services by way of the programme for disadvantaged and special services.  In many youth services work for girls has been developed.  However, in most cases this work has been undertaken by women having a personal interest in such work which means that generally such work is dependent on individuals or a small group of women.</P>
    <P>I should impress on the House that young people always have been imaginative, creative and original.  They have a great deal to offer today's world and, more important, that of the future, a future that after all belongs to them.  We must ensure they are given the support outlined in the Bill to enable them express their ideas through positive, constructive action.  The enthusiasm and idealism of our youth must be exploited and utilised so that their work will be enhanced with fuller recognition given their rightful claim to a greater say in the life of our country.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill proves <Col N="1050" /> that the Fine Gael Party value young people and their contribution to our society.  The provisions of this Bill say to young people in a loud, clear, unambiguous voice that they matter, that what they say matters and is important; that what they do and what they would like us to do is relevant.  Indeed, it puts into action the hitherto meaningless rhetoric such as their description as being our greatest national asset.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party I should emphasise that Deputy Deenihan always has held a sincere, genuine concern for young people and has never let up on his commitment or determination to enhance and expand our youth services.  He has never ceased his efforts to focus the attention and concentration of all his colleagues on the needs and aspirations of the young Irish. His Bill is deserving of overall support and, in its introduction, he has done a good job for our young people.  Fine Gael want to hear the voice of the youth of Ireland.  We believe that they have important things to say and that nobody in this House has a right to exclude them.</P>

      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Therese Ahearn about Deputy Deenihan as spokesman for his party on youth affairs.  There is no doubt that he has always acted in the utmost interest of young people in the provision of youth services for them.  He has always been constructive in his role as Opposition spokesman, something on which I would like to pay him a very sincere, personal compliment.</P>

      <P>The Bill, which came to my notice on Friday evening last only, is one with which I cannot find much satisfaction.  I say that without wishing <Col N="1051" /> simply to be negative about it.  I do not agree with Deputy Deenihan that this Bill &mdash; even if enacted next week &mdash; would be of any great significance in improving our youth services or the lifestyles of young people.</P>
      <P>We do not need another advisory committee to improve our youth services. Neither do we need any further discussion; rather what we need is more money.  Deputy Deenihan referred to a number of reports and policy documents that had been published in this area, one an excellent report, the Costello report and, following on that, the Fine Gael document entitled, &ldquo;In Partnership with Youth&rdquo;.  It was for that reason that I said in 1987 when I took over this position &mdash; and have repeated many times since &mdash; I did not intend to have any more policy documents, reports or committees, that we had sufficient documentation and talk, what we wanted was action.  We succeeded in getting a certain amount of action.  Nonetheless I am the first to accept that lack of money has been a major problem in our getting more action along the lines we wanted.</P>
      <P>I want to refute a number of points. The Deputy referred to statements and election guarantees about advisory councils.  No such statements were ever made by me and no such guarantees were given.  The last four years have seen policies and aspirations put into action.  I was very happy to adopt the Costello report which set out the areas in which action was needed in regard to youth services.  A significant development of youth services has taken place on that bedrock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary organisations must be appreciated for the work they are doing. Were it not for them and their efforts, we would have no youth services.  In fact, we have excellent services, due to the voluntary organisations.  The only inhibiting factor in their work is lack of money.  We are giving them about £10 million and they have demands for a much greater sum.  There is not a need for an extra committee or for new legislation, but there is a need for more money.  That <Col N="1052" /> is the problem.  If extra money could have been provided by bringing in legislation, I would not have failed to take the appropriate action.</P>

      <P>I should like to see it. The only legislation proposed was in regard to local youth service boards which were to be set up.  The establishment of a committee of Ministers of State in various Departments was also proposed.  I wonder why this idea has been brought forward now, since it was not contained in the 1985 policy document.</P>
      <P>This matter is all about our providing youth organisations with more money. The last paragraph of the Fine Gael document stated that in 1985 the voluntary youth organisations received £2,029,700. The document went on to state that the Government were making an additional £2 million available in 1986 for the phased development of the national youth service. That was the last line of the policy document published in December 1985. In January 1986 the Department of Finance announced that the £2 million provided the month before was being withdrawn from the youth service.  That was the commitment by Fine Gael in terms of extra financial resources for the development of the youth service.  They provided £2 million in 1985 and promised in a policy document in December that year an extra £2 million, but they announced in January 1986 that the £2 million was being withdrawn.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy's party were in Government he was not very successful in getting money.  This debate should be focused on the wonderful work done by youth organisations and the need for politicians, civil servants <Col N="1054" /> and the general public to recognise that the best value for Government expenditure comes from the youth services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan has shown a lack of knowledge on what has been happening during the past two years.  There has been extremely good co-operation between the voluntary and the State sectors.  I have enjoyed a very good relationship with the national organisations, the National Youth Council, Fóiróige and the others.  The only issue of major concern to them and to me is lack of money. The interdepartmental committee which I set up two years ago to deal with the provision of money for the most disadvantaged children, sat in order to make recommendations to me for a two-year programme.  It has not been necessary for them to sit since because the programme has proceeded very well along the lines they set out.</P>
      <P>The next development was the committee set up by the Government, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, which deals with homelesness and child care.  They are representatives of the Departments of Health, Education and Justice and they are tackling the continuing problem of disadvantaged young people.  It is not correct to say there has been no continuation of the work of the committee.  It is certainly not correct to say that the Department of Education were not aware that the Department of Justice had appointed youth officers in the Tallaght area.  I was aware of that from the outset and I welcomed the development, although I expresed concern because we, in the Department of Education, could have used extra youth officers in Tallaght and other areas if we had the money to fund them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have found no demand from the youth organisations for the proposed advisory committee, and I meet them regularly.  I have with me the various agendas they have put before me and they have not put forward in any of those agendas a proposal to set up a national advisory committee similar to the one proposed in this Bill.  There is no demand for such a committee and I do not for one moment think it would add anything <Col N="1055" /> other than another layer of bureaucracy to the provision of youth services.  Given that the Deputy proposes that travelling and subsistence expenses should be paid to the members of the committee, this proposal would cost money which I believe could be much better used providing youth services on the ground.</P>
    <P>In addition, the advisory committee would bring in people from a wide range of areas.  Frankly, it would be an unworkable committee because it would go into areas which are not the responsibility of the Department of Education.  This would lead to more red tape, more bureaucracy and more talk which, in turn, would lead to absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the provision in regard to a register of youth organisations because the Department of Education have a detailed list of organisations in receipt of funding.  This list is available to anyone who wants it.  We keep a significant number of records on all of those organisations.  Indeed, there is a continual assessment by the youth affairs section of the Department of new organisations which want to be considered for funding.  A register of youth organisations would have no beneficial, practical, effect that I can establish and Deputy Deenihan did not outline any in his speech.</P>
    <P>While section 5, which deals with education and training, is a good section there is nothing in it that is not being done already.  It outlines the areas where action which should be taken in education and training.  However, all this is happening very effectively at present. The only problem youth organisations have in regard to the action is that they would like to have more money to carry out a more effective and broadly based education and training programme.</P>
    <P>The local advisory committees would simply duplicate the local voluntary youth boards.  Nine of these boards have been set up and two further boards were announced recently.  The only reason I cannot set up voluntary youth councils all over the country is that I do not want <Col N="1056" /> to set up councils to which I cannot provide some funding, however small, to help them with the task they have to do. The very laudable demand for a local voluntary youth services structure is hampered only by a lack of money.  As I have said, section 6, which proposes the establishment of local advisory committees, would simply add a further layer of bureacracy which would be of no great benefit whatsoever in providing youth services at local level.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with tax relief.  While the idea of tax relief may seem good, I disagree vehemently with Deputy Deenihan's suggestion that it would bring very significant amounts of money to youth services.  There is ample reason to be categorical about this.  For example, one has only to look at the proposals by the Fine Gael Party in Government when they introduced Gaisce, the President's award.  Gaisce was to be funded by a series of donations from the private sector which were to carry a tax relief bonus.  When the then Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs put it to his Government colleagues that this devlopment should be approved they refused to approve the provision of a tax relief scheme for donations to Gaisce.  As a result no money was donated by the private sector.  In fact, the youth affairs section of the Department of Education had to take up the full funding of Gaisce which they have been proud to carry on.</P>
    <P>The second reason I believe a tax incentive scheme of this nature would not be of any significance is that one such scheme is in operation &mdash; a tax relief scheme on gifts to Cospóir.  In the four years that scheme has been in operation we received no money because it is simply not attractive for the private sector to make gifts to sport through that scheme. I am not aware of any scheme other than this one which could be introduced for the provision of money to youth organisations which would be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners.  Fine Gael in Government rejected the same type of scheme when it was proposed as part of the funding for Gaisce.  I am absolutely definite that there is no hidden crock of <Col N="1057" /> gold in the private sector which could provide money for youth services through any tax relief schemes.  Consequently, section 7 would be of no benefit whatsoever in the provision of extra funding.</P>
    <P>Having gone through the various sections, I have to say there is nothing in the Bill which would improve the lot of youth service provision.  However, I acknowledge that this debate gives us the opportunity to highlight the necessity for increasing the amount of funding and further developing our youth services.  As I have said to youth organisations and in this House, the main difficulty which has always existed in relation to youth service provision is that it is not taken seriously by the general public or politicians on all sides of the House.  The reality is that youth services provides an excellent service to the State for a very small cost.</P>
    <P>I have to get across the message to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government that more money should be put into this area.  In the present climate where there is a demand for major cutbacks I can assure the House that this is a very difficult message to put across. I have been making the case for extra funding for youth services in the Estimates and I have met with the kind of response that we read about in the newspapers, that is, there must be cutbacks in public expenditure at all levels. This is the kernel of the issue.  I want to put it to Deputy Deenihan that it is also the kernel of the issue for his party.  It has been stated categorically by the leader of his party, Deputy John Bruton, over the past number of weeks that a cornerstone of the economic policy of Fine Gael in Government would be to cutback on public expenditure.  Therefore, it is not good enough for people to promise extra money in the current climate.  We are all agreed that extra money is difficult to get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the importance of all of us, together with the youth organisations, working to try to convince everybody that, despite the major difficulties in regard to the public finances which will continue, the investment of extra money by the State in youth services would give a good return.  During the past week newspapers have carried stories and printed pictures of disadvantaged young people in parts of Dublin city.  This epitomises the need for youth organisations who would ensure that there would not be wholesale disruption of the lives of young people.</P>
      <P>If we provide more money for youth organisations to enable them to continue their work, there would not be the kind of difficulties we have seen in parts of Dublin this week.  We would not have the difficulties we have seen in areas such as Ronanstown.  At present Opposition parties are calling for extra gardaí to be appointed.  If the response of the Government is to provide extra gardaí then, as Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, I say that is the wrong approach.  We have an uncanny ability here to try to prevent problems after they have happened.  If we were to increase the amount of money we are spending on youth services in places such as Ronanstown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is being run extremely well by the Catholic Youth Council and Dublin Vocational Education Committee. In 1991 we provided £88,710 towards that scheme and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin also provided a significant amount of money.  That money is far short of what is required to provide those young children in Ronanstown, who are severely disadvantaged and underprivileged, with a reasonable level of lifestyle to which they are entitled but are not getting.  I have to say, &ldquo;there but for the grace of God go I&rdquo;.  I have no doubt if I were a child in Ronanstown and brought up in the same circumstances as those children, I would have been in the pictures in the newspapers last Sunday.  We have got to face up to the fact that unless and until we are prepared to put money into the youth services, who can give those children an improved standard of living, we will have the problems we saw at the weekend.  We will spend twice as much money trying to solve those problems by recruiting extra gardaí or providing extra prison cells or whatever.  In my four years in my present post &mdash; like my predecessor &mdash; I have been trying to deal with the problem. <Col N="1060" /> The general public do not recognise that money spent on preventive measures for those young people would by and large solve their problems.  I have only to look around this city and the country at the work being done by youth organisations and by the youth service to know that given any small chance young people are good and will act responsibly.  If we cannot put in the basic resources to assist those young people in having a basic lifestyle they will get up to the kind of difficulties that are becoming all too prevalent.  That is the issue this debate should address.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputy Deenihan to forget about this Bill and address the issues which need to be addressed and highlighted here and outside.  I hope as a result, despite the serious difficulties we have with the public finances, the Government, and the Department of Finance, will see the necessity for providing more money, otherwise it will cost the State considerably more in curing the problems those young people will create as a result of not being given a fair chance.</P>
      <P>I ask that this debate this week and next week addresses those issues, the mechanisms by which we can make the youth service more effective.  We do not need any more policies, we have all we need.  We have excellent youth organisations providing an excellent service throughout the country on a shoestring. We have to make a critical analysis of the work they are doing and bring to the Floor of this House, before the general public and the Minister for Finance, the fact that the work they are doing is proper for young people and that it costs money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the point made by Deputy T. Ahearn in regard to young <Col N="1061" /> women.  Since I was made Minister of State I have been anxious to see that youth organisation serving women have an equal, if not greater, opportunity through the provision of money and support services from my Department.  We have tried to ensure that the organisations serving women are given an equal, if not a better, chance than the organisations which serve boys only.  We have tried to ensure that the disadvantaged programmes would be of assistance to women.  A number of our disadvantaged programmes are specially geared towards young mothers and young women in places such as Dublin. Limerick and Wexford.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not serve the interests of young people or the interests of the youth service provision but it gives us an opportunity to debate this important issue and for that I thank Deputy Deenihan.  I hope that for the remainder of the debate we address the issues and, rather than political point scoring, which I have tried to keep out of, we recognise that for all parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We welcome the contribution by Deputy Deenihan on the Bill.  I am a little confused in regard to what the Minister said.  He stated that what we need is not a Bill but an opportunity to debate youth affairs.  That is what we want in the House and that is what 500,000 young people and those in youth organisations are looking for.  Will the Minister acknowledge that with the exception of Private Members' Business, the business of this House is in the hands of the Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey, is a member of the Government and we have not had a debate on youth affairs since 1984.

      <P>Father Christmas will not come this year for thousands of youngsters in rural Ireland unless the headage cheques arrive.  That may sound like an over-dramatic seasonal plea but I <Col N="1063" /> can assure the House that it is not. Farmers have never been so down at heel or with their backs to the wall as they are at present.  Cattle prices are back by over £100 per head and even more so in the disadvantaged areas to which the headage schemes apply in particular. Milk is back from £1.10 per gallon to 78p per gallon by comparison with just over a year ago.  Lambs are fetching between £28 and £35.  One cannot sell wool.  Never before in the history of agriculture have things been so bad.  Never before has agriculture been devastated on all fronts simultaneously.  Never before have farmers faced such uncertainty. The consequence of the GATT and Common Agricultural Policy talks is that small farmers are being told in particular by implication that there is no role for them any longer.  I refuse to accept this.  We have to create a role for them.  These are not the people who have perpetrated the excesses that international managers are now trying to curtail and regulate.</P>
      <P>Things have never been so bad on all fronts.  In the past milk prices would be down but beef prices would be up so that checks and balances kept things afloat. When headage, suckler cow grants and beef premiums were introduced they were seen very much in terms of a bonus in order to further augment the farm income.  Today they are the only income that farmers receive.  Recently a farmer told me he had sold 9 young cattle for less than £100 each.  At this stage the man is effectively asset stripping.  That man and hundreds of other small farmers are waiting for the postman to arrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about a clear commitment to £100 million in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is vital that those cheques arrive before Christmas.  Otherwise it will be a harsh, bleak Christmas.  In the past the Minister, Deputy Deasy, not alone doubled headage payments but paid them in double quick time.  In relation to beef premiums, at the moment forms are being discarded for the smallest of mistakes. I implore the Minister to ensure <Col N="1064" /> that there is more leniency with regard to the forms.  After all, this scheme is 100 per cent funded from Brussels.  There is no point in sending money straight back to Brussels because of minor flaws in a very complicated process.  I urge the Minister with regard to the £100 million commitment and with regard to the £12 million increase for the old disadvantaged areas to ensure that the payments are made before Christmas.  A person with a salary, a professional person, and others get their cheques on time, yet farmers have to wait and do not know when they will be paid.  The farmer cannot make any plans at the moment the way things stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Higgins. The Deputies from Mayo West and Mayo East met with an official delegation from the IFA yesterday, and this matter was discussed.  I would like the Minister in his reply to clarify for the farmers of the west whether or not the commitment of £100 million plus the £12 million increase will be paid.  Will the Minister indicate when this will be paid and will the Minister and his senior Minister please see to it that the payments sections of the Department, arrange set times for issuing these payments so that farmers can plan ahead?</P>
      <P>A fundamental point at issue is that the headage payments are no longer a bonus, no longer a top-up.  They are the income of many thousands of farmers from Donegal to West Kerry.  It behoves the Minister on behalf of the Government to see to it that the promise made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is honoured that the cheques are sent out so that farmers can meet their commitments.  This is important for the social life of thousands of farmers in rural Ireland.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that and will ensure that a mechanism is put in place in the Department to establish a specific pay time for these payments.  I appreciate that it is important for the Department to keep money in their coffers for as long as possible but in all fairness a commitment was given by the Government and I implore the Minister to see that it is honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Enda Kenny for raising this matter.  I note that there is another Mayo West Deputy and a South-West Cork Deputy in the House who have also brought the matter to my attention.  I held a clinic over the weekend at which it was brought to my attention that people would appreciate these payments at the very least as a Christmas box.  It is my intention to ensure that as many headage payments as possible are made by Christmas and that whatever payments remain are then made as early as possible in 1992.</P>
      <P>So far this year just over £176 million in all has been spent on livestock headage grants.  This total comprises a £16¾ million carry-forward from the 1990 disadvantaged areas schemes, a £12 million carry-forward from the 1990 suckler cow premium schemes a £27.75 million carryforward from the 1990 special beef premium scheme, £46 million payable in 1991 under the 1990 ewe premium scheme and £74 million in respect of 1991 ewe premium.  In addition to this, it is proposed to spend another £88 million before Christmas to bring the overall total up to £264 million or so.  This £88 million will comprise £63.25 million for the 1991 disadvantaged areas schemes, £21 million under the 1990 and 1991 suckler cow premium schemes and about £4 million under the 1991 special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the beef premium scheme raised by Deputy Jim Higgins, I am also aware of application forms with minor technical difficulties, for instance, a wrong tag number or something like that.  I have spoken to the headage section in the Department with regard to that matter and they will sympathetically consider applications where it is quite obvious that there is no intention to defraud or to claim money that is not due.  In all, some £162.5 million will be paid by the end of 1991 under all 1991 headage premium schemes compared with £148 million paid out under the 1990 schemes by the end of 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having drawn the general picture in <Col N="1066" /> relation to payments this year for Deputy Higgins, I would now like to turn to the specifics of the 1991 disadvantaged areas schemes payments.  The £63.25 million to be spent on the 1991 schemes by Christmas will represent just over 72 per cent of all 1991 payments due under those schemes, a percentage that is in line with payments made under them in previous years.  Paragraph 13 (iii) of Section VI of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, referred to by the Deputy, did not promise that £100 million would be paid in 1991 but merely stated that &ldquo;The full benefit of the revised headage scheme payments in respect of 1991 would, on this basis, be £100 million.  If the increases contemplated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are put in place for 1991, then the cost of the 1991 schemes will indeed rise from the current cost of £87.5 million to the £100 million mentioned in paragraph 13 (iii).  A decision on such an increase has been deferred pending a full scale review of the feasibility of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Meanwhile payments under these schemes are being made at the current rates between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I would just mention that the cost of the disadvantaged areas scheme has risen from £60 million in 1989 to £87.5 million this year without even allowing for the increases mentioned in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> An increase of over £27 million or almost 46 per cent inside two years is an indication of the Government's commitment to our disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá mé buíoch díot gur thug tú seans dom anocht labhairt faoin bhfadhb seo. Having heard about the millions of pounds mentioned in the previous reply I feel embarrassed to mention to the Minister for Social Welfare that I am looking for a few measly hundreds of pounds only.  Let me say to the Minister, <Col N="1067" /> as the new Minister for Social Welfare, that all new brooms sweep clean and I am quite sure the Minister will face into his Department sweeping all these archaic rules out of existence.  There are many archaic rules and I would advise the Minister to catch them by the scruff of the neck and throw them out as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The case I speak about tonight concerns a Carlow man who, because of his bad health was awarded a free telephone rental.  He has angina, arthritis and blood pressure, and each morning he has to put a patch on his chest to stabilise his system. He is a widower and he has an only child and while that child attended school each day he was, up to this, in a position to use the telephone if he needed medical attention.</P>
      <P>However, for some strange reason, the Department of Social Welfare decided that when the daughter had reached the magic age of 15 there would be no need for him to get help.  That is forgetting, of course, that the daughter is going to school each morning by bus at 8 o'clock and coming back at about 5 o'clock in the evening.  He is on his own for more than one-third of every day.  The daughter is not earning money but going to school, which all 15 year olds should do, and which is the least we can offer our children. While the legal age up to which a child must be in full-time education is 15, we cannot talk about legal standards at this stage.  The age up to which children go to school is generally 18.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should raise that legal age to 18 to make it practical.  This girl will be at school for the next three years and this man is deprived of the free rental because she is 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers I am talking about are very few.  The cost would be small and the relief would be huge in terms of taking the pressure and worry from people who are in this position.  I would therefore appeal to the Minister to deal with this in a practical way and to please avoid telling me about archaic rules that he is stuck with.  If the Minister must tell <Col N="1068" /> me about them let him tell me he will change them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned, who is a widower, receives a retirement pension from my Department.  This is paid at a weekly rate of £83.00 &mdash; £64.00 basic pension, £14,00 in respect of his dependent daughter and £5.00 fuel allowance during the winter months.  He also qualifies for a free electricity allowance and a free travel pass. He was receiving free telephone rental from the time he became a widower in late 1990.</P>
      <P>When his daughter reached 15 years of age in August 1991, his free telephone rental allowance had to be terminated in accordance with the scheme.  The allowance was terminated with effect from 26 August 1991.</P>
      <P>The free telephone rental scheme is intended to encourage people who are living alone to have a telephone in order to be able to summon help in an emergency. Under the conditions of that scheme, pensioners must be either living alone or living only with a dependent child under 15 years old, or living with people who are themselves permanently incapacitated.  If pensioners are living with older dependent children or with an able-bodied adult, then there would normally be someone able and responsible in the house to go to seek help if required.</P>
      <P>In particular, where there is a teenaged child living with the pensioner, it is not unreasonable to expect that a 15-year-old would be mature and responsible enough to get effective help should his or her pensioner parent require it.  Of course, children in their teens are likely to be at school for part of each day.  They would, however, normally be at home in the house at weekends and in the evening and night time, to get help if needed then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Deputy's information, since he suggested that we should take these things by the scruff of the neck, Exchequer expenditure in 1991 on the free telephone rental scheme will be £13.96 million.  By the end of October <Col N="1069" /> last, there were 94,400 people receiving an allowance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme represents a very considerable commitment of Exchequer funds to meet an important social need. Given the scale of expenditure already being made to the scheme, I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate it is very difficult in times of scarce additional resources to develop schemes such as this one to meet every possible situation fully.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to make an exception to the rules of the scheme in the particular case raised by the Deputy without discriminating against other pensioners who might be in a similar situation. Any extension of the scheme to cover pensioners in these circumstances would have to be considered in the context of the budget.  Again, I am sure the Deputy will understand that the Government are analysing the Estimates for 1992 very carefully.  I cannot say whether in these difficult times it would be possible to make further concessions under that scheme.  I will certainly keep the Deputy's views in mind and if it is possible to make any further extensions to that very worthwhile scheme we will certainly do it.  However, I could not make a commitment here to do it, bearing in mind that the amount of money that is already committed to the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is my first appearance here since the new Minister took office I want to congratulate him and wish him well as Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Wednesday, 30 October, a fishing boat, the <i>Heather Berry</i>, based in Renvyle, County Galway, got into difficulties off Old Head during a very bad storm while on it way to fishing grounds in Clew Bay and sent out calls for help. A helicopter based at Shannon arrived on the scene and airlifted two crew members.  In the meantime another fishing boat from Westport, the <i>Sun Dancer</i>, came to the rescue of the <i>Heather Berry</i> but it, too, got into difficulties.  Because <Col N="1070" /> the helicopter had to go back to refuel it was not in a position to continue the rescue operation.  Fortunately, a trawler, the <i>Honey Bee,</i> from Achill, came to the rescue and took the <i>Sun Dancer</i> in tow and saved the lives of three crew members.  I wish to pay tribute to both crews who set out in atrocious weather conditions with no regard for their own safety.  Were it not for the bravery of the two seamen and their crews coming to the rescue in that storm, the three crew members of the <i>Sun Dancer</i> would probably have lost their lives.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the present position regarding the fuelling of helicopters in Castlebar military barracks. It has an ideal landing facility with floodlighting and there are personnel on duty at all times.  I suggest that a modern fuelling depot should be provided at this location given that a number of islands off the Mayo coast require a constant helicopter service.  Indeed, at this time of year many people from all over the world who arrive at piers and harbours along the coast, to bury their dead or visit relatives living on the islands, are unable to get to them and have to return to the United States, Australia and so on without having made the trip.</P>
    <P>If fuelling facilities were available at the military barracks in Castlebar or a helicopter provided there, it would eliminate the cost of travelling to Baldonnel, Shannon or Donegal to refuel.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of locating a helicopter at the military barracks in Castlebar to provide a rescue service over a long coast line, from Donegal to Cork, to airlift patients to hospitals and to protect our fisheries.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for his good wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fuelling facilities for helicopters involved in search and rescue, air ambulance and island relief missions are available at Castlebar military barracks.  The supply of aviation fuel has been maintained there for a number of years and has been availed of during the years by Air Corp Dauphin and Alouette helicopters involved in search and rescue, air <Col N="1071" /> ambulance and island relief operations. This facility will continue to be used as required.</P>
    <P>In addition to the facilities at Castlebar, refuelling facilities are also available at several other locations along the west coast, including at the civil airports at Carrickfin, Sligo, Knock, Carnmore and Shannon Airport.  Facilities are also available at military locations in Tralee, Cahirciveen, Finner Camp, and at the Commissioners of Irish Lights sites in Castletownbere, Blacksod Bay, Rossaveel and Fanad Head.  Work is in progress on behalf of the Department of the Marine on the upgrading of the Commissioners of Irish Lights helipad at Blacksod Bay.  This work is expected to be completed by the end of December 1991.  The upgrading will permit day and night refuelling of medium range search and rescue helicopters.  The availability of this site on the extreme west of the country maximises the range of SAR helicopters. Airports are generally used for refuelling purposes but in emergencies locations such as Castlebar military barracks can also be used.</P>
    <P>The Government have effected significant improvements during the past few years in the provision of SAR services on the west coast.  Following a review of the structure and operations of the air sea rescue services, the Government accepted a series of recommendations that from 4 September 1989 a Dauphin helicopter be located at Shannon on a 24 hour response basis throughout the year; that in a separate upgrading the air facility at Finner Camp, County Donegal, be increasingly used for SAR helicopter operations, that Air Corp search and rescue services be augmented by the reintroduction in September 1989 of the Alouette III helicopter for daylight search and rescue missions, and also that the helicopter refuelling sites owned by the Commissioners of Irish Lights at Fanad Head, County Donegal, Blacksod Bay, County Mayo, and Castletownbere, County Cork, be upgraded for 24 hour refuelling of search and rescue helicopters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Other recommendations approved by the Government were the provision, on contract, of a medium range helicopter service, the relocation from Shannon to Finner Camp, County Donegal, of the Dauphin helicopter service provided by the Air Corps on a 24 hour response basis throughout the year once the contract helicopter service had been put in place at Shannon, and also the deployment of a Dauphin helicopter at Cork as soon as practicable, primarily for operations with the <i>LE Eithne</i> but to be located at Cork when not embarked on the ship.</P>
    <P>The Government also approved the acceptance of a tender from Irish helicopters Limited for the provision for an SAR helicopter at Shannon, a Sikorsky S61N, capable of rescuing up to 15 survivors within 200 nautical miles.  This service began operations on 15 July 1991. On 16 July, the Air Corps SAR facility at Shannon relocated to Finner Camp and has been operational from that location since.  Arrangements are being put in place to deploy a Dauphin helicopter to Cork for operations with the <i>LE Eithne.</i> This will also be available for search and rescue operations.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 to date the Air Corp carried out 552 search and rescue missions saving 264 lives.  In addition, the Air Corps carried out 671 air ambulance missions and 12 island relief operations.  I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to all Air Corps personnel involved in these operations for their professionalism and dedication.</P>
    <P>With regard to the incident to which Deputy O'Toole referred, I am not aware of the exact details but I will be very glad to look into the matter and discuss it with him very shortly.  I emphasise, however, in regard to the question of refuelling facilities at Castlebar, these facilities have and will continue to be available there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity <Col N="1073" /> to raise this very important matter with the Minister for Social Welfare in the Dáil tonight.  I would like to ask him to explain the serious anomaly which exists under the present arrangements operated by his Department where the recipients of long term disability benefit are debarred from benefiting from the dependant allowance in respect of members of their family who have attained the age of 18 years and who are still attending second or third level education institutions. Recipients of all other pensions from the Department of Social Welfare are granted this allowance provided their dependants are still attending education institutions up to the age of 21 years.</P>
      <P>While the number of cases involved would not be great, in rectifying this anomaly we would be setting the record straight and ensuring that all those in receipt of social welfare benefits and pensions are treated equally and, in particular, that those in receipt of long term disability benefit are not discriminated against.</P>
      <P>A few minutes ago I listened to the Minister's response to Deputy Browne who raised a similar matter but pious words will butter no bread.  What is needed is immediate action to rectify this anomaly which is creating severe hardship for the unfortunate recipients of long term unemployment benefit.  It is hard enough to rear a family and to pay for second and third level education, and the Department are dragging their feet as far as this very small request is concern.  I ask the Minister to rectify the situation if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1989 only widow pensioners and people on deserted wife's payments and other lone parents with children could receive an increase for children over 18 years.  In those cases increases continued to be payable up to the age of 21 years in respect of children in full-time education.  In all other cases, including pensions, child dependent increases ceased at 18 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989, and over the following two years, the Government progressively <Col N="1074" /> raised the age limit in respect of children of recipients of other pensions and long term social assistance payments.  As a result, from last July, increases for dependent children in full-time education are payable up to age 21 in the case of all pensioners and those on long term social assistance schemes generally.  However, increases in respect of children of recipients of short term payments continue to be payable up to the age of 18 years only. Disability benefit is essentially a short term payment in respect of temporary incapacity for work.  Deputy Sheehan referred to recipients of long term disability benefit.  It is open to any person who has been on disability benefit for a year or more to apply for invalidity pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The invalidity pension is payable at a higher rate than disability benefit, and increases in respect of dependent children in full-time education are payable up to the age of 21 years. Since 1987 the number of recipients of invalidity pension has risen by almost 8,000 or 27 per cent.</P>
      <P>The question of paying increases in respect of dependent children over the age of 18 years to recipients of short term benefits, including disability benefit, would have major financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> Deputy Sheehan seems to have a particular case in mind and if he gives me details I will deal with the matter.  I will not express pious hopes here but I will offer sound advice.  It appears that the case which Deputy Sheehan has in mind is one of a person who should be on invalidity pension instead of a disability <Col N="1076" /> pension.  If he was in receipt of this pension he would qualify for the allowance to which Deputy Sheehan referred.  I take the point which Deputy Sheehan made and I will examine the matter fully.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was remanded on Friday, 16 August, to Mountjoy Prison.  On committal he was attended by one of the prison medical orderlies and was placed under special observation which involves a prisoner being checked every 20 minutes.  The following day, 17 August, the deceased was seen by the prison medical officer who prescribed medication.  He was seen again by the medical officer on Monday, 19 August, and Tuesday, 20 August, and further <Col N="859" /> medication was prescribed.  In addition, on Tuesday, 20 August, he was seen by a psychiatrist from the Forensic Psychiatric Service of the Eastern Health Board which provide psychiatric services for prisons in the Dublin area.  The psychiatrist made arrangements for the prisoner's transfer to the Central Mental Hospital for the afternoon of 21 August, 1991.</P>
    <P>The deceased was last seen alive at 10 a.m. on 21 August.  When checked again at 10.20 a.m. he was found to be in an unconscious state in his cell.  He was removed immediately to hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.</P>
    <P>It is normal procedure when a person is committed to prison to ask him whether he wishes to have his family contacted. In this case, the governor met the prisoner the morning after his committal and asked whether he wanted to have his family contacted but he declined.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently published the Report of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths.  I have accepted the main thrust of the group's recommendations and they will form the basis of future policy on suicide prevention. One of the recommendations in the report refers to the provision of psychiatric services for prisoners.  I have asked the director of Prison Medical Services to review, as a matter of urgency, with the Forensic Psychiatric Service of the Eastern Health Board, the adequacy of existing psychiatric services for prisoners in Dublin and to advise, as necessary, as to improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 47 and 127 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> I want to make clear first in response to the question by Deputy Bell that the only prison in which rioting took place recently was Mountjoy.  I should like at the outset to give a brief account of the sequence of events in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>Just before 5 p.m. on Sunday, 15 September 1991, a group of six prisoners succeeded in breaking out on to the roof of the A Wing of Mountjoy Prison.  They gained access to the attic through a ceiling in the toilet area.  Apart from removing sufficient slates to gain access and to make a foothold, the prisoners were not destructive at that stage.  In order to avoid the risk of serious injury to either staff or prisoners it was decided that, so long as the prisoners were peaceful, action would not be taken immediately to force them from the roof.  Continual efforts were made to persuade the prisoners to come down voluntarily and one of them did so during that night.</P>
    <P>On Monday morning, in view of the fact that the five prisoners were on the roof, a more restrictive regime than normal was operated inside the prison. Considerable unrest built up and in an attempt to defuse the unrest prison management decided to allow prisoners out of their cells for part of the afternoon. The most secure yard in the prison was used for prisoners in the A Wing who wished to go outside.  Shortly after going out a large number of these prisoners attacked staff in the yard.  While staff reinforcements were being collected from other areas of the prison, the prisoners in the yard in question formed a human pyramid against one of the walls and 66 prisoners used the pyramid to gain access to the roof.  Some of them were assisted by &ldquo;ropes&rdquo; made from blankets and clothing which were let down from the roof by the roof top protesters.</P>
    <P>Available staff, some in riot gear, were immediatley directed to the trouble area while the remaining staff concentrated on returning those prisoners who were not involved in the disturbance to their cells. Reinforcements were procured from other prisons and Garda and Army assistance was requisitioned.</P>
    <P>The protesting prisoners proceeded to <Col N="862" /> strip the roof of slates and to use them as missiles against staff, gardaí and Army personnel.  The disturbance was brought under control just after nightfall.  A number of prisoners and staff were injured but fortunately the injuries were relatively minor.</P>
    <P>At no stage did the protesting prisoners make complaints of any real substance and it is not unreasonable to conclude, therefore, that the disturbance simply represented a calculated challenge to good order in the prison and to the institution of State.  It was important that it should be dealt with firmly and quickly, and at this point I should like to compliment prison staff, gardaí and the Army for the tremendous job they did, in the face of real violence, to bring the disturbance under control.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the disturbance I arranged for a review of security at the prison to be carried out.  A report has been submitted to me and I have arranged for a number of recommendations to be implemented without delay, including re-roofing with deck sheeting rather than slates, general security improvements and measures to ensure that adequate water pressure will be available for the future.  Other recommendations are more long term in nature and are still under consideration. Deputies will understand that because of the security content of the report it would be inappropriate to give any more details of it publicly.</P>
    <P>Conditions in Mountjoy Prison are not unreasonable given the age of the prison and the general pressure on prison space. I have never claimed they were perfect and Deputies will be aware of the programme I have been following for steady improvements to the whole prison stock. The fact that by the end of this year over £31 million will have been spent on the prison building programme since 1987 is, I think, a clear indication of the commitment to this task.  Only a week before the disturbance I opened a newly renovated wing of St. Patrick's which incidentally includes in-cell sanitation.  It received the highest praise and work on the complete refurbishment of a further <Col N="863" /> wing of St. Patrick's commenced recently.  This kind of renovation is the prototype for all the old prison buildings. In Mountjoy itself, a new unit, due for completion next June, is being built for prisoners with communicable diseases and the building of a replacement kitchen is about to commence.</P>
    <P>It is as well to bear in mind that it is costing over £500,000 for repairs and ancillary works in Mountjoy Prison as a consequence of the disturbance, money which could have been far more usefully spent on improving conditions for prisoners. Causing large scale destruction of the roof of the prison and serious risk to the life and limb of gardaí, prison staff and members of the Army can scarcely be regarded as a manifestation of genuine concern for the improvement of conditions in Mountjoy.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that, as the House will be aware, the industrial action undertaken by clerical staff in court offices who are members of the Civil and Public Service Union came to an end on 20 November 1991 following negotiations between officials of my Department and the Civil and Public Service Union.</P>
      <P>Members of the CPSU who had been involved in the industrial action in the courts resumed work on 21 November 1991.  The Civil and Public Service Union are balloting their members at the moment on proposals for settlement with a recommendation for acceptance.</P>
      <P>Following the resumption of work the main priority now is to clear the backlog which has built up in the courts during the dispute and the staff in the court offices are co-operating fully to clear the arrears as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the figures requested by Deputy McCartan of the number of court cases, hearings and applications deferred because of the dispute, the position is that these figures are not available and could only be compiled by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.  All efforts now must be directed towards dealing with arrears which have built up particularly in areas such as family law, wards of court and probate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 28 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to amend the law in relation to under-age drinking, either generally or by making regulations under section 40 or an order under section 47 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  This relatively recent Act introduced a wide range of measures which provide a solid framework within which the problem of under-age drinking is being tackled.</P>
      <P>The basic approach behind these measures is to make it as difficult as legislatively feasible for a person under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol or to get possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence, and, where he or she gets possession, to make it possible for the gardaí to seize it.  It would be inappropriate to introduce new measures until there has been more time to assess the impact of the measures introduced by the 1988 Act.  There is reason to believe that the existing measures are beginning to have a positive effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a reply to a question earlier in the month I indicated that the problem of under-age drinking cannot be solved by legislation alone.  The social, cultural and economic factors involved in this problem must be taken into consideration.  It <Col N="866" /> is for this reason that I continue to promote and encourage the idea of community based initiatives and I have encouraged the Garda Síochána to become involved in organising and assisting such local initiatives to deal with alcohol and other substances abuse.  I am informed by the Garda authorities of Garda involvement in 26 existing voluntary local identity card schemes, which have by and large operated successfully. I understand that moves are afoot to establish further schemes in other areas. The indications are that local schemes with a strong community involvement make a positive contribution to tackling under-age drinking and I consider that for the present at least the way forward lies in the development of further such schemes rather than in the introduction of a compulsory, national scheme.</P>
    <P>I still have under consideration the question of whether I should make an order under section 47 of the 1988 Act prohibiting sales of drink by self-service methods in outlets such as supermarkets. In addition to assessing the effect of other measures in the Act to curb under-age drinking, I will have to bear in mind the repercussions, financial and otherwise, of such an order for the outlets concerned.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that I will continue to keep the licensing laws under regular review.</P>

      <P>Arising out of a Supreme Court decision in February 1991 to the effect that it was a matter for the Government or the Minister for Justice to decide on such an application, I set up an advisory committee on 9 September 1991 with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;To advise the Minister for Justice as to whether or not the applicant is suffering from any mental disorder warranting his continued detention in the public and private interests, including the question of whether he would be a potential danger to any member of the public if released, having regard to any relevant information, material, or submissions as may be tendered to or come to the notice of the committee, including any information, material, or submissions tendered by or on behalf of the applicant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The committee completed their consideration of the matter on 30 October 1991 and advised that having regard to the criteria in the terms of reference, the applicant's continued detention is warranted in both the public and private interest.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In each of the five years 1986 to 1990 the number of persons committed to prison for failure to comply with a court order to make payments in discharge of a civil debt was 222, 192, 230, 174 and 161, respectively.  The average period of committal imposed by the courts in such cases in each of the five years referred to was 34 days, 24 days, 22 days, 18 days and 15 days, respectively.  The information sought by the Deputy as to the average period spent in prison by such persons is not readily available and could not be obtained without an inordinate expenditure of staff time.  It should be noted <Col N="870" /> that the average period actually spent in prison by debtors would be less than the average period of committal imposed by the courts because, in practice, some debtors make payment either on committal or shortly after committal.</P>
      <P>The number of persons so committed to prison represents only a small fraction of the total committals to custody in any year and such persons occupy less than 1 per cent of prison spaces on an annualised basis.</P>
      <P>The estimated annual cost of the operation of the prison system per head of the prisoner population in 1990 was approximately £31,000 which includes all infra-structural and staffing costs.  However, the true additional cost for any individual new prisoner coming into the system is only the cost of maintaining him/her, which is approximately £10 per day.  This would include items such as food, bedding, medical supplies, laundry, etc.</P>
      <P>Nobody may be committed to prison merely for non-payment of debt and committal usually takes place only after all other avenues to enforce the debt have been exhausted.  In fact, a person may be committed to prison only for failure to comply with a court order to make payments in discharge of a debt, an order which may be made only after examination of means designed to establish that the person can pay.  Only those with the capacity to make payment and who refuse to do so, rather than those who have no capacity to make payment, may be committed.  The question of introducing a system of attachment of earnings to secure payment of debts is under examination at present and any proposals which may emerge will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>

      <P>All applications to fish for eels are vetted by the relevant regional fisheries board and licences are only issued to persons approved by the boards as part of their statutory functions relating to the management of fisheries.  Existing domestic legislation does not permit a residence requirement to be attached to eel fishing licences and it is doubtful if EC rules would allow such a requirement to be introduced.</P>
      <P>Extensive research has shown that the eel fishing gear authorised for use in this country does not significantly affect other fish life.  The gear is highly selective for eel fishing and occasional capture of other species has little effect on the stocks thereof.</P>

      <P>A number of major reviews have been carried out of the efficiency and effectiveness of the present structures and various recommendations have been made, including the replacement of the existing structures by a single national authority, and the abolition of the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>The boards have come through a very difficult patch in recent years, having to deal with a serious fall in staffing and financial restrictions, the fall-out of the angling licence dispute and the aftermath of the Ballycotton tragedy.</P>
      <P>On assuming office in 1989, I assured the boards that I had no plans at that time to change the structures in place and that remains the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prime focus of any concern at the <Col N="876" /> moment is to ensure that boards have in place adequate safety programmes and also that their finances are managed so that budgets are not exceeded.  I also have in mind that boards activities and costs should be presented in programme form and, in particular, that their development role and impact should be fully catalogued.</P>

The referendum will enable the Saharawi people to choose between independence and integration of the territory with Morocco.</P>
      <P>Ireland is one of the countries which has been asked by the United Nations to contribute personnel to MINURSO.  The Government agreed to do so and 15 Army officers and 15 Garda officers will be participating when the full complement of MINURSO personnel is in place.

Title III, part C of that Act contains a series of Declarations of Congress which express the sense of Congress on a range of issues including Tibet.

      <P>The Dalai Lama is a revered and respected religious and spiritual leader who has consistently advocated non-violence.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A <i>Certificat de Coutume</i> is a document which is required by the civil authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions before a non-national is permitted to marry in the jurisdiction in question.  It is issued by the relevant authorities in the person's own country.  In this country it is issued under my seal as Minister for Foreign Affairs and signed on my behalf by an authorised officer of my Department. The <i>Certificat</i> states that the person is not bound by the ties of a valid marriage under the laws of Ireland and is therefore free to contract a marriage with a named intended spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An applicant for a <i>Certificat de Coutume</i> must complete a questionnaire and <Col N="878" /> provide evidence, normally in the form of a statutory declaration, that he or she is free to marry.  If the applicant has been married previously, but has been divorced abroad subsequent to the coming into force of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorce Act, 1986, then he or she must produce evidence that the application is covered by the terms of that Act and in particular that either the applicant or the previous spouse was domiciled abroad on the date of the institution of the divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the case to which the Deputy refers the applicant obtained a divorce abroad in 1990.  However, it appears that he was domiciled in Ireland at the relevant time. Accordingly his case, judged purely on the basis of his own domicile, would not come under the 1986 Act.  Hence a <i>Certificat de Coutume</i> could not be issued.</P>
    <P>However, I am informed that his former spouse may have been domiciled abroad at the relevant time.  If this were to be confirmed then the case would come under the 1986 Act and the relevant <i>Certificat</i> could be issued.  For this reason my Department are now seeking evidence relating to the domicile of the former spouse.  When such evidence is received the application will be dealt with as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>The Government do not consider that there is a need for the establishment of an elected European Senate as proposed by the Deputy and does not therefore intend to make proposals on the matter at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the European Parliament itself does not support the establishment of a second chamber but favours less far-reaching institutional procedures for establishing links between it and the national parliaments of the member states.</P>
      <P>France has proposed the establishment of a &ldquo;Congress&rdquo; or Conference of Parliaments to be made up of representatives from the European Parliament and national parliaments.  It would be consulted on the major issues facing the Union and would receive reports from the Presidents of the European Council and Commission on the state of the Union.</P>
      <P>The Government will consider this and any other proposals that are tabled and will take a positive view on enhancing the involvement of national parliaments in the work of the Community.</P>

In such a case the vehicle is liable to forfeiture and the importer liable to prosecution.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> The Commissioners decided to refrain from proceedings and offered release of the vehicle on payment of an appropriate compromise sum.  This offer was availed of.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the case the Commissioners see no reason to depart from the decision taken.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned had, only a few months previously, imported and duty-paid a vehicle at Dun Laoghaire he would have been well aware of the correct procedures for clearing vehicles.</P>
    <P>Those procedures include the requirement to declare vehicles at the time of importation.  Prospective importers are informed of that requirement when they inquire at Customs and Excise offices.</P>

      <P>Some £176 million has been paid already this year in premia and headage grants on cattle, sheep, horses and goats. It is proposed to pay a further £88 million before Christmas to bring the total paid in 1991 up to about £254 million in all.</P>
      <P>This £264 million will include some £80 million under the disadvantaged areas scheme which is in excess of the total paid in previous years and the proportion of payments to be made within the year is well up to normal.  Pending consideration of when an increase in payment rates can be put into effect these grants are being paid at the present rates so as to allow payment in 1991 to as many farmers as possible in the disadvantaged areas &mdash; including those that were recently included in the list of disadvantaged areas reclassified as more severely handicapped.</P>
      <P>I am examining possible changes in EC regulations and internal departmental procedures which will allow greater ease of administration and speed up payments in the future.</P>

      <P>The amount of quota available for allocation by the tribunal at present is about 100,000 gallons.  In order to be eligible for an allocation from this reserve producers must have suffered particular hardship under the quota system and their basic quota entitlement, i.e. their milk deliveries in 1983, must have been adversely affected to a significant extent by human illness or animal disease or the accidental destruction of the producer's fodder or dairy herd.  In addition the producers must not have benefited significantly from any previous reserve.</P>

      <P>The EC Prices Package agreed for 1991-92 provided for a reduction of 2 per cent of each member state's milk quota with effect from 1 April 1991. However producers are being compensated for this reduction at the rate of 41 pence per gallon in respect of 1991-92. In addition, provision was made for a Community-funded buy-up scheme under which quotas will be purchased from producers willing to sell, with a view to reallocating the purchased quotas to restore the 2 per cent reduction with effect from 1 April 1992.  Should insufficient quota be purchased under the buy-up scheme to restore the reductions in full, producers will continue to be compensated at the rate of 41 pence per <Col N="897" /> gallon per year in respect of unrestored reductions for a further four-year period.</P>

      <P>After 1992, some changes will occur in the plant health controls relating to trade in plants and plant products between EC member states in order to reflect the process of completing the Internal Market.  The terms of the new plant health regime are still under discussion at Community working party <Col N="901" /> level so it is not possible to give the final position on new procedures.  The general structure of the proposals is that the new system is designed to facilitate free movement of healthy plant material, including forest plants and timber, throughout the Community without special inspection at national boundaries.  More detailed inspections and controls will take place at the point of production.  The system of plant health certificates will be replaced by an alternative system of plant passports. All source nurseries and areas of plant production, such as forests, will be officially registered so that they can be inspected and controlled by the national plant protection service, and be authorised to issue plant passports.</P>
      <P>Recognition is made in the proposal for the designation of protected zones which are free of particular plant diseases and pests.  Member states will be able to require additional specific measures to prevent the introduction of those organisms on material coming into such zones from other member states.</P>
      <P>There will also be provision for checking such material on entry to ensure freedom from the particular pests and diseases.  The zones have not yet been defined but it is intended that the provisions be used by this State to protect its high plant health status, inclusive of forest plantations.  My Department have maintained close liaison with the Northern Ireland ministry in relation to plant health matters of joint interest.  The possibility of a joint protected zone for the whole island would require that both administrations could work out an acceptable procedure.  This matter will, of course, continue to be examined.</P>
      <P>The development of free trade is bound to increase the possibilities of plant-health risk.  However, I am satisfied that a vigilant operation of the new system will minimise risk and provide a continuing safeguard against the introduction of new diseases and pests into this country.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the report in accordance with section 57 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 for the six months ended 30 June 1991 laid before the House on 11 September, 1991.  As of 1 November 1991, a total of 37 blocks are held under petroleum leases, 12 blocks or part blocks are held under petroleum exploration licences and 30 blocks or part blocks are held under licensing options.</P>
      <P>My Department have recently reached agreement with Marathon Petroleum Ireland, Limited, on a new programme of exploration under which a total of seven wells will be drilled by the company in the period 1992 to 1996.  The first of these wells will be drilled in 1992.  During 1991 one exploration well was drilled in the Irish offshore.  At this stage it is not possible to be specific about the number of wells which will be drilled during the coming year as discussions are continuing with companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking a slightly longer view, I am hopeful that a number of initiatives to be taken by the Government in early 1992 will result in intensified exploration activity offshore Ireland in subsequent years.  Comprehensive petroleum taxation legislation will be introduced in the Finance Bill, 1992, which, when enacted, <Col N="906" /> will make good a substantial and longstanding deficiency in the overall regime applicable to hydrocarbons exploration and production offshore Ireland.  We have never brought petroleum taxation measures into law and I believe that uncertainty in this area has militated against Ireland when companies carry out comparative assessments in the context of targeting exploration investment.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the introduction of petroleum taxation legislation, my Department are undertaking a complete review of Ireland's offshore licensing terms.  The purpose of this exercise is to identify and make the changes necessary to ensure that our terms reflect today's circumstances and conditions and meet modern requirements.  I expect to be in a position to announce the new terms in early 1992 also.  Taken together, I believe that both these tax and term initiatives will enhance Ireland's image as an attractive location for hydrocarbons exploration and will encourage a greater level of exploration activity.  Only by stimulating and encouraging greater industry interest in this way can we hope to secure for the Irish people the benefits which would rise from finding and developing further hydrocarbon reserves off our coasts.</P>
    <P>In addition I have already announced a &ldquo;frontier&rdquo; licensing round for mid-1993, concerning acreage in the Erris and Slyne Trough areas.  This is deep-water, challenging acreage for the industry but my Department and I feel it has potential which warrants further investigation.  I am heartened by the level of up-take of a technical report on the Erris and Slyne Trough areas which has recently been published by my Department with a view to assisting the industry in the context of decisions relating to the 1993 round.</P>

      <P>The Christmas bonus was introduced originally in 1980 for those in receipt of social welfare pensions and other long term payments.  It was subsequently extended to include the long term unemployed. The cost of the bonus this year is £28 million, an increase of £2.4 million on last year.  It will be paid during the first week in December and, for the third year running, the bonus will constitute 70 per cent of normal weekly payments. Almost a million people will benefit i.e. 620,000 people on long term social welfare payments and their 360,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>There are currently 27,000 persons in receipt of disability benefit for 15 months or more from my Department.  The cost of extending the Christmas bonus payment to include this category would be £1.3 million and there are no plans at present for such an extension.  However, the long term sick in receipt of invalidity pension are covered for the bonus.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance, which was introduced in 1990, provides an allowance for the first time direct to people caring for elderly and incapacitated pensioners. Carer's allowance cannot be paid in addition to another social welfare or health board weekly payment.</P>
      <P>It has always been my Department's practice to advise recipients of a social welfare payment to claim an alternative qualifying social welfare payment where there is a possibility that they may be better off as a result.  Similarly, recipients will be advised to retain their existing social welfare payment where an alternative payment for which they have applied would put them in a worse off position financially.  The information leaflet on the carer's allowance clearly states that the new allowance may be received instead of an existing payment provided the conditions are satisfied.</P>

      <P>What is commonly referred to as an &ldquo;on-the-spot fine&rdquo; is in fact an invitation to pay an amount by way of fixed penalty as an alternative to being summonsed to court for certain minor infringements of the law.  Apart from certain litter offences which are enforced by local authorities, the only offences which at present attract &ldquo;on-the-spot fines&rdquo; are minor traffic violations i.e. illegal parking and non-display of tax disc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister responsible for the administration of the courts and the Garda Síochána I am naturally concerned to promote measures which would save court time and Garda time spent in court <Col N="914" /> and in enforcing court fines.  I am therefore favourably disposed to the application of &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo; to minor offences of what might be described as a regulatory nature where this is feasible from the legal, policy and practical points of view.  However, the assessment of the feasibility of using &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo; as part of a particular regulatory regime is a matter in the first instance for the Minister with responsibility for the area concerned. Only the Minister with responsibility for and familiar with the operation and the requirements of the regulatory apparatus applying in a particular area would be in a position to make a considered judgment as to the desirability or otherwise of introducing &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo; in that area.  For example, any question of extending fines-on-the-spot to further environmental or traffic offences would be a matter in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>Proposals to apply specific controls to the parking of large vehicles were developed following a meeting between representatives of the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation and my Department on 29 July 1986.  Such controls would be introduced through the application of local traffic and temporary parking rules in the Dublin area initially. The making of such temporary rules is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> I understand that finalisation of the Garda proposals is dependent on submission of a schedule of locations in Dublin where on-street and, possibly off-street parking for such vehicles can be provided.  My Department have no direct input into the process of making temporary rules, prior to their submission for my confirmation, or in the identification of the locations referred to.  The Department did, however, request the three main local authorities in the Dublin area to provide the information for the gardaí.</P>

In such cases, it is for the planning authority, or An Bord Pleanála on appeal, to determine what conditions may need to be attached to the permission to regulate separation from dwellings.  Smaller silage structures may be constructed without planning permission, subject to compliance with conditions laid down in regulations. One of these conditions is that no such structure may be situated within 100 metres of any dwelling house, save with the consent of the owner and the occupier.</P>

    <P>The former Medical Research Council, a statutory body under the responsibility of the Minister for Health, made the 1980 and 1985 grants above towards various cancer research programmes in hospitals.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the Council's successor, the Health Research Board, made grants for similar purposes.  In addition, the EC Europe Against Cancer Programme, which has as its aim the reduction of cancer deaths in Europe by 15 per cent between 1986 and 2000, made a grant of 90,000 ECUs (approximately IR£70,200) to screening for breast cancer research.</P>
    <P>The Mater project received a further 90,000 ECUs in 1991 and also received an allocation of £65,000 from lottery funds.  In addition, the Europe Against Cancer Programme allocated 40,000 ECUs (approximately IR£31,200) in 1991 to a research-based cervical screening programme in UCD, and a further 40,000 ECUs to a study of food and nutrient intake in the EC organised by Nutriscan Ltd.  The Health Research Board's grants for cancer research in 1991 amounted to £85,000.  The Health Research Board's allocation of funding to the various categories of research for 1992 has not as yet been finalised.  However, the board will be providing £143,000 for a new research unit on the molecular biology of leukaemia/aplastic anaemia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> The Irish Cancer Society will be contributing a further £30,000 to the unit, bringing their total funding to £173,000.</P>
    <P>My Department's health promotion unit have included in their draft programme for 1992 a health promotion intervention in the workplace which will focus substantially on cancer prevention. The initial phase of this will involve baseline research in workplace settings.  It is expected that the project will receive financial support under the Europe Against Cancer Programme.</P>

This appointment will considerably improve the availability of orthodontic services in the area and will also enable the board to commence a programme of orthodontic training for clinical dental surgeons from the board's staff.  The board expect to be in a position to bring a further 500 new cases into treatment in 1992.</P>

      <P>The provision of ophthalmic services to eligible persons in the Kerry area is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board.  I have been informed by the board that the number of children, including new cases and recalls, on the waiting list for ophthalmic services in County Kerry is 419 and that the maximum waiting period for services is eight months.  Approximately 50 per cent of children are deemed to be medically urgent and are seen within six weeks.</P>

      <P>My Department have, since the mid 1980's, carried out a detailed annual census of employment levels in the health services.  Since 1988 the census has been taken on 31 December of each year.  The statistical information set out on the following tabular statement is therefore the most proximate available to that requested by the Deputy.  Equivalent data in respect of 1991 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant increase in the numbers of social workers employed in the health boards in 1989 and 1990 arising primarily from the introduction of special budgetary measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> Also the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and related developments such as the Child Care Act, initiated during the current year, have enabled my Department to approve the recruitment of a further significant number of social workers in the health boards.  In the same context I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department have also given approval to the recruitment of a number of additional consultant child psychiatrists and psychologists in 1991.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, be aware that the public voluntary hospitals and homes for the mentally handicapped also employ substantial numbers in these disciplines.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the registrar-general that the birth of the child in question has been registered and that a certified copy of the relevant entry in the Register of Births &mdash; i.e. birth certificate &mdash; may be obtained on payment of the appropriate fee to the local registrar.  I am also informed that when the birth was originally registered information as to the paternity of the child was given to the local registrar and entered in the register. These paternity details are now being challenged by the mother and an amendment to the entry has been requested.</P>
      <P>All amendments to the original entry would require the authority of the registrar-general and his office have been in correspondence with the mother and have also contacted her by phone.  This particular case raises some complex legal issue in relation to the re-registration of non-marital births and it remains to be determined what, if any, amendment may, given the relevant legal constraints, appropriately be made to the existing entry.</P>

      <P>Consideration is being given in the Department of Justice to the inclusion of legislative proposals in a proposed Criminal Justice Bill to implement those recommendations of the committee which are relevant to that Department, for instance, the provision of statutory powers to the Garda to erect barriers on the approach to stadia/arenas, to confiscate alcohol and for the licensing of indoor and outdoor pop concerts where the anticipated attendance exceeds 2,000 and 5,000, respectively.  Consideration is also being given in my Department and the Department of the Environment to the administrative and legislative arrangements which would be required to give effect to the other recommendations contained in the report.

      <P>I am aware of the obstruction at Sneem referred to by the Deputy.  The position is that the specific location is not part of the Kerry Way.  The route on which the obstruction is placed was considered as a possible route for the Kerry Way, when it was being established, but as the obstruction was already in place a detour was made.  The extra distance caused by the detour is insignificant.</P>

The latter deals with the duration of the placement, parental consent, insurance issues, briefing for employers on the aims of the programme, follow-up of trainees during placement, and feedback afterwards from employers and trainees.</P>
      <P>The success of the vocational preparation training programme relies heavily on the co-operation of employers to ensure that placement opportunities are provided for trainees which will provide a useful learning experience in preparing them for the world of work.

      <P>Defence Force regulations provide for the payment to officers of An Fórsa Costanta Aitiúil and An Slua Muirí of allowances towards the cost of providing themselves with certain articles of officers' pattern uniform.</P>
      <P>The rates of uniform allowances take account of the different scales of items of uniform prescribed for the FCA and for An Slua Muirí.  The rates are at present under under review.</P>

      <P>The report of the Gleeson Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces clearly underlined the desirability of examining the whole question of the deployment of personnel of the Permanent Defence Force. It is in this context that a rationalisation of FCA units is being considered by the military authorities.  I will arrange for all interested parties to be consulted before any decisions are implemented arising from the current review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to Directive 90/388/EC on competition in the markets for telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>This directive does not apply to telex, paying, mobile (i.e. cellular) radio telephone and satellite services and does not propose any change in the provision of the public telecommunications (i.e. switched) network.</P>
      <P>The directive liberalises the provision of all other telecommunications services except voice telephones.  It allows for regulations of the liberalised services by way of a licensing of declaration procedure. In the case of circuit or packet switched data services the licensing procedures may, until 31 December 1992, prohibit licensed services providers from offering spare capacity on their leased line networks for simple resale to the public.  The prohibition may, in the case of insufficiently developed circuit or packet switched date services, be extended to 31 December 1995.</P>
      <P>In effect, therefore the Directive liberalises the supply of value added services now and, from either 1 January 1993 or 1 January 1996, as appropriate, the supply of data transmission services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of this Directive will require the making of regulations by me under the European Communities Act, 1972.  I am advised that drafting of these regulations is at an advanced stage and <Col N="959" /> it is hoped to implement the Directive around the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Pending implementation of the Directive I have publicly announced that no action will be taken under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 against providers of value added services.</P>
