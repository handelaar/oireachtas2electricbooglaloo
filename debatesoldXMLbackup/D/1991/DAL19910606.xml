      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 13, 2, 14, and 1.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that (1) business shall be interrupted today at 6.30 p.m. and (2) No. 1 shall be taken at 5 p.m. and shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>May I now ask if the proposal that business be interrupted at 6.30 p.m. this evening is agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that No. 1 be taken at 5 p.m. to be concluded not later than 6.30 p.m., agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the proposes to introduce legislation to give genuine statutory authority to the proposed task force on jobs in view of the fact that if they lack such authority they will be seen simply as a talking shop and the Taoiseach's concern about the unemployment problem will be seen as similar to his discovery of a health crisis in the midst of a general election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but will the Ceann Comhairle not agree that <Col N="1074" /> a task force of this kind will mean nothing unless they have statutory authority and the only body to give them statutory authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Following yesterday's meeting with the trade union representatives, and today's meetings with the other social partners, may I ask the Taoiseach if it is the Government's intention to make time available next week to report back to this House on the outcome of those talks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, if you allow me to complete my question you can then rule on whether it is in order.  Will the Taoiseach not agree that it would be appropriate for this House to debate the proposals the Government are making to deal with this crisis and that it would be appropriate that this take place as soon as possible following his meetings with the various groups?</P>

      <P>I want to refer to something which is customary, that the House debate the outcome of the annual price negotiations in Brussels.  I asked this question of the Taoiseach yesterday and he did not reply.  Will he allow Government time to debate this very serious issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, following the publication of the Kingston report, whether he anticipates that legislation will be necessary in view of the fact that the publication of this report has removed the one remaining pretext in the way of building the Tallaght regional hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to bring to your notice and seek your guidance in relation to the refusal by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to answer questions in my name on 5 June.

In view of the revolutionary thinking on this matter, perhaps the Minister would avail of this opportunity to clarify what precisely is the position.  I understand that he has information which is not very clear to the local authorities, particularly to my local authority.  Perhaps the Minister would at this stage say something to the House on the exact position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to introduce this Bill, it is without question the most significant measure to emerge to date in the Community in the area of consumer protection. Equally, the changes in our national law will have important implications for the legal process as regards product liability.  Thus the position of Irish consumers will be advanced in a very considerable way by providing additional legal redress to those already available under existing tort and contract law.</P>
      <P>While the present measure is aimed primarily at improving the position of the consumer, it should not be construed as being either anti-enterprise or anti-business development.  I would like to remind the House that the requirements of the directive already have to be met by Irish manufacturers in their principal EC markets. Deputies are aware that our manufacturing sector now sells about 70 per cent of its production in markets which are predominantly within the European Community.  In 1990 our exports to other EC countries were valued at nearly £11 billion.  Currently 2,500 manufacturing companies in Ireland &mdash; half the total &mdash; are now engaged in exporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> The remaining 2,500 manufacturing companies continue to rely on the home market for the bulk of their business. Thus it will be in industry's interest that quality assurance and safety standards are maintained at the highest international levels.  The message to industry is that quality production, a desirable end in itself, helps to guard against the risk of damage and liability, and consequently costly claims.</P>
    <P>Any company operating to the highest quality standards in its management and production processes should have little to fear from the new legislation.  The competitive challenges associated with the Single European Market make it imperative that Irish manufacturers employ strict quality control in the production of their goods.  Furthermore, I believe that as many companies as possible should strive to achieve certification by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The attainment of its quality standard is an invaluable tool in marketing Irish products overseas.  At the end of February 1991, 182 Irish companies had been awarded ISO 9000 certificates. It is predicted that there will be 400 before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread consultation with industry, as well as with consumer and trade interests, in the course of preparation of this legislation. Industry should now be very familiar with the aims and requirements of the EC Directive as a result of this and also through seminars arranged over an extended period.  This Bill will give effect in Irish law to European Communities Directive 85/374/EEC on liability for defective products which was adopted on 25 July 1985.  The directive is an integral part of the Community's policy of reducing distortions in trade between member states by the harmonisation of their laws in a wide range of areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill will introduce into Irish law the remedy of damages, in respect of injury to a person or damage to his property, from faulty or defective products, based on the principle of strict or no-fault liability.  This means that where damage is caused to a person or his property <Col N="1083" /> from the use of a defective product, the producer is liable irrespective of whether he is negligent in its manufacture or production.</P>
    <P>The remedies available under this Bill are additional to those in existing tort and contract law.  Liability in tort exists where, because of a defect in a product resulting from its faulty manufacture, damage is caused to a person or his property, but to succeed in such cases at present the plaintiff must prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer, supplier or dealer.  For this reason many potential claims never get to court and the injured party does not even get a hearing.</P>
    <P>The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, incorporates two main implied conditions which are: (i) that the product or goods are of merchantable quality; and (ii) that they are reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are intended.</P>
    <P>A consumer can take an action for damages against the supplier &mdash; generally the retailer &mdash; if the goods are not of the necessary quality and damage or loss ensues.  Of course, if such an action is successful in recovering damages from the supplier, then that supplier can seek indemnity from the person who supplied him with the product or goods.  Taken together, the expanded law of tort and contract law will offer the consumer a comprehensive and complementary set of measures providing wide ranging protection in the area of product liability.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows quite closely the wording and the provisions of the directive. However in transposing the directive into national legislation member states are permitted to exercise a number of options.  These are as follows: first, member states are allowed to include in the scope of implementing legislation primary agricultural products, including fish and game, which have not undergone initial processing; second, member states are allowed to exclude from the defences that are available to the producer the so-called &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; or &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; defence and third, member states <Col N="1084" /> may put a limit on the total liability of a producer for damage resulting from a death or personal injury and caused by identical items with the same defect.  In giving effect to the directive, the Government has decided not to avail of any of these options.  I will explain the reasons for this approach presently.</P>
    <P>The following is a description of the provisions of the Bill.  The definitions of certain of the terms used in the Bill are contained in section 1.  Many of the provisions of this section are self-explanatory but some warrant comment.  Damage within the meaning of this Bill includes death or personal injury or loss of, damage to or destruction of property. Damage to the defective product itself and to property that is used other than for private consumption is excluded.  An injured person is defined as one who has suffered the damage or his personal representative or dependants.  Products covered by the Bill are all movables except primary agricultural products, which include fish products and game, except where these products have undergone processing of an industrial nature. Included are component parts of or raw material used in the manufacture of a finished product even though that final product may be an immovable.  An example of this would be building materials used in the construction of a house, which is immovable.</P>
    <P>Primary agricultural products have been excluded from the legislation because they can be particularly prone to hidden defects caused by environmental factors beyond the control of the producer. These products, however, will still be covered under fault-based tort and contract law.  Where they are processed, the responsibility will reside with the processor, who will be considered as the producer under the terms of this Bill.  It is his responsibility to detect defects and failure to eliminate them could expose him to risk.  It is interesting to note that all member states, with the exception of Luxembourg, which have implemented this directive have excluded primary agricultural products from the scope of their implementing legislation; for us to do <Col N="1085" /> otherwise would be to unfairly disadvantage our own farm sector particularly with regard to insurance costs.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains the principal provision of the Bill, imposing liability for damages in tort on the producer for damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in his product.  A producer is defined in considerable detail and may be (a) the manufacturer of a finished product, (b) the manufacturer of a component or of a raw material used in a finished product, (c) in the case of processed agricultural products, including fish and game, the processor thereof, (d) any person who, by using his name in connection with a product, represents himself as the producer of that product, (e) any person who imports a product into the European Community for business purposes, or (f) in the unlikely event that none of the above mentioned can be identified, any other person in the chain of supply.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this section provides adequate scope for the identification of a liable producer where a defective product has caused damage. Where a defective product is imported into this country from outside the European Community, the importer will be held liable.  A very important safeguard from the point of view of the consumer is that where he has difficulty in identifying the producer and where, simultaneously, the supplier of the defective product fails to identify the manufacturer or his supplier, then that supplier can be held liable.  In my view this represents a powerful incentive to Irish importers, wholesalers and retailers to refrain from dealing in faulty goods, particularly those originating outside the EC.</P>
    <P>In order to discourage the possibility of an excessive number of cases entailing very small claims, section 3, in accordance with the provisions of the directive, provides that damages not exceeding £350 claimed in respect of property are excluded from the provisions of the Bill, but this restriction relates only to damage to property.  Where damages are awarded, only that amount in excess of £350 can be recovered.  To enable this <Col N="1086" /> figure to be updated without the necessity for primary legislation, the Bill will empower me to vary this amount by making an order under this section.  Such an order might be necessary, for example, if the EC Commission decided to revise this minimum amount or a significant movement of exchange rates over a period warranted an adjustment.</P>
    <P>The directive allows members states to provide for a limit on the total liability of a producer resulting from a death or injury caused by identical items with the same defect.  Where a member state decides to avail of this option, the limit cannot be less than 70 million ECUs &mdash; approximately £53 million.  This Bill does not include such a limit.  It is considered that the minimum financial limit is pitched at such a high level that there would be no material difference from that of a system of unlimited liability.</P>
    <P>Section 4 concerns the burden of proof on the injured person.  I indicated in my introduction that in actions under the existing law of tort, the injured person is required to prove negligence on the part of the producer; in actions brought under this legislation the injured person must prove only the damage suffered, the defect in the product and that the defect caused the damage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides the criteria for determining the defectiveness of a product. Under this Bill, a product is defective if it does not provide the safety which a person is entitled to expect taking all circumstances into account.  This criterion must, for example, take into account the way the product was used &mdash; some products are capable of being used for a purpose for which they are clearly not intended.  In such cases a product may well not be considered to be defective. Additionally a product cannot be regarded as defective solely because a better product has subsequently been put into circulation.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Bill makes available to producers a number of defences.  These are contained in section 6.  A producer will not be liable if he can prove any of the following: that <Col N="1087" /> he did not put the product into circulation, that the defect probably did not exist at the time the product was put into circulation by him or that the defect arose afterwards, that the product was not produced for an economic purpose or in the course of business, that the defect was as a direct result of compliance with any legal requirement of national or European Communities law, that in the case of a defect in the raw material or component part the defect was due to the design of the finished product or the instructions given by its manufacturer, or that when the product was put into circulation the state of scientific or technical knowledge was not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered; this is commonly known as the &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; or &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; defence.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the directive does provide for the exclusion of the &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; or &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; defence. This option has not been exercised in the Bill.  The Government are of the view that this defence should be allowed as the cost of insuring against this risk could be extremely high and the effect could well be to stifle innovation in some of our most progressive industries. When development risk is a factor in causing damage, however, a cause of action for liability based on fault may exist.</P>
    <P>There are two very important time limits specified in section 7 of the Bill. First, it stipulates that an action for recovery of damages can be brought within three years of discovery of the damage rather than the date of sustaining such damage.  Second, right of action will expire after a period of ten years from the date on which the actual product which caused the defect was put into circulation by the producer.  If, however, judicial proceedings are pending at the end of this period, liability does not expire but runs until a final decision is made.  If the damage is discovered during the ten-year limitation period but proceedings are not initiated before this period expires, an injured person will have no right of action <Col N="1088" /> subsequently.  I am empowered to make an order under this section in respect of the application of the Statute of Limitations, 1957, to proceedings initiated under this Bill.  The purpose of this is to ensure consistency with the limitation of actions provisions of the Bill amending the Statute of Limitations which is currently before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that joint and several liability will apply where two or more persons are liable for the same damage. In such circumstances an action for damages may be brought against each and every liable person.  This provision is in line with the Civil Liability Act, 1961. It enhances the prospect of the injured person securing full recompense.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that if the injured person is responsible to any degree for the damage the producer should not be liable for all the damages.  Section 9 provides that where any damage is in part due to the fault of the injured person, or to the fault of any person for whom the injured person is responsible, the producer will be enabled to reduce his liability under the rules of contributory negligence as provided for in the Civil Liability Act, 1961.  These rules, however, will not apply where the damage is as a result both of a defect in a product and the act or omission of a third party.</P>
    <P>An important practical measure of protection for the consumer is provided for in section 10.  This section prohibits the limitation or exclusion by the producer of his liability contractually or by any notice or by any other provision.  If a producer does attempt by, for instance, the inclusion of a clause in a contract to limit or exclude his liability in this way, such clause will have no legal effect.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that any existing rights of an injured person are not affected by these provisions.  Rights under contract law or in tort, therefore, are unaffected.  Indeed, there may be instances where an injured party would wish to avail of either of these avenues of redress rather than that being introduced by this Bill.  These new provisions will, therefore, complement existing <Col N="1089" /> domestic law in the area of product liability.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that section 1 of the Courts Act, 1988, which relates to the abolition of juries in certain actions in the High Court shall apply to an action for damages for personal injuries taken under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that this Bill shall not apply to any products put into circulation within the territory of any member state before the commencement of this Bill.  Section 14 provides for the bringing into effect of this Bill.  I intend to introduce these measures immediately this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>These are the provisions of this Bill.  I am confident that it will improve considerably the position of persons injured by defective products.  I also believe that whatever burden this imposes on producers is balanced to a reasonable degree by the defences available and by some other provisions of the Bill.  I am sure that the Bill will, accordingly, be welcomed by Deputies on all sides.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the principle of the Bill.  As the Minister has pointed out, the Bill runs very close to the 1985 EC Directive.  I want to know why it has taken so long for the Minister to introduce this important measure. Ireland is well behind most of its European partners in the implementation of the Directive.  It has come to my notice that businesses have been gearing up for the legislation for a considerable time, even without the implementation of the Directive.  That shows how progressive and modern in outlook our businesses have become and the way they look ahead to the European marketplace and the measures they will require to comply with the Single Market from 1992.  They have shown innovation and forethought in implementing and complying with the various directives much earlier than even the Government.  I am curious to know why the legislation has taken so long to come before us because the Minister's speech put strong emphasis on quality and standards.  A great onus is now put <Col N="1090" /> on businesses and manufacturers to emphasise quality and higher standards if they are to meet the requirements of the Directive and to complete in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The consumer is very discerning, and the consumer should be made aware of the legislation.  I regret that the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not seek to enforce adequately much of the consumer-related legislation put through the House or provide information that would help consumers bring genuine cases under the legislation.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the cost of enforcement of the Bill, as I am, indeed, with regard to other legislation.  The Minister said that certain exclusions have been made to prevent frivolous claims. This country needs a small claims board to deal with small claims that could be brought under the legislation but which might be prohibitive for the consumer because of the costs involved.  The best example of that is to remember that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is inundated with calls &mdash; up to 20,000 annually &mdash; expressing concern about the 1980 Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  Many consumers with complaints do not find their way to court because of the expense involved.  That is anti-consumer and it is not something that we, as a nation, should tolerate. The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not address that issue in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand a few sections in the Bill and the reasons for making certain exemptions.  The Minister went to great lengths to list the various options he had before enshrining the Bill, but I still want to know why agricultural production is exempt.  I am at a loss to understand how a Government that talk about quality and high standards, find that food production and food processing should be exempt from the Bill.  Food safety is becoming such a key issue in the sale of our exports that I find it difficult to comprehend why the Government feel that no legislation is required in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister will take an opportunity to explain why that area is not included in the Bill.  I would be <Col N="1091" /> pleased to hear why agricultural production itself is so prohibitive in terms of insurance costs, as mentioned in the Bill, and why primary production has not been implemented by other European countries, with the exception of Luxembourg. I would be grateful for a more detailed explanation of that matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with manufacturing and processing but various services have been made exempt.  Why were they not included in the Bill?  Is another directive imminent to include consumer services under liability?  The Minister mentioned that consumers might have some difficulty in tracing the manufacturers of products particularly products from mainland Europe.  He indicated that where the manufacturer of a product imported from the EC cannot be traced, the supplier will be liable under the directive. It is welcome that somebody can be held liable from the point of view of the consumer.  Is that a correct interpretation of the position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I will clarify the position in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the cost of enforcing EC Directives.  The consumer must have greater access to justice and that is why I advocate the setting up of a small claims court.  It would be ridiculous to provide legislation so that consumers can take a case in respect of defective products, if the cost of doing so would be prohibitive.  Greater access to justice is essential if the provisions of this Bill are to be implemented.  Other Acts are not being enforced because of the cost involved.</P>
      <P>We must achieve a balance between frivolous claims which may cause damage to businesses and well-founded claims. The Minister in his speech pointed to this problem.  There is a danger that people with the financial means will bring frivolous claims which will damage businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to development risks and to the fact that people testing a new product might run into difficulties <Col N="1092" /> with discerning consumers in relation to defective products.  This is an important issue.  It will be difficult to get the balance right in relation to people establishing new businesses if at the beginning they do not have the appropriate manufacturing techniques or the correct inputs into the manufactured product and when established produce a fine product, having tested the market and experimented over a period.  Following the passage of this legislation there will be more emphasis on feasibility studies and on research and development.  It will take longer for a product to come on the market because of the risks for a company who could be put out of business under this directive if they do not get the balance correct in manufacturing.  Exempting the first £350 of claims from the consumer's point of view will be of assistance in developing new products.  That will not create any great difficulties in relation to new products on the market.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the cost of product liability insurance.  Our insurance cover is the most expensive in Europe.  I am concerned that product liability insurance costs do not damage our export potential.  Businesses have difficulties in getting product liability insurance at a competitive rate.  Those involved in engineering, construction and in perishable goods have great difficulty in getting a quotation.  Because of our peripheral location and our need to transport products as cheaply as possible to the mainland of Europe, we should ensure that nothing in this directive inhibits businesses from getting the least expensive product liability insurance. Will the Minister comment on the problems that may arise in relation to product liability insurance due to the implementation of this directive?</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives a very loose interpretation of the matters inherent in the definition of a defective product.  A court may have a hard time defining a defective product.  The definition should be tightened up to ensure that consumers do not make frivolous claims under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 producers will be exonerated from liability on certain <Col N="1093" /> specified grounds.  The words &ldquo;deliberate intent&rdquo; on the part of the producer should be included in this section.  A producer does not want to manufacture a defective product because his livelihood depends on ensuring that the highest standards are maintained.  We should look at the possibility of including words that would indicate fraudulent or deliberate intent on the part of the producer.  A manufacturer should not be forced into court without a clear indication of a deliberate attempt to produce a defective product, or an indication that his manufacturing processes were deliberately not up to scratch.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had consulted widely throughout industry on this Bill. This could not be further from the truth. I am appalled at the general lack of consultation by the Government in relation to consumer legislation.  The Competition Bill is another example of the House being asked to rush through legislation in a matter of a couple of weeks without knowledge of the report of the Fair Trade Commission and without having had the opportunity to fully discuss the issues with the various interested parties.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Fair Trade Commissioner have not had any consultation in regard to this directive or the Competition Bill.  That is very disturbing and shows that the Government have difficulty in ensuring enforcement of the legislation. While we are very happy to pass legislation in this House, we seem to have difficulties about the compliance costs and the enforcement procedures necessary to ensure that consumers are aware of their rights and have the opportunity in a less expensive way in a small claims court to bring cases in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>The first person to consult if one were pro-consumer in relation to this legislation is a person who has experience of dealing with consumers and various aspects of legislation in relation to consumers, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  The Minister's attitude is not helpful and I hope it is <Col N="1094" /> not one which will prevail in relation to further directives brought before this House in future.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of the legislation. As I said, the business world have already geared themselves for the implementation of this directive.  The Government have been one of the last members of the European Community to implement this legislation.  It is a welcome development that the onus in civil law is on the producer to show that the product is up to the highest quality and standard of production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Where has this Bill been all these years?  The EC issued the directive for this measure in 1985 and we are only introducing it now.  Indeed, if the EC had not issued a directive to bring in this reforming measure we would not be debating it this morning.  We are doing it, not because we want to do it, not because the Minister or the Government believe in it, but because we have been ordered by Europe to introduce it.  It is a poor reflection on us all that most of the reforming legislation we seem to be introducing is not from our own resources but because the EC has issued directives compelling us to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry, other Members and I spent all day yesterday talking about the Competition Bill, in particular about Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. We introduced the Competition Bill because we were directed to do so by the EC Commission.  It is not as if we did not have our own resources to enable us to bring in reforming legislation.  We spend quite a lot of our resources on the Law Reform Commission, which over the years has done excellent work in preparing many worthwhile reports, the overwhelming majority of which are shelved and never see the light of day.  Working in the Law Reform Commission must be one of the most frustrating jobs anyone ever had, even more frustrating than the job of a politician on occasions. They put in tremendous work, which is clear from the many reports they introduced over the years which they know in their hearts the Government will not <Col N="1095" /> bother about.  That is a great pity because much of our legislation is in urgent need of reform.</P>
    <P>We are here today because of the EC directive; nonetheless it is welcome as improving the position of the consumer. The net effect of the Bill is to render the manufacturer of a product liable under law for any damage or loss arising from a defect in his product, whether or not the defect arises from negligence on the part of the producer.  The delay in bringing in this Bill has been a very serious matter for a group of people who have suffered grievously and continue to suffer.  I refer to unfortunate haemophiliacs who developed AIDS as a result of having been injected with infected blood plasma.  I should declare my interest by saying that I act as solicitor for many of those unfortunate people, some of whom have already died while others are in a very serious condition with a very low life expectancy.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 73 haemophiliacs in Ireland facing the possibility of long, difficult and expensive legal proceedings to try to secure a just settlement of their claim for compensation. The main reason that those proceedings will be complex &mdash; if they go ahead &mdash; is that their case will rest on the old law before the introduction of the Bill which means that the onus of proof is on the haemophiliacs to try to establish that there was negligence on the part of those agencies who supplied them with the contaminated blood products.  The fact that the blood which gave them AIDS was contaminated is not in contention but the argument has always been that the suppliers cannot be seen as negligent because so little was known about AIDS. While this is a highly debatable argument it is clear that if haemophiliacs were in a position to pursue damages under this legislation they would not have to establish anything more than that the blood was contaminated and, therefore, a defective product.  The delay in bringing in this Bill represents a potentially very serious matter for that unfortunate group <Col N="1096" /> of people.  Do we not have a responsibility in this House to haemophiliacs suffering from AIDS through no fault of theirs but as a result of a medical product injected by way of treatment?  Do the Minister and the Government have a responsibility to deal with their position in this legislation?  We could do that by introducing a retrospective element to this legislation.  Would it be all that unreasonable to say that the benefits of this legislation should be antedated to 25 July 1981, the date when the directive was adopted by the EC?  That would be humane and reasonable.  I ask the Minister to agree to do that and to seek Government approval for retrospection.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the agency of the Minister for Health, are very much involved in this issue, because the Minister may have a potential liability in that regard.  Nonetheless, it is a problem that has arisen, not alone in Ireland but all round the world, and different Governments have reacted to the very real human problem it presents in different ways.</P>
    <P>You will recall, a Cheann Comhairle, that quite recently in the United Kingdom, for example, the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, ensured that a sum of £10 million would be made available to settle the claims made by haemophiliacs. It was suggested to the Minister for Health that he should adopt a similar <i>pro rata</i> approach, but I am sorry to say that this was fobbed off and long fingered with the excuse that other people, hospitals or the Blood Transfusion Board might be held liable.  No realistic response has been forthcoming from the Minister to the haemophiliacs and their families &mdash; some of whom have been bereaved &mdash; who find themselves in a tragic situation.  Why should our response be any less humane than the response of Mr. John Major in the United Kingdom and the response given in various other countries?</P>
    <P>If the Government had implemented this legislation in 1985, as they had been directed to do, and had met their obligations under EC law to which they pay great attention or lip-service as the case <Col N="1097" /> may be, then the haemophiliacs would find themselves in a different position and their claim for damages would have been made on a different basis.  It must be very hard for them and their families to see this legislation being introduced in 1991, given that the Government were directed to introduce it in 1985, knowing what the effect of that delay may be for themselves and their families.  They have been shabbily treated by the Department of Health.  They have been misled and mistreated in attempting to secure a fair settlement.  I put it to the Minister that the spirit of the Bill is being dishonoured by the Government even before it becomes law.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker made reference to the glib and easy practice which we seem to have adopted in this House of bringing in legislation to confer additional rights on people who do not have the capacity to exercise those rights. The legal aid service is a disgrace and it is so underfunded as to be laughable. What benefit is to be gained in conferring new rights on people who cannot afford to retain lawyers or call in the expertise required to exercise these new rights? One without the other is useless.  I suggest to the Minister that we may as well not bother conferring new rights on people unless at the same time we provide them with the means to exercise those rights. We also spoke about this matter yesterday on the Competition Bill, which confers new rights on people in respect of anti-competitive practices.  People were told that new rights were being conferred on them and that they would be allowed seek injunctions in the High Court, but how many people will find themselves in a position to do this?</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to confer new rights in the Liability for Defective Products Bill and in the Competition Bill, but we have to go further and provide the means to allow ordinary people who cannot afford to avail of the services of expert lawyers to exercise these rights.</P>
    <P>It would be nice to hear the Minister say today that he recognises this fact and that he is going to do something about <Col N="1098" /> the free legal aid service.  That was promised a long time ago.  The House will recall that during the course of the debate on Committee Stage of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, which introduced remarkable reforms in the area of family law, I suggested to Deputy Collins, then Minister for Justice, that it was all very fine to give new rights to spouses in an effort to give them some hope that their family affairs would be put in order and asked if he was going to do something about the free legal aid service.  He replied &mdash; he repeated this later on television &mdash; that he recognised there was an urgent need to do something and said that he was going to make a special attempt in Cabinet to secure improvements, but nothing has happened. Indeed, the position has got worse.  One cannot get an appointment with the community law officers, who are doing magnificent work.  It is beyond belief that they are coping, given the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>This is an uncaring Government. They seem to have the idea that it is sufficient to bring in judicial separation legislation, a Competition Bill and a Liability for Defective Products Bill to confirm new rights and that they do not have to do anything more, but it is not a bit like that.  The old adage of justice being open to everybody, like the Ritz Hotel, is as true today as when it was first said.  People are not in a position to call in expertise to exercise the new rights being given to them in this legislation. We may as well not bother if we are not going to do something about the legal aid service.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a number of other matters, but they are more appropriate to the Committee Stage debate.  I am greatly concerned about haemophiliacs and I would like to know if the Minister is going to do anything to help them, having regard to the fact that if this legislation had been implemented on time it would have made all the difference to them.  The Minister stated in his contribution: &ldquo;for this reason many potential claims never get to court and the injured party does not even get a hearing&rdquo;.  The <Col N="1099" /> people the Minister is referring to are the haemophiliacs.  I am not saying that they will not be successful under the existing law; they might, but the difficulties facing them are immense.  The cost involved is also immense.  They needed this Bill in 1985 and it would have made all the difference even in 1986 or 1987.  Do they not have a grievance when they see a measure which the Government were ordered to implement in 1985 only being introduced in 1991?  This is to the detriment of the weakest, sickest, most ill and most vulnerable section of the community.  They find themselves in a desperate position because of the delay in introducing this important legislation. The Minister will perform a very signal service in the interests of fairness, justice and humanity if he agrees to accept the amendment that I will propose on Committee Stage which would result in the Bill being applied retrospectively to enable haemophiliacs to avail of its benefits as though it had been adopted in 1985.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I compliment the Minister for bringing this important legislation before the House.  It is very comprehensive and will affect consumers, retailers and manufacturers.  It will introduce the principle of no fault liability into Irish law and will impose liability on the producer of a defective product or component irrespective of whether any negligence was entailed in the manufacture of that product or component.  This principle is different from fault liability where the negligence of the producer of the defective product must be proven.  Therefore, the Bill will supplement the existing law and marks an important innovation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contract law, in particular section 14 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, provides that the goods must be of merchantable quality and reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are intended.  The EC Directive 85/374 allows member states a few options: first, member states are allowed to include in the scope of national legislation primary <Col N="1100" /> agricultural products and game.  The Bill before the House today does not avail of this option and therefore the legislation will not apply to such products.  Second, member states may exclude from the defences which are allowed to the producer the so-called state of the art defence, that is, the producer would not be liable for damages if he or she could prove that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time the product was put into circulation was not such to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered.  The Bill does not avail of this option either and therefore that defence is available to the producers.</P>
    <P>Product liability requires legislative protection for the consumer.  Equally, it involves an attitude of mind by companies which goes far beyond the legal requirements and sees the need to produce quality, defect free products as a fundamental part of what successful business is all about.  The issue of product liability is extremely important in itself, but it must be seen in the wider context where a whole new range of responsibilities and requirements must be addressed following the completion of the Single Market.  Irish companies in the post-1992 Single Market will find, as indeed they are finding at present, accelerating competition in the market place.  The Single Market provides vast opportunities for Irish companies, but we must not forget that there are also vast opportunities for the companies within the other member states.  In order to survive Irish firms must adopt the characteristics of world class manufacturing companies.  This means a total focus on the customer, identifying the customers' needs and developing products and services to fulfil those needs. That is what it is all about.  Of course, most of the successful Irish companies are customer oriented and this is reflected in particular in their commitment to quality, for which the Irish product is well known worldwide.</P>
    <P>Irish companies have also developed a keen sense of customer service and a greater awareness of the need to invest in marketing and research.  But every Irish company must seek to reach the highest <Col N="1101" /> standards of quality if we expect to win business in a marketplace that is becoming more and more competitive everyday. Agencies like the Irish Goods Council will tell you that these standards will have to be the norm and not the exception.  Irish firms face enormous challenges but will have enormous opportunities in the Single Market.  In just one part of that market, Ireland, the new scope of Irish industry is estimated to be worth over £1.2 billion a year.  To get their business the customer must be the beginning and end of the company's entire operation.</P>
    <P>Some have argued that product liability might result in insurance companies increasing their standard rates of product liability cover.  In my view this argument cannot be justified.  Similar legislation has been introduced in other European countries and the net result of this legislation has been to enhance the quality of the product.  In this situation I cannot see that striving for better quality should increase insurance liability or insurance premia. Therefore, I call on the Minister here today to make sure that the legislation is tight enough to ensure that we will not see an increase in insurance premia.  We all remember the commitments that the insurance industry gave to every individual Member of this House when we were told that if we abolished the jury system we would see at least a stability in the cost of insurance and a better deal for young drivers.  What has happened? We have seen an escalation of premia and it is even more difficult for young drivers to get insurance at a reasonable cost today.</P>
    <P>The Bill also represents a major step forward in clearly defining the rights of the retailer and the consumer.  Many of us have had the experience of purchasing a faulty product and, despite the best efforts of the retailer to seek compensation, either he or the consumer is left with the inferior article.  In such a situation both the consumer and the retailer are left at the mercy of agents, distributors and importers.  It is not that retailers and consumers have no rights in this area, but the fact is that until now <Col N="1102" /> they had been covered only in very scattered legislation.  Some of it is very old and dates back over 50 years.  This Bill builds on the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act and brings together in a clear, concise and simple way the rights of consumers and indeed of retailers.</P>
    <P>The importation of goods from outside the European Community is quite considerable. These include goods from low cost countries in the Far East where it can be difficult to identify the manufacturer and it is even more difficult to make them liable for defective products. Therefore, I particularly welcome the provision in the Bill which makes the importer of the goods into the member state liable for damage caused as defined in the Bill.  This should ensure that in future importers will have to pay a great deal of attention to the quality of the products they are importing, and indeed the safety standards of the product, because they will be liable for damage caused by that product.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this Bill is a major event and therefore I am glad to note that the Minister in his wisdom has had various seminars organised throughout the country to brief the industry on the implications and advantages of this Bill.  I compliment the Minister on his foresight in organising these seminars.  They are of tremendous benefit to those in industry, who will be well aware now of the implications of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is a major advance in co-ordinating consumer legislation. Having said that, if it is found that we need to achieve further Community harmonisation, I would urge the Government strongly to pursue such a course at the Council of Ministers.  This Bill has implications for manufacturers, retailers and consumers.  It is a major piece of legislation.  It will encourage manufacturers to provide quality products.  For consumers it will define their rights and for retailers it will clarify the legal position.</P>
    <P>The clear message to the insurance industry from retailers, consumers, manufacturers and the Government is that we will not tolerate an increase in <Col N="1103" /> premia following the passage of this legislation. Similar legislation has been implemented in other European countries where there has been no increase in premia.  We cannot have a repeat of the situation where the insurance industry told both Houses that if we abolished juries we would see at least a stabilisation of insurance premia.</P>
    <P>On that note of caution I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which gives effect in our legislation to a 1985 EC Directive.  It is another measure which aims to bring Irish law in this area into line with European legislation and administrative provisions.  The main effect of the Bill will be to remove the onus of proof of negligence from the consumer and the plaintiff and require only proof that damage was caused by a faulty product.  Most of us recognised the desirability of this sometime ago and there must be some criticism of ourselves in that we did not take action earlier on our own account.</P>
      <P>That negligence must no longer be proved puts a very desirable form of pressure on manufacturers of movable goods to ensure that their products are up to standard and are of such quality that they will not attract claims.  The Bill will demand a high degree of vigilance on the part of the manufacturer.  This is to be welcomed.  Low standards should not be accepted anywhere.  One of the complaints I have voiced over the years is that Irish people are much too slow to complain whether in restaurants or in respect of the purchase of goods with which we find fault.  This unwillingness to complain has been a contributory factor in some areas where standards have not improved.  In America there is pride in the level of service offered.  People consider the quality of service they give to be an important part of the quality of life they lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It sometimes appears that when a complaint is taken to the manufacturer of a faulty product it is resented and it is made extremely difficult for the complainant to <Col N="1104" /> get satisfaction.  It should be the norm that if a customer finds fault with a product the manufacturer and retailer will do everything to ensure that the complaint is met fairly and the inconvenience and damage to reputation put right as soon as possible.  In more serious cases, of course, there may be resort to the courts for damages.  I am not referring to the frivolous and spurious claims which are all too common in the courts at present. Every manufacturer and commercial undertaking should be conscious of the quality of their products and should likewise to be concerned to satisfy the customer. The consumer is entitled to know that the highest possible standards are being upheld.</P>
    <P>In one part of this Bill the Minister has demonstrated a great degree of shortsightedness. There is also a degree of conflict between the directive and the Bill.  The EC Directive as cited in the Bill states:</P>
    <P>Whereas liability without fault should apply only to movables which have been industrially produced; whereas, as a result, it is appropriate to exclude liability for agricultural products and game, except where they have undergone a processing of an industrial nature which could cause a defect in these products; </P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech stated:</P>
    <P>Primary agriculture products have been excluded from the legislation because they can be particularly prone to hidden defects caused by environmental factors beyond the control of the producer.  These products however will still be covered under fault-based tort and contract law. </P>
    <P>The Minister has gone further by including fish products, which are not included in the directive.  I do not know why he felt it necessary to go beyond the products listed in the directive.  Perhaps he will explain.  Section 2 (2) (c) states:</P>
    <P>In the case of the products of the soil, of stock-farming and of fisheries and game.... </P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <P>I refer the Deputy to Article 2 of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather then it is included in the directive.  I cannot understand why any of them is included.  The Minister justified it in his speech when he stated:</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that all members states, with the exception of Luxembourg, which have implemented this directive have excluded primary agricultural products from the scope of their implementing legislation; for us to do otherwise would be to unfairly disadvantage our own farm sector particularly with regard to insurance costs. </P>
      <P>I do not accept that statement.  We, more than any other country in Europe, depend on the export of agricultural and fish products to mainland Europe.  It would be a mistake, therefore, for us to give a signal that there is some doubt about their quality, particularly when there is some shadow over agri-business at the moment.  It is significant that Luxembourg, another small country that is quality conscious and trying to export agricultural products to the rest of Europe, deliberately included agricultural products and made them liable to the same controls as normal manufactured or movable goods.  We have had some difficulty in establishing markets in Europe.  This would be an ideal opportunity for the Minister to make a major speech outside this House saying even though we are entitled to exclude our agricultural products that because we have faith in their quality, at all stages from the land to the supermarket shelf, we are underlining that by saying that these products will come within the scope of this legislation.  It would have been a major step for the Minister to take to show that we have that confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat some of the points I made last night on the other Bill.  If we are to bring the numbers of unemployed down to a manageable level it is important that we export goods.  It is extremely important also that those goods be of the highest quality.  There must be an <Col N="1106" /> acceptance by customers in mainland Europe of all the quality goods we produce, whether they are floppy discs or tinned salmon.  Whatever we produce here must bear the hallmark of quality. That is the only way we can overcome the disadvantage of transport costs.  That must be backed by after sales service.  I would like to interpret this Bill as being a contribution towards that.  Our exports must also be backed by intensive professional marketing and extensive advertising campaigns.  They are the components that must be present if we are to win a market share in Europe.  It is not impossible.  There are plenty of examples.  I know there is concern at the tendency of major conglomerates to promote a brand image for one product and squeeze all other products off the market.  However, there is a market there at the top end in every country in the world for extremely high quality products at premium prices provided the country promoting them, the industry promoting them and the firms producing them, can stand over that quality, that they are backed up by an impeccable after sales service, that they are properly marketed and packaged and that an advertising campaign to draw consumers' attention to them is present as well.  If those four components are there then a share in the top end of the market can be won for any Irish product, but not if any one of those four components is missing.</P>
    <P>Excluding agriculture and fish products from this Bill is a serious mistake.  It will not enhance the reputation of Irish products and will not send the right signal to Europe.  I do not want to exaggerate the problem by suggesting that people will say that since we did not include these products something must be wrong. As the Minister has said, only one country, Luxembourg, has not excluded them. It would seem the reverse is true: that by not excluding them we will be driving home the message that we will settle for nothing less than the very top standards for every product we produce.  I do not accept the Minister's argument that environmental damage is beyond the control of the producers.  That is true, but it is <Col N="1107" /> true of other products as well.  However, such products are not nearly as important to this country as agricultural products. Given that we have a good clean food sector, I cannot understand why the Minister has decided to give this derogation to agricultural products.  Most of our farmers and fishermen have nothing at all to hide and would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that Irish agriculture normally operates to the very highest standards.  Also it is to the benefit of all producers and manufacturers when clear standards and guidelines are laid down.  They know it is good for business. Consumers are also conscious of the need for legislation in this area.  The Bill is quite well balanced and facilitates the protection of consumers while not providing a too rigid framework for producers and manufacturers to operate within.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides a number of defences for the manufacturer.  It is very important that legislation in this area reflects and achieves the purpose for which it is intended and the Bill before us seems to comply with that.</P>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Taylor is an interesting one which the Minister should look at before Committee Stage.  He will obviously have to have consultations with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.  I think if the Department of Finance comes into it we will not see the amendment that Deputy Taylor wants being accepted by the Government.  The haemophiliacs are a very small body of people who, through absolutely no fault of their own and because of the complexity of the law, have not been able to get compensation for what was an extremely serious and traumatic experience. Some have already died and many of the remainder have a very short life expectancy.  If this Bill could be amended to facilitate their case coming before the courts then there would be widespread appreciation, not just in this House but in the community, of the Government's contribution towards redressing the wrong which these haemophiliacs have <Col N="1108" /> suffered over the past seven or eight years.</P>

      <P>I, too, appreciate the position Deputy McCartan finds himself in.  I realise he was here at the outset and I will keep my comments relatively brief in order that he can get in at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill for three basic reasons.  First, as has been commented on by the last speaker, Ireland has developed over the last 25 or 30 years as a consumer society, but we have never developed the consciousness of consumer rights that exists elsewhere.  This Bill will help to awaken such consciousness.  I do not believe for a moment that it is possible to create a consciousness by law, but I do think the Bill will be helpful in that <Col N="1109" /> it will again help to emphasise that consumers in our society have some rights. Let us hope it will encourage consumers to exercise those rights.  Deputy Barry made the very valid point that we do not complain enough.  We complain a good deal about public services and political services but, oddly enough, when the consumer buys a product and the product does not live up to expectations or the claims made by the producer or distributor, all too often we live with the loss and simply write the issue off.  It is time the Irish people began to assert their rights as consumers, and to the extent that the Bill will help to put consumerism back on the agenda it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>When it comes to consumer relations there is a type of consumer apartheid which is all too evident on the part of suppliers and frequently on the part of shops and distributors.  The Bill puts all consumers on an equal footing and for that reason it is again very welcome.  To point out what I mean by this, let me say that a few years back I had a complaint from a constituent who received a wrong delivery of an oil product from one of the major distributors.  An honest mistake had occurred.  I telephoned a senior person in the distribution company and within a matter of hours the matter was rectified.  Shortly afterwards I came across an identical case where a consumer who had not been in a position to put pressure had a very similar problem with the same company and the consumer was left over a long winter weekend and into the early part of the following week before the oil product was replaced. Without straining our memories we can all recall only two short years ago oil consumers all over this country suffering loss because of poor quality oil issued to consumers in winter.  They had no protection other than their capacity to lobby through TDs or get in touch with the company.  In the sense that the apartheid attitude to consumers that has existed, differentiating between consumers who have some clout and consumers who are less powerful, will be wiped away by this Bill, it again is welcome.</P>
    <P>A third reason for welcoming the Bill <Col N="1110" /> is that at long last it introduces into Irish law EC Directive 85/374 of July 1985.  It reflects no credit on us that we are one of the last member states to give legislative teeth to that directive.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was due to come into effect by July 1988, so we are a bit late; nonetheless it is welcome that finally we are giving teeth to it.</P>
    <P>My welcome for the Bill is not without some questions.  The Bill still requires an aggrieved consumer to go into court. While it lessens the burden of proof on the consumer &mdash; that is the main element in the Bill &mdash; by introducing the concept of strict no fault liability, the consumer still has to face the intimidating and potentially expensive majesty of the courtroom.  Would it not be better were we to have a small claims court for the settling of claims under, say, £1,000 or £2,000?  Many of the claims I see coming up under this legislation would fall into that category and I feel it would be wise and helpful were we to give consideration to moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>The second problem I have with the Bill is that it fails to identify a role for the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  I listened yesterday to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, giving an explanation for the exclusion of a role for the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in the Competition Bill.  I supported the Minister subsequently in the vote.  But I have to say, to put it on the record, that I found his explanation that he did not wish to &ldquo;burden the Director&rdquo; less than convincing when the Director's specific wish to be burdened was clearly signalled recently at a number of public fora.  It would be no bad thing if we were to incorporate a specific role in this Bill for the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  I accept the point made from time to time that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has inadequate resources, but we should look at the question of improving his resources if we consider the possibility of expanding his burden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not likely.  The third problem I have with the Bill is that I cannot identify clearly where the right of action exists on imported goods.  Section 2 (2) (e) of the Bill provides that &ldquo;producer&rdquo; means: &ldquo;any person who has imported the product into a Member State from a place outside the European Communities in order, in the course of any business of his, to supply it to another.&rdquo;  I am sure there is a simple answer to this, but I would like some clarification as to where the right of action exists on imported goods.  Will it lie in the Irish courts and will the importer and producer automatically have to attend, or will the aggrieved consumer have to seek redress elsewhere &mdash; for example at the European Courts?</P>
      <P>There is a related issue here in that goods can be imported into the EC by importers in, say, Germany, France or wherever outside this country and they can be distributed here by agents.  For the purposes of this Bill will the agents of the importer be importers into this country and will those agents then be liable?  I look forward to the Minister's response on these points.  They are not particularly burdensome and I hope he will respond when he comes to reply to Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of any shortcomings the Bill may have, it is very welcome legislation. In a sense it is the beginning of a real consumers' charter in this country.  While our present sale of goods legislation gives certain protection, it puts the onus of proof on the consumer.  This Bill provides a different focus from that Act and it helps to lessen that burden of proof.  We are all familiar with the horror stories of product liability, the horrific thalidomide case and the years of grinding battle the parents of damaged children had to endure before they achieved some semblance of justice.  We are all conscious here too of the battle for compensation for HIV infected haemophiliacs, an issue made more complex by the fact that a State agency as well as private companies <Col N="1112" /> are involved.  While I know many people in this country would suggest we should make the compensation payable and be done with it, the present impasse raises the problem of whether the major companies and at least one major multinational who have an involvement in this case are to be let off the hook.  That is an issue which we on all sides of this House wish to see resolved at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Every day there are less dramatic cases where defective products cause injury or property damage and in effect because of the difficulties and complexities of existing law which is so tilted against the consumer, consumers simply give up and suffer the loss or injury.  We all know of many such cases.  I remember a short time back a major radio programme dealing with complaints about Zanussi dishwashers and a spokesperson from the distributors and the company saying these were only very isolated affairs.  I would have believed in the distributor except for the fact that the following night my next door neighbour and good friend suffered a major fire in the house.  The house was very badly damaged.  The product was working throughout the night and only good luck prevented loss of life.  The problem was a wiring defect which turned out to be very common in that model which was well known to the distributor at the time but which was in effect played down in all the publicity.  My neighbour friend had to enter into a burdensome round of negotiations, first with his insurance company and then his insurance company sought to lay some blame on the distributor.  The distributor presented a complicated issue because he had changed and there followed a tortuous six or seven months before justice was done in this case.  My belief is that the existence of this law will make producers and their agents far less likely to try to shift their responsibilities and to that extent this is welcome legislation.</P>
    <P>I had personal experience when dealing, on behalf of another constituent, with an Irish manufacturer of a shower unit which had the endearing habit of decanting water everywhere but in the <Col N="1113" /> shower.  The manufacturer blamed the plumbers, the plumbers blamed the manufacturers and my constituent was left to mop up the mess on each and every occasion that somebody switched on this product in the sequence other than the secret sequence which it reacted to. Nobody paid damage in this case and the consumer was left to foot the bill.  This legislation would greatly help in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, the main effect of this Bill is to introduce into Irish law the principle of strict no fault liability. This will impose liability on the producer of a defective product or a component, irrespective of whether any negligence was intended in the manufacture of that product or component.  The principle of strict liability is, as the Minister has said, different from fault liability, in which the negligence of the producer of the defective product must be proven.  The Bill will supplement, therefore, existing laws, particularly the existing law of contract and tort, which is far less consumer friendly. That is a welcome change.</P>
    <P>Now that we have introduced the concept of strict no fault liability into Irish law in this limited area I suggest we have a look at where that concept can be introduced into other parts of consumer relations &mdash; for example, the delivery of services, medical services, dental services, optical services, a whole range of services in specialist areas not just in the medical area but in the financial field. People suffer loss because of services in that area also and they have far greater difficulties, given the sort of mafia operation that the so-called liberal professions operate under &mdash; for example, the legal profession.  Given the way they protect each other, perhaps we should start to look at whether the application of this principle outside products into services has something to recommend it.  The remedy introduced by the Bill is the remedy of damages in respect of injury to a person or damage to his property from faulty or defective products.  That is an excellent way of progressing.  If damage is caused to the person or to the property from use of the defective <Col N="1114" /> product, the producer is liable, irrespective of whether he was negligent in the manufacture of the product.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other points which were made during the course of contributions which were interesting and valid.  In particular the point was made by Deputy Cullimore, and reflected by Deputy Barry, about insurance.  I would have one fear that insurance companies, who are well known and are notorious for milking the Irish public, would seek to use the introduction of this positive legislation to hike up cover yet again.  We all know that the insurance companies have fleeced the Irish public for many years.  Their most recent outrage on the Irish public was their claim that a change in our courts system would result in lower premia.  We know that that was a fraudulent claim.  Every Member of this House has received complaints over the last ten or 12 months on the extraordinary difficulties which young drivers &mdash; even careful young drivers with good records &mdash; have in obtaining insurance.  Everybody knows about hikes in insurance premia, particularly car insurance, which do not seem to be related to any objective criteria.  I share Deputy Cullimore's fears.  I would hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who does have some powers in the matter of insurance companies, would take any necessary steps to ensure that some baseline study of the level of insurance costs arising from the area covered by this Bill would be established and that when the Bill comes into effect an effort would be made to police rigorously the baseline to ensure that the insurance companies do not use this Bill as another opportunity to fleece the Irish public further.</P>
    <P>This is a fine Bill.  It is good legislation. Deputy Hogan commented that it was well balanced.  I think it achieves a balance in a difficult area.  We do not want to go into the situation which they have in the United States where spurious claims can be made on the most extraordinary basis for huge amounts of money that can kill industry.  None of us wants that, particularly given the jobs crisis which we all recognise.  None of us <Col N="1115" /> wants to create a situation where Ireland becomes a difficult place to establish enterprise.  However, none of us wants Ireland to be a place where we have to put up with defective products and where the consumers have to suffer loss day in and day out.  While I welcome the Bill I look forward to the Minister answering the points I raised at the outset.</P>
    <P>We should consider at this stage the new concept of a small claims court.  It would help to create a less intimidating environment within which the Irish consumer could seek to vindicate his or her rights.  It would be beneficial to all parties. There is the question of involving the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is an office which is not as well developed as I would wish it to be.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade should be involved in all matters relating to competition and consumer issues and should be to the forefront.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade should have the resources to be seen as the consumers' ombudsman in all issues.</P>
    <P>Finally, I mentioned the question of remedy.  I am sure the Minister has an adequate answer on it.  I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Leyden, for introducing this legislation. It is worthwhile legislation and I have no doubt it will improve vastly the situation of consumers in this country.  I have pleasure in supporting and commending the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to indicate the support of The Workers' Party in principle for the fundamental ideas surrounding the legislation before the House today.  We will support the legislation on Second Stage but will be advancing some reservations about the specifics of the Bill, which I hope to touch on very briefly, and will be pursuing these by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister or the Minister of State <Col N="1116" /> will take on board some, if not all, of the points that will be raised in regard to the legislation we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>Before moving to the specifics of the legislation and those reservations about which I have spoken, there are some general points that need to be made. Consumer law in this country has come a long way from the celebrated case of Donoghue <i>v.</i> Stevenson &mdash; the snail in the bottle of beer case &mdash; which established for the first time the idea of responsibility on the part of a manufacturer for a defect in the product.  This case in England in the thirties has been advanced to a great extent, both there and here through our courts, and culminating in time various items of legislation particularly in the area of sale of goods.  Our legislation to date has been reasonable in those respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new concept being introduced by the Bill is one which extends beyond the area of negligence, the rights of people to recover for loss and damage suffered from a defective product on the basis of strict liability.  It is not an absolute standard; it is a standard that lays onus or responsibility on the producer, manufacturer and distributor of products on the basis that they should not be able to slip out of responsibility by reason only of the failure of the consumer to establish a case of negligence on the part of any one of the parties in defence.  Nonetheless, it allows the party on the defence side certain provisions of protection which are dealt with in the directive and in the legislation itself.  We have not been lax in developing and in keeping in line with international standards generally with regard to liability for defective products.  This legislation will introduce for the first time into our consumer laws the concept of strict liability.  The first matter that concerns me with regard to the legislation is the way in which the Minister of State presented it to the House today.  Why has no explanation been given by the Minister in presenting the legislation as to the reason it has taken successive Governments such an extraordinarily long time to bring before the House what is basically very straightforward and <Col N="1117" /> succinct legislation?  It is not as though this is something new.  It is certainly new as a concept to be introduced into our law but it is not new as a concept in law generally, particularly in the context of Europe and in debate and discussion at European level.</P>
    <P>There has been a directive in circulation since 1977 which has been debated by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and various EC committees on this issue.  It has also been the subject of three separate reports by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities here.  I will deal with those reports in general terms shortly.  In the first of those reports the point is made that the directive which has been in circulation since 1977 was based very closely on the Council of Europe Convention on Product Liability adopted by the Council of Ministers in September 1976.  Since then there has been in existence a protocol convention at Council of Ministers level in the Council of Europe, available to the Minister and successive Governments of this country to work on.  We have received no explanation as to why we had to wait 15 years for the production of the legislation that is before the House today.  It is very straightforward legislation with no more than 14 basic sections.  It is incumbent on the Minister to explain why it has taken so long to bring it before the House and to help us understand the defects, if any, in our legislative process which resulted in a year long period of gestation for legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I have not heard any Member, though I was out of the Chamber for a brief Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. Perhaps Members do not have a great deal of regard for that committee. This highlights an attitude that exists generally within the Dáil with regard to the work of committees of the Dáil.  There is a massive disinclination on the part of the two major parties in the House to assist in the establishment of committees.  A game has been played over the last year and a half between the <Col N="1118" /> Government and the Fine Gael Party on three important committees: the law reform committee was not established because Fine Gael refused to participate; the committee on foreign affairs will not be established because Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil cannot agree on who should chair it and the committee on crime is not being established because what had been previously agreed between the Whips of the various parties regarding the appointment of a chairperson to that committee has been reneged on by Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>They are some indicators of just how indisposed we are to the establishment of committees.  Where committees have been established they have proved effective, for example, in the area of child care, marital breakdown and foreign adoptions.  I lament the fact that even though the Minister, the Government and the House have available to them three separate reports of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, no one referred to them or their work.  I had the privilege of sitting on the committee of the last House that dealt with this matter as far back as 1987.  The report was eventually concluded in July 1988.  That report referred to &ldquo;the Directive since its first publication in draft form in 1976&rdquo;, and yet it took until 1988 to come to a conclusion on the matter.  The deliberations took place not only in the committee and at national level here but a lot of consideration was given to the matter at European level within the Council of Ministers.  As I have said, the work of the joint Oireachtas committee was concluded in July 1988.  There was a requirement that the directive be in place by July 1989, and we have only now, almost two years later, found time to first address the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the joint Oireachtas committee should not have been overlooked by the Minister in his presentation of this legislation.  Regard should have <Col N="1119" /> been had to the work that was done in that committee.  We should at every opportunity promote the work of these committees and recognise that the only way we will ever seriously improve on our legislative performance is by expanding the role of committees in this area.  It is regrettable that the joint Oireachtas committee reports were not adverted to by the Minister or indeed by any other speaker I have heard so far in the debate.</P>
    <P>I will very briefly refer to the reports. They are informative and will help us arrive at some conclusions with regard to the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of the legislation before the House.  The first report was produced and signed by the current Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, on 23 March 1977.  It is a brief report in the extreme.  It indicates that the Confederation of Irish Industry at the time were &ldquo;completely opposed in principle to the proposal.&rdquo;  They went on to record in some detail the reasons for this, many of them spurious in the extreme.  The report I am quoting from, volume 22, states that: &ldquo;The Confederation believes that the increased cost will affect the price and availability of nearly every product and will seriously impair the ability of many concerns to function&rdquo;.  The Irish Insurance Association also argued that the directive would have to be amended in several respects. The report states: &ldquo;it [the association] believes that the draft needs to be amplified so that the precise incidence of damages can be accurately assessed&rdquo;.  It goes on to say that the association were of the view that &ldquo;Pending clarification it [the association] finds itself unable to give any approximate indications of the likely costs in insurance to Irish industry&rdquo;. Having heard those views, needless to say, the committee at the time concluded that while it was a laudable objective to make it easier for persons to get compensation for damages caused by defective products they believed &ldquo;that the proposed Directive raises many complex issues that need to be examined before a final decision is taken&rdquo;.  The matter therefore was not advanced very strongly <Col N="1120" /> by the first report of the joint Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>The committee returned to this matter in their second report which was concluded on 13 May 1981.  The report was signed by the former Senator Alexis FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>The views of various interested bodies on this important directive were recorded, and it would appear that at that stage many more of them had become involved and were taking some cognisance of what was going on.  It has to be borne in mind that we are now five years from the time that the draft directive was first circulated.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry again led the field and were, to say the least, as highly antagonistic towards it as they had been in the earlier report.  They were very disparaging, stating that they did not believe it would carry the harmonising influence intended by the directive. They stated: &ldquo;if adopted, it will disturb competition within the Community and impede Ireland's economic development and industrial progress.&rdquo; The confederation went on to expand their arguments against the directive, and actively tried to impress upon the Oireachtas Joint Committee &mdash; and, I have no doubt, the Government of the day &mdash; that the directive should not have any currency whatever in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, according to the report, found the proposal fundamentally unacceptable. They, again are a very important sector of industry, a sector that successive Governments of the period highlighted as one that could led to an expansion of jobs.  Leading components of that industry internationally have been invited into the Irish economy.  In 1981 the report found that the idea of consumer protection on a strict liability basis was unacceptable to them.  The report records their most serious criticism being the refusal of the Commission to acknowledge the reasonableness of providing a defence for development risks. The industry, if they are the originators of the whole debate, have to take a bow, because in time the final directive as <Col N="1121" /> drafted did concede that point and left open the right of each country to derogate on the grounds of development risks or state of the art defence.  As the Minister has said, Ireland intends to follow that provision sheepishly rather than seek a derogation.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Trade Associations recorded their reservations about the directive, saying that they were not satisfied that the Commission had made a sufficiently strong case for the introduction of legislation dealing with product liability.  That was a remarkable position for any national organisation describing itself as a Federation of Trade Associations to adopt in 1981, given the degree of debate and negotiation that had gone on in the drafting of the directive in the first instance as much as five years beforehand.</P>
    <P>The National Consumer Advisory Council joined the debate and met the Oireachtas Joint Committee, which I was happy to note.  They supported the directive in general.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Irish Insurance Association, who had not been clear four years before at the first report stage on where they stood, said they were in a position to meet their obligations and requirements under the legislation once it was in place.</P>
    <P>The final report dealt with the final draft directive issued by the Commission in July 1985.  It should be recorded in this debate that, whilst debates had taken place since 1976, the final directive was set, copper-fastened and available to all of us, including the Minister and the Government, in July 1985.  One has to ask why the matter was not progressed by the previous Coalition Government of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, but, even though they did not use their two years, the directive was available to the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987, four years ago.  Earlier I suggested that Ireland had a deadline of July 1989 to implement the legislation.  I wish to correct that, the deadline was in fact July 1988.  The directive required Ireland by whatever device to have such legislation in place in this State to protect consumers <Col N="1122" /> along the lines indicated.  Ireland singularly failed to meet that deadline.  So far in the debate no Government Deputy, including the Minister, has given any explanation for the failure to meet the deadline.  The Minister has a duty to provide such an explanation, and I hope he will take an opportunity in the debate to respond.</P>
    <P>In July 1988 the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee, of which I had the privilege to be a member, again recorded the various views of the interested parties.  At that stage of the debate it was good to note that the Confederation of Irish Industry had at last come out of the nether reaches of obscurity and recognised that they were obliged to come abreast of international developments and views.  They accepted that the directive would in time introduce the kind of standards we would all like to have for consumer rights and producer standards. They also had several reservations about various provisions they had urged the Government to take on board.</P>
    <P>By and large the 1988 report records the general agreement of all parties, consumer, producer and manufacturer, to the adoption of the directive, perhaps on the basis that it was inevitable and mandatory for Ireland to act upon it.  The committee were able to recommend that legislation should proceed, and pointed out that it should be primary legislation and not a ministerial directive, as had been argued by some representatives of that committee.  I am glad that we have at least done that much.</P>
    <P>I am still confounded as to the reason it took four years to produce what seems to be a very small Bill, given the degree of work, research and analysis that had gone on for many years.  It appears from the speech of the Minister of State that the only hint he will give is that there was &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; with the different trade and consumer organisations.  The issue was taken a little further by Deputy Cullimore, who obviously has access to information not available to myself, who referred to seminars that took place and involved the different interested organisations. I remind the House that the <Col N="1123" /> Minister of State said there had been widespread consultation with industry as well as with consumer and trade interests in the course of the preparation of the legislation.  I also note that the Minister of State was obliged in his speech to yet again make the point that the Bill is not anti-manufacturer, anti-producer, or anti-industry but that if it is implemented and put into good effect it will bring standards up to the stage at which producers and manufacturers will benefit.  The obvious point that has to be brought home to us as Europeans is that our manufacturers and producers, who contend for the market in Europe, have to deal with those standards in other countries in any event so they should face them at home.  All of that leads me to believe that there had been only a very late conversion to the whole concept on the part of the Confederation of Irish Industry and private manufacturers and producers.  While they may have been saying things in 1988 and earlier to the Oireachtas Joint Committee, they persisted in a backward and obstructive attitude to this directive and to the development of the legislation. That is certainly the impression that comes across.  Unless we all accept that our primary responsibility is to the consumer we will have trouble in getting this legislation through and in implementing it.  We should recognise that this is an important development in the area of consumer protection and that it provides motivation towards higher standards.  We will make substantial progress here as long as the principle and spirit of the legislation is taken on board by everyone involved.  It was important in the context of this debate to outline what seems to have been a very obscure attitude in Irish industry towards the directive over the last 15 years or so, an attitude that seems to have persisted until a short time ago. This legislation should now get a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <P>There are some specifics in the legislation about which I and The Workers' Party would have reservations.  I will deal with them in the order in which they <Col N="1124" /> appear in the legislation.  My first reservation related to the proposal to exclude primary agricultural products and fish products from the legislation.  It is a fundamental mistake on the part of the Government not to include these items in the provisions of this legislation. This point is made very well in the third report of the joint Oireachtas committee on this issue where the committee dealt with the submission by the Director of the Quality Assurance Research Unit at University College, Galway.  In page 11, paragraph 24 of the report, the Director of the Quality Assurance Research Unit advanced a case for seeking a derogation to include primary agricultural products on the basis of our international standing as a food exporting country.  He felt that the inclusion of primary products in the scope of the directive would protect and enhance our image as a source of pure and wholesome foodstuffs.  That report is worth referring to if only to highlight the issue and ask the Minister of State why a view so well founded was ignored and departed from.  The point has been taken up by other Deputies.  I am glad of that, so that this is not seen to be a point which is being made against farming interests or the agricultural industry.  We must recognise that the future of agriculture lies in our maintaining the high standards that currently exist.  Because of our high standards we should not fear the provisions of this legislation.  By implementing this legislation to cover primary agricultural products we have a marketing instrument for promoting Irish agricultural products abroad.  The Government should look carefully at this issue and be slow to depart from the advice given.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not advance any cause in this area.  It needs greater amplification before we move from it. The Minister of State in his speech said that primary agricultural products have been excluded from the legislation because they can be particularly prone to hidden defects caused by environmental factors beyond the control of the producer. I have a small grounding in agriculture, having been brought up on a <Col N="1125" /> farm, but I do not have any great scientific knowledge.  I do not understand the Minister's concept.  I was not convinced of the Minister's arguments during the deliberations of the joint Oireachtas committee who considered the report. What environmental factors would be beyond the control of the producer?  The technology available to farmers today establishes beyond doubt that there is information available to everyone in the industry so that they can know exactly what is going on at an environmental level.  There are no environmental factors beyond the control of the producer, and there is not a serious case to be sustained here.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry favoured not seeking a derogation.  They favoured excluding agriculture, but we have to remember that they were against the directive when it was circulated and they only begrudgingly accepted the principle of the directive.  Beyond their argument the cause has not been advanced very strongly.  There was no submission from the Irish Farmers' Association or from any of the farming bodies to the joint Oireachtas committee.  Perhaps they were relying on the Confederation of Irish Industry but that was not made clear at the time.  Reasoned research from University College Galway makes the point that we should aim for the highest standards in agriculture and in agricultural products.  We have the highest standards and we should have nothing to fear from legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>In time the emphasis in Irish agriculture will move towards the more wholesome side of the industry.  This will result in the minimisation if not the negation of the so called environmental factors which are causing problems for the Minister of State. I will certainly press this issue on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister of State will look at the matter more carefully.</P>
    <P>The second issue I want to raise is the limit of £350 on the right of people to recover damages from defective products. There is not an upper limit set on <Col N="1126" /> how much can be claimed, but there is an unfortunate starting off figure of £350. That is based on the fact that the directive of 1985 talked about 500 ECUs being the limit.  It also referred to the financial limits, including this limit, being reviewed every five years.  The first period of review has passed and I should like the Minister of State to say whether there has been any change in the level of ECUs fixed in this area.  I would be arguing against any upward movement, but the Minister should state the position in this regard.  It is another reflection of the difficulties encountered by being so tardy in bringing our legislation forward.  A sum of £350 may not seem a lot in regard to the issue with which we are dealing but it is an incredible penalty to impose on the small consumer, the person who probably can least of all, in the first instance, afford to buy the product and least afford to live with the defective item when it is useless or causes damage as a result of being defective.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputies who attend at advice centres have met many people who suffered loss and damage as a result of defective goods &mdash; electric goods immediately spring to mind but I do not want to single them out &mdash; and who obviously do not have the resources to buy a replacement or to go to the District Court to pursue a claim.  They are being penalised because they cannot afford a replacement unit and do not have the resources to go to court to pursue a legal action to establish negligence on the part of the producer, manufacturer or distributor of the item.  They do not have any remedy.  The people who would benefit from this legislation &mdash; those with small claims &mdash; are being told that they have no right to claim that the producer, manufacturer or distributor have a responsibility in this regard, which is wrong in principle.  I accept that it is in the directive but that is for guidance purposes only in this area and is not mandatory.  Even if it was mandatory, I say that this country &mdash; a small island community &mdash; could easily argue and be respected for saying that the circumstances in our country should mean <Col N="1127" /> that we will not be bound by this provision. The type of argument we could produce is the fact that over one-third of the population live below the poverty line, that we have the highest rate of unemployment in any EC country and that we have a very expensive legal system requiring a lot of money on the part of the litigant and a very inadequate legal aid system.  Until we come up to the standards of our European partners we would be lauded for saying that we will not introduce this lower limit provision.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that this is a movement in the wrong direction.  At a time when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> makes a commitment to examine the establishment of a small claims court we are failing to extend legislation in a fundamental way to a whole range of small claims.  We are saying that there will be one law for the more substantial claimant &mdash; the rich &mdash; and another law for the poorer claimant.  I accept that is not a very precise analogy, but by and large the people most affected by the lower limit will be those who cannot afford to take legal action and to go to court to pursue a claim for negligence as opposed to the strict liability issue, which is so much easier to establish. Those people simply will not have the means to replace the defective products. It is a bad provision and I ask the Minister to look at it again.</P>
    <P>The next issue is the question of the ten year limit on any action.  The point is made in one of the reports &mdash; I cannot immediately recall which one &mdash; regarding the position of an action which might accrue in relation to a minor or a person suffering from a disability.  That position needs to be clarified before we accept the absolute of a ten year limit.  Why should there be a statute of limitations apart from the general law of limitations?  Very good legislation in this area was introduced recently by the Government based on the principle of discoverability saying that an action runs from the time that the defect could reasonably have been discovered, not from the time when the contract is made or the product is sold. <Col N="1128" /> In regard to a minor the period runs from when the minor becomes an adult and the same applies to a person considered to be mentally defective.  Those periods of limitation are important.  The concept of discoverability is also important and has been taken on board by the Government in their recent legislation in this area.  However, it seems to have been substantially departed from by the absolute ten year period of limitation being proposed in the legislation, based on the directive.  This matter should be further looked at.</P>
    <P>Business should not be allowed the benefit of an absolute time limit, such as ten years, where that business is still in existence and where no injustice can be shown to be caused by the lapse of time before an action is taken.  If a person has suffered damage because of a defective product it should be left to the courts to decide whether the action should proceed after a substantial lapse of time based on arguments made by either party that the lapse of time would prove an injustice to the person being sued because of inability to answer the claim, which is the law at present.  Under our statute of limitations that is available to a litigant who is being sued after a substantial lapse of time and where a court has a residual jurisdiction to say that an action should not proceed because it would be unfair or unjust to the party concerned.  That is the proper formula to be adopted.  A ten year absolute limit is not good law, it is too restrictive and should not be adhered to.  It is not in keeping with the spirit of the legislation, which is to protect the consumer as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 12 extends the provisions of the 1988 Courts Act with regard to no jury hearings.  The Workers' Party were implacably and fundamentally opposed to that legislation when it came before the House.  We fought it as vehemently as we could, but, having regard to our numbers, obviously not terribly successfully. However, we were the only party at the time who said that there would not be the spin-off available to the lay litigant, the insurance industry and <Col N="1129" /> the community as a whole by the abolition of juries in civil matters.  Our position then was, and still is, that the jury was a democratic reflection of the community at large in the legal process and that it was always important to maintain that democratic community involvement; otherwise we would develop an élite and rarefied legal climate which would not serve the interests of the lay person.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of an incident which occurred the other day in the Circuit Court in Dublin.  A minor came before the court seeking damages for an injury which occurred on a CIE bus.  A judge heard the case at 11 a.m. and, having heard the facts, ruled, in the absence of a jury, that the award offered was inadequate, as he was entitled to do, and instructed the parties involved to come up with a more generous figure than the one of £8,000.  However, for some reason the case was heard by another judge in the same jurisdiction in Dublin within half an hour who ruled that the figure was too generous and should be reduced to £7,200.  Therefore, in a matter of half an hour the litigant who was looking at the prospect of being offered a figure in excess of £8,000 ended up with an award closer to £7,000.  Chinks can appear and for this reason we should as far as possible have maintained in the legal process a democratic community voice, the jury service.</P>
    <P>The point that needs to be made is that we were told in 1988 during the course of the debate on that Bill that if we got rid of juries in civil actions in the High Court civil actions would be heard more quickly and that the backlog would be cleared, but this has not happened.  I accept that there has been an improvement, but claims are not being processed and dealt with as quickly as they should be.  There is still a huge backlog in the High Court. We were also told that the cost of insurance premia would be reduced for the consumer, but clearly this has not happened.  If anything, the cost of insurance premia has rocketed during the past two years since the legislation was put in place.  Our case has been well made and I make it again today.  We have not <Col N="1130" /> been well served by the abolition of juries in civil actions.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill provides that the provisions of the 1988 Act shall apply to all actions taken under this Bill &mdash; in other words, all actions taken under this Bill will not be heard before a jury regardless of how complex the issue involved are and of the important need for a jury to have an input in deciding on the facts. That is to be regretted.  We will oppose that provision in principle even though this does not make a great deal of sense now, given that juries have been abolished. However the point is worth making.</P>
    <P>Another point which needs to be made is that, if the Government persist in extending the list of actions in which juries are abolished and if we are to introduce the concept of no fault liability in this area, it is time we examined the question of a national insurance scheme to ensure when an accident occurs or when damage is caused people will be offered a fair amount in compensation, following an assessment by a tribunal of lay people or judges or a combination of both, to be paid out of a national insurance fund.  We should get away from the idea of litigation in the first instance, of hit and miss procedures and the question of negligence and fault, and recognise that people, even though they may have been the authors of their own accident, have a right and entitlement to be looked after and cared for.  One way of doing this &mdash; this is what they have done in New Zealand and elsewhere &mdash; would be to get rid of the parish industry, insurance companies, which it has been suggested by Deputies on both the Government and Opposition sides of the House, has been milking the Irish consumer for far too long.  We should get rid of them in this area and establish a national insurance fund.  It is heartbreaking on the one hand to see people, following a lengthy hearing in the High Court and elsewhere, walking away with nothing having failed to prove negligence because they did not have the capacity or the resources to pay lawyers to argue their case for them and, on the other, to <Col N="1131" /> see others who have suffered horrendous injuries walking away with a massive amount of money in compensation.  This imbalance, the vagaries of the litigation system, should be addressed in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but the Deputy should wait until Committee Stage before going into detail.  The Deputy is generalising too much and is not sticking to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to hear you say that.  I was just about to move on to the next point I want to make, which is that The Workers' Party welcome the provisions contained in sections 8, 9, 10 and 11.  We welcome in particular the provision that joint and several liability will apply where two or more parties are liable.  It is an important right that a person can pursue the main litigant when a product has been found to be defective and damage has been caused.  It is also important that liability will not restrict the other rights of the consumer protected by section 9.</P>
      <P>The provision that a producer, manufacturer or distributor will not be allowed to limit or exclude his liability in a contract is equally important and should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The final matter I would like to deal with is the Government's proposal to seek a derogation and allow industry to avail of the &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; or &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; defence.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee dealt with this matter in their reports, in particular their final report in 1988.  I accept they decided to recommend that the Government should seek a derogation in this area but I expressed some reservations about this at the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to express my concern about the proposal contained in the Minister of State's statement.  I think the Government are wrong to seek a derogation. Given that the overall aim of the legislation is to provide a high degree of protection for the consumer and raise <Col N="1132" /> standards in industry, it is important that we do not allow industry to avail of the &ldquo;development risks&rdquo; or &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; defence.  It should be pointed out that other European countries, such as France, Luxembourg, Belgium and Denmark, do not provide this safeguard for industry in their territories.  The committee were moving towards this recommendation in finalising their report in 1988 and I would ask the Minister to indicate the direction in which other countries are headed.  There is no uniformity on the issue and it is an area where high standards should be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made the point that if we fail to seek this derogation we would in some way discourage industry from carrying out research, but I do not accept that.  It is clear given the standards which have been achieved in other countries, that they have been able to take without any difficulty the concept that research and development should be covered and that defence should not be available to industry.</P>
    <P>The point is that if a litigant is to take an action of negligence against a manufacturer it is for the manufacturer to say at the hearings that that was the best they could have done at the time even though subsequently another method or means of going about the manufacturing process was achieved.  The Minister suggests that by not introducing this derogation it would act as a disincentive for industry to invest in this country.  I think the motivation of all industry is profit; and industry in all areas, particularly when they are moving into the unknown, will always continue to take risks, to speculate and to attempt to maximise on a new idea irrespective of the state of consumer law. My point is that they are always susceptible to legal action in the area of negligence and they do not have available absolutely the state of the art defence. Why should we extend it to them now simply because we are introducing the idea of strict liability where the primary concept is to protect the consumer?</P>
    <P>This issue is important because we have many instances, particularly in the chemical and medical industries, where an <Col N="1133" /> attempt was made by industry to hide behind the idea that they did not know better at the time.  The thalidomide case in Britain was a classic example where they tried to hide behind the defence that they did not know better at the time.  But after a protracted litigation and examination of the facts this position was found not in fact to be entirely the truth and after many years these unfortunate victims succeeded in getting their just compensation. We have an almost analogous situation in this country where the Government have failed to honour the just claims of the haemophiliac victims of the HIV virus who were administered over a period a factor which was not entirely free of the virus.  Their claim is still outstanding because we do not have in our legislation to date a strict liability provision.  If it existed that litigation would be settled a long time ago.  Under the provisions of this legislation it would be settled against the State.  The present law is based on negligence, not on strict liability, and because of that they are still waiting.  In fact, some have died without any compensation being afforded to them.</P>
    <P>This point has been raised by other Deputies, but I wish to advert to it because I am very directly involved and concerned, as our party are, with their cause.  The point has been made that we could seek to amend the legislation to make it retroactive.  However, if nothing happens on the Government side to settle the haemophiliacs' just claim, The Workers' Party would consider an amendment in that respect which would be specific and just case.  I do not believe it is acceptable to advance the cause that we should make all claims arising from this legislation retroactive. It specifically provides in the legislation that claims will arise only for goods manufactured, processed and circulated after the passing of the law and it coming into effect.  That is only sensible because one cannot hold the manufacturer or producer liable for standards that did not exist when the product first came into <Col N="1134" /> being.  However, in the case of haemophiliacs, because of their just case and sad circumstances, the House could make an exception of their case.  As I have said, unless The Workers' Party are satisfied that progress is being genuinely made by the Minister for Health in their cause we will put down a specific amendment on Committee Stage which would allow the case of haemophiliacs to be dealt with under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to deal with the defences that are available to the manufacturers, producers and distributors under the legislation.  These are povided for under section 6 of the Bill. I believe that some of them are much too widely drafted and provide much too easy cover for the producer of defective products. Again I am working from the position that our primary concern must be for the consumer and from that perspective, some of the defences, particularly those in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f).  I am mindful of the Chair's counsel not to be over specific and I do not intend to go into them in any greater detail except to ask the Minister how breaches of section 6 (d) would be dealt with.  Section 6 (d) states that a producer will not be liable for a defect that would arise due to compliance with any requirement or an enactment by the EC.  But would the case of the litigant who suffers damage from the defective product as a result of the inept or negligent compliance with the directive be treated on the basis of negligence or strict liability?  This should be looked at; otherwise it deserves amendment before Committee Stage.  Section 6 (e) deals with defects that arise due to the state of scientific and technical knowledge available.  I believe this should be qualified to say that the state of scientific knowledge that should have reasonably been known with due diligence on the part of the manufacturer at the time the process was being initiated.  This is an important qualification.  Where a producer does not exercise reasonable diligence in this area, the standard should be one of strict liability and not of negligence. If a manufacturer seeks to offlay <Col N="1135" /> responsibility to the primary manufacturer or the manufacturer of a component used, I think this must be coupled with a requirement that the person making the claim, the manufacturer or distributor or whoever, is obliged to join with the other party to the proceedings so that the ultimate court hearing will decide the issue between them without allowing the person who raised this issue at the court hearing to slip out on the basis of being able to pass on responsibility to a third party.  If a defence as in section 6 (f) is relied on, it should be coupled with a prior obligation on the manufacturer to join the third party to the proceedings and have the issue determined by the court of hearing.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have taken some time with these points but they are some of the important reservations that The Workers' Party have with the finer detail of the Bill.  I have gone into these points because I hope the Minister will take some of them on board before Committee Stage and deal with them by way of amendment to the Bill and that the others will be dealt with in his reply at the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>In summary, The Workers' Party welcome the Bill as an important advance in consumer law.  It comes as we are moving towards the market of 1992.  There is need for standardisation of the laws and for fundamental protections for the consumer on a strict liability basis.  For too long there has been a failure properly to compensate people for sharp practices on the part of manufacturers, on the basis that they did not have the resources, the expertise or the means to establish negligence. That day has ended.</P>
    <P>The Minister could go somewhat further by taking on board some of the reservations to which I have referred.  We will support the legislation at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which is long overdue.  We are all aware of the necessity at times, especially around Christmas, to withdraw products from the market which have been found to be <Col N="1136" /> defective.  It is appropriate that this Bill should be put on the Statute Book in the interests of consumer protection.</P>
      <P>The need for consumer protection is particularly evident in high risk areas such as the DIY sector.  This sector has grown enormously over the years and people who purchase various types of machinery and equipment must be comprehensively protected in the case of faulty goods.</P>
      <P>Many of the defective products which are found to be on sale here have been imported from outside the EC.  The need for high standards might be raised in the context of the GATT negotiations. Within the Community we are responsible for our own affairs and are in a position to protect the consumer but the import of non-EC products can cause problems.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the thirties and to the growing awareness of the need to protect the consumer against unscrupulous manufacturers and suppliers. The negative lobby formed by the umbrella bodies of industry is unacceptable, if predictable.  Unfortunately those manufacturers who maintain high standards and in respect of whom there is no need to legislate for consumer protection must bear an insurance cost.  The manufacturer who is concerned about the quality of his product will depend on selfregulation rather than legislative provisions in order to maintain high standards. Manufacturers of this kind are pointing out that because of their brand name and reputation there is no need for this protection and that they have their own in-house quality controls.  That point must be balanced against the broader need for the protection for the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.  Some of the amendment which have been outlined by The Workers' Party are not realistic. Deputy McCartan went into detail about legalities which would be an intolerable burden on an already over-burdened sector.  It is like being against everything and for nothing, looking for the ideal. The Minister has struck the right balance <Col N="1137" /> and I hope the legislation will be on the Statute Book as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on its comprehensive nature.  Deputy McCartan referred to the time lag between the discussion of matters such as this at committee level and their further discussion in the House.  Considerable changes take place which affect one's attitute to legislation in a relatively short space of time. That is the case here.  The committee have through the chairperson repeatedly brought to the attention of the Government and the institutions of this House the need to bring forward legislation as quickly as possible at a time when people are conscious of its implications and the various submissions are fresh in the mind.</P>
      <P>I welcome this consumer protection legislation which was much sought after and long awaited.  It is EC led and driven in the sense that we must comply with the directive.  We have all heard cases of consumers who have been disadvantaged because a product proved to be faulty. A positive development is the greater awareness of the need to provide quality products which producers and processors can stand over and which are not likely to injure or cause damage.  It enhances our standing in the marketplace, pariticularly as an exporting country, and there is also a benefit in insurance costs. We have all become conscious of the need to respect the rights of the consumer. We must move away from the position where a consumer returning a faulty product to a supplier could meet with a totally negative response.  Such a response determines the consumers attitude to both the product and the supplier. In a case where a product has been proved to be faulty there should be no quibble about its replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I used to be involved in the machinery business and if a consumer complained about a fault I would first try to find out how often the fault had occurred.  If the fault occurred at an early stage one could be sure that the same fault occurred in <Col N="1138" /> other units sold around the same time. That is a clear indication of liability.  This legislation will impress on producers, processors and suppliers the need to ensure that the consumer, the person who pays the piper at the end of the day, is catered for and is not damaged or injured in any way as a result of a deficiency in a product.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, Deputies Barry and McCartan, I see no reason for excluding agricultural products from the scope of this legislation.  It would benefit our agricultural products if they were to be included.  We are exporting worldwide and it would be of great benefit to us in world markets if we could say that we did not have to have any derogation but decided to allow this legislation to fully encompass all of our products, including our agricultural products.  We could use that as a selling point abroad.  There is an urgent need for a quality mark for all Irish products which could be used as a pre-determining factor in deciding whether or not a product is safe, falls within the guidelines set down and is satisfactory.  Products bearing a quality mark indicating a sufficiently high standard would obviously be more attractive to insurance companies who might have to insure against liability.  The introduction of a quality mark would mean that the industries, the producers and the suppliers would have to police the quality marking itself, thereby eliminating much of the litigation that goes on at present.</P>
    <P>This legislation is very positive.  It has negative aspects as well, and Deputy McCartan referred to one or two of those.  One thing I am acutely conscious of is the constant recourse to the courts for decisions on virtually everything.  If this goes on the High Court and the Supreme Court will have to sit on a 24-hour basis to resolve all the problems that are likely to be referred to them under this and other headings.  Alongside that are the huge costs.  This is a negative aspect of the Bill.  I am in favour of the concept but there are aspects which are likely to have a cost impact to be met by the consumer.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan mentioned the <Col N="1139" /> possibility of a national insurance scheme.  This may be necessary in the future because there is such a welter of applications and so forth to various bodies and it will be impossible for anybody to obtain insurance in the next few years if the present trend continues.  It has been suggested that people should be compensated in some way whether or not they have been negligent.  I accept that. However, the system should not be so open-ended as to allow repeated frivolous, and sometimes fraudulent, claims to be made resulting in massive increases in insurance premiums which have to be met by the policyholders.  This is happening as a result of awards made by courts which can be higher or lower depending on the judge or court.  This proves one thing, that none of us is infallible, even the courts.</P>
    <P>One weakness in the Bill is its impact on costs.  If we had the quality mark I spoke of it would be relatively simple for any industry to police its own quality and product liability and allow insurance companies to make cover available at a reasonable rate without impacting on everybody else.  It is here that I want to mention the national insurance scheme suggested by Deputy McCartan.  It has been suggested that that might be an answer to the problems.  In a country that has such ready recourse to the courts there will ultimately be a sharp increase in insurance costs.  Should it fall to consumers in general to pay the cost of that compensation or should everybody in the community shoulder the burden?  That is a question to which nobody has a ready answer but it must be asked and addressed very soon in this House.  If the system is too open-ended, if there is too ready recourse to the courts system, ultimately all the experts will have been called together and will have talked each other out of existence.  Eventually somebody has to make a decision as to the liability or otherwise of a particular person.  Should everybody in the country be insured to cover such eventualities or only those who are at present covered for public liability and product liability?  In the latter <Col N="1140" /> case the extra cost will be added to the price of the products and the consumer still ends up paying through no fault of his own.</P>
    <P>A number of people have again and again gone to the courts here with frivolous claims for huge damages on foot of severe pain, incapacity and so on.  This was proven in the courts and accepted.  If you consult with some of their neighbours and ask them what they think about it they generally have something else to tell you, the nub of the story being that the rest of the community who pay insurance premiums to cover against liabilities very often end up paying for this very claimconscious society we are now developing. The success or otherwise of this legislation will depend very much on whether we decide to be reasonable and rational and have high quality products with inbuilt policing processes which will eliminate many frivolous actions of the type to which I have referred; or proceed down the road of endless horrendous legal battles whether we decide to go for broke and end up attempting to sue somebody else in the hope of easy pickings.</P>
    <P>The agricultural area is covered in the Bill.  After food has been processed it comes within the ambit of the legislation, but the introduction of additives before processing is becoming very prevalent.  I agree entirely with my colleague, Deputy Barry, that there is a good case to bring that aspect of our industry within the ambit of the Bill, even though it was felt at the time of the discussion at the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities that it was not desirable for climatic and environmental reasons.</P>
    <P>A number of other speakers wish to contribute, so let me mention just a couple of things.  We all at some stage have had reason, having purchased a new car &mdash; touch wood, I have had no bad experience with my last one &mdash; to go back to the supplier and make a complaint. How many times have we seen lines of motor cars withdrawn for review of an item in the manufacture which has threatened safety and so on?  That happens <Col N="1141" /> regularly.  How many times have there been little faults that have never been mentioned for which the consumer is paying regularly?  When he or she goes back to the same supplier and asks to have the matter repaired, once it has gone off warranty it becomes part of a new and very expensive ball game.  An examination of the type of complaint raised in that way would reveal that the same queries come up again and again. That should not be so in respect of a relatively new product.</P>
    <P>In regard to medical products and preparations, reference has been made to haemophiliacs whose unfortunate plight has been discussed in this House repeatedly. The thalidomide babies have also been referred to.  This legislation must have a bearing on those cases and will be a warning to producers and manufacturers of products which heretofore they could very well say were quite harmless, that you could eat, drink or rub as much of them on as you liked.  In future they will have to be a little more circumspect because they themselves are to be liable, rightly so, for the quality of the products.</P>
    <P>Few of us can have driven over the roads in this country without noticing some of the very large and prominent potholes which appear from time to time. The Minister sitting opposite might not want to accept responsibility for those, but I assure him they exist even in his own constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak on that with some authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I and, I am sure, every Member of this House have seen roads resurfaced during the summer when surface dressing is carried out and have driven over the same roads three or four weeks later to find part of the surface has disappeared.  When we ask questions about that we are told there was some little difficulty, some chemical problem. We often wonder whether the public, the taxpayer, get good value for money there.  We do not always hear what exactly happened, whether the firm who <Col N="1142" /> supplied the material in the first place were asked to supply new material free, gratis and for nothing, as they should be in a system of full product liability.  If a product is supposed to meet requirements and the supplier, manufacturer or producer has to supply the same product within a short time to do the self same job and is paid for it a second time, obviously serious questions have to be asked.</P>
      <P>A range of household products have been mentioned by other speakers and I do not propose to discuss them in depth, but they range from washing machines to cookers, frying pans, electric irons and so on which have an unfortunate habit of developing peculiar traits.  It could well be the old story of the Friday manufacturer or the Monday manufacturer on the assembly line or the pre-bank holiday manufacturing assembly line or the post-bank holiday line, as they were commonly known in various trades up to recently when stricter quality control was introduced.  However, there are still a few of them around.  But, generally speaking, manufacturers are more readily available and more amenable to making amends that they were.  They will not be so readily available or amenable when it comes to damage.  Replacement is one thing but the damage or injury resulting from the faulty product may be serious.  I hope the good relationship which has been nurtured and built up between consumers and manufacturers over the last number of years will not now falter or be injured in any way by the introduction of this legislation which has its positive and negative sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned building materials in his speech and referred to a house made up of materials which were moveable and had suddenly become immoveable.  That is interesting.  It should be covered by other legislation as well, legislation which incidentally, was before this House for the last six, seven or eight years.  Without a doubt there is a need to ensure that, notwithstanding the six year guarantee scheme, this legislation should take within its ambit the whole area of construction and house building.  In the construction of a building <Col N="1143" /> a number of products and components are used which, if they fail individually, can have a fairly dramatic impact on an entire structure and a knock-on effect on other products.  Therefore, it is important that they come under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House further except to mention that under section 10 of the Bill a disclaimer in a contract will not be sufficient grounds for somebody to opt out of the system.  The disclaimer will not be accepted, rightly so, because if a contract is being made and part and parcel of that contract has within it a disclaimer to the effect that the manufacturer, the producer or the supplier is in no way liable, then there would be no sense in having legislation like this before this House.  It would be completely and absolutely meaningless.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  I am sorry it has taken so long to bring it before the House since it was discussed some considerable time ago by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. I note the exclusions and the inclusions and I hope we will not see a hike in costs, such as insurance costs, as a result of the introduction of this legislation.  I have referred to the legal profession and the ongoing wrangles in the courts.  I would not like the insurance companies to see this as an avenue and an excuse for hiking up insurance premia or any other cover to people who are likely to require cover under this legislation. There is a tendency in this country to do that type of thing, especially in the run up to 1992 when we are supposed to be rationalising and generally making available to all our consumers a better deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to join with the previous speakers in welcoming this Bill to the House.  It has taken some time to reach the Floor of the House.  The introduction of the Liability for Defective Products Bill brings to an end years of protracted negotiations among the <Col N="1144" /> member states and represents a significant advance in the area of consumer protection.  This is the final stage of this process.  The choice of implementing this directive was through primary legislation by an Act of the Oireachtas or through secondary legislation by regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972.  The intention among most member states was to bring this directive through primary legislation.  In the UK the legislation has been in place for the past four years.  I am glad that the implementation of the directive in this country is by way of an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Bill raises many substantive issues, such as the shift in the burden of proof from the claimant to the producer and above all the definition of key terms, such as &ldquo;product&rdquo;, &ldquo;producer&rdquo;, &ldquo;defect&rdquo;, &ldquo;development risk&rdquo;, &ldquo;damage&rdquo; etc. Defining such concepts, in my view, is a primary function of the Oireachtas particularly as this legislation will have to be read in conjunction with existing law on tort and contract.  It is important not to delay the introduction of legislation as producers will need time to adjust their operations to the new regime of strict liability, such as the negotiation of adequate insurance cover.  In this regard it is noteworthy that most previous speakers have outlined their concerns about the whole question of insurance cover when this Bill is put in place.  One of the main themes coming through all the contributions so far has been the question of the effect the new legislation will have on insurance premia and on the whole question of litigation by individuals for liabilities which they would claim were caused by defective products.  I hope as a result of the implementation of the legislation we will not see a major increase in insurance costs and that if there are some increased costs we will not see the knock-on effect by the increase in the consumer price of products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With certain limited exceptions the Bill applies to all products manufactured in or put into circulation in the Community. Primary agricultural products &mdash; that is products of the soil, stock farming and of fisheries &mdash; are specifically excluded from <Col N="1145" /> the scope of this Bill.  This exemption would not include products which have undergone processing of an industrial nature.  The producer is defined as the manufacturer of a finished product, component or raw material or anyone who represents himself as the producer, for example, of own brand products.  Where the producer cannot be identified each supplier of the product will be treated as its producer unless the identity of the producer or any other person along the chain of supply is made known to the injured party.  The importer of a product into the EC will be treated as its producer.</P>
    <P>A product will be regarded as defective when it does not provide the safety which a person would be entitled to expect, taking all circumstances into account, including the presentation of the product, the use to which it would reasonably be expected that the product would be put and the time the product was put into circulation.  Furthermore, a product would not be considered defective for the sole reason that a better product was subsequently put into circulation.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Federation are confident that insurance cover will continue to be available, though at an increased cost, under the terms of this Bill.  I have some concerns in this area that the actual increased cost, which the Insurance Federation have talked about, will not reflect itself in increased consumer prices.  The Insurance Federation opposes derogation to exclude state of the art defence, as this would have a very significant effect on the cost of and in certain circumstances the availability of insurance cover.  I am glad to note that certain defences will be open to a producer, such as where he did not put the product on the market, where the offending defect did not exist at the time it was circulated by him, where it was not possible scientifically or technically to detect the existence of the fault at that time or, in the case of the component or raw material, where the defect is due to a design fault in the final product in which it was used.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting also that similar legislation has been in existence in the United <Col N="1146" /> Kingdom for the past four years.  While it has brought significant benefits to consumers there, it has not had the negative impact on producers of goods that many commentators in the UK at that time predicted.  As I have said previously, I hope the whole area of litigation will not be seen by the consumer as a new area to be tried out under this legislation.  Perhaps the whole question of litigation is a matter for another item of legislation.  In fairness to our own manufacturers, they also need some type of protection.  I understand from the Minister that negotiations took place between the various interested bodies &mdash; the producers, the distributors and the retailers &mdash; and that to a certain extent adequate protections are provided in the Bill for the producer.</P>
    <P>The Irish insurance companies will have to be monitored in the individual cases which they deem to settle outside the courts.  There is a general perception out there that certain insurance companies are too quick to settle what the normal person would regard as spurious cases.  I hope the Minister will monitor the effects of this legislation and if he finds there are abuses by various sectors of the community that he can through some other means act to stop this abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish this Bill a speedy passage into law.  It has been around for a long time as the EC directive was first published in 1985 and we are now into 1991.  I commend the representative bodies of industrialists for their endeavours to familiarise their members with the implications of this Bill.  I endorse their conclusion that the best defence industry has against possible litigation and claims for compensation is to have proper quality control and adequate insurance cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the sentiments of the Deputy from Carlow-Kilkenny in congratulating the Minister for bringing forward this legislation. However, my congratulations are reserved on the belated action of the Government in bringing forward this legislation which has been thrust upon <Col N="1147" /> us by the European Community.  It is another example of the European Community giving a lead in legislating on this important consumer area where we should have given a lead many years ago. It is another of the European conventions that is finally being made part and parcel of our law.</P>
      <P>This leads me to ask all members of the Cabinet to produce a comprehensive list of the number of European conventions to which Ireland has become a signatory State in the past number of years.  By signing these documents we are committing ourselves to introducing and bringing up to date our domestic legislation, but we have not done that.  This is another example of how far behind most European states our laws are, in conforming to EC conventions.  The fact that eagerly awaited 1992 is literally around the corner should be a cause of serious concern to everybody in the House.</P>
      <P>This is good legislation and is certainly to be welcomed.  I wish it a speedy passage through the House.  I hope that on Committee Stage some amendments will be taken on board by the Minister.  There are not so much defects in as omissions from the Bill which I hope will be taken on board.  Since the late seventies there has been a considerable amount of legislation which favours the consumer, and that is very important.  Nevertheless, the consumer as a lobbyist or a clout figure in society is left very much to the rear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other influential groups in society &mdash; the professions, industry, farmers, employers and trade unions, groups which one could describe in the words of a former Minister for Finance as well heeled and articulate &mdash; are to the fore in presenting the views of their particular intrest group at national level.  An example of that significant level of clout was the recently completed <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Regrettably the consumer has been left behind.  The consumer and consumer interests are the forgotten group in society.  Our consumer legislation and our interest in consumer affairs should be <Col N="1148" /> highlighted and updated so that the Irish consumer can exercise the same level of sophistication as the consumer in other European member states.</P>
    <P>This legislation stems from European law, from a code of practice that is in operation in most European states.  While it is welcome, it must be accompanied by other measures that would give the legislation far greater effect.  Since 1979 we have had the Consumer Information Act, 1978, the appointment of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, the implementation of restrictive practices orders prohibiting anti-competitive practices and various consumer safety orders made under the Industrial Research and Standards Act of the early sixties.  We have seen the setting up of the office of the Ombudsman and the appointment of the Data Protection Commissioner.  We have also seen the introduction of a certain status for the consumer, but without effective remedies immediately available to the consumer, we are not doing the consumer a good service.  While this Bill lines up behind the Consumer Information Act and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, the consumer will not be treated to the maximum benefits under the legislation without an effective system of redress.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in this legislation is introducing the concept of strict liability, with liability or fault being apportioned without the necessity of proving the point, without arguing the point in a court forum.  This is certainly welcome but the damage must be proved.  In the event of there being a fundamental dispute as to liability, the only effective remedy will be through the courts.  What distinguishes the Irish consumer from their European counterparts is the fact that we do not have a simplified code of practice in the form of a small claims court for dealing with a grievance or a complaint.  That is the point I want to make.  While welcoming the legislation there is a considerable gap in our laws that will not be closed until we have an inexpensive and <Col N="1149" /> effective remedy in the form of a small claims court.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the legislation and structures that exist, there is still much that is unsatisfactory to the Irish consumer. That can be seen from the reports of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, an office that deals with 20,000 complaints per annum mainly of a small claims nature.  When one considers that, together with the level of complaints received in the office of the Ombudsman, one can see the need for legislation like this and indeed, for our legislation to be more strictly enforced and operated on a much tighter basis than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Bill was not brought forward in the context of a consumer package.  It is extraordinary that, for example, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade can deal with consumers' complaints, such as a mistake by a plumber or a problem with a local garageman about a defective car, but yet he cannot deal with a grievance, however justified, a person might have against Telecom Eireann or the ESB.  Similarly, the Ombudsman is unduly restricted in carrying out his operations.  He can deal with Telecom Eireann or An Post, but not with other State monopolies such as the ESB.  These anomalies and weaknesses only add to the perception of indifference on the part of a State monopoly towards the consumer.  I wonder has that point been addressed in this legislation? I dare say it has not.  Judging from what the Minister has said, we are dealing merely with the supply and provision of products and not addressing ourselves to the provision and supply of a service.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a point the Minister made &mdash; and I hope it was made in all sincerity &mdash; that there is a feeling that consumers' rights, rights of the general public, rights of the individual from a small claims/consumer/fair trade point of view, are anti-business and anti-progress and actually interfere with the running of a successful business.  The Minister reiterated his view that that was not so. I hope that feeling will be hit on the head at the earliest opportunity.  It is only when <Col N="1150" /> we have a comprehensive package of consumer rights and methods by which the consumer may gain redress fairly quickly that there will be top, high quality products that will lead to the survival of many of our industries, manufacturing and otherwise, after the 1992 changes.</P>
    <P>The concept of strict liability is contained in the Bill and that is very welcome. It ensures that the producer is responsible whether or not he or she was responsible for the defect in a product that caused an injured party to suffer. That power is long overdue and I hope it will do something to reduce the need of the consumer to engage in litigation. However, the Bill does not go far enough in that regard.</P>
    <P>We should seriously consider the irrelevance to the consumer of the court system and our legal structures.  The fact that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade deals with more than 20,000 complaints and inquiries regarding unsatisfactory products and services in any one year underlines the irrelevance of the court system to the consumer.  I have to admit that in many ways the Irish legal system is anti-consumer, because of the tedious delays, the archaic procedures and, most important, because of the cost involved.  The only redress available to the consumer is through the civil law, and that position will not change fundamentally as a result of the Bill.  It may be argued that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has power to institute criminal proceedings against an offending party, but since that office was set up that has not proved to be very important.  It is a weapon that is not used to any great effect by the director.  I consider that the reason for that is that such an action will not help the consumer in any way, it will not compensate the victim.  The fact that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has power to issue legal proceedings of a criminal nature is of little use to the consumer who needs an effective remedy for himself or herself.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, the Office of the Fair Trade Commission and the Ombudsman should <Col N="1151" /> be given the resources annually to engage in something of a public relations campaign. It is amazing that years after the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman in the mid-eighties many people who could well use its services do not know of its existence.  That protects the Government because if people do not know about the office they will not use it.  It would be fair to say that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Ombudsman have gone on public record &mdash; something not done lightly by either of those officials &mdash; to say that every year they are very much strapped for cash.</P>
    <P>The 1984 annual report of the Director of Consumer Affairs stated:</P>
    <P>In previous annual reports I referred to the fact that the present means of seeking redress through legal action through the courts are, in relation to the unsatisfactory goods and services, irrelevant to the vast majority of consumers in most cases of complaint.  In too many cases the rights which the consumers undoubtedly have e.g. under the Sale of Goods Acts, are rights in theory only, since in many cases consumers are not able to, or do not feel able to, pursue these rights in practice through the legal action. </P>
    <P>Those comments should not be taken lightly because they were not meant to be taken lightly.  The report underlines the feeling reflected by the consumer that the legal system is simply not providing redress in the area of consumer rights or liability for defective goods and products.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, whose name is on the back of the Bill, put forward the idea of a small claims court on several occasions.  I did not give the document too much attention at the time, but I remember that when the Minister, the leader of the Progressive Democrats was in Opposition he was anxious to set himself up as a champion of the consumer.  That idea was certainly contained in some of the party's election documents.  Since Deputy O'Malley <Col N="1152" /> became Minister for Industry and Commerce he has not been so vocal in that regard.  I should have thought that the Minister would use this opportunity of extending the law for consumers to put into practice the views he expressed when he was leader of a party in Opposition not so long ago.</P>
    <P>The idea of a small claims court has received sufficient amplification from interested parties throughout the past decade that its establishment would not present a great problem.  The Minister for Justice, who would have certain responsibilities in that regard, is against the concept of a small claims court, and said that the District Court fulfils that role.  The District Court does not fulfil that role because of the costs involved, the delays involved, and the formal procedures attached to the office of the District Court.  We should certainly consider what other jurisdictions have done.  That is what is being done in the debate on the Bill, but we also need to consider the whole concept of a small claims court in the context of what other European states have done quite successfully.</P>
    <P>An argument put forward against the idea of a small claims court is that it would be used as a vehicle against the consumer by debt collection agencies. That argument has been bandied about for quite some time, but the simple answer is that those people would be excluded from having an audience in a small claims court.  The only people who could bring actions would be members of the public in relation to a particular grievance or small claim.  Debt collection agencies and trade creditors would not be allowed to use the services of that court.</P>
    <P>Another argument put forward against the concept of a small claims tribunal or court is that it would be unconstitutional. That argument simply does not hold water.  There are sufficient precedents in the law to rule out that complaint.  I point to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, An Bord Pleanála and the Labour Court as bodies of a quasi judicial nature that were set up without any constitutional impediment or any outcry on behalf of <Col N="1153" /> vested interests that such establishments were contrary to Article 34 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If the House is serious about protecting the consumer this Bill will have to be accompanied by legislation to protect the consumer, to give an element of redress to the consumer that does not exist.  I cannot understand, nor has the Minister fully explained, why primary agricultural products which have not undergone initial processing are exempt from this legislation.  When one considers the Irish economy preparing for the fall-out from 1992, primary agricultural products from this State are of fundamental importance. If we are going to exclude them from legislation we are not doing our green quality image any good.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on his reservations in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is unbelievable in the context of consumer rights in that it excludes any claim under the sum of £350.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary reply.  The question referred to the alleged leaking of a Garda document to the IRA in early April.  It is quite extraordinary for the Minister nearly two months later to say that he cannot give any indication as to whether the allegations had any foundation, having regard to the damage this sort of allegation can have on confidence in the Garda Síochána, to the damage resulting from statements made by members of Parliament in Northern Ireland that there was collusion between the Garda Síochána and the IRA, and in view of the fact that this resulted in the death of a County Tyrone man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Justice informed the House when the investigation commenced, it is necessary that the investigation be thorough, wide-ranging and complete.  The investigation is concerned with the unauthorised possession of a Garda document which received a considerable amount of circulation in the force.  The interviewing of relevant personnel and the necessary follow-up action obviously takes some time.  We do not want to have a rushed or incomplete investigation for the sake of producing a report in a hurry.  It is essential that the investigation be thorough and that we learn lessons from it. As the Minister said earlier and as I said in my initial reply, the Commissioner has informed us that it is expected that the investigation will be completed fairly shortly.</P>

      <P>The report was not ordered by the Minister for Justice nor by the Department although we were in <Col N="1155" /> consultation with the Garda Commissioner immediately it became known that a journalist had been given a photocopy of an internal Garda document. The Garda Commisioner is responsible in law for the internal administration of the force, as well as being the head of the Garda Síochána who are responsible for the investigation of criminal offences.  It was with both of those aspects in mind that the Commissioner appointed a senior Garda officer to investigate the matter.  The Garda Commissioner and the senior officers reviewed the situation immediately after the discovery that this document has been leaked.  I am not privy to exactly what changes were made but I know some changes were made.  Everything depends on the completion of the report.  It is a complex and delicate situation. We await the report.  As soon as it becomes available the Garda Commissioner will take appropriate action.</P>

      <P>I understand that a document proposing a charter of rights for victims of crime is being prepared by the Irish Association for Victim Support and we shall be happy to carefully study its contents.</P>
      <P>We are most conscious of the need to ensure that the rights of the victims of crime are protected and that victims are treated with sympathy and respect in the aftermath of what is for many of them a traumatic and harrowing experience.</P>
      <P>Much is already being done by way of support for the victims of crime.  I am aware that the Garda authorities have taken a number of initiatives in the area of victim support.  In addition to the work done in the normal course of duty by all officers, a very useful and positive arrangement has been made whereby a particular garda is designated as someone who may be contacted by a victim of crime for information or advice in relation to his or her case.  This is a valuable support which helps to dispel the feelings of insecurity and isolation that victims may understandably experience. I wholeheartedly endorse this development which forms an integral part of the support service which victims of crime have a right to expect.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department provide an annual grant-in-aid to the Irish Association for Victim Support, a voluntary body which provides practical and emotional support to victims of crime.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent work done by the association.</P>

      <P>The question asked if the Minister proposed to draw up a charter for victims of crime.  The reply seem to indicate that the Government are abdicating their responsibility to the Irish Association for Victim Support which is a very worthwhile organisation.  Is the Minister aware that the victims of crime are the forgotten people of society, that our laws are out of date in relation to keeping victims and their relatives informed as to what is happening and is he aware that the parents of a child who has been killed are not informed as to when the court case will be heard, that somebody who loses a son through a drunken driving incident is never informed as to when the case will be heard and that as a result of changes made there is no longer provision for pain and suffering as a result of injuries sustained from an attack?  Is the Minister aware that legal aid is not available to victims to take civil actions against people?</P>

      <P>On 2 May 1991 the Minister for Justice set out in detail, in reply to questions tabled by Deputies Mitchell and Durcan, the specific measures which have been taken to counteract drug related criminal activity in this country. I am sure the Deputy does not expect me to go over the same ground again.  I shall, therefore, confine my remarks to a few essential points.</P>
      <P>We are aware of growing concern that this menace, which was brought within bounds in recent years, is re-emerging as a problem on our streets.  We have discussed this issue in depth with the Garda authorities who, while reporting an increase in level of drug seizures in recent years &mdash; mostly cannabis &mdash; say there is no question of the problem being on the scale which existed some years ago.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that the drugs problem is continuing to receive priority attention from a law enforcement point of view.  All members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drug misuse within their operational area.  In addition, specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and at present small specialist units are in operation in Dublin's north inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and Tallaght.  Similar specialist units are set up on a temporary basis in other areas as required.  The strategies employed include intelligence gathering and analysis, surveillance, targeting and monitoring the activities of suspects, as well as routine investigations.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the strategies are proving very effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the legislative side, the Minister for Justice has announced plans which I believe will make a major contribution towards the fight against drugs.  Very <Col N="1160" /> shortly legislation will be published to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and money laundering.  I have no doubt that this legislation will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>However, law enforcement on its own will never solve the drugs problem.  This is an area in which the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for our young people is at least as important as the Garda response.</P>
    <P>The need for a national drugs strategy has been recognised by the Government. My colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, Minister for Health, recently launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  Our intention is to tackle the drug problem on every front.  Realistic and achievable objectives have been set for the reduction of both the supply of and the demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Reynolds, Minister for Finance, in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Spring on 22 May 1991 gave details of the compensatory measures which will be taken by law enforcement agencies in member states to combat drug trafficking arising from the removal of internal frontiers in the European Community at the end of 1992.</P>

      <P>What steps is the Minister taking to enlist community support from parents, teachers, schools, youth organisations, residents' associations, churches and the news media to enlist their support to try to deal with the increasing drug problem?

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give the average waiting time for appointments with a solicitor for first time clients for each of the Dublin civil legal aid centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Legal Aid Board that at the moment, in so far as the Aston House and Ormond Quay law centres are concerned, there is a waiting period of up to eight weeks to see a solicitor in non-emergency cases. The Tallaght law centre and the Gardiner Street law centres are currently not receiving new cases of a non-emergency nature, mainly because of vacancies for solicitors which have arisen and are in the process of being filled.  In all four law centres special treatment is afforded to emergency cases, that is, those cases which in the opinion of the board merit immediate access to a solicitor.</P>
      <P>The overall position should improve in the Dublin area when two solicitors are appointed to fill vacancies in the Tallaght and Gardiner Street law centres and when the two new recently announced law centres at Clondalkin and Finglas/Ballymun are opened by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply, although it masks the real problem, gives a harrowing picture of the position in Dublin.  Will the Minister elaborate on his statement that the major problem for Tallaght and Gardiner Street is the absence of two solicitors?  Will he accept that the basic problem is the sheer volume of people trying to gain access to law centres?  There is certainly a problem in regard to staffing, but the major problem is the sheer volume of people seeking access to the law centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to open new law centres all over the country but we must have regard to the financial implications.  We must cut our cloth according to our measure.  I agree that in Dublin city there is a major demand for <Col N="1163" /> this service.  However, Deputy McCartan will agree that, on the recommendations of the board of the legal aid service, we have expanded the service.  We are creating new centres, we have made more resources available and new staff are being recruited.  I am sure he, as a professional in the field, will also accept that no matter who wants to see a solicitor there is a waiting period.  We are doing what we can to ensure that this is minimised and that where there is an emergency access is immediately available to those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the objective of the public civil legal aid scheme should be to put poor litigants on the same footing as those who can afford to pay?  Would he further accept that a person does not have to wait up to eight weeks to see a lawyer in the private sector to obtain advice and that his comment that two new centres will be opened hides the fact that the centre at Aston Quay has been closed and the staff dispersed and that no additional lawyers have been made available in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that the legal aid centre at Aston Quay should be closed and two new centres opened in its place was made by the Legal Aid Board who decided that further law centres were needed but not in Dublin where there are four centres.  The number will be increased to five shortly.  The additional law centres to be provided will be located in Letterkenny, Castlebar and Dundalk which are not serviced by full-time law centres at present.  The purpose of this scheme is to ensure that a service is available to those who cannot afford to pay legal fees.  I am confident we will continue to improve the service with the resources available.</P>

      <P>The vigilance of the Garda Síochána is counteracting that and they have taken control of the situation over the past year in particular.  The Government are concerned about the escalating cost of liability insurance and are committed to the reform of the <Col N="1170" /> present system for the determination of personal injury cases in the courts.  The question of establishing a specialist tribunal to deal with personal injuries is one possibility that is being considered, other possibilities include changing the existing procedures governing the conduct of personal injuries actions which give rise to costs.  The working party, formed at the invitation of the Attorney General, are carrying out a broad examination of the cost aspect of personal injuries actions with a view to increasing the efficiency and reducing the cost of such actions.</P>

      <P>In his earlier reply the Minister indicated, and he seemed to amplify this just now, that a specialist tribunal might be established.  Will the Minister clarify the position?  Is the commitment in the programme not as firm as we were led to believe heretofore and is something that is only a possibility and one of a number of options and may not be acted upon?  Will the Minister of State indicate at what level this investigation is taking place?  Is it an interdepartmental investigation or an investigation within his own Department solely?  Will a subcommittee or an official of the Minister be appointed to look at the matter?  What formal structure exists to investigate this important issue?  Will the conclusions of the investigation be returned to the social partners and the House for consideration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has on a number of occasions, in reply to parliamentary questions, indicated to the House that we accept the need for updating our criminal laws and that in fact we are doing a good deal about it with all the speed that the resources at our disposal allow.</P>
      <P>With regard to the type of legislation which seems to be referred to in the question, I might mention that we have before the House the Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, which proposes to replace the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, and penalises the unauthorised modification and accessing of computer data.  Also, we hope shortly to be in a position to publish a Criminal Evidence Bill which, among other things, will provide for the admissibility as evidence in criminal matters of business and computerised records.  We will also be introducing a Bill to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crime and the prevention of money-laundering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the area of the law dealing with crimes of dishonesty, the Larceny Act, 1990, which the Minister for Justice initiated, updates and refines the law on receiving.  The Law Reform Commission are at present conducting a comprehensive review on the law on other aspects of dishonesty and their report, <Col N="1172" /> when published, will be receiving our early attention.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office as Minister for Justice in July 1989 Deputy Burke has promoted other important legislation to deal with modern day crime &mdash; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, for example, provides for very strict controls on the carrying of offensive weapons and, effectively, bans stun guns; and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, provides for the taking of bodily samples for DNA and other forensic testing.</P>
    <P>This record is clear evidence of progress in updating the area of the law referred to by the Deputy.  It shows this Government's commitment to law reform and to ensuring that we have better and more modern legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the Minister of State that the words used in this question, &ldquo;Garda have to operate under outdated Statutes against increasingly professionalised and sophisticated criminals&rdquo;, are the words used by the Director of Public Prosecutions in a recent speech.  I am sure the Minister of State will take what the Director of Public Prosecutions said seriously.  Will he agree that, despite the progress made over the past number of years, we still have an increasing crime problem?  Would he not agree it is time to set up a criminal law reform commission, headed by a High Court judge, to review all statutes in relation to criminal law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Director of Public Prosecutions said and I agree with much of what Deputy Barrett said.  We have to be absolutely certain that we are at one on what the exact situation is.  The Deputy talked about a special high powered commission but the Minister dealt with this in a reply to a question in this House on 2 May last.  He indicated he had no proposals to establish such a separate law reform commission. While he accepted that significant areas of our criminal law require review and updating he pointed out that the resources we can devote to law reform <Col N="1173" /> are limited and that the best use that can be made of these resources is to target these areas where the need for review and reform is greatest.  He pointed out also that work is not finished when a commission reports and make recommendations for legislation but that further considerable work has to go into preparing and drafting Bills to implement the recommendations both in our Department and in the draftsman's office, as is the case with all Departments.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Barrett is accurate when he says there is an increasing level of crime.  The crime level has been well contained by the tremendous vigilance of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Barrett in urging the Minister of State to review the position of his Department in regard to the establishment of a separate law reform commission on criminal law. Is it the position of the Minister, and his Department, that no legislation will emanate from the Department until the Law Reform Commission issue reports, recommendations and draft legislation? Are there any proposals in the Department, the office of the Attorney General or any other Government Department, to deal with commercial fraud?  Is there anything in the offing or will the Government await the report of the Law Reform Commission before anything is done?</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy we are working on several Bills.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, gave a list over the past two months and I gave some indications of what we are doing. We are still working on other Bills and we will continue to do so.  We are giving priority to the areas in need of greatest reform.  We will make as much progress as we can to ensure that the laws are adequate to deal with the various problems we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that there is no greater priority, outside the jobs crisis, than the need to tackle crime that affects ordinary citizens? Will the Minister agree that the only way to update all our laws which are badly in need of updating &mdash; all one has to do is to open the newspapers to read what the judges are saying in court &mdash; is to set up a special law reform commission to review all criminal laws.  There is no point in rectifying our economy, having our balance of payments in order, if people cannot walk the streets or leave their home without the fear that their house will be broken into or that they will be mugged on our streets?</P>

      <P>The Government are concerned about the level of crime and the Minister for Justice has published a detailed and comprehensive crime fighting package.  In the period 1984-90 crime figures fell by about 12 per cent overall from 99,727 to 87,658 crimes, while the <Col N="1175" /> number of convictions rose by 10 per cent from 16,396 to 17,957.  Within these overall figures there are very encouraging trends: offences against the person dropped by 30 per cent from 2,331 offences to 1,631 offences, attacks on the elderly, a despicable type of crime, fell by almost 90 per cent from 432 to 51, residential burglaries came down by 19 per cent from 18,774 to 15,160, unauthorised taking of cars dropped by 44 per cent from 18,735 to 10,521, larcenies from the person dropped by 23 per cent from 5,842 to 4,495&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>For 1984 to 1990. Deaths on the road were reduced by traffic law enforcement on an unprecedented scale and came down 25 per cent in the first quarter of this year from 122 to 90, and armed raids, which peaked at 685 in 1986, were down 33 per cent by 1990 to 459.  This is positive statistical proof of the efforts we have made, the prioritising of resources and the commitment by the Garda Síochána to bringing criminals to justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this question refers to the sophisticated criminal who can use modern technology and computerisation? We are not talking about the old fashioned type of crime but about crimes such as commercial fraud which are being reported almost on a weekly basis.  Huge sums of money can be transferred from businesses and companies in the semi-State sector as well as companies in the banking sector and our laws have not been updated to deal with this yuppie, sophisticated type of criminal. Obviously we are concerned about other types of crime, but there is also a need to deal with criminals of this kind.  The gardaí cannot tackle the problem because the statutes are out of date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

The Data Protection Act has been put in place and the impact of new technology is being appraised.  We will bring forward legislation if we feel it is necessary.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether towns and villages in rural areas have become targets for city criminals; and the plans he has, if any, to cope with this alarming trend.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, from reports which I have received from the Garda authorities, that there has been a slight increase in the level of recorded crime in some rural areas over the past year or so.  While it could not be assumed that city based criminals are to blame in all instances, the Garda authorities report that these criminals have tended to commit more crimes in towns and villages on the periphery of large urban areas. There is nothing new in the fact that city based criminals behave in this way and, while not wishing in any way to minimise the problem, I think it worth making the point that the increase is mainly attributable to a rise in the number of minor larcenies committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have assured me that the situation is being monitored by them and that divisional officers have recently prepared a programme of measures designed to address the problem.  It would not be appropriate for me, obviously, to disclose the details of these measures but I can say that they include the use of additional patrols and special check points.  In addition, the gardaí are continuing to encourage and promote community involvement in crime prevention activities through the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes. There are about 1,046 neighbourhood watch schemes now in operation covering 202,175 households; and community alert schemes are in place in 245 <Col N="1177" /> locations.  There is no greater aid to effective policing than community alertness, co-operation with the gardaí and willingness to inform the gardaí when suspicious activities are observed.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural policing arrangements generally, we are currently examining comprehensive proposals aimed at securing an enhanced service to the public from the Garda Síochána in the areas affected.  These proposals do not involve the closure of any Garda station or any reduction in Garda numbers attached to stations which might benefit from the scheme.  We intend to make decisions in relation to all aspects of the rural policing reform proposals in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from general proposals for rural policing, we are assured that Garda resources will continue to be deployed to best advantage and that the assignment of additional gardaí to meet the special requirements of any particular area will be arranged as needs dictate and in keeping with the best interest of the community in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct that there is no intention to close any rural Garda stations, particularly after the local elections? What provisions is the Minister making regarding the manning of rural Garda stations to deal with the growth of rural crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has made it quite clear &mdash; and I confirm it now &mdash; that there are no plans to close, downgrade or reduce the services provided by any rural Garda stations. That is absolute.  The Minister for Justice has already announced publicly that Garda management, in consultation with officials of our Department and with the Garda representative associations, are engaged in a review of current policing systems to see whether they fully meet the needs of the public or whether by reorganisation or other means they can be made more efficient, modern and more responsive to community needs.  No decisions have yet been taken on foot of the review.  We are acutely conscious of <Col N="1178" /> the advantages which accure to both the public and the Garda Síochána from the close relationship which has traditionally existed between them and we are determined that if any changes are introduced they will not in any way interfere with this special community relationship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Garda management have submitted plans to the Minister and that discussions and consultations have taken place between the Garda, senior civil servants and the Minister for Justice in relation to the bringing into being of plans which will effectively downgrade and reduce the hours of opening of many Garda stations in 11 specific areas?  Is it not a fact that it is intended to close rural Garda stations for 163 hours per week, reopening for five hours only to the general public?  Is it not a fact that this is to take place in the third week of July?  I ask for a detailed and comprehensive reply because of the seriousness of the matter and the concern and alarm being felt by large numbers of people throughout rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Enright says.  We are discussing with the management of the Garda Síochána the whole situation, particularly community policing.  The purpose of community policing is to provide 24 hour cover for the entire community, to make sure that gardaí are as mobile as possible and can get to the scene of the crime very quickly.  Some changes will have to be made but Deputy Enright will accept that a number of Garda stations around the country seem to have been permanently closed for a number of years.  The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; system has never really worked. All this is being examined.  There is a new recruitment campaign to provide proper community 24 hour cover for the people. of the country and we are totaly committed to that.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you were good enough last night to allow me raise on the Adjournment a particular problem that arose in my constituency. Since it is a general problem and there is <Col N="1179" /> an acceptance by the Minister that crime is being exported from this country and city to the counties bounding Dublin, will the Minister again review the green man system which is really useless in a town like Carnew which has two divisions beside it and can get gardaí from either place at certain times in the week?  Will the Minister also recognise the mobility of criminals which is sometimes even better than that of the gardaí and the increasing crime in the countries borderng Dublin, and will he ensure that in the summer months and in future we will see more evidence of Garda activity in and throughout these counties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

Deputy Kavanagh would agree that the Garda were quickly on the scene to deal with a group of people who went there from the capital city for the day where, apart from drink, there were other problems that compounded the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister reconcile community policing with the concept of the green man?  Will the Minister accept that the green man is a brother of the green box which has replaced the rural post office throughout the country? It is no substitute for a Garda presence on the ground.  Would the Minister confirm that the rationalisation programme that is not being put forward by the Department of Justice along the lines of that which has been in existence in Thomastown, County Kilkenny and in County Mayo since the mid-eighties, has been a failure and that there is little point expanding that service to other parts of rural Ireland?  Would he agree that what we are seeing is a rationalisation programme which will not come into effect until after 27 June, that it is, in effect, a dressed up cutback that will close down many rural Garda stations?  Will the <Col N="1180" /> Minister cast his eye over Question No. 105 which is related to what we are dealing with now, and confirm that Garda sergeants are being appointed in rural Ireland?  I understand they are not.</P>

I want to assure Deputy Flanagan that we do not propose to close down or downgrade rural Garda stations.

      <P>On the problem of mobile criminal gangs moving from major urban areas in Dublin, should the Minister and the commissioner not be considering the re-establishment of mobilised specialist units of the Garda Síochána, such as the special task force that was disbanded some time ago, to deal with the mobile criminals?  Would the Minister agree that the best way of effectively dealing with these people is not through this concept of community policing but by equipping the garda to pursue effectively?  Would the Minister also agree that the restoration of the walkie-talkie as a simple device for mobile patrols is an important issue in this area so that gardaí on mobile patrol can keep in contact with one another to effectively pursue the criminal who is now mobile and moving into rural areas?</P>

In answer to a question of the Adjournment last night and to an earlier question here I have outlined the strategy <Col N="1181" /> of the Garda Síochána that various specialist units are being put together to deal with particular problems in particular areas.  I am confident that the necessary measures will be put in place to reduce the level of crime and the opportunity for crime in the interests of the community.</P>

There is a serious crime problem in Dublin, but would the Minister agree that there has been a 6 per cent increase in indictable crime outside Dublin in rural Ireland?

      <askee>Minister for Justice,</askee>
      <Quest>in the light of the inadequate rehabilitative treatment of our offenders and the underfunding in this area, his views on the extent to which our prison service has an adequate rehabilitative effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to deal fully with all the complex issues that arise in relation to this topic by way of answer to a parliamentary question and I shall confine myself to bringing out the essential points.  Before I do so I want to say, and I am sure the House will agree, that it would be most unfortunate if anything were to be said here today which would tend to undermine the efforts of prison management and staff, and all of the support services in the prisons, in the difficult job they perform on behalf of our community.</P>
      <P>While the primary purpose of the prison system is to maintain in safe custody offenders sentenced to prisons and places of detention by the courts, a central element of prison policy is to provide offenders with services and facilites which will encourage them to use their time in prison constructively and help them to lead law-abiding and self-supportive lives on their release.  Civilised penal systems the world over have been forced to face the reality that prisons of themselves cannot rehabilitate people and that all that can be hoped and aimed for is that prisoners, by availing of a range of helpful services, may be encouraged to rehabilitate themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our prison system has a wide range of institutions, from high security to open centres, available to meet the varying needs of different individuals.  Within these institutions an extensive range of services is made available including educational, work training, medical, psychiatric, psychological, welfare and chaplaincy services.  These services have been detailed to the House on a number of occasions in the past and are dealt with fully in the annual reports on the prisons <Col N="1186" /> which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>It is quite incorrect to suggest that the prison system has been under funded. Total expenditure on prisons in the last ten years has been over £610.7 million. The amount provided for 1991 in the Prisons Vote is almost £81 million, including £7.2 million for the probation and welfare service and £500,000 for work and work training.  Teachers' salaries are not paid from the Prisons Vote but are paid directly by the Department of Education and ultimately by vocational education committees and amount to some £1.75 million a year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the extent to which the prison system is geared to provde help, encouragement and facilities for prisoners to rehabilitate themselves is satisfactory and that the funding provided is relatively generous when the needs of the many other vital social services are fully taken into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to you, Sir, that it is not the purpose of this question to undermine the services or staff of the Prison Service.  Having given that reply, can the Minister say to this House that he is satisfied that prisoners are getting rehabilitation in prison with the budgets available to his Department? I have to disagree with him if that is to be his answer.  Can he say part of the problem is that many of the prisoners having spent some time there come out having attended, so to speak, the university of criminals in prison rather than being rehabilitated, as evidenced by the return of prisoners to the same establishments after a very short period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that tremendous work has been done in this area.  A tremendous new approach has been taken over the last few years.  We must all accept that, as has been traditional over the years, a significant proportion of offenders may be expected to be recommitted to prisons for new offences.  Prior to their committal many offenders have had little or no opportunity to realise their potential skills or <Col N="1187" /> resources.  Many of them have had little or no education or work skills and many come from socially deprived backgrounds. Obviously, the ability of any prison regime successfully to overcome such long term disadvantages and antisocial tendencies must be limited and we must acknowledge that.  The range of services and activites available in our places of custody as I have outlined &mdash; medical, welfare, educational, work training and others &mdash; have the broad effect of educating offenders so that they may be encouraged to turn away from antisocial behaviour and be prepared to lead useful lives on their return to normal life.  It is important to acknowledge, however, that the prison system cannot do the impossible. A great deal is up to the individual, taking into account the level of opportunity created for him within the prison system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that about 27 per cent of the prison population is under 21 years of age?  Is he further aware that the one common denominator they have is high levels of illiteracy and poor educational records and performance? Is he further aware that prevention is better than cure?  I assume he is.  Have his Department been in consultation with other Departments with a view to bringing about prevention?  Have they looked at various programmes?  For example, have they evaluated the effects the educational cutbacks have had on the increase in juvenile crime?  Particularly over the last three years have they evaluated the huge increase in the number of child sexual abuse reported cases, which is obviously increasing the number of disturbed children in our communities? Have they made any attempt to put together a programme to provide more resources for schools and more resources for health boards so that we might prevent such crimes?</P>

      <P>Absolutely.  We are constantly co-ordinating our activities. There has been constant liaison on the prison service between the Department of Justice, the Department of Education and the Department of Health as well as in particular areas with various professional bodies and, where necessary, with health boards in ensuring that we provide an adequate range of services for prisoners.  Deputy Cotter has given us a percentage of people under a specific age. That means he is taking into account all those people who may not necessarily be in confined prisons.  We must have proper comparisons.</P>

      <P>May I put to the Minister who claims that tremendous work has been done in this area that it is not showing in the results in terms of the number of prisoners who are going back time and again to prison?  Would he accept that one of the first steps that must be taken is the reactivation of the prison building programme?  That would help the prison services to move away from the old Victorian and overcrowded institutions that simply cannot accommodate any proper rehabilitative programmes. Secondly, would the Minister agree that there is need for a major expansion and investment in the area of probationary and supervisory services as opposed to the simple lock up system that is being used time and again as the mainstay of our prison system?</P>

We must accept that the criminal element is created by people who probably for one reason or another find themselves in a situation where they resort to this type of life.  I think Deputy Garland took me out of context.  I did not say that a large percentage of people go back to prison, I said a significant proportion do.  We must accept that this is happening not just in Ireland but all over the world.

Would he not agree also that the present system of either detention, bail or whatever is not working and that we need to apply more resources, whether in terms of our educational system, of changes in our laws or by way of making parents more responsible for the activities of 13 and 14 year olds? Would he agree that it is the responsibility of a parent to take account of the activities of their children?  And that it is not acceptable that we can read in our newspapers that 13 and 14 year olds are breaking into homes in the middle of the night and engaging in acts of vandalism? Would the Minister not agree also that we need to change our laws and apply more investment in the whole area of detention centres so that when we have young offenders in these centres they will get the help they need?  Would the Minister accept, too, that the parents of these children should get the help they need because otherwise young offenders will return to a home where parents are not accepting their responsibility, and the law is not taking that into account?</P>

While the prison officers' essential task is to maintain safe custody and control, they also play a central part in all of the efforts being made to encourage the offender to turn away from criminal behaviour on his release.  Apart from that the expenditure on the support services is quite considerable and I have detailed this already. I accept what Deputy Barrett has said, that we must constantly change, improve and reform our laws and reinforce the laws.

    <Title>Liability for Defective Products Bill, 1991: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to Question Time I was dealing with specific matters in the Bill which give rise to concern.  Now that the Minister of State has returned I would ask him when replying to Second Stage to reflect on these matters with particular reference to section 3 and the introduction into Irish law of an excess provision. This is unprecedented.  It is a practice that insurance companies have been carrying out with some effect in recent times, particularly as regards premiums. One may pay a lower premium which appears at first sight to be attractive, but when a claim is made one finds the excess is on a sliding scale.  It could be from £250 to £1,000.  It is regrettable that we should see the introduction of such a practice into Irish law.  It is even more regrettable and scandalous that it should be introduced in an area of consumer legislation, having regard to the comments I made earlier on the absence of a small claims tribunal or a consumer court.  One can look to what directors of <Col N="1235" /> consumer affairs and fair trade commissioners have said about the irrelevance of the legal system, on which I spoke at some length earlier.  People are simply not bringing claims to court because they have lost faith in the courts system.  The people who have lost faith in the system are those who seek a remedy for a claim of a couple of hundred pounds.</P>
      <P>The Minister will, I am sure, be aware that this Bill is geared towards the consumer. The defective products could be anything from a washing machine to a hoover or any consumer goods which generally have a life span of between five and ten years.  These cases make up a significant number of the 20,000 complaints which the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade deals with on an annual basis.  It is sad that these people are not covered by the legislation.  Is it a coincidence that the price of such goods as hoovers, washing machines and portable televisions is under £350?  While this reforming legislation is a welcome change for the consumers, large numbers of consumers are totally neglected by the legislation, and that is sad.  I would ask the Minister to expand in some detail on why this is the case.  Will he say the reason is to minimise the number of claims or to obviate some deluge of spurious and frivolous claims?  There are procedures in existence that could adequately deal with those problems without introducing this excess provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the excess is even more stark with the introduction of a power under section 3 (3) which enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce to amend or revoke an order made under this section &mdash; in other words, it will be entirely within the power and jurisdiction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to increase the scale as he or she from time to time may wish.  At a time when we should be making the law more accessible to consumers, when we should be broadening the whole area of consumer rights, quality guarantees and value for money, it is regrettable that our law should reflect this excess or absence <Col N="1236" /> of provision for small claims, particularly when there is no tribunal in existence to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deserves some consideration. Subsection (1) of that section states that an action for the recovery of damages shall not be brought after the expiration of three years from the date on which the cause of action accrued or the date on which the plantiff became aware, or should reasonably have become aware, of the damage, the defect and the identity of the producer.  I congratulate the Minister on that addendum to the standard limitation of actions.  It is very important that not only should the three year rule exist but that the limitation should be extended to the date upon which the plantiff became aware, or should reasonably have become aware, of the defect in the product.  That is in line with other legislation that is going through the House at present, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill.  I certainly welcome section 7 (1) of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bernard Durkan mentioned specifically in the course of his address the question of house building and house building materials.  That is a matter that will have to be addressed in the House by way of legislation.  The national house-builders' guarantee scheme merely grants to the holder of a certificate a six year guarantee but a difficulty arises where the defect does not come to light within that period.  That gives rise to significant hardship throughout the country. It is not a matter that can be immediately addressed in this legislation but I hope the Minister will address it by way of regulation or alternatively incorporate it in the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill that is going through the House.  If a person is selling a house, perhaps 15 or 20 years after buying it, it may be only when it is being surveyed that a latent defect such as a burst pipe under the concrete is brought to the notice of that person.  This immediately represents a serious impediment on the sale and can give rise to considerable hardship.  Unfortunately, in such a case there is no remedy in law.  I congratulate the Minister on section 7 (1) and hope <Col N="1237" /> that provision is incorporated in future legislation.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill it is regrettable that the Minister has not seen fit to make a statement on the concept of a small claims court.  We are not requesting a tribunal which would pay compensation but which would right the wrong that has been done.  There is provision in this legislation for a minimum claim of £350. If we take the example of a defective matter such as a dead insect in a piece of apple pie, which is quite a common claim, or a foreign body in a tin of beans &mdash; again something that is a feature of many claims &mdash; the level of compensation awarded by the courts in such cases is less than £350.  It is a pity this legislation, if enacted in its present form, will not provide for such defects.  As a result the old negligence principles will still have to be applied, giving rise to delays, archaic practices and, perhaps more importantly, expense.  This will mean that consumers will not claim because they will not regard themselves as having an effective remedy and ultimately the company producing the defective goods or product will not be brought to answer.  Hence the standards of that company may not be as high or as quality orientated as they might otherwise be.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I hope the Minister will consider several amendments in the interests of the consumer and, perhaps more important, provide the House and the general public with a long-awaited commitment towards the setting up of a forum, a court, a tribunal or whatever one might wish to call it, the hallmarks of which would be efficiency, lack of expense and informality.  The chairman of the body could be any respected member of the community, and hearings could be held regionally where, for a fee of less than £5, a member of the public could have his or her grievance adjudicated on, not with a view towards granting compensation but with a view towards granting an amount equivalent to what the person lost on a defective item such as a hoover or a washing machine.  The Minister must accept it is <Col N="1238" /> high time that such a structure be set up for the benefit of the consumer.  When one considers that the Liability for Defective Products Bill comes from the European Community, we see Ireland as being almost a Cinderella state in so far as a small claims forum is concerned.  There is little point in updating our consumer legislation with this type of window dressing unless we are prepared to bring forward the entire package.  I do not have any objections in principle to the Bill, which is welcome and perhaps overdue.</P>

      <P>I express my appreciation to Deputies on all sides of the House for their constructive contributions to the Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>I shall try to deal with most, if not all, the queries raised.  There will be an opportunity to deal with the various matters in detail on Committee Stage so I shall not give a Committee Stage type reply now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members are generally in favour of the main thrust of the Bill.  Deputies Hogan, Taylor, McCartan, Flanagan and others mentioned the length of time that was taken to introduce this very important Bill.  The Bill represents such a fundamental change in existing law that it was essential for the Government to get it absolutely right.  The reasons for that were explained in reply to questions in June 1990 and April 1991.  Other consumer directives have been implemented in the meantime by the Minister, including measures to deal with misleading advertising, doorstep selling and food labelling.  Of the twelve member states, nine have introduced legislation, two &mdash; Spain and France &mdash; have not yet introduced legislation and we in Ireland have now brought forward this legislation.  It was vital that full consultation was carried out with all interested parties because the Bill is of great significance.  The so-called delay in introducing the provision to Irish law was caused by a number of unavoidable factors.  The main reasons were a lengthy consultation process with a wide range of interested parties; the drafting <Col N="1239" /> of the legislation, which required much detailed and painstaking research, taking longer than expected; and the heavy workload of both the Department and the office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flanagan and Hogan raised the issue of small claims.  The commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to examine the existing procedures to deal with claims involving small amounts of money is being followed by my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  Many issues need to be considered, including the issue of whether changes can be made in the existing legal procedures, including the court system, so as to make it easier for consumers to obtain redress in cases for which they are prevented from so doing because of the potential cost involved.  The points made by Deputies Flanagan and Hogan and others on this issue will be taken into consideration by the Minister and by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>In reply to comments made by Deputy Hogan, I advise that a sister directive to the present directive is under discussion in Brussels.  That will provide for liability of providers of services.  That is something that will be of great interest to consumers.  Consumers would have many concerns and much dissatisfaction in relation to services and would like to have some form of redress.</P>
    <P>The question of the exclusion of primary agricultural products was raised by Deputies Hogan, Barry, McCartan and Durkan.  In my earlier speech I explained that primary agricultural producers were excluded as such produce could be difficult to monitor because of environment hazards outside of the control of the producer. I also explained that virtually all of the other member states had excluded such produce from the scope of their implementing legislation.  For most of the time that the directive was under negotiation in Brussels, between 1975 and 1985, the main Opposition parties were in Government.  When in power they were completely against the idea of the inclusion of primary agricultural products. That would not be a good reason <Col N="1240" /> for my Government to go along with that policy but we decided, in the interests of our farming community, who are under immense pressure at all times, and in the interests of a level playing pitch, that it would be unfair to include the Irish farmer in relation to primary agricultural products.  I must point out, however, that for the processing of primary agricultural products the processor is liable.</P>
    <P>The points made by Deputy Barry about the high standards attained by Ireland in the production of agricultural products are quite reasonable.  Irish agricultural products are renowned throughout the world.  The inclusion of agricultural products in the Bill would be a good, strong marketing point.  Nevertheless, the liability of the processors of the product would cover occasions when any tampering with the primary product might occur.  The companies involved in processing would have to take into account the liability of the producer.  In the circumstances, I feel that it was a wise decision to exclude primary producers of agricultural products, including fish and poultry.  I stand by that decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan spoke about consultation with interested parties.  In 1987, a detailed discussion document on the directive was sent to all interested parties, including the industry, farmers, the trade union movement and consumers. Seminars on the directive were held in all regions to acquaint people with the situation and to take their views into account when the legislation was drafted. My Department, together with the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Confederation of Irish Industry, were involved in the seminars.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the subject of higher insurance costs.  Experience in the United Kingdom, where the directive has had the force of law since 1987, has shown no discernible increase in insurance cover costs.  It is likely that the same position will pertain here.  Indeed, the point made by Deputy Cullimore explained the position very well.  The directive will provide a powerful incentive to producers and manufacturers to provide better quality products.  If that happens there can be <Col N="1241" /> no reason for an increase in insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>As I explained in my speech, in the definition of defective products the Bill follows very closely the wording of the directive and its provisions.  Because of the nature of the directive that course was necessary.  In defining when a product is considered defective we have used the wording of the directive.  That is the proper course of action, and it is to be recommended.</P>
    <P>The points made by Deputy Taylor in relation to the difficulties experienced by haemophiliacs <i>vis-á-vis</i> the AIDS epidemic do not apply to this Bill.  However, as the Deputy raised the matter in all sincerity, I shall comment on it.  Even if this law had been enacted before now, the state of the art defence would still have been available to the importers or producers of the blood product in question. This matter is being considered at the moment.  Indeed, when I was in the Department of Health I chaired a group preparing a report on the subject. Though I have great sympathy with the position in which haemophiliacs find themselves in this regard, quite frankly, I think that the Bill would not apply to haemophiliacs who contract the AIDS virus by way of blood transfusion.  I will bear in mind the points made by Deputy Taylor but I presume he will have an opportunity to put them to my colleague the Minister for Health on another day. We are all aware this issue is causing great concern.</P>
    <P>In relation to the involvement of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Roche, this Bill will be part of our civil law and it will essentially be a matter for the parties involved to resolve any problems arising in relation to a defective product.  The director has a function as set down in the 1978 Consumer Information Act to publicise consumer protection legislation and he performs this function in various ways, such as the publication of leaflets and advising consumers of their rights.  He will perform a similar function in relation to the measures in the Bill.  Deputy <Col N="1242" /> Roche asked if a consumer can take a case here in respect of a product imported into the country.  This Bill will be part of Irish law and a case can be initiated under it in an Irish court.  I would point to the European Judgments Convention given effect to in law here in 1988.  This provides for the enforcement in one country of the Community of a judgment issued by a court in another Community country.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan mentioned difficulties in relation to the Council of Europe Convention and wondered why this had taken so long.  While the Council of Europe Convention was adopted in 1976, discussion had already commenced on a draft EC Directive on the subject, and it was decided to await the outcome of these discussions before introducing changes in law here.  This was a sensible decision as the likelihood was that, having given effect to the Council of Europe Convention, we would soon have had to change our law again to give effect to the directive.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan also mentioned the reports of the joint committee.  The first two reports were produced while the draft directive was still under discussion, well before the shape of the measure which finally emerged was known.  The third report of the joint committee on the directive was one of the many documents and submissions considered by the Government in the preparation of this measure.  Deputy McCartan described in detail the opposition to this measure as expressed to the committee by various representative bodies.  The position now is that bodies representing trade and manufacturing interests are pressing strongly for the introduction of this measure as they are anxious to have clarified before 1992 the legal situation which will apply to all member states.</P>
    <P>We had no option but to include the limit of £350.  The directive imposes such a limit and member states have no choice but to include it.  The lower limit included in the directive &mdash; 500 ECUs &mdash; has not been revised to date.  As the Deputy pointed out, there is provision in Article 18 of the directive for revision of the <Col N="1243" /> amounts mentioned in the directive but this has not been used yet.</P>
    <P>Section 12 was included for reasons of consistency in relation to the Courts Act, 1988.  It seeks to ensure that the situation that applies to other proceedings will apply to proceedings taken under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ten year limit, section 7 (2) (a) relates to the defective product and in particular to the life expectancy of the product.  The right of action in respect of any product expires ten years after that product has been placed on the market. Obviously, some products will have a much shorter safe working life while others would be expected to last much longer.  During discussions on the directive, the ten year period was generally considered to be a good average standard safe working life.  The principle of discoverability of damage is provided for in section 7 (1).</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the principle of awareness of damage stems from the fact that many personal injuries or property damage caused by defective products are not immediately obvious, that is slow acting toxic substances inadvertently incorporated into some component of the product, whose effects may not be felt for some time after contact with the defective product.  In the same way a defective product may cause damage to property over a period of time, possibly vibrations from an item of machinery might gradually weaken part of the structure of a building.  Also, the connection between the personal injury or property damage and the defect may not be immediately apparent.  If the three year time limit for recovery of damages set out in subsection 1 of this section were to run from the date on which the injury or damage was sustained rather than on the date on which the injury or damage was discovered, the right of action could have expired before the injured party became aware of any problem.</P>
    <P>In addition, the question of awareness of injury provides the basis of the proposed amendment to the Statute of Limitations, 1957, which is currently before <Col N="1244" /> the Seanad.  These measures, which incorporate the time limit and principles which I have already described, are being taken in response to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission as set out in their <i>Report on the Statute of Limitations: Claims in respect of Latent Personal Injuries.</i></P>
    <P>I should like to quote the following in reply to the point about member states:</P>
    <P>(b)  Development Risks Defence: Included by the UK, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Germany (except for pharmaceuticals).  Excluded by Luxembourg. </P>
    <P>In relation to the wording of defences allowed, that is dealt with in section 6 (d). Deputy McCartan queried the position of the consumer damaged by what he called the inept application by the producer of the provisions of a European enactment. The question to be decided in such a case is whether the producer was or was not in compliance with the enactment in question.  If he was complying with a legal requirement, he would not be liable under this new regime, but if his product did not so comply, the producer would not have this defence available to him.</P>
    <P>A quality mark for Irish products was mentioned by Deputy Durkan.  This concept is already recognised as is evidenced by the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; symbol and the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; symbol which appears on many products.  It is also the underlying concept behind the attainment by Irish manufacturers of the standard of quality necessary for the awarding of the ISO 9000 certificates.  As I have indicated, an increasing number of Irish manufacturers are reaching the required level of excellence in production methods.  I would encourage all manufacturing companies to seek to obtain the ISO 9000.  We hope to have 400 by the end of 1991.  There are over 2,500 manufacturing companies in the export field.  They should aspire to achieving that excellence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the £350 excess in section 3 (1) and I covered that earlier in replying to Deputy McCartan. It relates to damage to property but not <Col N="1245" /> to personal injury caused by the defective product.</P>
    <P>From reading the Bill, Deputies will appreciate why it took some time to prepare it.  It is very important legislation and is of great benefit to consumers and, ultimately, to our exporters.  We must maintain the quality of our products internationally.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The legislation before the House is forward-looking in its approach.  The Bill establishes for the first time a range of rights for all employees in relation to the payment of wages.  The Bill enshrines three basic rights, the right of every employee to a readily negotiable mode of wage payment; the right of every employee to a written statement of wages and deductions; and protection for every employee against unlawful deductions from wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill originates in a discussion document I published in November 1987.  The document examined, among other things, the options for repeal of the Truck Acts and for new legislation governing the payment of wages.  The views of all the interests concerned were sought in the related consultative process.  More recently, arising from the <i>Programme for <Col N="1246" /> Economic and Social Progress,</i> I undertook to finalise legislation which would facilitate the move towards non-cash wage payment.  The programme committed me to the introduction of a wages Bill during the spring of 1991.  The Bill was initiated in the Seanad on 23 May &mdash; having overshot its deadline by just a few weeks.</P>
    <P>The motivation for this Bill stems from a variety of inter-related concerns.  For one thing, we in Ireland are much behind our European competitors in changing over to non-cash modes of wage payment. A comparison of statistics available from a number of EC countries shows that Ireland has a very high percentage of employees paid wages in cash. Denmark has probably the lowest percentage, with only about 5 per cent of employees receiving cash wages.  Other countries, such as the former West Germany, Belgium and Spain, report figures in the range 10 per cent to 25 per cent. A survey published by the FIE in 1987 indicated that as many as 45 per cent of all employees and 51 per cent of blue collar employees in this country were in receipt of wages in cash.  Happily, more recent research suggests that there has been some movement in the direction of non-cash wages since that date, but much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The statistics strongly suggest that many firms have yet to exploit the advantages offered by new technology in the area of wage payment.  With computers now a feature of even the smallest business concern, there is every reason for optimism that cost-effective modes of wages payment will be utilised increasingly to the benefit of both employers and employees.  Often existing computer capacity can be adapted to handle the payroll.  Present technology even allows employers to transmit wage payment information from their own computer records on tape or disk to compatible systems in banks and other financial institutions. I understand that the resulting savings in security costs and payroll staff can be significant.</P>
    <P>My concern about the incidence of cash wages in Ireland is conditioned by a <Col N="1247" /> number of other factors.  Clearly, such a high level of cash wages cannot but affect the cost competitiveness of business both here in Ireland and abroad.  Important, too, are the unquantifiable benefits associated with an increase in non-cash modes of wage payment.  I am thinking here of the number of armed robberies of payroll cash which have taken place in recent decades and the ongoing security costs related to their prevention.  Anything that can be done to reduce or eliminate this problem will not only improve the quality of life all round but will also stamp out a serious and ever present threat to life and limb.</P>
    <P>For the future, there is an emerging trend away from the use of cash and more and more towards a non-cash economy. Even today almost everyone utilises plastic money, whether it is a card that gives access to a 24 hour automatic teller machine, a cheque book and cheque card or one of the wide variety of credit cards available.  Exploratory initiatives such as the POSVAN Project give pointers to the possible shape of financial transactions in the future.  One option examined by the project, which is backed by Telecom Éireann among others, is the debiting of bank accounts at the point of sale.  So, for example, computer links placed at supermarket check-outs might in the future allow a customer, then and there, to debit his own account by the amount of the grocery bill and to credit that of the supermarket.</P>
    <P>By the turn of the century, developments of this kind and others may well have revolutionised the way we regulate our financial affairs.  It is no more than common sense that the legislation governing wage payment should be sufficiently flexible to allow for the payment of wages by new and emerging facilities for money transfer.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the Truck Acts have been seen as a major barrier to the more widespread use of non-cash methods of wage payment.  The Payment of Wages Act, 1979, sought to address this issue and was in some measure successful. However, that Act stopped short of a <Col N="1248" /> fundamental review of the Truck Acts. The Bill proposes repeal of the Truck Acts, 1743 to 1896, together with the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>My Second Stage speech in the Seanad outlined for Senators some of the historical background to those Acts. Indeed, The <i>Cork Examiner</i> reporting the previous day's debate said: &ldquo;you could almost smell the dust yesterday as Minister Bertie Ahern brushed the cobwebs off legislation dating back more than 200 years&rdquo;.  I do not intend to dwell on the historical perspective today.</P>
    <P>Suffice to say that the Truck Acts take their name from an old English word meaning to &ldquo;trade&rdquo; or &ldquo;barter&rdquo;.  Under the truck system, workers were often required to accept domestic goods and provisions in lieu of cash wages or to take credit at the company shop which often stocked inferior goods at inflated prices. Daniel O'Connell contributed to the debate in the House of Commons on the Truck Act, 1831.  He described a variation of the system on the following lines &ldquo;a manufacturer who sets up a shop might pay his men in money at one counter and compel them, by threats of turning them out of employ, to spend it at the other counter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Truck Acts, contrary to the impression that might be conveyed by their name, far from favouring &ldquo;truck&rdquo;, outlawed the practice of paying manual workers their wages in kind.  They required, instead, that manual workers should be paid in &ldquo;current coin of the realm&rdquo;.  The Acts also addressed abuses such as unlawful deductions from wages and the practice of some employers of charging interest on advances of pay.</P>
    <P>A significant feature of this Bill is that it provides for the first time a range of protections for all workers in connection with the payment of wages.  Deputies will note that I have imposed no qualifying periods of service or minimum hours thresholds for eligibility under the Act.  I have also taken on board in the Bill issues raised in this House during March in the context of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees) Act, 1991. During the passage of that Act, concern <Col N="1249" /> was expressed by a number of contributors to the debate about workers employed through employment agencies and on short term contracts.  I was unable, for reasons explained in replying to that debate, to allay the fears of Deputies in so far as they related to the part-time workers' legislation.  Happily, the difficulties encountered in the case of other legislation are of no relevance to the Bill now before the House.  Accordingly, the provisions of this Bill extend both to workers employed through employment agencies and workers on short term contracts of employment.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides a framework which will facilitate the move to non-cash wages.  The will and the action necessary to effect this move must come from the interests themselves.  Unlike some other desirable objectives, arrangements for non-cash wages are likely to prove financially sound for all those involved.  For employers, there are the benefits of efficiency, security and cost competitiveness which I have already outlined; for financial institutions, there are advantages associated with the electronic transfer of data and the opportunity to reach a wider base of likely customers. Employers for their part will share with employers the security that goes with non-cash wages.</P>
    <P>One criticism of the move to non-cash wages is that it delivers employees, who would not otherwise be their clients, into the hands of the banks.  There is a sense in which this argument cannot be rebutted. Any of the readily negotiable modes of wage payment, other than cash, necessarily involves the mediation of a reliable financial institution.  If employees are to avoid contact with financial institutions at all costs, there is no option but for the payment of their wages in cash.</P>
    <P>However, this argument is also concerned with two other issues.  There is the concern that the legislation may secure unwittingly for the banks a monopoly in the matter of wage payment and the concern that low paid employees will not be as welcome customers in the bank as their high income counterparts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> To take the first issue, the list of acceptable modes of wage payment in the Bill includes all the widely accepted and readily negotiable modes of money transfer. Clearly, the services of the main commercial banks are among them &mdash; cheques, bank drafts and credit transfer facilities.  However, they are by no means the only options.  The financial services of An Post are also acceptable for wage payment purposes as are those of the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Bank was set up under statute by the Minister for Finance and has somewhat longer hours of business than the main commercial banks. Building societies are also competing nowadays in the provision of personal financial services.  The terms of the Bill would allow, for example, the credit transfer of wages to a building society account.  Again, the business hours of building societies are more likely to suit employees who find normal banking hours inconvenient.  I should add, also, that cash remains an acceptable mode of wages payment.</P>
    <P>Clearly, many employers and employees may choose to have wages paid through one of the commercial banks.  On the other hand, the alternative options provided in the Bill will, no doubt, appeal to some employees and their employers.  There is provision in the Bill to add to the list of acceptable modes of wage payment, if and when new modes of money transfer become available and prove their worth.</P>
    <P>The notion that low paid employees have little to gain from the banking system touches some deep preconceptions about banks and about the capability of low paid employees to look out for themselves.  Understandably, banks, like all commercial enterprises, may have a preference for the customer that is likely to profit them most though, no doubt, like other businesses, they will deal with the less profitable customer too. Indeed, banking is one business in which the modest client with a good track record is appreciated.</P>
    <P>Turning to the low paid employee, it would be a mistake to legislate on the <Col N="1251" /> basis that he or she has not the wisdom to order his or her own affairs.  The low paid employee will know, better than anyone else, both the limits and the extent of the benefits to him or her of opening a bank account, and the nature of the account, if any, whether current or deposit, that best suits his or her needs. In any event, not all modes of non-cash wage payment require an employee to have a bank account.  An employee may arrange with his or her employer to be paid by bank draft or through An Post or by some other mode of payment where encashment is straightforward on presentation at the appropriate institution.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, important issues to be resolved by employers and employees in the move to non-cash wages.  Some employees retain rights to particular modes of wage payment, either contractually, as a result of custom and practice, or pursuant to this Bill.  The timing and other details of the change to new modes of wage payment are, in these cases, matters for negotiation at the level of the firm.</P>
    <P>There may be, in some cases, a question of a financial inducement to encourage workers to make the transition to non-cash wages.  One rationale for such an inducement would be to cushion employees against banking costs which they might not otherwise incur.  Many employees, though now paid in cash, will already maintain bank accounts.  A minority of employees will have operated solely in the cash economy until the changeover to non-cash wages.  A survey conducted in 1986 estimated that 65 per cent of employees who were paid wages in cash also operated bank accounts. Another way of regarding such a financial inducement would be as a profit sharing exercise.  The savings arising from the changeover to non-cash wages might be shared by the employer with the employees, either as a one-off lump sum payment or in the form of a small but permanent increase in wages.  Individual circumstances will dictate, also, whether the convenience of the parties warrants <Col N="1252" /> the giving of paid time off for banking purposes.</P>
    <P>I have provided in the Bill for transitional arrangements in the case of certain employees.  The arrangements are intended to allow an employee currently paid in cash to continue to be so paid until such time as an alternative method of wage payment is agreed with the employer.  The arrangements will also allow manual workers, formerly paid in cash, who have entered into an agreement to non-cash wages under the Payment of Wages Act, 1979, to revert to cash wages in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The transitional arrangements have been criticised on the grounds that the legislation does not go far enough in pushing the move to cashless pay.  Critics of the arrangements appear to envisage that the legislation would facilitate a move to non-cash methods of wage payment based on some level of compulsion. There are, of course, serious industrial relations and other difficulties inherent in such an approach.  Equally important, perhaps, are the reasonable expectations of the categories of worker involved that they should be treated fairly in the context of the Bill.  It is my experience also that undue haste may be counter-productive, particularly where a fundamental legislative change is envisaged. An incremental approach to change will often achieve its purpose more fully and more satisfactorily than any plans to accomplish an overnight solution, however well intentioned.</P>
    <P>There are good economic and financial reasons for encouraging the move to non-cash wage payment, for the economy, for employers and, perhaps to a lesser extent, for employees.  Like the critics of the transitional arrangements, it is my aim to help to effect a move to non-cash wages as speedily and effectively as possible.  I have, therefore, looked in some detail at the case against the transitional arrangements but have been disinclined to accept it, for the reasons already stated, among others.  The Bill, <Col N="1253" /> accordingly, reflects my considered position on this matter and seeks the House's approval for it.</P>
    <P>Let me now bring Deputies briefly through the main provisions of the Bill. The Bill requires every employer to pay wages by one of the modes of payment listed in section 2.  As I have already mentioned, the list covers all the widely recognised means of paying money &mdash; from cheques and money orders to bank drafts, credit transfers and cash.  Rapid future change in this area is to be anticipated because of advances in electronic data processing and other developments. I propose, therefore, to take power so that additional modes of wage payment can be added to the list in section 2 if and when new methods of money transfer are developed and gain public acceptance.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill repeals the Truck Acts.  The section also provides for the transitional arrangements which I have just described.  Section 4 of the Bill imposes on employers an obligation to give to each of their employees a written statement of wages and deductions.  The statement must be given to the employee at the time of wage payment, except in the case of payment by credit transfer, when the statement should be given as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is concerned with deductions from the wages of an employee.  The section prohibits an employer from making a deduction from wages unless it falls within one of three categories &mdash; a deduction which is required by Statute, such as PAYE or PRSI; a deduction which is provided for in the contract of employment, say, pension contributions or a disciplinary fine, and a deduction to which the employee has consented in writing, such as trade union subscriptions, VHI premia or payments to a savings scheme.  All other deductions are outlawed.</P>
    <P>This section also contains further special restrictions which apply to two categories of deductions.  One such category is where deductions are made in respect of either goods or services supplied by the employer and necessary to the employment.  Included here, for <Col N="1254" /> example, would be the employees' contribution towards the purchase or cleaning of work clothes or the supply of transport to work by the employer.  The other category involves deductions arising from the actions of the employee, such as disciplinary fines or bad workmanship.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 of the Bill provide a complaints and appeals procedure for employees who have been subject to unlawful deductions.  The right of complaint for an employee against an unlawful deduction is to a rights commissioner in the first instance.  There is a subsequent right of appeal for either the employer or the employee to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Section 8 provides for the enforcement of a decision of a rights commissioner or a determination of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 9 empowers the Minister for Labour to appoint &ldquo;authorised officers&rdquo; for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the terms of the Bill.  The powers conferred on &ldquo;authorised officers&rdquo; are similar to those provided in other protective legislation.  Section 10 allows the Minister for Labour to prosecute offences arising under the Bill.  Section 11 renders void any agreement which is out of keeping with the provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1, 12, 13 and 14 are standard provisions relating to definitions, regulations, expenses and short title respectively.  The Schedule lists all the Acts which it is proposed to repeal.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, this Bill was introduced in the Seanad.  An advantage of initiating a Bill there is that one benefits at an early stage from the characteristically informal and incisive scrutiny of that House.  As ever, I was struck by some of the detailed contributions offered by Senators in a spirit somewhat removed from the cut and thrust of adversarial politics.  In the course of the debate, Senator Ó Cuív indicated his concern to ensure that pay statements should be easily understood by employees.  He instanced one or two pay statements he had come across which has proved virtually unintelligible because of the nature and extent to which abbreviations were <Col N="1255" /> used to describe deductions.  Senator Seán Fallon raised with me by letter a fairly precise technical point relating to deductions from wages pursuant to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to all the Senators and to their colleagues for their stimulating contributions.  The two proposals mentioned above are being considered with guidance from the office of the Parliamentary Draftsman.  Depending on the outcome of that consideration, I may bring forward Government amendments on Committee Stage to encompass either one or both of the suggestions outlined.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this Bill proposes the repeal of centuries old legislation which in its day provided significant rights for workers in the matter of payment of wages.  That legislation, developed in the context of an emerging cash economy, has outlived its usefulness.  Indeed, the emphasis on cash wages, so central to the Truck Acts, has proved counter-productive to progress and efficiency for some decades.  For the future, legislation must take cognisance of the trend towards non-cash modes of money transfer in the economy generally and their necessary consequences for the manner of wage payment.</P>
    <P>Despite advances in technology, the need remains, as it did when the Truck Acts were framed, to guard the wage payment rights of employees.  Then, as now, the legitimate concerns of employers for cost effective and secure modes of wage payment must also be addressed.  I am reasonably certain that the Bill meets the immediate requirements of each of the interests in these regards.  As to the future, I am sufficiently confident, or foolish, to hope that the Bill may prove as relevant to the needs of the next century as the Truck Acts did to the needs of the last.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to subject the Minister to the cut and thrust of adversarial politics.  He seemed to fear that having escaped it in the Seanad he would be confronted by it in the Dáil.  I <Col N="1256" /> very much welcome this Bill, the intent of which is right.  Indeed it was a source of amazement to me in the days when I was a law student and we had to study the Truck Acts that at a time in the early seventies when there were stories regularly in the evening newspapers about payroll robberies by the IRA in various parts of the country, about staff in supermarkets and banks being held up at times of the week when it was known that large sums of cash were being transported from one part of a town to another, such legislation was not introduced at that stage.  The fact that we have been so slow in updating our legislation has facilitated organisations like the IRA to fund their campaign of violence in the North of Ireland.  It was most unfortunate that legislation such as this was not introduced by previous Governments of the different political persuasions over the years.  The introduction of such legislation in years gone by was a point of contention &mdash; certainly on the part of the trade union movement who were concerned that workers' rights would not be properly protected.  In some areas there were reservations on the part of employers but by and large employers were pressing for changes in the law for many years.  I suspect that if we had moved away from wage payments in cash many years ago illegal organisations would not have had nearly as much money to purchase arms as they have had and that not nearly so many people would have lost their lives in the North of Ireland.  I am not blaming the Minister for this.  I welcome the fact that he has brought the Bill to the House but I regret that such legislation was not brought before us earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the legislation will diminish the need for large sums of money to be transported by employers to their place of work on wage days or by banks and in so far as it will diminish the possibility of large scale robberies of the nature that we became familiar with over the years, this Bill is very welcome.  It is also welcome because it finally brings our wage <Col N="1257" /> legislation into line with modern technology. Indeed many people in employment would welcome a facility &mdash; where it has not proved possible up to now to agree it with their employers because of the Truck Acts &mdash; to have their wages paid by direct bank transfer on a weekly or monthly basis.  That facilitates the way people want to operate in a modern economy. People do not want to receive large sums of cash and sometimes do not want to receive cheques either because if they have bank accounts they are quite happy to have their money transferred directly into their accounts.  That ensures that their money appears in their account on the day it is transferred instead of two or three days later, allowing for the delay between the time of lodging a cheque and the money having an impact on your account.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on the job front but I was pleased to see that the programme provided an agreement on the part of the Government and the social partners that legislation of this nature would come before the House.  The Minister's false modesty in complying with the timescale is welcome.  Too frequently we see the Minister's colleagues coming into the House from one end of the year to the next promising all sorts of legislation that they never produce, and regarding it as something of a comedy routine to promise legislation in the autumn for the following spring but in the spring to come into this House and say it will be ready for the following autumn.  Some Ministers seem to think this is a point of fun.  In fairness to the Minister for Labour, if he says he is going to introduce legislation in an area, his record shows that he will do so.  I was somewhat amused at his self deprecating remarks when he criticised himself in the Seanad for not having the legislation in by the end of April, as he said he would but instead having it in early May.  That is a refreshing approach. Far too frequently we engage in the gladiatorial political contest across the floor of this House but if somebody is doing something well they deserve to be told so.  We on this side of the House will <Col N="1258" /> facilitate the speedy passage of the Bill, in the context not only of Second Stage today but of taking the Committee and Final Stages at the earliest date possible.</P>
    <P>I will now address one or two matters in the legislation.  I noted with interest in the Minister's speech, indeed Senator O'Keeffe had pointed it out in the Seanad, and it was something that occurred to me when I saw the Bill, that it is the intent of the Bill to ensure that all of those in the workforce get a statement as to their weekly or monthly wage and as to the purpose for which sums of money are being deducted.  I am very familiar with the type of wage slips people get.  For a large proportion of the workforce, their wage slips are often totally incomprehensible because of the manner in which they are set out and when what deductions are for is described, it is so abbreviated and so complex that it is virtually incomprehensible.  Practically every major company have their own method of doing this and the State bodies are equally to blame.  It is important that the requirements on an employer to set out clearly the purpose of deductions requires that workers get an intelligible statement with their wages and not a statement that contains so many abbreviations as to require a translator to explain it.</P>
    <P>Having said that we should have passed this legislation many years ago, it is worth pointing out the oddity of the fact that we are now repealing the 1743 Truck Act. Other speakers have pointed out that it is one of the few remaining Acts enacted by the old Irish parliament pre-1800.  It is a commentary on our ability to modernise the State when in 1991 we are finally repealing a piece of legislation of 1743&mdash; legislation 250 years old.  It is also an interesting sign of the times.  Whereas the legislation is very welcome the Truck Acts were originally designed to prevent employers requiring employees to accept payment by way of benefit in kind &mdash; one of the classical ways that the employer would do that would be to require the employee to be paid in the product that the employer produced, whether the employee wanted the quantity of the <Col N="1259" /> product he was given was neither here nor there so that they would have to go and sell it, or the employer could require the employee to accept goods from his shop at exorbitant prices.  Nowadays, we have a different problem altogether.  Due to the extraordinary high level of taxation and the fact that many people in employment feel there is no incentive to work hard or to do overtime, because if get a large financial reward for the work you do most of it will disappear to the taxman, there is a great deal of enthusiasm for payment in kind on top of the official wage.  It is not unknown, so as to reduce the tax impact on workers, for major as well as minor companies to pay them currently in kind to a certain degree.  Of course those payments in kind under the Truck Acts are not regarded as payments at all and they are illegal.  What is interesting, and the Minister might comment on this, is that it seems to me that strictly speaking they are still illegal and cannot be taken into account after this legislation is passed.  I will give one or two examples, a computer manufacturing company employ somebody at a wage and, though this may not be in the contract of employment, it may be well known within the company that part of the payment is that each year the employee will get free of charge one of the company's latest computers. The company can explain that to the taxman on the basis that you are being given a product so that you keep up to date in your job, that you need to retain the computer for job purposes.  Everyone knows that a free computer which is being provided every year can be sold on the black market if one so wishes.  The taxman will never discover it.  Another way of getting around this problem is by having a business conference for 100 employees in a five-star hotel in Majorca. There is the more simple expedient of incurring travelling expenses.  Fifty employees may have to travel every year for company reasons.  Where they go is not generally examined in detail.  It could be London, Tenerife or the United States.  In reality it is payment in kind, a way of giving additional rewards to <Col N="1260" /> employees for work done which can legitimately be explained as a company expense without incurring PAYE or PRSI costings.</P>
    <P>In 250 years we have come full circle. Even 100 years ago workers had to be protected from being forced by their employers to accept benefits in kind instead of cash.  Nowadays workers are delighted to get benefits in kind in addition to cash.  If such benefits in kind were described in an employment contract as being part of payment for the job, they would be illegal, even under this Bill.  Provided it is done under the counter on a nod and wink basis, it is an Irish solution to an Irish problem, designed to diminish the impact of our excessive income tax imposition.  The Minister cannot solve that problem overnight, but I was interested in the comments by Peter Cassells of the ICTU after a meeting with the Government yesterday when, despite the PR exercise on the jobs issue, he made the point that we will not resolve the jobs problem until we diminish the taxation impact on the wages we earn.  That is not a matter for this legislation but the Minister might indicate the position in relation to an employer who employs a person on £10,000 a year plus the promise of a holiday every two years in the United States, or the promise of some other benefit in kind.  Strictly speaking, I think it is not lawful under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the Minister will have the full co-operation of Fine Gael in having it enacted before the summer recess.  The only technical difficulty is in relation to ensuring that statements of earnings and of deductions are very clear.  Another matter which arises relates to employees currently in receipt of cash payment where the employer wishes to transfer to a non-cash method of payment.  I have always held the view that industrial relations issues of this type should be dealt with by agreement and discussion between the workers or their unions and the employers.  I would be anxious to ensure that those companies who, under existing legislation, have been prevented from transferring to a <Col N="1261" /> non-cash basis of wage payment will not find themselves totally blocked by their workforce from shifting to a cheque or bank transfer basis of payment.  In the case of employers who want to make such changes fairly rapidly, there is within the ambit of this legislation the possibility for a group of employees or a union who want to make difficulties to do so and to seek various payments which, in the current economic climate, a company may not be able to meet in return for what would be seen by the workers as a concession.</P>
    <P>If a company want to make the switch to a system of non-cash payment and agreement cannot be reached with trade union representatives of the workforce or with the workers themselves, what is the exact role of the Rights Commissioner? Is his role confined to the resolving of disputes which arise under the legislation?  If the company wishing to make the change are subject to demands from the workforce which they cannot meet, can the Rights Commissioner play a role in reaching an accommodation which would allow the company to make payments on a non-cash basis?  That may prove possible, but I am not certain.  The provisions in relation to the Rights Commissioner seem to relate more to resolving disputes in relation to wages and deductions rather than resolving disputes between an employer and a trade union as to some from of compensation or once-off payment to a workforce in return for switching to a non-cash basis of paying wages.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill and I hope we may be able to take Committee and Report Stages next week, if the other parties are agreeable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the Bill and I recognise that the Truck Acts need to be upgraded.  The real reason for these changes is not just the antiquity of existing legislation but the determination of the Government to limit the transfer of huge amounts of cash from one location to another because of the danger of robbery. In order to overcome this problem <Col N="1262" /> we are to find ways of paying workers other than by a cash transfer system.  If that is the intention, as Deputy Shatter believes, we should consider why cash payments are so attractive to workers in Ireland.  In Denmark 90 per cent of wages are paid in some form other than cash, but here a minimum of 50 per cent of workers receive wages in cash.  Clearly this is proving costly to the State and to banking institutions because of the security costs involved in transferring huge sums of money from one place to another.  Often a military escort is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Second Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the Appropriation Accounts for 1987 be laid before the Dáil and that the report, proceedings and minutes of evidence be printed. </P>
      <P>As Chairman of the all-party Committee of Public Accounts of this House I am placing before the House a copy of the Committee's Second Interim Report on the 1987 Appropriation Accounts.  This report relates to the sale of the State's shareholding and royalty entitlement in Tara Mines Limited.  I have asked to have the opportunity to speak on this matter because I believe it raises some fundamental issues regarding the rights of the Dáil, and the rights of the citizens we represent, to have full information concerning the use of their moneys and assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts addressed this issue arising from a reference in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the question of royalties payable by Tara Mines.  At the committee's examination it emerged that the State's shareholding had been sold for an all-in price of $50 million, a <Col N="1263" /> price which included payment in lieu of royalties.</P>
    <P>Did the State get value for the sale? Unfortunately, our investigations have not reached a firm and satisfactory conclusion for a number of reasons which I wish to bring to the attention of all Members of the House.  Under the terms of the original mining lease dated 19 September 1975, Tara Mines Limited were liable to pay royalties at a rate of 4.5 per cent of the company's annual profits.  The terms of the lease also provided that in the event of a dispute arising between the Minister and the company relating to the computation of royalties, the matter would be referred to arbitration.</P>
    <P>In March 1987 the Department requested payment of £4.8 million in outstanding royalties in respect of estimated company profits totalling £107 million for the years 1978 to 1984.  Following the company's rejection of this claim an agreement to appoint an arbitrator was reached in September 1987.  By July 1988 an arbitrator had been appointed.  The accounting officer for the Department explained that the delay was caused by the fact that the Department wanted to ensure that the best expertise was available to advise and represent the Minister in relation to the arbitration hearings.  In May 1989 the accounting officer informed the committee that the issue of the amount of royalties payable had now been overtaken by a Government decision to sell the State's stake in Tara Mines Limited to the majority shareholder for 50 million US dollars, the then exchange rate equivalent of IR£35.3 million.</P>
    <P>In February 1990 the committee were informed that NCB Corporate Finance Limited were engaged as consultants to advise on the sale for which they were paid a fee of £661,885.  I should add that the attempt to engage consultants did not go to tender and this, we were informed, was done because the consultants were reported to have special expertise in the area.  The accounting officer has contended that he was precluded from providing the Committee of Public Accounts <Col N="1264" /> with a copy of the consultant's report because of a confidentiality clause in the original mining lease.  This clause entitled the Minister to have access to the books and records of Tara Mines Limited provided that any material obtained was treated as confidential.  This right had been exercised in connection with the preparation of the consultant's report. The accounting officer had sought the advice of the Attorney General who it should be noted advised the Government, and not Parliament, as in the UK, as to whether in these circumstances the disclosure of the consultant's report to the Committee of Public Accounts would constitute a breach of contract.  The Attorney General informed him that release of such material to any person other than the Minister, or officers of the Department, would amount to a breach of contract for which, presumably, the State would be sued.</P>
    <P>The committee's interim report highlights the fact that the terms of the contract have therefore contributed to precluding the proper discharge of the duties which the committee are mandated by the Dáil to carry out on the taxpayers' behalf.  This agreement between the Department and the company has prevented the examination of a report paid for by the taxpayers, a report which would have assisted the committee in their assessment of whether the State obtained full value for the sale of its shareholding.</P>
    <P>The basic question at issue still remains unanswered.  Was the £35.3 million paid for the State's 25 per cent shareholding in Tara Mines Limited a fair price, particularly when this amount is regarded as including outstanding royalty payments dating back to 1978 and future royalties? Are we to accept that on this basis the mines were worth less than £150 million in total?  I must point out that it is very difficult to reconcile this valuation with the Department of Energy's own estimation that the mines have provided profits of £107 million in the period 1978 to 1984.  I should add that in this morning's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> there is a report <Col N="1265" /> on Tara Mines which states that the company are still profitable.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil, through this committee, is to make an informed judgment as to whether the State has received value for money or has been taken advantage of then we should, at the very least, be able to say how this figure of £35.3 million was calculated.  In the absence of the necessary information we cannot even do that.  It is clearly contrary to the basic principle of parliamentary democracy that this should be the case.  If a member of the Government can enter into a contract with a private company to sell the taxpayers' assets, how can it be democratic or acceptable for such a contract to be so secret that the taxpayers' representatives cannot see if the affair was properly conducted and at arms length. What does the &ldquo;power to send for persons papers and records&rdquo; mean if this power can be bypassed by the simple expedient of a private contract?</P>
    <P>In their report the committee have recommended that in future contracts with financial implications for the State should not include clauses which preclude subsequent disclosure of information which this House or its Committee of Public Accounts may see fit to request in the legitimate exercise of their role in the area of public financial accountability. I would ask the House to endorse that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Apart from our concern at the lack of accountability to the Parliament in this instance the committee are seriously concerned at the future implications of this matter.  In giving evidence the accounting officer stated that even if there were no legal prohibition on the disclosure of information in this case he would still have difficulty in disclosing that information or, indeed, any other commercially sensitive information held by his Department.  This is not the first occasion that such a stance has been taken by accounting officers.  Similar views have been expressed in the past by accounting officers in the Department of Industry and Commerce and in the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Committee of <Col N="1266" /> Public Accounts, I wish to highlight the fact that the committee and the Dáil regularly find themselves in a situation where the interests of the taxpayer and the interests of the nation as a whole are playing second fiddle to the interests of private businesses.  If we are to do more than merely pay lip-service to parliamentary democracy this situation cannot continue.  In order to safeguard the public interest, surely it is self-evident that apart from the issues raised in this case any company who receive substantial funds from the State should clearly be made more accountable to the State than a company who are operating totally on the basis of private funding. Despite the self-evident nature of this principle, it is a principle which many of our State agencies have in the past paid scant regard to.  The committee believe that this situation must change.</P>
    <P>The committee, therefore, further recommend that their own terms of reference should be modified along the lines set out in the committee's special report dated 18 May 1988 on the future role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. In this regard I welcome the Government's intention to publish draft legislation on this matter towards the end of the present session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The committee recommend strongly that the principle of the primacy of the public interest over private interest should be clear in all areas where State investments have been provided.  The forthcoming legislation provides a clear opportunity to re-establish firmly this principle of public accountability.</P>
    <P>This House is entitled to know how the valuation of £35.3 million was calculated. Questions which we should reasonably be expected to hear answered include how much of this amount is accounted for by royalty payments?  What assumptions were made regarding the useful life of the mineral deposits at Tara?  What assumptions were made concerning the price of ore in future years?  What discount rate was used to value the assets? How does the Minister reconcile the valuation of £35.3 million on a quarter share <Col N="1267" /> of this enterprise plus any payments due on prior or past royalties with his own estimation that the enterprise delivered £107 million profits in a period of six years?  Why were NCB paid the very generous amount of £661,885 &mdash; without going to tender &mdash; for conducting their valuation of the company?  Will the Minister provide the House with a breakdown showing how this very generous sum was calculated?  What are the future obligations of Tara Mines to pay royalties or taxes to the Exchequer?  Specifically when will the present lease expire and will the term of the lease then be open for renegotiation?  Perhaps most important, the House should be told of the approximate value of the ore which has been recovered by the Tara Mines Company to date in 1991 terms and the percentage of the value of those deposits which this £35.3 million represents.</P>
    <P>It is a serious matter for an accounting officer not to be in a position to supply all the relevant papers to the Committee of Public Accounts, given the committee's role and Standing Orders which are provided by this supreme democratic institution.  In future any accounting officer who is required to be party to any agreement which prevents him or her from fulfilling his or her duty to account to the Dáil fully and absolutely through the Committee of Public Accounts should, as is the practice where an accounting officer is committed to incur expenditure which he or she believes not to have the proper sanction of Dáil Éireann, request such direction in writing before complying and then forward the papers to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  You cannot be a judge in your own cause &mdash;<i>Nemo iudex in causa sua.</i> That is a principle which should apply in every case.  It is not good enough and is wholly unacceptable that the Department who conducted these proceedings should seek to state simply that they got a good deal and that is all there is to be said about it.</P>
    <P>It is the role of the Dáil through the Committee of Public Accounts to satisfy itself on these matters.  It is the Dáil who <Col N="1268" /> represents the owners of the assets concerned. The Dáil Committee of Public Accounts should be able to satisfy themselves in these circumstances.  They must report that they have been unable to do so.  This is a serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>Too often we take for granted the work of our institutions that work very well.  Since 1923 the Committee of Public Accounts have been an intrinsic and vital part of the machinery not only of this House, but also of the machinery of Government itself.  I am afraid that too seldom has there been a recognition of the sustained hard work and professionalism that goes into the PAC scrutiny of State expenditure. Indeed, the present chairman and his committee have an excellent record and, despite the increasing complexity of many of the State's expenditure programmes, have managed to bring their assessment of the Appropriation Accounts right up to date.  In this work they complement the acknowledged expertise and independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a clear recognition of the position of the PAC within the Government service.  Indeed, all Departments have given their full co-operation to the Comptroller and Auditor General and subsequent examination by the PAC at all times.  The same is true of all Departments; I know that in four separate sessions on the Energy Appropriation Accounts for 1987, which are the basis of today's debate, the Secretary of the Department of Energy, as accounting officer, gave the fullest possible co-operation to the committee.  There were particular circumstances, however, arising from the Tara Mines issue, which the PAC were pursuing, which prevented a full disclosure of original documentation. The committee, in their report, have stated that by virtue of the fact that they had not total access to all the original documentation they requested, they were precluded from coming to a final conclusion whether the State obtained <Col N="1269" /> full value for the eventual sale of the shareholding in Tara Mines and for the accrued and future royalties relating to the Navan ore body.  While this is the essential element of the Committee's report, it cannot be seen totally in isolation and must be viewed against the background of the State's relationship with Tara Mines Limited.</P>
    <P>While today's debate is ostensibly about a matter relating to the Department of Energy, I suspect that there are underlying issues here which might have, equally, arisen in the operation of any other Department.  That is not to say, however, that the issues raised on the sale of the State shareholding in Tara Mines should not be addressed.  I propose to deal with the issues raised and demonstrate that the approach adopted by the Department of Energy in the sale of the State's minority shareholding in Tara was both correct and commercially astute.  In short, the State got an excellent price for its equity interest and the taxpayer got full value for money.</P>
    <P>The PAC's scrutiny of this item in the context of the 1987 Appropriation Accounts for the Department of Energy did not, of course, for one moment suggest that there was any improper conduct, or indeed, that the transaction was not handled correctly in all its aspects. One element I detected, at the time of the PAC assessment, and, indeed, borne out by the tenor of subsequent Dáil questions, was that certain critics were not really addressing the issue of the price obtained for the shareholding but were really hankering after a total rewrite of history.  I think it would be helpful for the record just to recall what the salient facts of the Tara saga were.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce came to an agreement with the owners of Tara Mines Limited by which the State received a 25 per cent shareholding in the company in return for the granting of a State mining lease. One of the financial provisions of the lease required the company to pay an annual royalty of 4.5 per cent of profits calculated by the Revenue Commissioners based on corporation profits <Col N="1270" /> tax as it existed on 6 April 1974.  This tax was later replaced by corporation tax under the Corporation Tax Act, 1976. Because of their familiarity with tax law, the Revenue Commissioners made the appropriate royalty calculations.  The State lease provided for the settling of any disputes by arbitration.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners and Tara never agreed the basis for defining profits on which royalty could then be calculated. The only solution to identify the exact method of calculating profits on which royalties could then be computed was to appoint an agreed arbitrator and that was done in 1987.</P>
    <P>Much of the controversy which surrounds this issue was based on the fact that no royalties were ever paid on the operations at Navan, and despite substantial volumes of lead and zinc being exported, the royalties which were to be paid were based on a tax that had lapsed and the ground rules had not been clearly set.</P>
    <P>There are volumes of academic books worldwide on the subject of royalties and natural resources.  There is, however, broad consensus that a tax on profits is not only the most equitable way of capturing an element of possible windfall in mining operation, but is also the one which best facilitates economic development. While royalties based on volume or value, for example tonnage or sales, have the merit of simplicity, they are also in themselves a cost burden on any operation.  Straight volume or value royalties tend to block the development of mines where estimated rates of return or projected profits are marginal and also have the demonstrated effect of closing operations which are finely balanced from a commercial viewpoint or even modest loss makers.  However one views the arguments, the fact remains that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce came to an agreement in which royalties were based on profits and that could not be changed either unilaterally or by any form of wishful thinking.</P>
    <P>The focus on the appropriate royalty structure had drawn attention from a fundamental flaw in the 1975 agreement. <Col N="1271" /> The initial agreement did not protect the State in that it gave the majority shareholders an effective veto over the State's sale of shares.  The articles of association of the company set out the mechanism to be used should the State as shareholder propose to sell all or a portion of its shareholding in the company.  The mechanism was dangerously restrictive to the State's interest.</P>
    <P>The mechanism may be summarised as follows: the State was obliged to give notice to the company that it intended to sell all or a portion of its shareholding. Once such notice was given, it could only be revoked with the agreement of the majority shareholder; the State had to first offer its shareholding to Tara Exploration and Development as majority shareholder which would have an option to purchase for three months following the offer; if Tara Exploration and Development did not look to acquire the State's shareholding and if the company did not find a purchaser within four months of the State giving notice, the State then, in theory, had the option of selling its shareholding to any person at any price.  However, the directors of the company had absolute and uncontrolled discretion as to whether they would admit such a purchaser to membership of the company; and in the case of a dispute between the State as seller and the company as purchaser, either party might apply to the company auditor to fix fair value to the shares and the State would have been bound to accept such a price.</P>
    <P>This selling mechanism once initiated by the State, was irreversible unless the company allowed otherwise.  Furthermore the State had no prior guarantee that this &ldquo;fair value&rdquo; price would reflect the true worth of its shareholding. Indeed, using the &ldquo;fair value&rdquo; mechanism was fraught with potential danger to the State, for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>If the company auditor was called on to fix a fair value for the State's shareholding, he would be deemed in so doing to be acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator under the articles of association. This distinction has important legal <Col N="1272" /> implications.  In valuing a shareholding, an arbitrator is bound to take submissions from both parties and to set out the basis of his valuation.  If either party disputes his valuation, they can appeal on a point of law.  On the other hand, an expert valuing a shareholding is not bound to receive submissions and can issue a valuation without setting out the basis on which it was derived.  There is no appeal against the judgment of an expert unless he discloses the basis of his valuation, or unless the figure arrived at is impossibly high or low.</P>
    <P>In summary, the selling mechanism set out in the articles of association was weighted heavily in favour of the company. The effective manacling of the State's position was to greatly influence the way the Department of Energy set about selling the shareholding.</P>
    <P>It must be said, however, in fairness to the participants in the 1975 agreement, that however disadvantageous some of the deal's elements were, it did result in the State getting a 25 per cent equity stake without cash payment.  Indeed, we would not be debating this issue today if that agreement had not been put in place. It must be said also that a balance had to be struck between the rights of the private sector developers and the State's interest in facilitating the development of the mine.  Achieving such a balance is seldom straightforward.</P>
    <P>The State's position was further weakened in 1982.  The net effect of new arrangements meant the further dilution of the State's interest.  In 1982 the State went along with the issue of £1.25 million worth of preference shares.  The State did not participate in this issue.  These new preference shares were entitled to receive an 11 per cent yield, and 10 per cent of all dividends and reserves.  This agreement had two effects: for £1.25 million invested in the company, the State agreed to extend the mine lease by ten years.  Based on current extraction rates, this is equivalent to 25 million tonnes of ore.  While there was provision for extending the lease up and up to £20 million was to have been invested, in the event only <Col N="1273" /> £1.25 million was provided for substantial concessions.</P>
    <P>In addition to conceding on the ore, the Minister agreed to an effective dilution of the value of his shareholding by 10 per cent.  While a further £6.75 million was to have been invested, this was waived by the then Minister in 1984.  As the Minister held 25 per cent of the shares in Tara, he gave up 10 per cent of his value in return for an investment of £312,500, i.e. 25 per cent of £1.25 million.  Based on this valuation, the Minister would have valued the residual State shareholding at £2,812,500.  Clearly, in the approach in 1989 to the disposal of the State's minority shareholding in Tara, we did not use the logic of the 1982 agreement as a benchmark to assess value.</P>
    <P>There was, however, a very real yardstick which the Department of Energy could use.  In 1986 the majority shareholders sold out.  These shareholders had created a company, Tara Exploration and Development, which was the holding company for the original 75 per cent majority stake.  That shareholding had been enhanced further by the preference share agreement of 1982.</P>
    <P>The State controlled Finnish mining company Outokumpu acquired 100 per cent of Tara Exploration and Development in February 1986 for Can. $19 a share or Can. $126 million in aggregate. The average US Dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate during February 1986 was 0.712.  The Outokumpu price for Tara Exploration and Development can be valued in February 1986 at US $90 millions.</P>
    <P>The assets which Outokumpu purchased were (a) 75 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Tara Mines, (b) 100 per cent of the redeemable preference share capital of Tara Mines with a par value of Irish £1.25 million and the right to a fixed and variable dividend, (c) Can $15.3 million worth of promissory notes due to Tara Exploration and Development from Tara Mines, of which Can $9.8 million were repaid to the company during 1986, (d) certain exploration licences and exploration activities in Ireland unconnected with the Navan ore <Col N="1274" /> body and (e) an investment in Northgate Exploration consisting of 501,714 common shares with a quoted market value of US $1.6 million.</P>
    <P>The Outokumpu price can be adjusted so that it refers only to 100 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Tara Mines. Allowing for this adjustment the full valuation of the ordinary share capital of Tara Mines would be US $103 million. This offer, of course, was made in February 1986 dollars.  Adjusted to take account of changes to March 1989 when the State's shareholding was sold, the valuation was then $113 million current. A straight 25 per cent shareholding in Tara Mines based on the price Outokumpu paid for its majority shareholding adjusted correctly so that the comparison is fair and valid, would be US $28.25 million.  Outokumpu paid the State $50 million for the State's minority shareholding together with past and future royalties. If we isolate the royalties question pound for pound, or indeed dollar for dollar, it can be demonstrated that the State received a very handsome price indeed for its minority shareholding.  But, all things were not equal.  The State's shareholding had been diluted to 22.5 per cent approximately by the preference share issue of 1982 thereby leaving the effective majority shareholding at 77.5 per cent.  This is not where the story ends. Outokumpu were acquiring an unencumbered majority shareholding with full control while the State's shareholding was impotent, locked in, therefore highly illiquid with total control left effectively in the hands of the majority shareholder arising out of the fatal flaw in the original 1975 agreement.</P>
    <P>The royalty issue is a vexing question which arose out of the obscure and incomplete agreement of 1975.  As I said at the outset, no amount of wishful thinking can set the clock back.  The inherited position was one where royalties would be 4.5 per cent of operating profits based on the computations of the pre-1986 corporation profits tax regime.  Paradoxically, the difficulties did not arise because of the decision to change the basis of the corporation tax in 1976.  The <Col N="1275" /> difficulties arose because a definition of profits was not agreed at the time.  This led to the appointment of an arbitrator in 1987.  Given the dispute on the computation of profits it was incumbent on both sides to maximise their claims.  The logical position for the Revenue Commissioners was to assume that no allowances or netting off would be allowed and to base their claim on the maximum perceivable receipts for the State. Clearly, the company owed it to their shareholders to minimise their tax exposure.  Before getting into even the basis of the dispute, I think common sense should ask us to look at how exactly the Tara Mine performed.  Neither ordinary dividend nor royalty was ever paid because distributable profits did not arise until 1989 and the calculation of profits for royalty purposes was in dispute right up to the time of sale negotiations.  The underlying reality was, whatever the positioning on both sides of the arguments on reckonable profits, that the original controlling shareholders sold out in 1986 without getting a penny dividend. The majority shareholders comprised some of the most respected and experienced of the world's major mining companies. Chartered Consolidated, Cominco, Noranda and Northgate, are regarded as first rank and canny operators in the mining sector.  They were the developers of the original mine and they know the operation better than anyone. They volunteered to sell out without receiving even a nominal dividend.</P>
    <P>If we take a closer look at the mine's profitability once again the issue is fairly straightforward.  In its first ten years of operation starting in 1978, and despite both good and bad years in terms of commodity prices, the mine made profits in only three years and losses in the other seven.  In aggregate the accumulated losses far exceeded the aggregate profits in that period.  The cynics may well say that the majority operators were shaping their accounts in such a way as to somehow shelter hidden profits.  This premise just does not stand up when it is seen that the majority shareholders sold out <Col N="1276" /> without getting any effective benefit for any such positioning.  Any credence somehow that this assertion might have disappears when the reality of how vulnerable and precarious the company were for a number of years is brought to light. In fact the 1982 rearrangement of capital was at a stage when the very existence of the company was threatened and when there were genuine risks that the company would go into receivership.  There had been a number of debt reschedulings and some of the company's lending banks had indicated that they could go no further. Surely, this is not the identikit of the alleged treasure trove as painted by some of the Tara critics.  Perhaps it is understandable to think in these terms when a significant output and value added in the company is taken into account.  Clearly, Tara have been very successful in terms of employment in the Navan area and as a significant net contributor to the balance of payments. Once again it is easy to equate high sales figures and profitability though on examination these will be seen not to bear any close correlation with one another.</P>
    <P>The royalty issue deserves further scrutiny however.  It is transparently clear, given the availability of capital allowances, that the company had no royalty liability up to the end of 1982.  When the company's draft 1983 accounts became available in mid-1984, there was sufficient improvement in the company's trading position to indicate that at least a theoretical basis for seeking royalties could arise.  It became clear in 1985 following legal advice obtained by the Department of Energy on the methodology in calculating the profits of the company for royalty purposes, and from contacts with the company, that strong disagreement existed between the State and the company on important questions which were relevant to royalty liability. One notable area of contention was exchange losses: the question of currency exchange losses on borrowings in the Tara context arose through funds raised by Tara on the foreign currency markets to bring the Navan mine into development. The company's view had always <Col N="1277" /> been that exchange gains and losses on this debt are financing costs in the same way as normal interest payments on loans.  While the revenue accepted that the interest on bank borrowings is fully allowed there were certain different interpretations as to the possible treatment of exchange gains and losses.  Given the possible uncertainty of this issue revenue disallowed all offset based on this issue in the profits computations prepared for the Department of Energy for the purposes of royalty calculations. Another issue which contributed to the difficulty was disagreement on the timing of capital allowances.  It was quite apparent that these arguments could only be resolved by recourse to arbitration.  In February 1987 counsel for the Department of Energy advised that a computation of the company's profits for royalty purposes should be prepared by the Revenue Commissioners for the years 1978 to 1984, so that a royalty demand based on these years issued to the company.  The main reason for this move was to formally establish that a dispute existed which required to be resolved through arbitration.  Revenue computation put this procedure into play. The Revenue Commissioners made a demand for £4.789 million based on a figure of £107 million profits for the first seven years of operation of the company.</P>
    <P>Despite extensive explanation in this House and elsewhere this figure has been bandied around as if it were an <i>ex cathedra</i> declaration of the actual position. I cannot stress too much that this was a perfectly legitimate and acceptable opening gambit by the Revenue Commissioners to get the arbitration process under way.  Revenue prepared the computation on the basis that the State's approach on every item of disagreement would prevail.  This demand was, quite naturally, rejected by the company.</P>
    <P>The demand of £4.789 million was seen as representing the best possible scenario for the State; the Revenue Commissioners made it clear at the time that having regard to the nature and extent of the disagreement with the company that <Col N="1278" /> there was a strong possibility that no royalties would be recovered for the first seven years of operation.  However, the arbitration process would settle the basis for computation of royalty for subsequent years.  Following protracted correspondence with Tara agreement was reached on the appointment of an arbitrator in September 1987.</P>
    <P>As an aside here I know that the PAC expressed certain disquiet that it should take so long to get the arbitration process under way.  That is a view with which one could readily identify.  However, I know that the accounting officer explained to the committee that there was a certain difficulty in assembling a legal team with a track record in problems related to mining and taxation.  It was very important for the State that they be represented in the best possible way.  In any event, the delay in itself did not in any way undermine the State's entitlements.  Consultations with the office of the Attorney General with a view to engagement by the State of counsel with special expertise in the various aspects which would be put before the arbitrator had already commenced before the formal royalty demand was made.  These consultations were still in process in mid-1988 when arrangements were put in hand to sell the State's shareholding in Tara Mines Limited.  Early in these negotiations it became clear that an opportunity existed to settle the royalty issue for once and for all on terms attractive to the Minister for Energy.  At this stage the Revenue Commissioners were asked to prepare further and more realistic royalty computations. They confirmed their original private view expressed in March 1987 that there was a strong possibility that no royalty would be payable for the first seven years of operation.  They estimated that on a cumulative corporation profit tax basis the range of royalty payments that might be due right up to date, that is for the first 11 years of operation, from 1977 up to 1 January 1989 inclusive, could be in the range of £1.5 million to £2.3 million. Even at that the top of this range was regarded as being optimistic.  A more realistic figure could be at the bottom of <Col N="1279" /> the range at £1.5 million.  I hope the recall of these figures will help defuse some of the heat generated over the value of royalties.  Indeed, together with the advisers on the sale the assessment by the Department of the full value of the royalties, both past and present, came out at about $11 million.</P>
    <P>In summary the price received for the sale of the shareholding was excellent. Despite the inherited weakness of the original agreement and the further dilution of the State's rights in the 1982 capital rearrangement we managed to get a price which beat the benchmark set by the original majority shareholders and all reasonable expectations we could have hoped for based on conventional approaches to valuation, notably those of net present value.</P>
    <P>Such a good result does not come about by chance.  When negotiating with a company of the stature of Outokumpu considerable care would have to be exercised in ensuring the best possible return for the State.  Indeed, Outokumpu, while now experiencing some temporary difficulties, have been a strikingly successful company with growing interests worldwide. They have, in particular, received much favourable press commentary for their skilful purchases and acquisitions notably in the mining sector, but even Outokumpu when coming to negotiate did not consider they had sufficient in-house experience for this type of deal. Outokumpu employed first rank financial and mining advisers in London.  The Department of Energy equally in their approach to the sale of the shareholding wished to ensure the very best possible return would be obtained for the State. It would, of course, be very easy to take the penny wise, pound foolish approach and conduct the exercise totally in-house. The Department of Energy's approach was more measured and far seeing; it was determined to take on board the best possible combination of consultants, international commodity experts and legal advisers so as to ensure that the State's negotiating position was as strong as it could possibly be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> The flaw inherited in the original 1975 agreement whereby the State was effectively locked in by the majority shareholders also had a spin-off effect in the Department's approach to the employment of consultants.  It is normal practice in the Department of Energy to appoint consultants or financial advisers after a competitive process in which price, track record and specific expertise are all taken into account.  If, however, the engagement of financial advisers had been, in this instance, put out to tender we would have been giving a clear signal to Outokumpu of our long-range intentions.  This would have put the State, and ultimately the taxpayers, at a disadvantage.  In the event, therefore, the financial advisers were selected on the basis of mainly qualitative criteria and notably a demonstrated ability to deliver imaginatively, particularly in less than orthodox circumstances. Following a broad review of requirements, National City Brokers were appointed to act as the Department's advisers.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that NCB are the largest independent corporate finance and stockbroking house in Ireland.  As NCB are not associated with any bank, they had no potential conflict of interest because of lending relationships or other banking relationships with Tara or Outokumpu.  The fee basis was totally standard for transactions of this sort.  NCB charged based on value achieved. If NCB had not delivered such a substantial payment for the Minister for Energy, NCB would not have received the fees.  The only other consultancy payment to NCB by the State is for advice in relation to the flotation of Irish Life. As the Minister for Finance has already informed the Dáil, the award was based, not only on expertise, but also on the fact that the NCB tender was the lowest.  The Department of Energy believe very strongly in value-driven fees.  The <i>ad valorem</i> fee type structure is widely used in business.  It gives people an incentive to achieve the best deal for their clients. In this particular case, the State got 98.5 per cent of the benefit.</P>
    <P>While the Department of Energy had <Col N="1281" /> been the prime movers in the process, the very successful outcome was in no small way attributable to the sustained work, professionalism and advice of NCB.  People very often focus on the absolute size of a fee rather than on its relative size and its ultimate net cost to the State.  The really relevant questions are, of course, was value obtained for the fee and did NCB contribute materially to the price, which was above estimates of reasonable expectations?  The answer is a clear &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, and the Department of Energy were well served on this occasion by NCB.  In practice, the net cost to the Exchequer was considerably less.  First, of the total amount of £662,000 was a VAT payment of £132,000 which when included is a mere exercise in circularity as the VAT payment reverts automatically to the Exchequer.  In addition, a withholding tax of £170,000 was also deducted from the payment, leaving a normal net cost to the Exchequer, by excluding the VAT and withholding tax elements, of £360,000.</P>
    <P>In previous questions in the Dáil on this issue, the Minister for Energy has pointed out that the services rendered by NCB were way beyond those that would be involved in a normal brokerage transaction. Of course there was a brokerage element and if the whole exercise had been simply one of brokerage then the fees would have been much less.  This transaction, however, was unique in that it required sustained input and advice on the approach, the valuation, international commodity prices and a large amount of legal work, together with intensive work at the negotiation stages. The NCB input into this whole process was considerable.  From January 1988 NCB Corporate Finance Limited gave a full working commitment to the review of the Minister's rights and powers under the State/Tara shareholding agreement and mining lease and started detailed financial analysis of Tara's performance and future prospect.  The main component of the work done by NCB in the first half of 1988, aside from the strategic advice on the emerging positioning by the Department relative to Outokumpu, was <Col N="1282" /> the preparation of a preliminary report of the State's objectives and expectations in the sale negotiations.  This involved an exhaustive review of the company's operations, up to date research into zinc and lead metals and concentrate markets, currency exchange rate forecasts and operating costs and revenues estimates. The approach called for widespread and discreet discussions with Department officials and other sectoral interests in Ireland and overseas.  This work culminated in the building of computer models to value the State's shareholding in Tara Mines.</P>
    <P>The one key essential negotiation hurdle was to get the agreement of Outokumpu to set aside the binding selling mechanism as stipulated in the 1975 agreement and to allow the Department, and their advisers, access to Tara's detailed records.  This access was, of course, covered by confidentiality clauses which I have already explained.</P>
    <P>While it would be too timeconsuming to go into all the quantitative and modelling work done by the NCB Team, the approach is based on two principal valuation techniques to the ordinary share capital of Tara Mines, namely, discounted cash flow, DCF, and valuation based on the Outokumpu offer of 1986 to buy out the original majority shareholders.</P>
    <P>The DCF method involved projection of Tara's future cashflow on the basis of carefully considered assumptions in relation to lead and zinc prices, currency exchange rates, other key production data based on ore reserves, operating costs and production schedules.  When these cash flows are discounted back to current prices an indicative value of the State shareholding was obtained.  The many variables and underlying assumptions for this calculation were subjected to a wide range of sensitivity analysis tests.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Outokumpu offer for Tara Exploration and Development in February 1986 was not taken at face value but was analysed in very great detail. Furthermore, adjustments were built in to take account of the depletion of the <Col N="1283" /> mine in the interim period and of changes in metal prices, exchange rates, mine operating costs and other elements, notably the market discount which would normally apply to the highly illiquid minority State shareholding as against the premium which attached to the majority readily saleable shareholding purchased by Outokumpu in 1986.  The indicative figures derived from these exercises correspond broadly to the DCF figure calculated quite independently.</P>
    <P>NCB also valued past and future royalties payable to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another key element to the NCB advice was to get the timing of the approach right.  While negotiators for an operating mine such as Tara would automatically disregard the commodity prices ruling at the time of negotiation, in practice the psychological backdrop of high or low prices can often be a determining factor in a successful sale.  Part of the NCB advice was to get the timing of the substantive negotiations right.  This they did, one could argue, to perfection.  The key indicator here is the price of zinc. Zinc is much the more important factor, as there is about five times as much zinc as lead and because zinc is considerably more valuable.  The average world price of zinc in dollars per metric tonne has been for 1986, $758; for 1987, $799; for 1988, $1,247; for 1989, $1,659; for 1990, $1,515; and today, $1,056.</P>
    <P>With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear the advice the Minister received from NCB was outstanding.  Relative to today's prices zinc was over 50 per cent higher when the Department and NCB concluded the sale.  The annual figures mask an even more favourable set of monthly figures.  In fact, the NCB advice on timing meant the negotiations conducted in the early months of 1989, coincided with the highest price ever recorded for zinc in the last 15 years.  The monthly average price for zinc as quoted on the London Metal Exchange for February 1989, was $2,006 a tonne; prices are now languishing at $1,050 a tonne.</P>
    <P>NCB also exercised the same degree of expertise in relation to lead price and <Col N="1284" /> exchange rates.  For example, the lead price at the time of the negotiations was over a third higher than the level it is today.  If the Department and NCB had not moved at the most advantageous time from the State's perspective there is a real danger that the Minister would have achieved the values implied in the 1982 deal instead of over ten times that level.</P>
    <P>Instead, Tara, as expected, performed very well in 1989 and 1990.  This, as indicated, was due, primarily, to the very high metal price and relatively strong dollar in 1989.  It was the expectation of these profits that enabled the State to get $50 million for its interests.</P>
    <P>The royalty was payable out of pre-tax profits and the amount of the royalty deductable as a charge for tax purposes. Consequently, while the royalty level was 4.5 per cent the effective royalty would now have been 2.7 per cent.  As a result, in 1989, the Minister would have received in the region of $2 million and in 1990 in the region of $1 million.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had not sold his shares, he would have been entitled to dividends out of the after-tax profits if the majority shareholder decided to declare one. However, based on the historic experience of no dividend payments, the expectation of dividends would be low, even in a bumper year such as 1989.  It should be noted that, in 1989, Outokumpu only paid 16 per cent of their earning out as dividends.  As should be clear from these figures, the Minister received excellent value from his interest in Tara.  He was only able to achieve this result by selling against the background of optimism on mineral prices and exchange rates which existed in 1989.</P>
    <P>In the criticisms of the price obtained by the State for its shareholding certain spurious calculations have been made based on speculation on the Galmoy find by Conroy and indeed more recently that of Ivernia West.  We have all been heartened by the Galmoy find and further encouraged by the recent potentially exciting discoveries of Ivernia.  The Department of Energy and indeed the Geological Survey Office work closely with prospecting companies and facilitate <Col N="1285" /> them in every way possible.  We all hope that both these finds will, in time, develop into very worthwhile commercial projects, bringing with them much needed employment and local value added.</P>
    <P>Comparisons with Conroy are both potentially misleading and dangerous. Conroy has, of course, proven reserves of over 6 million tonnes, but in addition, Conroy has identified other mineralisation zones and has additional licences.  The reserves in Conroy are of a higher quality than the ore at Tara.  In addition, the value of Conroy has been enhanced by the discovery by Ivernia and at the market belief of a strong mineralised zone along the Rathdowney trend.  Unlike Conroy, Tara has a very defined area without the same upside potential.</P>
    <P>In essence the sale agreement for the Tara shareholding and the royalties focused on a single composite figure.  The final agreed $50 million included both elements.  The whole thrust of the negotiation revolved on settling on this single figure; the breakdown into the individual components were not seen as crucial.  The Department of Energy, however, always had a clear view on how they valued the components, which in aggregate were reckoned to be worth approximately $40 million.  The additional $10 million over and above the detailed calculations of value as calculated by NCB on behalf of the Department was gained by negotiation. As there were two Outokumpu companies involved in the purchase it was necessary for the figure to be split up.  It was Tara Exploration and Development which is a 100 per cent company owned by Outokumpu, which acquired the Minister's shares in Tara Mines Limited while it was Tara Mines Limited who had to settle their royalty liabilities to the Minister. Accordingly, the aggregate figure was broken down in a ratio of 2 to 1 for the shareholding <i>vis-á-vis</i> the royalties.</P>
    <P>I have taken a certain amount of time out to explain the whole history and circumstances of the sale of the State's shareholding.  I have done so because given the inherited difficulties, the Department's approach was one which <Col N="1286" /> was both sensible and yielded good results.  The PAC for their part have not stated that in fact the price obtained was not good.  The problem, as seen by the committee, was that they did not have full access to all the papers which, in their view, would let them come to such a conclusion themselves.  This is the kernel of the report by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Once again the Tara dossier contained circumstances which gave rise to particular problems.  The agreement concluded by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1975 with the company contained a strict confidentiality clause. In addition, the Minister at the same time in agreeing a State mining lease for Tara approved the inclusion of a covenant which undertook that all information and data supplied and all books and records made available by the company would be treated as confidential.  The accounting officer, in these circumstances, could not make available to the committee the NCB report and related documentation which drew freely on data which was clearly covered by these former legal confidentiality stipulations.  The accounting officer's position was supported by the legal advice of the Attorney General. Indeed, the Attorney General has advised that the Minister, and through him, the State, could be liable to damages for any loss or injuries sustained as a result of such a breach of the confidentiality clause in the original shareholder's agreement or the covenant in the State mining lease.</P>
    <P>I note it is the committee's view that the agreement of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to his undertakings in both in the shareholder's agreement in 1975 and the parallel State mining lease has precluded the proper discharge of the committee's duties as they see it under Standing Orders.  The PAC should be facilitated in every way possible in their examination of departmental accounts.  I know the Department's accounting officer shares this view and has stated so publicly to the committee. Nonetheless, the situation in which the accounting officer found himself was one <Col N="1287" /> which was quite clear cut; it was just not possible to facilitate the committee by giving them direct access to data which was held by these contractual obligations relating to confidentiality.</P>
    <P>I also note that the committee are also of the opinion that no further agreement should be signed on behalf of the State which may impinge on procedures for public accountability.  As a general aspiration, that is something most people could go along with, but there will always be situations where that may prove to be difficult or impossible.  Indeed, the committee expressed their grave concern at the implication of the accounting officer's statement that even if there were not legal prohibition on the disclosure of information in this case he would still have difficulty in disclosing it, or indeed any commercially sensitive information held by the Department.  While, as I have already stated, the committee should be facilitated in every way in their scrutiny, and indeed the Comptroller and Auditor General should have direct access to any documentation he should so choose in pursuit of his constitutional duties, there may well be circumstances where documents could contain information that would be harmful either to any individual or an enterprise if they were made public. Indeed, every Deputy in this House, I am quite certain, could cite many instances of the interaction between individuals, or companies, with the State where confidential commercial information is made available to Government Departments.  The accounting officer for the Department of Energy in his capacity as secretary for example also holds a full range of such information from off-shore exploration information to details on oil company operations together with mining, prospecting and other development information.  There are many instances when it just would not be possible to release information in any way which could be identifiable as pertaining to an individual or a company.  The very operating methods of the CSO are familiar to all Members of the House; <Col N="1288" /> Government Departments are effectively bound in the same way.</P>
    <P>The committee in their concluding remarks in their report call for changes in the terms of reference of the committee along the lines proposed by their own special report dated 18 May 1988 on the future role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I can tell the House, however, at this point that the Government have before them at present proposals from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in regard to the future role of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The recommendations in the 1988 special report of the Committee of Public Accounts on &ldquo;The Future Role of The Comptroller and Auditor General and The Committee of Public Accounts&rdquo; are being considered in this context.  I should also mention that the Department of Finance have circulated separately proposals in regard to the complex issues of privilege and compellability, issues brought to the fore also by the need to cater for the possible televising of Oireachtas committee proceedings.  It is expected that the proposals will be brought before the Government at an early date.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that until the Government have fully considered these matters and reached decisions on them, I am not in a position this evening to comment in detail on the views of the Committee of Public Accounts in that regard.</P>
    <P>From the evidence given by the accounting officer and what I have said here today, it is crystal clear that the conclusions drawn by the Department and their advisers from all the evidence available to them, including the confidential information obtained from Tara, that the realised price of $50 million was very favourable when compared to the reasonable expectation of the value of the State's interest was in the region of $40 million.  I can assure the committee and this House that any perusal of the report and its supporting information would not lead to the conclusion that the State was sold short in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> I can also categorically state that without these confidentiality provisions the State would have been seriously handcuffed in securing essential information in the hands of the company and would have suffered accordingly.  No such inhibitions, of course, applied to the majority shareholder who was in possession of all the relevant files through their control of Tara.  In those circumstances confidentiality has its uses and must be respected, even if the question of breach of legal obligations and possible claims for damages never arose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts in finally winning this debate. I only wish that he had chosen a day when I had time to put together my thoughts on one of the most important issues to come before this House in recent years.</P>
      <P>A number of fundamental issues are raised by this debate.  One of them concerns the right of this House to information and full disclosure on business transacted in the name of the taxpayer and the State by or under the aegis of any Minister.  I do not think the Minister dealt adequately with that area.  The second question is in relation to what the sorry Tara Mines saga tells us about the conduct of industrial policy which led eventually to such disenchantment on the part of the Government because of their inability to extract royalties of any significance from the operator.  They finally threw up their hands and said they wanted to get rid of their remaining stake in that company.  There is also the question of what lessons, if any, the Government have learned for the future in the conduct of mining policy.  We are facing the prospect of a major mine on the Kilkenny border to which the Minister referred.  Have we learned any lessons for the future in our dealing with the mining sharks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the use of consultants, how they are selected on behalf of the State, and their competence and expertise to advise on such a complex, difficult and new matter as far as Ireland is concerned.  These are major <Col N="1290" /> questions and, as I said, I would like to have had an opportunity to prepare for this debate because I am functioning largely from memory.  The questions raised are so grave that even the lengthy, detailed considered reply which the Minister made is not adequate to dispel the questions in the public interest which are raised by this affair.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a long &mdash; and apparently detailed &mdash; response.  I am quite satisfied that nobody in this House is in a position &mdash; certainly I am not &mdash; to absorb the figures and details which the Minister set out in attempting to justify that the disposal of our interest in this mine, together with the disposal of future royalties, for the sum of $50 million, was an adequate price and whether the State got value for money, the critical question brought to our attention by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We do not know whether the Minister answered that question, despite the pages of obviously very deliberate reasoning that went into it.  However, the Minister is wrong in saying that the Committee of Public Accounts expressed no view about the adequacy of the price or whether it was disposed of for an inadequate price. The entire questioning of most Members of the Committee of Public Accounts could only lead one to that conclusion, no other inference could be taken from the meetings we had in relation to this matter except that the Members of the committee were of the view that our valuable stakeholding in this mine was sold for a bargain basement price.  It was also clear that we had the most serious concerns in our minds about the competence of the consultants to advise on this matter.  We have serious questions about the manner in which they were selected, why this particular company were selected and why the enormous sum of £600,000 plus fees were paid for the advice given.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in putting his reply to the issue before us in the context of the lease signed in 1975 by the then Minister and Government.  It was a disaster and I am sure if that Minister was still in politics he would agree.  The Attorney <Col N="1291" /> General's Office have leaned on it very strongly to justify the refusal of information which the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts brought to the attention of the House this evening.</P>
    <P>In all the history books and in what passed for civics classes in those days, we were told we were a poor country without natural resources other than land.  We were told that we had no mining resources or mineral deposits of any value, but then we discovered that we had the most valuable lead zinc deposit in Europe at Navan.  I find it very difficult to appreciate how a Minister &mdash; and his senior advisers in the Department &mdash; could have decided public policy in relation to Tara Mines in the way they did in the wake of their experience of Tynagh, County Galway.</P>
    <P>People may have views about multinational companies, the employment they provide and the desirability of so much of our industrial base being so dependent on multinationals, and if they were not here, we would be a great deal worse off.  We must have them.  Mainly they provide jobs but profits are repatriated and they are extremely difficult to deal with on the question of transfer price fixing and so on.  However, it is generally accepted in business circles that the multinational companies are babes in the wood compared to the international mining sharks who are the most ruthless, transnational companies on the face of the globe.  They contrive &mdash; as they did very successfully in Navan &mdash; to ensure that no profit is shown at the end of the year and, consequently, no royalties are payable to the Government.  It is extraordinary that this company which, by common consent, is the most profitable lead zinc mining company in Europe and which began trading in 1978 attempted to show the State right up to 1982, through the use of transfer pricing, capital allowances and the other mechanisms available to them, that they were not liable to pay royalties.  Having regard to the terms of the lease they were invited to rip us off.  Any lease which was designed to impose royalties on profits <Col N="1292" /> rather than on the ore mined was destined to allow the multinational put its hand into our back pocket.  That is what happened in this case.  Eventually, the Government, despaired at their inability to extract anything from this most valuable national resource, and decided to sell it off.  We got nothing from Navan except the jobs created underground and in the administrative services.  This is the most depressing chapter in Irish industrial history.</P>
    <P>The mine could have been used as the basis of industrialisation to create badly needed jobs.  Instead, if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; I was involved in a different capacity at the time &mdash; we managed to supply no fewer than seven smelters on mainland Europe and exported £608 million worth of ore during that period; yet the State did not get one two penny piece.  The Minister of State was right to view the matter against that backdrop.  That is what we inherited. Unfortunately, I do not see any evidence that we have learned our lesson.  We allowed ourselves in our despair, having been outwitted by Tara Mines, to be railroaded into selling off what was a valuable stake.</P>
    <P>The question which must be asked, as Deputy Mitchell said, is whether the people of Ireland got a fair price once our masters decided that we should cut our losses and sell off our remaining stake.  I am not interested in the price of metal on the London metal exchange.  The price of metal on the London metal exchange is equivalent to the price of oil in the exchange in Rotterdam or elsewhere. What we are talking about is a natural resource which could have been used as the basis of industrialisation.  We spend a lot of time whingeing and complain that as we do not have the raw materials Germany has in the Ruhr Valley with which to create jobs we have to import raw materials and that this should be taken into account but we had them in this instance and what did we do?  We shipped them out to Germany, Belgium and so on and then gave up in despair after looking at an ugly, empty hole in Tynagh which is what the Canadian outfit left us <Col N="1293" /> with when they pulled out of this country. We took the same road in the case of Tara Mines.  That is a sad, sorry, black chapter in Irish industrial history.</P>
    <P>Did we get value for money?  We did not.  It will take me some time to pour over the figures the Minister of State has presented this evening but I cannot for the life of me see how everyone who commented on this matter could have been wrong.  In the time available I did not have an opportunity to gather together all of the various documents and comments made at the time but the following headline appeared in <i>The Sunday Press</i> on 30 April 1989 &ldquo;Tara stake goes for a song&rdquo;.  I do not think the Minister of State would claim that <i>The Sunday Press</i> has any dangerous Left wing leanings and its financial commentator said:</P>
    <P>The Government stake in Tara Mines has been sold for a song.  This is the implication of figures which emerged with the announcement of the sale by Energy Minister, Michael Smith. </P>
    <P>He went on to outline some of the figures involved which we all know about and concluded:</P>
    <P>It has also emerged that the price paid by Outokumpu includes the agreement by the Irish Government to drop all future claims to royalty.  This lowers the price paid for the share of the mine even further. </P>
    <P>Any Government who make a deal such as that ought to be arraigned before the court of public opinion but regrettably for the reasons outlined by Deputy Mitchell we are not in a position to arraign them.  When we sought the necessary information on behalf of the public at the Committee of Public Accounts at the critical stage it was not forthcoming for the reasons outlined by Deputy Mitchell. The Secretary of the Department, the accounting officer, in the circumstances in which he found himself felt he was constrained by the lease and did not answer our questions or provide us with the documents despite our right to send for persons and documents.</P>
    <P>The secretary sought the opinion of the <Col N="1294" /> Attorney General in a note which read as follows:</P>
    <P>The Secretary seeks to be advised whether the terms of clause 6.06/6.07 of the shareholder's agreement and covenant L in the State mining lease preclude him from releasing a copy of a report drawn up by NCB Corporate Finance Ltd. to the Dáil Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>The relevant clause and covenant entitled the Minister to obtain certain information from Tara Mines Limited and to have access to their books, property and records, subject, however, to an obligation to treat as confidential any material so obtained.</P>
    <P>I am informed that in the preparation of the NCB report the clause and covenant were invoked so as to obtain information and access to books and records.  To the extent that the NCB report contains such information obtained through the use of the clause and covenant its publication to any person other than the Minister or officers of his Department would amount to a breach of contract and to a breach of the covenant in the lease. If the Secretary were to release such information he would expose his Minister to an action for damages in the event that the Company suffered any loss or injury as a result. </P>
    <P>The opinion of the Attorney General was as follows:</P>
    <P>I agree the Minister and through him, the State, would be liable in damages for loss or injury sustained as a result of such a breach of contract or covenant. </P>
    <P>It was a sad state of affairs that in the opinion of the first law officer of the State information on the lease entered into could not be made available to the Committee of Public Accounts and hence to Dáil Éireann.  It was both extraordinary and dangerous that a Minister could enter into an agreement on behalf of the people of Ireland and we could not be supplied with sufficient information to make a decision on the question of whether we <Col N="1295" /> got value for money and that, as Deputy Mitchell has said, is the nub of the issue. A great many people down through the years, some with expertise in the area, have commented that we were sold short to the tune of a great many millions.  The issue before us this evening, however, is whether this House has the right to such information.  I agree that we have to address this issue because of its implications.</P>
    <P>I am aware that legislation is hopefully imminent that may assist us in this area but, as far as I am concerned, many of the questions listed by the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; Nos. 1-8 &mdash; have not been answered by the Minister to my satisfaction.  I do not think some of the questions are capable of being answered to our satisfaction because another deficiency in the operation and effectiveness of a very good working committee of this House is that they do not have available to them expertise that could advise us on a case such as this.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts ought to be empowered to secure professional expertise on an issue as complex as this.  One is not confronted by this kind of issue every week.  There are certainly issues of waste and imprudent spending in various Departments for various reasons and for which we as politicians should take responsibility for the most part, but in a case like this we need to be guided on the validity of the statements of those who claim to have the expertise, made publicly through the years, that the State got a bad deal.  Apart from the point I made about whether we should have gone down the road we did at all, we should be able to validate and compare like with like in terms of the expertise available to us.  For example, it occurs to me that once the State began to flex its muscle and claim a share of the action when ore of an enormous value was being exported, the company claimed they could carry forward losses from one year to another year.  Every time it looked like we were getting near some of the action they came up with another impediment and another <Col N="1296" /> obstruction.  I do not think that has been adequately documented down through the years.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has been sufficiently frank in advising this House on the impediments that were put in the way of his Department in attempting to police the agreement such as it was.  It is generally and commonly agreed, even by the Minister for Energy, who confirmed it to me in this House, that it was a bad agreement.  Bad agreement as it was, the Department were obstructed at every hand's turn by the then majority stakeholder in the mine from trying to give effect to the terms of that agreement. The Minister has gone to some pains in his terms to tell us, &ldquo;the State got a handsome price.&rdquo;  I do not know how the Minister can come into this House with a straight face and tell us that in his view the State got a handsome price out of this debacle.  On 7 December 1989, for example, I put a number of questions to the Minister for Energy.  I asked:</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that to permit any multinational company to determine the level of its profits before the State gets any share of the stake is foolish, having regard to the widespread use of the transfer pricing mechanism in order to present profits in accordance with the wishes of that particular multinational company in any country?  A royalty extracted on the tonnage of ore would be more beneficial to the State than a royalty extracted on profits.  Will the Minister consider this situation in terms of the mining leases he is examining, and to which he referred earlier, and specifically in the case of Galmoy on the Laois-Kilkenny border? </P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>All I can say is that I am not here to pass historical judgment on decisions that were made in regard to the Tara Mines operation other than to say that, in my view they were far from satisfactory. The House can be assured that in regard to any similar find, a much more satisfactory regime will be applied on behalf of the State. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> There were several exchanges on this and my colleague, Deputy Mac Giolla, and I have taken it up on several occasions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy does not defend the position and he promises a more profitable regime for the State in the future.  Indeed, the then Progressive Democrats spokesman on Energy &mdash; whom I think is now an adviser in the Department of Energy, the former Deputy, Mr. Pat O'Malley &mdash; raised this matter a great many times in this House. There was widespread concern about the manner in which we, the Irish people, went like lambs to the slaughter.  We were fleeced by the mining moguls in this case. Now the issue that the chairman of our committee has brought before the House is really a minor dimension of the whole debacle.  Once the State decided to wash its hands and sell off our remaining minority shareholding the only question that can be asked is whether we got a fair price.  I submit to the House that, on the basis of all the independent expertise around the place, we did not get a fair price and it has only rubbed salt into the wounds of what has been one of the most damaging and fatalistic experiences in Irish industrial history.  I do not use that kind of description easily.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the points raised by the former Deputy, Mr. Pat O'Malley who in a radio interview on 2 June 1989 said in response to questioning that:</P>
    <P>One of the disturbing features of this Government's term in office has been the highly selective way in which their powerful friends have been given lucrative contracts and paid excessive fees out of public funds. </P>
    <P>That attack came in a statement from Progressive Democrats TD Mr. Pat O'Malley who was interviewed by Cathal Mac Coille and who went on to say:</P>
    <P>Well, I'm complaining about that certainly, Cathal, there are other areas where favouritism has certainly played a major part in the outgoing Government in relation to people, that they're closely associated with.  But, on the one you raise in connection with Tara <Col N="1298" /> Mines, the State's shareholding in Tara Mines, the 25 per cent was sold recently for £35 million, the financial consultants who handled that, were paid a fee of £530,000 which is equivalent to 1½ per cent of the value of the transaction.  Now, stock-broking circles have confirmed to me on numerous occasions since I first raised this matter in the Dáil, that that is an absolute exorbitant fee and is totally unjustified and that a more normal fee for a transaction of this nature would have been somewhere in the region of about .35 per cent or £120,000.  The position with regard to the State shareholding, the 25 per cent shareholding in Tara Mines, that there was only one possible purchaser of the State's shareholding, that was the majority shareholder, Outokumpu, and given that particular situation I had asked the Minister in the Dáil, whether he could (a) justify the fee that was paid to the financial consultant NCB and (b) whether he had indeed sought competitive tenders for a better fee from other people in the stockbroking area to complete this particular transaction.  In relation to both of these queries, the Minister assured me in a fairly general way, that he was satisfied with the procedures that were adopted in relation to this sale, but, in view of the very exorbitant fee, I don't accept what the Minister said. </P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley went on to justify this by saying that it was widely known that the principal of National City Brokers was closely associated with the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  The interviewer identified the principal as Dermot Desmond, which Mr. O'Malley confirmed.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter of the looming crisis in the home help service in Dublin and elsewhere.  I have been approached by representatives of the 250 home helps in the Finglas area and separately by the home help organisers in relation to two separate but related matters. There is great concern in the home help service about the impact of the part-time workers' regulations on the many thousands working in this area in a semivoluntary capacity, receiving token payments and providing an extremely valuable and varied service for the elderly.  In the context of the disappointment over the carer's allowance, the limited number of places available in residential homes and the desirability of maintaining people in the community, the home help service is vital.  Many of those who approached me are so concerned about the impact of the regulations that they sought to be excluded from the provisions of the legislation. The consequence is, however, that they would lose all the valuable protections which have been provided.  They have contacted the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Labour but <Col N="1300" /> nobody seems able to tell them where they stand and what has been arranged.</P>
      <P>The home help service is already suffering from the effects of very slow payments and as a consequence they are running massive overdrafts.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be very familiar with the wonderful service run in Finglas by Sister Phil from the social service centre where we both hold our advice centres.  They have an overdraft of £15,000 which is causing them great difficulty. This morning a similar voluntary group running St. Helena's nursery have been told they must put people on protective notice because their cheques are being bounced by the bank due to the fact that the health board are not paying on time.</P>
      <P>The part-time workers' legislation will mean that the cost of maintaining these services will increase phenomenally. Unless there are cast iron guarantees from the health boards that the money will be forthcoming promptly, it will be impossible for local organisers to maintain the services.  There must be immediate clarification to reassure home helps that they will be provided for and that this service will have a future.  All groups operating in partnership with the State service should receive funding in time so that major additional costs will not be incurred which undermine their ability to provide important services.  In the case of St. Helena's nursery the charges have amounted to £2,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to raise this matter last week because of the very disturbing reports which are circulating.  I hope the Minister will have researched the matter and will have prompted the Eastern Health board to make payments which have been outstanding in some cases for three or four months.  Hundreds of voluntary agencies are picking up the tab for the inequalities in our society.  These voluntary workers operate the meals on wheels schemes and hundreds of home helps visit sick and lonely people in deprived areas, giving them some semblance of respect and dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Startling evidence has been emerging <Col N="1301" /> all over Dublin that the Eastern Health Board are falling behind more than ever in their payments to these voluntary agencies.  The result is that home care workers are afraid there will not be sufficient funds to pay their £2 per hour. Many of these agencies, some run by religious and others by lay people, are running up bills for foodstuffs which they are unable to pay.  They are forced to use bank overdraft facilities on which the interest rates are cripplingly high.  It is intolerable that these voluntary workers should be forced into this position.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with the most deprived sections of the community. There should be a guarantee of payment one month in advance so that people can buy supplies and organise various services.  The contributions for the health board must be upfront.  I suspect that the problem is not being deliberately created by the Eastern Health Board.  They have been under-funded this year to the extent of £6 million and are trying to juggle their books to keep their own bankers at bay. It is a straightforward matter.  I heard the good news today that the Eastern Health Board have paid the Finglas group substantial funds which will tide them over. I hope similar funding has found its way to the other caring agencies operating a meals on wheels service from Beaumont Hospital and Crumlin Children's Hospital, among others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the contribution of both Deputies on these issues which are closely related.  First, there is no real basis for saying that there is a looming crisis in the home health service in Dublin and I want to outline the reasons I make that statement, which I do not make in any dismissive manner.  In the current year the Eastern Health Board will spend £3 million on the home help service and £1 million on meals on wheels.  The service has been strenghtened in recent years.  The funds which will be made available to health boards under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will provide <Col N="1302" /> the resources to enable health boards to further develop these services in a planned way right through the period of the programme.</P>
      <P>The implications which may arise for health boards and voluntary organisations as a result of the enactment of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time) Act, 1991, are being examined by my Department in consultation with the agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>Specific provisions have been introduced in the past in relation to the impact of amendments to statutory regulations on the home help service and similar action will be taken on this occasion if it proves necessary.</P>
      <P>As the House may be aware, in many instances the home help scheme is operated as a good neighbour scheme.  Volunteers who work as part-time home helps are paid a stipend or gratuity for the service they provide.  As operated in many areas, this is meant only as a contribution and is not intended to compensate fully for the task undertaken. The voluntary nature of the service, which involves a large element of social commitment, is underlined by the fact that a significant proportion of part-time home helps are engaged by voluntary bodies.  Indeed, in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that it is extremely difficult to assess the nature of an employment relationship without having regard to the particular circumstances in individual cases.  My Department in conjunction with the Department of Labour are currently examining the position in relation to the contractual status of part-time home helps.  As the scope of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees) Act, 1991, is confined to employees, i.e. persons employed under a contract of service or a contract of apprenticeship, it is not clear that the terms of the Act would be applicable in cases where a contract for service exists and where individuals engaged in a voluntary service are given a stipend or gratuity in respect of a service they might provide or are <Col N="1303" /> remunerated on a fee per service or fee per session basis.  It is anticipated that the applicability of the Act and any consequent implications, financial or otherwise, for groups providing home help services will be clarified without undue delay.  That is what Deputy Flaherty is seeking and I think we are agreed on that.</P>
    <P>Turning to the comments from both Deputies about difficulties arising in certain voluntary organisations because of delays in funding the service, cash is made available by my Department to health boards on cash profiles which are linked to each health board's approved level of expenditure.  It is a matter for each board to manage the issue of payments so that it makes the optimum use of the total cash available to it and deals with its creditors is a fair and consistent manner. There has been some delay in recent weeks in the making of payments by the Eastern Health Board to organisations providing home help services.  However, the current position is that all outstanding payments were made to these organisations by the board during the course of the last week.  All outstanding payments have now been made and, given the priority afforded by the board to these payments to the voluntary organisations concerned, I do not anticipate that there will be any further difficulties in maintaining a satisfactory situation in the support of this very important and cost effective service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue. It is a matter of the greatest importance when one considers that upwards of £26 million of taxpayers' money has been spent over the last number of years providing what we understood to be a comprehensive and modern system of communications for the Garda Síochána in the operation of their duties.  It is with great distress that we read in our national newspapers that the system does not appear to be working.  What is worse for the citizens who have paid so dearly for it, is that their rights are not being protected in the way the system was originally designed to do.  It is important that we get a full explanation from the Minister of State here tonight as to what is wrong with the system, what steps are being taken to put it right and how soon the Garda can work with this system to the fullest effect.</P>
      <P>The fact that there were major problems with the new Garda communications network was already a matter of public knowledge.  The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the huge over-run in costs in his report last year.  A system that was meant to cost between £3 million and £5 million ended up costing almost £30 million.  In an Adjournment Debate here on 14 March last I drew attention to the difficulties gardaí were having with the new system and how the Garda Commissioner had effectively banned the use of walkie-talkies in an effort to compel gardaí to use the new system.</P>
      <P>However, if the failure of the new system is as extensive as was reported in yesterday's <i>Irish Press,</i> then it is clear that this is a major scandal involving huge public expenditure on a system that is cumbersome, unsatisfactory and possibly unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effective communications system is an essential prerequisite for an effective policing system.  It can determine not only the number of criminals arrested <Col N="1305" /> but can sometimes mean the difference between life and death for a person under attack.  There have been complaints in the past about delays in dealing with 999 calls, and it was hoped that the new system would improve the situation. However, if anything, it seems to have made it worse.</P>
    <P>What seems beyond doubt is that there has been a considerable level of resistance among members of the force to using the new system.  I hope it is not a question of the members of the gardaí deliberately obstructing the use of the system in the hope of securing some productivity money.  Such an attitude would be most unfair to the taxpayer whose money has been spent installing the system.</P>
    <P>It may be that the gardaí have been inadequately trained in the use of the system and that they do not have any confidence in it, or it may be that there are not enough staff trained in its use, and that there are not enough trained staff to cover when other officers are sick. It is difficult to know what the problems are.</P>
    <P>An internal report prepared and highlighted in the exclusive in the <i>Irish Press</i> yesterday indicated a number of major conclusions which I will go through briefly.  It was found that despite the introduction of this very costly system the manual records kept in the 43 Garda stations have not been eliminated.  It seems incredible that gardaí are still manually recording detail with this expensive computer and communications system beside them.  In small Dublin stations the system is being used for very few incidents.  Garda management are being denied the many benefits of the system, not to mention what the taxpayer and the citizen are being denied as a result.  Little use is made of the system on the performance of individual gardaí for merit purposes or for distributing the workload.  There is very limited reporting of exceptional incidents with a view to finding the reasons behind the figures. There are problems caused by gardaí not properly entering details onto the system. There seems to be many problems, all of <Col N="1306" /> them contributing to a breakdown in what is a very expensive and up-to-the-minute facility.</P>
    <P>It is the ordinary gardaí from district sergeant level down who have to operate this system, but what level of consultation was there with them before the system was drawn up?  That seems to be a major bugbear, that this expensive white elephant was put in place without the members who were to work it to make it operative being consulted in the first instance. Whatever the reason for the present unsatisfactory situation, there is a strong obligation on the Minister and on the Minister of State to clear up the mess and ensure that this appalling waste of public money ends without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of responding to Deputy McCartan's question because the subject matter has, I believe, become the source of some confusion following various public comments made yesterday and again this morning.  I would like to begin by quoting the full text of a statement issued yesterday afternoon by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, which, so far as I am aware, has not been carried in full by the media.  The statement was as follows:</P>
      <P>Like all systems involving the use of advanced modern technology, certain teething problems were experienced when the computerised Command and Control System in Dublin became operational.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities immediately took the sensible course of asking the Operations Research Unit (ORU) of the Department of Finance to examine the matter.  Last October the ORU conducted a survey and, on the basis of this survey, submitted a report to the Garda Commissioner in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report, which has been quoted from, selectively, in a newspaper article today, indicated that the difficulties <Col N="1307" /> arising had to do not with the equipment itself, but with its use and with factors completely outside the system.</P>
    <P>One of the major issues, for example, was that about 40 per cent of calls made on the system were in response to security alarms at business and other premises, 99 per cent of which were false alarms, attributable, for the most part, to faults in those alarms.  I have already announced in the Dáil that I have approved the introduction of a new policy aimed at reducing the incidence of such calls.</P>
    <P>There are some residual complaints from Gardaí about the system, but, again, there is nothing very surprising in the fact that staff, whether in the public or private sector, tend, at times, to be critical of changes which are made possible by technology.  This is especially true when, as a by-product of better service to the public, the technology also enhances the capacity of mangement to monitor the daily performance of staff much more closely than was possible heretofore.</P>
    <P>All of the residual concerns voiced by Gardaí are currently the subject of examination by a Chief Superintendent with a view to identifying what further measures may be necessary in order to ensure that the public derives the full benefits which the new Command and Control System is undoubtedly capable of producing. </P>
    <P>That concludes the Minister's statement. However, there are certain points which I would like to stress.</P>
    <P>First, the Department of Finance report referred to in the Minister's statement was not concerned with the Garda radio network as a whole but with the computerised command and control system in the Dublin Metropolitan area which cost, not £266 million as one might assume from various comments made, but approximately £2.6 million.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the report did not deal with the actual system itself, technology or its technological capacity at all but with its <Col N="1308" /> use.  The Department of Finance, who prepared the report, are anxious that this point should be stressed and in fact the report itself specifically states that what the expert analysis was concerned with was, and I quote: &ldquo;the use which was being made of the Command and Control System and the amount of information which was being produced with a view to seeing what improvements could be made&rdquo;.  The report also stated, and again I quote &ldquo;It was decided that no useful purpose would be served in making a technical assessment of the computer system in this study&rdquo;.  Finally, and most importantly, in a paragraph headed &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo; the Finance report states that &ldquo;The major problem currently confronting the Command and Control System is the difficulty in improving the level of acceptance of this system at all ranks and thereby improving the amount and quality of data entered&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The third point I would like to make is that the report found that, while there were instances in which some delays occurred in responding to calls, these were relatively isolated and that the average response time was excellent and in line with what was expected of the system.  It is important that people in the community who feel vulnerable should know this and should not be frightened into believing that the new system somehow marks a disimprovement in the capacity of the gardaí to respond.  The contrary is the case.  The fact that there were delays at all is of course a matter which requires attention and it was precisely because of this that the Garda authorities sought expert advice in the first place from the Department of Finance. As the Minister for Justice stated yesterday, a chief superintendent is already engaged in the task of resolving any residual difficulties that remain.</P>
    <P>The fourth point that I think needs to be stressed is that this matter has an industrial relations side to it.  Again, there is nothing very surprising in this; it is clear that one of the tasks of staff associations &mdash; whether in the public or the private sector &mdash; is to represent the interests of members who naturally become a little <Col N="1309" /> uneasy when management acquires the capacity, through technology, to supervise day-to-day performance more closely.  Dealing with the industrial relations aspects of technological change is obviously a matter of importance. There are however various fora in which matters of this kind can be dealt with &mdash; in fact the chief superintendent who is now looking at the residential problems I have mentioned is working with a committee who include staff representation. I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not for one moment suggesting that all of this boils down simply to an industrial relations gripe &mdash; far from it &mdash; but I am saying that there are industrial relations considerations, that there are ways of dealing with these matters and that it is preferable that they be dealt with through well-tried channels rather than here in this House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think it is important to make the point that today's debate arises basically from the fact that an official document intended for internal guidance on improving the use made of the system came into the hands of a newspaper reporter, that it is possible that somebody released the document to secure unethical publicity and that the more publicity that is given to the matter the better we may, unwittingly, serve the purposes of the wrongdoer &mdash; whatever those purposes happened to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I wish to reflect the serious concern of the people of County Laois at the rumoured proposed new Garda scheme of rural policing.  In my view these fears are well founded as the proposals amount to a thinly veiled cutback on the part of the Minister for Justice.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind the high level of rural crime which will be fuelled <Col N="1310" /> by the introduction of measures that will withdraw the services of the Garda from rural communities.</P>
      <P>I am speaking particularly about the future of Garda stations in County Laois in villages like Durrow, Ballacolla, Clonaslee and Arless and the town of Mountmellick.  In fact, the level of serious and vicious crime in rural areas of County Laois in recent times is an argument in favour of the strengthening of the force rather than a withdrawal of service.</P>
      <P>The Minister must acknowledge the marvellous and dedicated work of voluntary bodies such as Community Alert throughout County Laois who have contributed in no small way towards keeping down the incidence of crime in the area. This experiment to withdraw gardaí and reduce the rural Garda station to a mere office open for a couple of hours a day is simply not on.  It has given rise to fears not only among the gardaí themselves but perhaps more particularly among members of the general public.  Close co-operation, inter-action and contact between rural Garda and the local community is the hallmark of crime prevention and detection and in my view this is at risk with Garda stations closed down.</P>
      <P>The existence of highly mobile criminals in rural Ireland, particularly in County Laois, who rove the countryside in cars and vans putting the elderly and those living alone and the most vulnerable in our community in fear for their personal safety is the greatest argument in favour of a greater strengthening of the Garda force on the ground.  The widely rumoured experiment is simply not on and I ask the Minister of State to confirm to the House for the benefit of all concerned that the plan is not merely postponed until after the local elections on 27 June but scrapped in its entirety and that a commitment be given to rural communities that this experiment which failed in Kilkenny and Mayo when tried under a pilot scheme will not be foisted on the people of County Laois.</P>

      <P>The reform of rural policing practices, which have existed <Col N="1311" /> since the foundation of the State and for a considerable time before then, is a matter of considerable importance to us all.  I agree with Deputy Flanagan that a full measure of consultation with and explanation to the interests involved is desirable.</P>
      <P>That is why the Garda authorities, for example, have engaged in full consultation with the Garda representative bodies before putting their proposals in the matter to the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, conscious of the fact that consultation with other interests is also necessary and we are naturally attending to this also.  I have already commented publicly on certain matters which appeared to be a source of concern.  I have explained, for example, that no closure of rural Garda stations is planned and that no reduction in the number of gardaí attached to rural stations will result from the implementation of these very important and carefully thought out proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is envisaged is a drastic reduction in form filling procedures in smaller <Col N="1312" /> Garda stations coupled with increased resources for gardaí in rural Ireland. When I talk of increased resources, I have in mind extra clerical and computer back up, more Garda vehicles and more involvement by local Garda management in the policing of rural areas.  We are still fine tuning this scheme in consultation with the Garda authorities, and when our plans are finalised they will be made fully public, and the views of interested parties, including elected representatives, like Deputy Flanagan, will be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I am very confident that Deputy Flanagan and his other Oireachtas colleagues and the people of County Laois will be more than delighted to accept the very new modern and enlightened proposals which we have to provide 24 hour security cover for the people of Ireland, both rural and urban.</P>

      <P>When court fees were last revised in December 1989, the opportunity was taken to rationalise the overall fee structure. One result of that rationalisation was that some family law proceedings were exempted from fees under the Supreme Court and High Court (Fees) Order, 1989 (S.I. No. 341 of 1989).  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, had only just come into force at that time and it was decided to leave over consideration of the question of exemptions from fees for proceedings under that Act until there had been some experience of its operation.</P>

      <P>The new unit in Mountjoy Prison, which will provide accommodation and treatment facilities appropriate to the needs of offenders suffering from infectious diseases, including those who are HIV positive, will include in-cell sanitation.  This is in accordance with the general policy of providing in-cell sanitation in all new building or major reconstruction projects. Work on the unit in Mountjoy commenced in April of this year and is expected to be completed in about 18 months.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made into the situation in the Fermoy District Court office and I find that I must reject the Deputy's contention that there are considerable delays there.  The Fermoy office services District Court sittings at Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Lismore and Tallow and scheduled court sittings have been operating normally at these venues.  I am not <Col N="1196" /> aware of any undue delay in dealing with office work at Fermoy District Court.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the staffing position in Fermoy and I understand that procedures for the temporary assignment of replacement staff to the District Court office there are operating satisfactorily and are kept under constant review.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the widely reported high level of drug abuse within our prisons, he will outline the plans, if any, he has to screen all those visiting the prisons; if he has any proposals to secure the perimeter of our prisons in order to prevent the throwing of drugs into exercise areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some drug abuse in the prisons but it is not as extensive as is sometimes suggested.  Such abuse is possible only to the extent that drugs can be brought into the prisons illegally.  The quantities involved can be very small and the difficulties posed for prison authorities in preventing their access are obviously great.</P>
      <P>Measures could be taken, such as the erection of barriers between visitors and prisoners, and the strip-searching of all persons, including visitors entering the prisons, which would virtually eliminate the problem but the result would be an inhumanely restrictive visiting regime.</P>
      <P>The measures that are being taken, such as the closer supervision of visits, the provision of surveillance cameras, restrictive visiting arrangements for known drug smugglers and increased perimeter security, should help to reduce the problem.  The need for further measures will be kept under review.  The most effective deterrent is staff vigilance, and drug identification and control form part of the prison officer training programme.</P>

      <P>Awards for compensation made under the criminal injuries compensation scheme are paid as quickly as possible within the resources available.  Following the allocation of an additional £4 million to the scheme by way of Supplementary Estimate last year, the delay between acceptance of awards and payment to applicants was considerably reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will understand that, as in the case of all public services, funding for criminal injuries compensation has to be allocated on the basis of requirement, <Col N="1198" /> the competing demands for other services and the overall budgetary situation.  The possibility of providing additional funding for the scheme is kept under constant review in my Department.</P>

      <P>I keep the situation in the Sudan under close review, receiving information on the situation there from a variety of sources, including Fr. Aengus Finucane, chief executive of Concern, whose most recent note was prepared on 16 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fr. Finucane was able to report on some positive aspects, in particular on what would appear to be a more co-operative attitude by the Government of Sudan to the relief effort.  Fr. Finucane states, <i>inter alia,</i> that considerable amounts of grain were being permitted to enter the country; relief ships had been given precedence; foreign voluntary agencies have been registered; and political prisoners released.  However, he warns against any undue complacency; for example, there has still been no <Col N="1204" /> official admission of the extent of the famine.</P>
    <P>This information is in accordance with that received from other sources.  While the World Food Programme reports that 56 per cent of the assessed needs for 1991 have been pledged, nearly eight million people are still threatened by serious food shortages, particularly in the south.  The logistical problems involved in the relief operations are enormous.  The situation is worsened by the ongoing civil war, the grim economic circumstances and soaring food prices.</P>
    <P>The Government are deeply concerned about the situation in Sudan. Since January 1990 they have provided £500,000 in emergency relief from their disaster relief fund through a variety of Irish and international agencies involved in the famine relief effort.  They have also arranged for £250,000 to be provided to the Sudan through the World Food Programme. During the same period, the European Community provided over 30 million ECUs in emergency food and aid programmes for the Sudan.  Ireland, of course, participated in all these through her EC budgetary contributions.</P>
    <P>Most recently, in view of the famine crisis in Africa and particularly in the Horn of Africa, the General Affairs Council of 15 April agreed to provide a further 400,000 tonnes of food, with member states contributing about an additional 200,000 tonnes.  The value of this additional effort by the EC and its member states amounts to over 200 MECUS of which the Irish contribution is nearly £1.3 million.  It is to be hoped that this new effort by the Community will encourage other major donors to help close the remaining food gap for 1991.</P>
    <P>As proposed by Ireland, the Development Council of 27 May also agreed that a high level mission would be sent to the Horn of Africa.  Although the details of this political initiative have yet to be worked out it is hoped that it can assist the relief effort in the Sudan at this critical time by focusing political attention on the area and on the immediate actions which need to be taken by the <Col N="1205" /> administrations and forces directly involved.</P>

      <P>The Amnesty report describes what it calls &ldquo;a continuing pattern of human rights violations&rdquo;.  It states that people believed to have advocated Irian Jaya's independence, whether through peaceful or violent means, as well as refugees and others are &ldquo;at risk of being victims of serious human rights violations including political imprisonment, torture, ill-treatment and extrajudicial execution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by Amnesty International about these matters. I would hope that the Indonesian Government will respond to the call made in the Amnesty report for an impartial investigation of reports of human rights violations by their security forces; and I would urge that Government, with which Ireland has friendly relations, to ensure that the human rights of the people of the area are fully respected.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commisisoners that the procedure in question, which was first introduced generally in 1989, applies in cases of smuggling detections of dutiable goods where the offence is minor and of a noncommercial nature, and also in cases of less serious commercial offences.  In determining whether an offence is covered by the procedure, officers are guided by the amount of import charges payable.</P>
      <P>Goods liable to high import charges &mdash; such as spirits, wines and tobacco products &mdash; prohibited goods and livestock are not covered by the procedure.  In general, an offer of immediate release of goods would not be made where an offender has been detected previously, where a crew member of a ship or aircraft is involved, or where there are aggravating circumstances, for example, obstruction or assault of officers.</P>
      <P>I understand from the commissioners that the procedure, which enables the less serious smuggling cases to be dealt with expeditiously, is operating satisfactorily and is availed of in the majority of these cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 28 insurance companies authorised to transact motor insurance, which includes taxi insurance, in this country.  However, some insurers are at times reluctant to offer quotations for certain risks.  I would point out that such reluctance will normally flow from experience.  It can be that an insurer has had a poor claims experience on a particular policy, or perhaps the poor performance of a company's account in a specific area of cover is reflected in a company's attitude to quoting for risks in such area.  However, individual insurers are generally willing to quote for what they would term a reasonable risk.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that price control on insurance premia was abandoned in January 1986.  Since then insurers, including motor insurers, are required only to notify my Department of alterations in their rates.  I have no role in sanctioning such alterations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company to which the Deputy has referred have notified my Department of an increase in their loadings for additional drivers on taxi policies.  The loading/premium for the additional <Col N="1219" /> driver is now the same as the policyholder's third party premium.  An extra loading for additional drivers would not appear unreasonable given that the existence of such drivers would most likely signify that the vehicle would be in service for longer periods, perhaps 24 hours a day, and therefore exposed to a greater degree of risk.</P>
    <P>Any loadings which insurers apply are an underwriting matter and strictly the preserve of the particular insurance company. I have no function in allowing or disallowing specific loadings.  However, statistics show that, among the main classes of motor vehicles, taxis have the highest claims frequency rates and are almost four times more likely to be involved in an accident than are private cars.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Deputy of what I have said in this House on numerous occasions, in that, as the insurance supervisory authority, I have a responsibility to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  I do not have responsibility for the day to day operations of insurance companies.  Therefore, I must respect the right of insurance companies to make their own underwriting decisions in the light of their particular circumstances and assessment of the market.  No legal obligation can be placed on any individual insurer to quote in respect of any risk, to quote at any particular premium or to quote in any particular manner.</P>

    <P> *1990 figures are provisional. </P>
    <P>With regard to figures to date from 1991, the position is that these have not been finalised.  The tentative estimates which are available indicate that the number of similar burglaries in the Shankill area in the first three months of this year were 135.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the point, of course, that estimated figures gathered over a relatively short period for particular areas cannot be regarded as being firmly indicative of a longer term trend. It is necessary to make it clear also that the Garda authorities keep the crime situation and policing needs in each area under constant review and make such adjustments to police response capacity in these areas as they deem necessary.</P>

      <P>The fact that the practical and project tests are common to both papers allows students to keep open the option of taking the higher or ordinary level examinations until the day of the written examination itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All leaving certificate subjects will be reviewed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment over the <Col N="1233" /> next few years and it is not intended to make any changes prior to that process.</P>
