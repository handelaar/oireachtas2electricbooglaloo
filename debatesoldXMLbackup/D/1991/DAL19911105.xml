      <P>Of the £2.354 million received from the Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust, a sum of approximately £78,000 remains uncommitted.  In response to a question on 27 February last.  I gave the House details of all the <Col N="2" /> projects for which grants were approved. The bulk of the money has been allocated to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, £1.1 million, and for the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, £1 million.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy recently, I have allocated a further grant of approximately £54,000 to the Shaw Birthplace Museum Trust.  With the exception of this grant and an outstanding sum of approximately £32,000 due to the RNLI, all the grants approved from the Sailors' and Soldiers' Funds have been paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Maidir leis na muiroibreacha, is eol don Teachta gur cheadaigh mo Roinnse deontas £66,000 ar 12 Nollaig 1989 chun a chumasú do Roinn na Mara suirbhéanna éagsúla agus staidéar mion-samhail a dhéanamh ar an oileán chun fháil amach cad iad na hoibreacha mara is fearr a d'fhreastalódh ar riachtanais mhuintir an oileáin.</P>
      <P>Tá na suirbhéanna déanta ach is gá díriú anois ar an staidéar mion-samhail a dhéanamh.  Tá curtha in iúl do mo Roinnse le déanaí ag Roinn na Mara go bhfuil méadú tagtha ar an gcostas measta don staidéar.  Tá lúcháir orm a rá go bhfuil deontas breise £10,000 ceadaithe agam anois agus go bhfuil iarrtha agam ar Roinn na Mara tabhairt faoin staidéar gan mhoill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le aerstráice agus aersheirbhís don oileán, tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil an cheist áirithe sin á bhreithniú acu go fóill agus go bhfuiltear dóchasach go gcuirfear togra faoin gcás <Col N="4" /> faoi bhráid bhord an Údaráis roimh dheireadh an bliana.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>An aontódh an tAire go bhfuil sé beagnach trí bliana anois ó láinseáladh an plean forbartha do Oileán Thoraigh, agus gur ceann de na príomh chuspóirí a bhí sa phlean ná calafort ceart a dhéanamh don oileán, agus gur beag dul chun cinn atá déanta ó shin?  Tá géarchéim chumarsáide ar Oileán Thoraigh. An bhféadfadh an tAire a rá tar éis trí bliana cén uair a bheifear ullamh chun tus a chur leis an obair an-tábhachtach seo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta, ní féidir linn dul ar aghaidh go dtí go mbeidh an wave-model study déanta.  Chuireamar £66,000 ar fáil agus tá an stáidéar híodragrafach agus topografach déanta anois.  Dúirt Roinn na Mara linn go raibh níos mó airgid de dhíth chun an wave-model study a dhéanamh. Tá an t-airgead breise sin, £10,000, curtha ar fáil, agus is dócha go dtógfaidh sé suas le sé mhí chun an staidéar a chríochnú. Níl mé féin sásta nach bhfuil an staidéar seo againn roimh ré, ach bhí deacrachtaí ar an oileán maidir leis an aimsir agus le leibhéal na taoide.  Aontaím leis an Teachta cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé tús a chur leis an bhforbairt seo agus geallaim dó nach gcuirfidh mise ná Aire na Gaeltachta ná an Rialtas moill air seo.  Aontaím go bhfuilimid ag fanacht cúpla bliain anois ach tháinig mise isteach sa Roinn i lár 1989 agus thart faoi mí Samhain na bliana sin chuireamar an t-airgead sin ar fáil.  Tá moill curtha ach caithfidh mé bheith féaráilte do Roinn na Gaeltachta, mar mhol an Roinn i 1983 go gcuirfí airgead ar fáil chun na suirbhéanna seo a dhéanamh.  Ag an am sin ní raibh de dhíth ach £25,000 agus ní raibh an tAire Airgeadais ag an am sin, atá sa Teach inniu, an Teachta Dukes, sásta an méid sin a chaitheamh.  Is cinnte go bhfuil moill curtha air seo ach is mór an trua, nuair a bhí sé níos saoire an obair seo a chur i gcrích, nár tugadh cead.</P>

      <P>Sin leithscéal an-bhacach ón Aire Stáit, ag cur lochta ar <Col N="5" /> dhaoine eile.  Bhí an tAire Stáit ar an oileán nuair a láinseáladh an plean.  An aontodh sé, nuair a bhíomar go léir ar an oileán, agus an Teachta Dukes len ár gcois, gur thuig muintir an oileáin an lá sin trí bliana ó shin go mbeadh dul chun cinn mór déanta, taobh istigh de thréimhse bheag, go bhfuil an méid ama sin imithe agus nach bhfuil aon chalafort i dToraigh agus nach féidir leis an Aire Stáit dada a rá ach &ldquo;níor dhein sibhse aon rud i 1983.&rdquo;  Tá leithscéal níos fearr ná sin ó mhuintir Thoraigh agus uaimse fosta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Following representations made to me by the management of B &amp; I and the B &amp; I group of unions, I have decided to request my financial advisers, Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance Ltd., to open negotiations with a view to receiving a fully comprehensive management staff buyout proposal.  I have also instructed my advisers that negotiations with Irish Continental Group may take place at the same time.  It would be inappropriate for me to provide details of discussions with any particular party.</P>
      <P>Following conclusion of the negotiations a final decision will be taken by the Government.  Arrangements for completion of the sale will be put in place immediately thereafter, including the introduction of the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>The level of consultation with trade union interests in relation to this sale is possibly unprecedented.  To date, my Department have had approximately 20 meetings with trade union representatives, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as well as numerous bilateral contacts.  I have met trade union representatives on three occasions.  I am, therefore, satisfied that the legitimate requirement for consultation with trade union interests has been fully satisfied in this instance.</P>
      <P>I wish to remind Deputies that the Exchequer has invested £106 million in B &amp; I Line since 1965 when it was acquired from the private sector by the State, including £53 million since 1985. Despite an improved trading result in the current year, the company still require substantial Exchequer financial assistance to meet their ongoing commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> SKC Corporate Finance Ltd. were appointed by me last year to examine the future options for B &amp; I with the main objective of determining how soon the company's dependence on Exchequer financial support could be ended.  Having assessed the feasibility and financial implications of a number of options, the consultants came out strongly in favour of the sale of B &amp; I as the best option.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to sell their shareholding was strongly influenced by the fact that they do not have the resources for the continued heavy investment in the company which the consultants highlighted and which all parties concerned agree is necessary for their survival and continued development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister extend the time limit, which I understand is 8 November, for this staff buy-out offer to the end of this month?  Will he accept that eight working days is simply not long enough for them to put together a suitable package?  Will the Minister explain why a year ago he rejected a management staff buy-out and why he is now prepared to consider it?  Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that whatever deal is made, the State will retain a golden share, that redundancies will be on a voluntary basis and that the maximum level of shipping services will be retained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I set the 8 November deadline because this has dragged on for a long time and I am anxious to have it finalised as a matter of urgency.  As they can meet that deadline with a bit of effort, I propose to stick to the deadline, if possible. I will not be unreasonable, however, if on the day a few extra days are required.  I did not reject the proposition, as such, a year ago.  At the time we sought bids.  Five bids were received, one of them a MBO.  Consultants did not recommend that course of action but now we are giving them a second chance to make a bid for the company.  That is reasonable. I am determined to see the sale of B &amp; I through at the very latest by the <Col N="10" /> end of this year, but I want to make sure that all sides have an equal opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer my question, that whatever sale is concluded, the State will retain a golden share in view of the fact that 99 per cent of everything exported from this country goes by sea?  Will he ensure that redundancies are on an agreed voluntary basis, as part of any sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a guarantee with regard to a golden share.  We discussed this with the trade unions at the 20 or so meetings we had with them.  It is simply not practicable because it would mean the Government going back on their decision to effectively dispose of the line.  I reject the notion of a golden share.  With regard to redundancies, every effort will be made to ensure the least disruption and that any redundancies which are necessary are voluntary, but it would be foolish of me to guarantee that because most of that will be in the hands of the purchaser whether it be the MBO or Irish Ferries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Government's recent expenditure review it was decided to reduce the 1991 subvention for CIE by <Col N="11" /> £1.5 million from £109.6 million to £108.1 million.  Having regard to this decision and to CIE's difficult financial position generally, approval was given to CIE for an increase in CIE's rates and fares which would generate an increase of up to 5 per cent in group revenue on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>To counteract possible negative impact of the fares increase, Dublin Bus introduced a promotional campaign concerning the advantages of purchasing ten journey tickets.  While the cost of single journey tickets has increased, commuters who purchase ten journey tickets will not have to bear any price increases.  This strategy is designed to improve the standard of bus services generally, especially in Dublin city.  I understand that Dublin Bus expect that passenger carryings will increase as a result of the enhanced service levels resulting from this overall strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister read in <i>The Irish Times</i> today a report that Irish women were living in the middle ages?  If a French journalist was to write about the Minister and his transport policy he would be excused for thinking that the Minister too was thinking in terms of the middle ages with regard to transport in this city.  Will the Minister tell the House, and the hard-pressed and over charged public transport user, why he prides himself in cutting back the subvention to CIE by 15 per cent in real terms, the net result of which means an increase in fares?  Is the Minister aware that a husband, wife and two children leaving the outer suburbs of Tallaght to go to the city will have to pay £6.40 return?  Does the Minister consider that reasonable?  Will, the Minister tell the House what is so different about transportation in this city when compared with other cities in Europe? We have only a 19 per cent subvention level.  Cities like Athens have an 88 per cent subvention; Amsterdam has 78 per cent; Turin has 83 per cent; Brussels 73 per cent and The Hague 75 per cent. Every other capital city in Europe has a <Col N="12" /> subvention far in excess of that of Dublin city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not take enormous pride in cutting CIE's subsidy from £109.6 to £108.1 million.  All aspects of Government expenditure have been cut back and that is not a major cut for a particular company to bear.  I would prefer if we did not have to do it but we have to make sure that expenditure at all levels is controlled and that is a cut I believe they can handle.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me about high fares. One of the ways of tackling high fares is to introduce competition into the bus business of the city and if the Deputy supports that no doubt he will give me some support in introducing private competition so that we can have competition in the city and in the country and, hopefully, that will push down fares as it has done in many industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we do not do as well as other countries proportionately in subsidising our public transport because we are simply not as well off as some of the countries the Deputy mentioned.  We would like to do better but £108.1 million works out at about 3p in the pound income tax.  That is a hefty subsidy for public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring specifically to Dublin Bus which does not get such a heavy subvention.  Would the Minister agree with me that the fare increases in December last year and March this year <Col N="13" /> penalise the poor who are totally dependent on buses which are their sole means of transport and that it also drives passengers who own cars back into their motor cars and onto the streets further adding to the congestion on our roads? No matter what the Minister might say about his belief that Dublin Bus will be able to cater for more and more passengers, the reality is that since 1975&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister if he would not agree that the figures show that since 1975 there has been a constant decline in the numbers of people using public transport and a corresponding increase in those forced to use private transport, that is, cars, resulting in the traffic snarls and jams in our cities every day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers that use Dublin Bus have not decreased.  They have remained static over the past couple of years.  There was no increase in fares in 1988, 1989 or 1990; I refused increases to CIE in 1988 and 1989.  The increase in fares works out at 12 per cent over four years which is roughly in line with inflation.  That is the best we can do.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>whether, in view of developments in relation to the accounting rate system and other factors, he anticipates that he will soon be able to announce a reduction in international telephone charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiative in reducing telephone charges, including international charges, rests with Telecom Éireann and under the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunication Services Act, 1983 my approval for a reduction in charges is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann's commitment to reducing charges has been well publicised. Telecom Éireann sets out their pricing objectives as being: to achieve a strong competitive position within the EC in international calls; to eliminate differences between outgoing and incoming prices for international telephone calls on key routes.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy, and with my approval, a tarriff package will be brought into effect by the company in January 1992.  This package will reduce the national telephone bill by 8 per cent or almost £50 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>It has been my policy to ensure a steady reduction in telecommunication charges and the Deputy can be assured that this will continue.  Negotiations in relation to accounting rates are carried out on a bilateral or multilateral basis by the telecommunications operators or administrations. In the case of Ireland this is Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing with the Minister that this is mostly a matter for Telecom Éireann, does he remember comments he made at the last Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis when he said &ldquo;I will be taking action within a few weeks to reduce telephone charges&rdquo;?  He did not refer to the importance of Telecom Éireann then. Would the Minister agree that the Irish <Col N="15" /> business community and exporting community are suffering very considerably because international telephone calls here are 40 per cent higher than in France and 27 per cent than in the United Kingdom and Germany, and that the Irish Small Business Association came to the conclusion quite recently as a result of a survey that our charges were 40 per cent higher than the European Community average?  In view of these circumstances, would the Minister agree that urgent action is required to do something about it, particularly in view of international movements both at the level of the International Telephone and Telegraph Consumers' Association and also at European Community level to make reductions and that reductions ought to be made here as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1 January 1990 leased lines have been reduced up to 50 per cent to Europe and up to 45 per cent to North America.  Further reductions of up to 70 per cent in domestic and cross-Channel leased lines have been in place since 2 April 1990, and from 1 January 1991 there have been further reductions in leased lines of 23 per cent to Europe and 17 per cent to North America.  I agree with the Deputy that telecommunication charges are too expensive here, particularly international ones, and that is why I was pleased with the £50 million package which is to go into operation in January 1992 to extend local areas to deal with peak and off-peak calls and to reduce costs generally.  I have been pressing Telecom Éireann for a further reduction of about 10 per cent in international calls at or about the same time, next January or thereabouts.  The Deputy is quite right.  I have been pressing them and we have had some progress.  I will continue to press them particularly in the international side where, I accept, the calls are too expensive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 31 and 38 together.  In my formal review of the operation of the Broadcasting Act, 1990 I have consulted with all relevant interests including representatives of the independent radio sector, RTE, IRTC, the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, the Institute of Advertising Practitioners of Ireland, Film Makers Ireland, the National Newspapers of Ireland and representatives of the TV3 consortium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on revenue which RTE can derive from advertising, sponsorship etc. and the concerns of independent radio operators were some of the many issues considered during the course of the review.  That review has been completed and is currently being studied by Government.  I hope to be in <Col N="17" /> a position to make an announcement in the near future.</P>

      <P>May I express my annoyance and anger once again that the Minister can find more to say on a television programme about his plans in relation to this matter than he can say in this House. This is a large part of the problem in this country at the moment.  People do not come into this House and state their policies; they do so at various conferences, on television, etc.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that there are so many complicated issues at stake and that this is the third effort to get this thing right in about three years, would the Minister not consider that the right method of approach would be through the speedy publication of a White Paper which would look at all of these complicated issues such as the provision of the third TV channel, the question of monopoly versus competition, of public money for commercial stations, of a changed role for Network 2, the amount of advertising time, the question of capping advertising, the alternative news coverage and all of these involved issues in which there is a tremendous vested interest by all sections of the media.  In view of those circumstances, surely the case is extremely strong for a White Paper to get this matter right once and for all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 33, 37 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>I established a formal inquiry on 14 September 1991 into the transactions leading up to the acquisition of the Johnston, Mooney &amp; O'Brien site by Telecom Éireann on 29 June 1990; the inquiry was extended on 20 September 1991 to cover additional properties at Merrion Road, O'Connell Street, St. Stephen's Green and at the Gaiety Centre.  On 29 October 1991 the inquiry was further extended to cover the sale of property at Dundrum, County Dublin, which took place in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee of inquiry commenced their investigations on 23 September 1991.  The inquiry decided to concentrate their initial efforts on establishing the facts regarding the transactions relating to the Ballsbridge site as that property <Col N="22" /> was the property which had been the primary source of public concern.</P>
    <P>Most of the individuals and company officers who were interviewed by the inquiry offered to co-operate fully with the inquiry.  By 1 October 1991, however, the inquiry reached an impasse in so far as certain individuals/companies who had undertaken to provide information had not in fact done so.  The inquiry was surprised by these developments and felt that they could cause serious delay to their work.  The inquiry concluded that it should, therefore, request the immediate appointment of an inspector under the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The inquiry presented their report to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications on 1 October 1991.  The inquiry was conducted by the secretary of the Department of Communications with assistance of specialist legal, financial and property advisers from the public sector.  The inquiry team worked under extreme pressure and for long hours to produce their comprehensive report in less than two weeks.  They performed admirably and researched and conducted interviews in an effective, thorough and professional manner.</P>
    <P>When I established the inquiry I publicly declared that I would publish the facts and I honoured that commitment. The inquiry established 15 key facts and made five important recommendations. The first two recommendations related specifically to procedures by Telecom Éireann in property purchase and disclosure. These have been accepted by Telecom and are being implemented as appropriate.  Recommendations Nos. 3 and 4 refer generally to the Companies Act and have been presented to Government. Recommendation No. 5 asked for the appointment of an inspector under the 1990 Companies Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has appointed an inspector under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, to investigate and report on the ownership of Hoddle Investments Limited and Chestvale Properties Limited.  That investigation is ongoing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> With regard to the sites other than that at Ballsbridge investigations are continuing and a report will be issued in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the photograph which appears in some of the daily newspapers today tells its own story about this affair.  In respect of the recommendations to which the Minister referred, does he acknowledge that one of the recommendations of the McDonagh inquiry was that it probably would be necessary to amend the Companies Act because the appointment made under section 14 of the existing Companies Act may well be deemed to be inadequate to get behind especially the critical Cypriot connection and that the appointment made under section 14 has all the powers of an appointment made under section 8 except it does not give critical access to bank accounts?  If those persons continue to obstruct successfully the administration of justice in this area, will the Minister advise that section 8 of the Companies act be amended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no hesitation and I am sure no member of the Government would have any hesitation, in doing that.  As of now, the inquiry is proceeding under the Companies Act and I have no reason to believe they will not make good progress.  The Deputy is quite right when he says that the inquiry conducted by Secretary McDonagh did suggest that the Act should be looked at and I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it was open to him to seek the appointment of the inspector in this case under section 8, and thereby have the powers to follow financial transactions, rather than under section 14 which is the power he chose to use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The inquiry suggested that section 8 be used.  I gather it was on <Col N="24" /> that basis, and on other factors obviously, the Minister made his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the existing Companies Act contains provisions under which an inspector can obtain information about bank accounts and that for some reason the Minister for Industry and Commerce chose not to use that power which is already in the existing Act, without amendment, but used instead a power under which an inspector does not have the ability to go after bank accounts?  Would the Minister state if he had any consultation with or made representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ask him to use that power to ensure, without an amendment to the Act, that the inspector and ultimately the public would have information based on access to bank accounts in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did discuss the matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he took account of the McDonagh inquiry which proposed that a certain section be used.  The Deputy will understand that there are two sections, the first concerning the High Court and, second, concerning the Minister. They have different powers but, as I understand it, there are also different conditions laid down under which he would appoint such inspectors.  I gather, in one case, there has to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of fraud or something of that nature.  However, that is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and my inquiry recommended to him that he would appoint an inspector.  He selected the section which he thought was appropriate at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Minister &mdash; and this is intended to be helpful having being involved, as Deputy Rabbitte was, in the committee which dealt with this legislation &mdash; that the section which the Minister for Industry and Commerce failed to use does have sufficient grounds for the appointment of an inspector in this case in regard to the affairs of the company, i.e. Telecom, and <Col N="25" /> associated transactions, and should have been the powers used?  Will the Minister agree to re-examine the Companies Act, in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with a view to having an inspector appointed who can go after the money because, unless we have information about the money, it will be possible for those using overseas companies simply to conceal relevant information about who is really behind particular transactions?  It is only through a bank account that one knows who is benefiting from any transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely accept that and I will be happy to look at the matter again in so far as I have an obligation &mdash; or remit &mdash; to look at the Companies Act.  The Deputy is quite right, when one traces the money one finds out what is going on.  Let me be clear about one thing, the McDonagh inquiry, the inquiry of the Secretary of my Department, recommended to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he take action under the Companies Act and it was envisaged that they would use the strongest possible means.  I have no doubt, from my discussions with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that he wished to use the strongest possible section of the Companies Act, that was his wish, he obviously took advice on which sections were appropriate and took the strongest possible section which was open to him to use at the time.  As I said, there is no difficulty in looking again at the Companies Act to see whether we can improve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise that this will be my last question.  I put it to the Minister that it would have been wise &mdash; even <Col N="26" /> if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had had doubts as to whether he could use the particular section &mdash; to at least apply to the High Court and let the court decide he could not act under that section instead of deciding himself, as he did, and failing to obtain the necessary power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. However, my understanding from discussions I had with him was that that course of action was not open to him because there had to be prerequisites before he could take such a step.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue that point because the Minister seems to have accepted that the critical thing here is to follow the money trail.  He also seems to accept that we will not get behind the Cypriot connection &mdash; and, therefore, the back of the entire scam &mdash; unless we get access to the bank accounts concerned. Will the Minister agree that it seems odd, especially in the absence of him being able to explain clearly to the House why the Minister chose to make the appointment under section 14?  Will the Minister express his concern that some of the principals involved in this affair seem to be obstructing the smooth working of the inspector in his inquiry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly call again &mdash; as I am sure every Member would &mdash; on everybody concerned to fully co-operate with the work of the inspector.  I expect that everybody will do that; it is important to finish the job of getting to the bottom of what happened in the Telecom Éireann matter.  I am determined <Col N="27" /> that that will happen and I know the Minister for Industry and Commerce is also determined in this regard.  I assure the Deputy that any action which needs to be taken to ensure it will happen, will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister agree that the inquiry under section 14 of the Companies Act being conducted now by the inspector appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in danger of being baulked because, as other Deputies have pointed out, the inspector cannot follow the money trail?  Is the Minister also aware that there is contrary legal advice available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;to many of us on this side of the House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could appoint an inspector under the High Court, despite the preamble to section 8, who would not be baulked in pursuit of the money trail?  Will he have discussions with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take the view of this side of the House into account to see whether he can proceed forthwith to appoint an inspector under section 8 who could follow the money trail and operate with the full powers of the High Court behind him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the inspector said, to date, that he cannot follow the money trail.  I am aware, as is the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of the preamble to that section in regard to a High Court appointment.  Obviously my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, took the view that the preamble prevented him from going that route.  His judgment was that the other route would be speedier and equally effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the Minister's judgment and perhaps the Deputy <Col N="28" /> would like to question him in that regard. I will certainly pass on to him the legal advice which the Deputy appears to have received and I will suggest that he study the comments made today in the House. We all want to get to the bottom of this and it is important that we do so speedily.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of any communications, formal or informal the Taoiseach had with persons (details supplied) on (1) the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and (2) the proposed Telecom Éireann site in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that one of the persons mentioned met the Taoiseach on many occasions in the past number of years.</P>
      <P>I assume that person took the opportunity, as he regularly did in the public arena and in meetings, to make his views known again to the Taoiseach, as he has done with many Ministers and Members of the House from all sides, on the subject of privatisation of Telecom.</P>
      <P>My understanding is, however, that no formal meeting took place with the Taoiseach and that person on this issue.</P>
      <P>When the issue of privatisation studies was raised during September, I made the following statement on 12 September 1991:</P>
      <P>As a matter of good business practice and arising from routine, informal discussions between senior Department of Communications officials and the company, Telecom Éireann decided to undertake an exploratory study of their future equity options, competition, liberalisation and deregulation issues and EC policy.</P>
      <P>The Department and the Minister will receive a copy of the report, in due course, after consideration by the board.  The Minister will then decide whether or not to put proposals to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During June 1991 Telecom presented the Department with a copy of the Telecom <Col N="29" /> 1988 IBI/Parabas study.  The Department in July 1991 requested that Telecom in any update of the study also cover issues such as the regulatory framework, international competition and so on.</P>
    <P>Telecom subsequently in August 1991 selected IBI and NCB to prepare a study on the implications of privatisation.  Telecom did not discuss the scope of this study, the selection of advisers to conduct the study or seek the approval of the Government, the Minister or the Department for the study.</P>
    <P>I believe that organisations such as Telecom should study various options as a matter of course.  In this case although privatisation of Telecom would require new legislation, Telecom are entitled under the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, to conduct such studies.</P>
    <P>My position is that these studies by Telecom would be useful in considering all options.  I do not believe that proper decisions can be taken without adequate consideration of all the options.  In this case while Telecom went ahead with the IBI/NCB study without seeking my approval, which they did not require, I would have been and remain interested in the results of any studies.  In any case I was aware of the study and did not object to it.</P>
    <P>As a result of other matters involving Telecom and the Ballsbridge site, I suspended the work on the IBI/NCB studies pending the finalisation of the Telecom inquiry.  As the inquiry is continuing, I have not yet made any decision on this study.</P>
    <P>No formal consideration of the matter by the Government has yet taken place. There are no proposals before the Government regarding the future of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware no communication of any kind took place with the other person regarding the privatisation of Telecom.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Ballsbridge site which Telecom purchased, there was no contact between either person and myself or the Department until my Department wrote to Telecom on 15 July 1991 seeking <Col N="30" /> details of their plans for the site.  The letter stated:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to say that the Minister has noted from time to time references in newspapers to Telecom Éireann's proposed new head office in Ballsbridge which is to be constructed at an estimated cost of £25 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to inquire when he will receive a request from Telecom Éireann for his approval to this proposal</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely</P>
    <P>The following reply was received from Telecom, dated July 22 1991.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>Please refer to Mr. Ryan's letter of 15th July 1991 in regard to the Ballsbridge project.  I am not aware of any provision under which the Minister's approval is required for this project.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely</P>
    <P>I wrote again to Telecom on 31 July 1991.  The following is the letter:</P>
    <P>I refer to previous correspondence about Telecom Éireann's proposed new head office in Ballsbridge.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to find out details of the proposal from Telecom Éireann and I would be glad if you would provide information on the scale of the proposal, the likely cost, the manner in which the cost will be financed, the likely return on the investment involved and the current stage of development of the project.</P>
    <P>Telecom provided some information on the Ballsbridge site project on 3 September, 1991.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge there was no communication between the two persons referred to and the Taoiseach or myself or my Department other than set out in this reply and the interim report of the Telecom formal inquiry.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister ask <Col N="31" /> the Taoiseach if the Taoiseach met Dr. Smurfit to discuss the matter and if the Taoiseach made any representations to Dr. Smurfit about who should be appointed consultants for the privatisation study?  Did the Minister ask the Taoiseach if the Taoiseach had any meeting with Mr. Finnegan, the auctioneer dealing with the Telecom site in Ballsbridge, about the matter?</P>

      <P>I did not ask the Taoiseach about Mr. Finnegan.  I had no notification of that question and, therefore, I did not raise it with the Taoiseach.  In clearing this question for reply today I inquired from the Taoiseach's Department as to whether any formal meetings had taken place.  My understanding is, as I said in my reply, that no formal meetings took place with the Taoiseach and the person mentioned on this particular issue.</P>

I spelled out in my reply that the person mentioned by the Deputy in his question made no secret of the fact that he had strong views on privatisation.  I assume that on many occasions that same person made his views on the question of privatisation known to the Taoiseach.  He certainly made them known to me and I have no doubt that he made them known to many other Members of the House.</P>

      <P>We accept that Mr. Smurfit has very strong views on privatisation and he made no secret of them. I say, Mr. Smurfit, because I have as much objection to unearned titles as I have to unearned profits.  I put it to the Minister that there are dozens of senior personnel in An Bord Telecom who will aver to what I put on the record of the House on 17 October, that Mr. Smurfit communicated to the Taoiseach that he would not be prepared to take a further term as Chairman of Telecom Éireann unless he was assured that the company could be floated.  It was on the basis of that assurance that he went ahead and made the decision on IBI and NCB to which the Minister has referred.  Therefore, he did not need Government approval because he understood he had such approval.  Furthermore, this is the cause of the ludicrous spectacle on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; the date now escape me &mdash; whereby there is a statement from Dr. Smurfit saying he had done this on the instruction of Government and a statement from a Government spokesperson saying that they had given him no such instruction.  The Minister, up until today, has never satisfactorily explained how that dichotomy could appear in public.</P>

There has been a serious breach of the law which has been overlooked to date. The Minister has said he was told that a meeting took place.

In respect of the issue that has dominated politics for the past two months and which preoccupies businessmen, is the Minister seriously trying to tell this House, and expecting us to accept, that he did not discuss this matter with the Taoiseach; if he did not do so why did he not do so?  Is the Minister trying to tell us that he seriously does not know whether the decision to bring in NCB, the company that is at the centre of almost all of the affairs being inquired into, to carry out a study for Telecom was a decision of the chairman, a decision of the board, of the Government or of the Taoiseach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 19, 25, 44, 47 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, I have received many submissions and read many statements, including those referred to by Deputy Byrne, both for and against a change in current Government policy on the Shannon stop and I have met deputations from interest groups on both sides.</P>
      <P>I have been giving a lot of consideration to the various submissions received.  I have had extensive contacts with North American carriers about the possibility of their opening new air services to Ireland.  To date, I have not received any firm proposals from them but I have given a commitment that, in the event of concrete proposals being made to me by any US airline for significant new or expanded services to Ireland which would require a change in existing policy, I will discuss these proposals with both the Shannon and Dublin interests to see how best Ireland can accommodate extra business.</P>
      <P>I have also been keeping in close touch with Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus about the proposals they have made to North American and Soviet carriers about the potential of Shannon as an international hub.  I have given them every encouragement in their efforts to interest international carriers in this concept.  I understand that Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus have recently concluded an arrangement with a Soviet regional airline, whereby that airline will feed traffic between Minsk and the US via Shannon using Aer Lingus transatlantic services. This service is expected to commence on 2 December 1991.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta have also made proposals to other Soviet and North American carriers about the potential of Shannon as an international hub and a response is awaited from a number of such carriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> I have also recently received proposals from Aer Lingus seeking approval to operate services between Ireland and Los Angeles, on the basis of a direct service to/from Dublin, and also for the operation of some direct services between Dublin and New York.  The Aer Lingus proposals are supported by the results of a study by the Boston Consulting Group commissioned by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to Aer Lingus that the position remains that there is no change in current Government policy in relation to the Shannon stop.  I have no plans at present to commission a study in the matter but I will, however, continue to review the matter in the light of the steady stream of representations being received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the statements by the Minister for Justice on this issue?  Will he clarify the context of the statement and whether there is any element of collective responsibility on this issue?  Will he arrange to publish the report of the Boston Consulting Group on the economics of the routes and the future of Aer Lingus in the context of transatlantic business?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice was expressing a personal view; he represents a constituency, which I imagine takes a very strong view on one side of the argument.  Obviously there is a difference of opinion among a great many people, including Government Ministers.  The Minister takes this view on a personal basis.  I have no doubt, Deputy, that on your backbenches there are Members who take a different view from your own on this issue.  Secondly, in regard to the Boston Consulting Group, I recently received their report.  It is a very comprehensive report.  I am studying it and I shall consider whether or not I should publish it.  I would be inclined to publish the report if it is appropriate for me to do so.</P>

The Minister's response to questions today has done nothing to allay fears about the uncertain future of Shannon.  Will the Minister assure the House categorically and without any trimmings that the future of Shannon is safe and that it will continue to be the transatlantic airport irrespective of representations made by any sources to the Minister or the Government in the future?

      <P>The assurances I sought in reply to Question No. 7 about a commitment to a compulsory trans-atlantic stop-over at Shannon have certainly been weakened following the Minister's reply.  The Minister has confirmed that as of now it is the Government's policy but he has also given indications of a variety of discussions in which he is engaged.  In regard to the damage done by the public statement by the Minister for Justice, in which he described Shannon Airport as &ldquo;one old relic&rdquo;, I should like to ask the Minister who has responsibility for transport and tourism, whether he approves or not of that description of Shannon Airport. Does the Minister recognise the damage that has been done to our national image and how it reflects on management, workers and those associated with the tremendous growth made at Shannon throughout the years?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned that about 50 per cent of North American tourists coming to Ireland come via Great Britain and Europe and whether he is fearful for the very survival of the Aer Lingus limited transatlantic service to New York and Boston?  Is the Minister concerned that in order for that service to survive it must be allowed expand its operational range to include Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities in the United States?  Does the Minister not fear that the compulsory stop-over at Shannon will do for Aer Lingus what compulsory Irish has done for the Irish language, that is, kill it?</P>

      <P>The Minister's said he does not intend to commission a study. I find that comment strange in view of his anxiety to get his hands on the report prepared by Deputy Dukes.  That in itself is an admission that the Minister feels there is void there.  There is now talk of a second airport in Dublin, which, I imagine, would not be environmentally acceptable to many of the residents of our capital city.  If there is no stop-over at Shannon industries in the south west-region, namely, Cork and Kerry, will suffer badly.</P>

Will the Minister not further agree that it is far more important than any of these spurious approaches being made to him by airlines or the representatives of airlines in North America that he busy himself looking at getting more access points for services in North America?

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patent law has been revised only once since the foundation of the State.  That revision was in 1964 and the Patents Act of the same year is still the current law on the subject.  It is out of date in many respects and is particularly not conducive to expeditious examination of patent applications.  Accordingly, one objective of the present Bill, which will replace the existing Patents Act, is to bring the law in certain key aspects into line with that of other European countries, particularly <Col N="206" /> our EC partners, and to establish examination procedures for patent applications which are less officially time-consuming.</P>
    <P>Another main objective of the Bill is to enable the State to ratify the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.  The most significant of these two international agreements is the European Patent Convention which was signed by Ireland and 14 other European countries in Munich in September 1973 and which has been ratified by all our EC partners, except Portugal, and by Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein.  Many representations have been made in recent years by certain industrial sectors, by the Confederation of Irish Industry and by Deputies in this House, pressing for ratification of that Convention.  After ratification, it will be possible to designate Ireland as a country in which patent protection for an invention is sought in addition to any or all of the other states which have ratified the Convention; and for that purpose the applicant only requires to make one application to the European Patent Office (EPO) in Munich whereas prior to the Convention individual applications had to be filed with the national patent office of each state in which patent protection was required.  The European patent when granted by the EPO will have the same status in each of the designated states as if it were a national patent granted by the respective national patent offices; the effect will be the same in each state; and revocation of the patent by the national authorities will be possible only on the grounds specified in the convention.  Finally, the duration of the European patent &mdash; a 20 year term &mdash; will be the same in each state.</P>
    <P>In the interests, therefore, of effective protection of innovations the convention holds many attractions for applicants and I am pleased to be taking the opportunity of including in the present Bill, provisions which enable the fulfilment of the commitment to ratify signalled by Ireland's signature of this Convention in 1973.  I have been persuaded, too, that ratification is regarded by research oriented <Col N="207" /> industry as an important national incentive in the encouragement of industrial investment and innovation.  Most of our Community partners ratified more than 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Patent Co-operation Treaty earlier.  This Treaty was concluded in Washington in 1970.  It has been ratified by all the Community member states &mdash; with the exception, again, of Ireland and Portugal.  It has also been ratified by the EFTA countries, the USA, Canada, Australia and various other countries. The idea behind the treaty is to streamline patent application filing and novelty search procedures for applicants wishing to obtain patent protection in a wide number of countries.  Applicants may make one central application &mdash; generally to their local patent office &mdash; designating the countries in which patent protection is required and the novelty search is carried out by an International Search Authority whose report of the search is then furnished to the patent office of each country in which protection is sought. Final examination and grant is performed by the various national offices.  This system economises considerably on the amount of work an applicant would otherwise have to do in order to satisfy the multiplicity of individual national requirements.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of Part II deals with the making of applications for patents.  These provisions are broadly similar to the present law, with a few exceptions.  The possibility to file what is called a provisional specification with an application followed later by a complete specification, is being abandoned.  Under the Bill a specification describing the invention, and which includes claims defining the matter sought to be protected, will be required with an application.  Nevertheless, it will be possible to have a filing date accorded to an application which is not formally in order provided the minimum requirements of section 23 are complied with and the deficiency is corrected later.  Furthermore, it will be possible for an applicant to file an application and claim the priority of an earlier application <Col N="208" /> he has filed in the office for the same invention, whereas at present only the priority of an earlier filing abroad can be claimed.  These changes are more in line with modern practice elsewhere and are generally in the interest of applicants.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of Part II deals with the procedures for search and examination of applications.  The provisions here are different in a number of respects from the present law.  For an applicant who obtains a patent for the same invention in, say, the European Patent Office, Germany or the UK, it will still be possible to submit the specification of that patent as evidence of novelty and inventive step in respect of the Irish application.</P>
    <P>A further objective of the Bill is the creation of a special system of patent protection for smaller type inventions. This is the short-term patent with which Part III of the Bill deals.  I shall say more about this subject later.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being prepared I took the opportunity to review the procedures for examination and grant of patents under the present law.  I was concerned about this matter in view of the large and growing backlog of applications currently awaiting examination. There was no prospect of eliminating this backlog without changing examination procedures and I am glad to say that the Bill contains new provisions in this respect which will be both adequate for the purpose and speed up examination considerably.  Because of the existing large backlog, I have taken the opportunity, in the transitional provisions, of arranging that the new procedures will apply also in the case of all applications on hand when the Bill becomes law; otherwise the existing backlog, if processed under the present law, would take years to dispose of.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House I will now outline the principal features of the Bill, indicating the differences from the present law and expanding some more on certain of the objectives to which I earlier referred.</P>
    <P>Part I is a short, general, part listing definitions of terms used in the Bill; clarifying certain matters relating to orders or <Col N="209" /> rules made under the Bill and providing for repeal of the present law.</P>
    <P>Chapter I of Part II confirms the continuation in being of the Patents Office and the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks while Chapter II lays down the criteria that an invention must satisfy to be patentable, namely, novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability, and defines these criteria.  It provides that patents cannot be obtained for certain subject matters, such as scientific theories, computer programmes, methods of medical or veterinary treatment, inventions whose exploitation would be contrary or public order or morality and plant or animal varieties.  These provisions about what is patentable are quite different from and more specific than our present law which basically provides for the grant of a patent for any new or useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter. The provisions proposed bring our law into line with that of other European countries and are based on the corresponding provision of the European Patent Convention.</P>
    <P>I should say at this point that the Convention has acted as a harmonisation instrument generally in that those European countries which have ratified it have also tended to adopt the legal concepts of the Convention in their domestic law. As I have already pointed out, Chapter III of Part II deals with the making of applications for patents.  These provisions are broadly similar to the present law, with a few exceptions.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of Part II deals with the procedures for search and examination of applications.  The provisions here are different in a number of respects from the present law.  For an applicant who obtains a patent for the same invention in, say, the European Patent Office, Germany or the UK, it will still be possible to submit the specification of that patent as evidence of novelty and inventive step in respect of the Irish application. However, where no corresponding outside patent application has been made, a search report on the invention will have to be established after the filing of the <Col N="210" /> Irish application.  The search report will be established under the authority of the controller by arrangement with an outside office which is capable of doing an adequate novelty search.  When the foreign granted patent or search report, as the case may be, becomes available it will be laid open to public inspection by the controller in conjunction with the application and the applicant will be requested to submit any amendments to the specification of his application in the light of these documents.  Any amendments will also be open to public inspection.  The office will check whether the subject matter of the application is patentable.</P>
    <P>These procedures replace the elaborate and time consuming provisions governing examination which the present law imposes and which have led to the enormous backlog in examination of applications to which I referred earlier.  I am satisfied that the new procedures, which are similar to those in operation in some European countries, will work well in practice and make for a much more efficient and streamlined system.</P>
    <P>The public, too, will have the possibility of inspecting applications at all stages. In addition, there are provisions in the public interest enabling applications to be made to the controller or the court for revocation of a patent on any of a range of grounds specified in section 58; the grounds include non-patentability of the invention and non-entitlement of the proprietor to a patent therefor.  Thus, the system provides for a reasonable balance between the interests of the patent holder and the rights of the public.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the term of a patent will be 20 years; it is currently 16 years.  The 20 year term is, again, the norm applying in Europe and is also the term of a European patent under the Convention.  The research and development costs involved in developing and perfecting an invention can be very substantial.  Also, in the case of certain inventions such as new pharmaceuticals, official authorisation is required before the new substances can be put on the market; these authorisations can take a long number of <Col N="211" /> years to materialise, resulting in a significant erosion of the term of the patent. For these reasons the longer patent term is justified.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Chapter VII of Part II dealing with infringement of a patent follow generally the lines of the present law.  However, the Bill also provides, in accordance with the principles of the European Patent Convention, that proceedings may be instituted after grant for acts of infringement committed before the patent was granted.  This is necessary to deter third parties from committing infringements in the interval between the date of publication of a patent application and the grant of the patent.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill makes provision for the grant of short-term patents.  The provisions here are completely new to Irish law and were devised in the interests of the smaller inventor who may find the task of obtaining a normal patent too costly and time consuming and, therefore, a disincentive to protecting his invention.  Therefore, I have made provision which will ensure that short-term patents will be capable of being obtained without undue official obstacles and I intend to provide for lower official fees for these.  In doing this I am conscious of the fact that small innovators face more drawbacks, cost-wise and otherwise, than larger companies in the innovation process and I hope the provisions which I have made will prove encouraging to them and an incentive to commercialise useful inventions.</P>
    <P>The period of protection will be ten years.  This will particularly suit the less technologically complicated inventions which by their nature may not have very long life cycles but which nevertheless have an important place in the whole process of industrial innovation and in the encouragement of new project startups. I should make it clear that short term patents will not be confined to small inventions and, indeed, it will be possible for an applicant who has applied for a short-term patent to make a simultaneous application for a full patent and later <Col N="212" /> abandon whichever application he does not wish to pursue.</P>
    <P>The final Part of the Bill, Part XII, contains those provisions which are necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.  In the case of the European Patent Convention, what is basically required is that applications for European patents designating the State be treated as having the same legal status as national applications made to the Irish Patents Office; and that European patents designating the State, granted by the European Patent Office, be treated as if they were patents granted under our own national law.  Part XII of the Bill fulfils these requirements, making also a number of consequential and other miscellaneous provisions.  An important provision is that if the language of the specification of the granted European patent is not English, French and German being the two other permissible languages of the European Patent Office, a translation in English of that specification must be filed with the Irish Patents Office and published here in order for that patent to have effect in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards the Patent Co-operation Treaty, in order to enable Ireland to ratify this Treaty, the Bill provides that Ireland may be designated in international patent applications filed under the Treaty.  The Bill also specifies in section 127 that, as permitted by the Treaty, an international application designating the State shall be deemed to be an application for a European patent designating the State.  Availing of this possibility has certain desirable advantages: it means that functions concerning international applications which would otherwise have to be performed by the Irish Patents Office will, instead, be performed by the European Patent Office, and the result at the end of the day will be the grant of a European patent designating Ireland having the same effects which I previously mentioned in relation to European patents.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to mention another patent convention, namely the Community Patent Convention, which <Col N="213" /> was signed by Ireland and the other Community member states in 1975.  It will not be possible to ratify that Convention on the basis of the present Bill because an amendment of the Constitution is required before ratification of this Convention can take place.  This matter will be kept under review in the context of other possible amendments of the Constitution which may arise in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I recommend the principle of this Bill for approval by the House.</P>

      <P>We are accepting this Bill. In fact, I wrote to the Minister early in the year to say we would facilitate its passage through the Oireachtas because it is important that it should be passed as quickly as possible.  However, I have some complaints about the Minister's handling of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill was first published on 15 July, yet the explanatory memorandum in relation to this very important legislation was only circulated on 22 October &mdash; over three months later.  This is a difficult technical Bill which is not easily understood by the lay person and to have the explanatory memorandum circulated 24 hours before the Minister sought to have the Bill taken in the Dáil is, at the very least, unsatisfactory.  I do not address my remarks particularly to the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, but rather to his senior Minister, Deputy O'Malley, who is head of a party who profess reform of the Oireachtas as one of their priorities.</P>

      <P>Perhaps individuals got them but certainly they were not circulated with the Bill at the time.  This is very bad coming from the Leader of a party who profess Dáil reform to be a high priority in their Programme for Government.  Between Deputy Leyden's party and Deputy O'Malley's party they promised reform of the Dáil before the end of 1989.  In the revised Programme for Government we see now that the partners in Government present proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in 1991 for implementation during 1992.  I hope the promise in the latest Programme for Government will have a better chance of being kept than the promise in the 1989 programme.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Bill on a number of counts.  We can all subscribe to the objectives set out in the explanatory memorandum which state:</P>
      <P>(iii)  to establish procedures in respect of examination of patent applications which are more expeditious than those in operation under the present law;</P>
      <P>(iv)  to provide for the protection of smaller type inventions by introducing provisions for the grant of short term patents;</P>
      <P>(v)  to establish that the Comptroller is the sole authority in relation to all matters concerning the grant of patents.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>Those objectives are vital for the modernisation of the Irish patent system.  This modernisation and reform is long overdue. Indeed, it is regrettable that the Bill is being introduced against a background of unresolved problems of staffing and expertise that exist at present in the Patents Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of defects in the Bill and I am sure the House will agree with me that they must be rectified.  This <Col N="215" /> can be achieved by the Minister accepting amendments for this Bill as presented.  It is a very suitable Bill for referral to a committee of this House rather than being dealt with by the House in full. This is the third Bill with which I have been associated &mdash; there is another Bill also &mdash; that would be extremely suitable for debate in a much smaller committee of the House if we are to modernise Parliament. I understand the Government's difficulties with that because of voting procedures which would confine their members almost on a full-time basis to a committee meeting.  I am sure that between the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Whips we could arrive at some formula which would allow a Bill to be debated among a smaller number of more interested Deputies than in the full House committee.</P>
    <P>The Competition Bill, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill as well as this Bill would be suitable for debate in committee.  If the Minister cares to take up that suggestion, on behalf of my party I would try to ensure there was some sort of voting system that would not have the effect of embarrassing the Government at any particular time, but of course, I cannot speak for other parties.  In these technical Bills where we all have to get advice from people who are more qualified than we are on Bills it is much better if we sit around a table, discuss matters and perhaps improve the Bill rather than making it a political football.  I would be very keen that that should happen. Having waited two years for the Competition Bill to be produced it was then guillotined through this House with totally inadequate discussion on Committee Stage and was rushed through in a very short period.  I hope that will not happen on this occasion.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very serious considerations which the Minister must take on board.  The main objective of the Bill is to simplify the procedures involved in full patent approval and to extend the term of the patent from the present 16 years to 20 years.  This will bring us into line with European practice.  While the <Col N="216" /> latter extension may enhance this country's prospect of attracting health care companies to set up here, it will also have an impact on indigenous production of generic drugs.  As this is a hobby horse of mine, can somebody please interpret for me what the word &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; means as regards industry, because I cannot fix in my mind a picture of an indigenous Irish company in the European context.  In that regard I always give the example of P.J. Carroll, which is to most of us an indigenous Irish company but, as far as I know, is owned 100 per cent by interests outside this country.  Is that a company we want to promote or it is a multinational company which is owned by Rothmans in America?  I say that in the hope that somebody will come to my rescue at some time.</P>
    <P>The extension of the patents will be a help towards attracting foreign companies in the chemical sector to this country. The Minister must do that but he should also avoid damage to home-based industries who provide sustainable jobs and opportunities for economic expansion.</P>
    <P>The Patents Office have experienced a rapid increase in the volume of inventions submitted for examination over the last number of years, but at the same time there has been a decrease in the number of technical staff.  The number of new patent applications last year was more than 4,000 while staff numbers dwindled to 11.  In the 63rd annual report of the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks the stark reality of this understaffing is underlined.  The report contains the fact that the backlog of applications up to the year ended 31 December last has grown to almost 20,000.  In the report the director says that in various previous reports he referred to his submission some years ago containing proposals as to the organisational structure of the office, that no action has been taken in the year under review in relation to those proposals and that staff numbers in the office had fallen progressively since the commencement of the public service staffing embargo, from 96 to 77.  That relates to the period between 1971 and <Col N="217" /> now, so the number of staff is fewer now than it was in 1971.  In the meantime work has increased considerably in terms of volume and complexity.  One does not have to have technical knowledge to understand that the volume and complexity of the work would have increased and that there would be more legal implications in relation to decisions made.</P>
    <P>In relation to applications, appendix 1 of the report shows growth since 1970. It is inevitable that while this situation prevails the backlog will remain and revenue will be foregone.  Table J, to which the director refers, shows that the number of patents has increased by about 1,700 to 5,000 and that the number of trademarks has increased from slightly over 2,000 to almost 8,000 in the last 20 year period.  At the same time, even though many of these have become much more difficult to assess, the number of staff supposed to make these decisions has decreased.</P>
    <P>Recent newspaper reports suggested that the office has lost expertise as well as staff and that the Irish Patents Office will find itself with a gap in a range of scientific specialities.  There is no point in passing a Patents Bill and pretending we are doing a good day's work if we do not provide the necessary staff to do the job properly.  The backlog in patents not processed also means a loss of revenue which has been reckoned by some people to be somewhere in the region of £3 million and by others to be over £8 million.  If those figures are correct the embargo on staff recruitment seems to have been a very shortsighted policy.  This situation must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Even though the Bill claims to do so, I do not believe it will alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>The trend within the European Community has been towards the simplification and the standardisation of procedures with regard to the granting of patents, and towards harmonising the so-called intellectual property laws in order to make the registration of trademarks more user friendly.  That is an objective with which we agree.  The Bill does not satisfy this objective.  The view of some experts in this area is that the Bill runs <Col N="218" /> contrary to this objective.  The Association of Patent and Trademarks Agents in the first paragraph of their submission say that unfortunately the Patents Bill runs contrary to the international trend and that, rather than simplifying procedures, it has made it more difficult for applicants to obtain a patent than was the case under the 1964 Patents Act.  For example, they had counted at least 11 ways in which a patent application could avoid itself without any way of retrieving the situation.  They say that if the Bill is enacted without amendment in this regard it will be most unfair and unjust to applicants and will lead to considerable difficulties in the future.  I presume that every Deputy has got the submission from the Association of Patent and Trademarks Agents.  No doubt the Minister and his advisers will have an answer to that charge.</P>
    <P>The processing of questioning and answering and of our putting points to the Minister which have been made to us by qualified people, would be better pursued if we could do it in a less formal setting than in this House.  I hope the Minister will consider that suggestion at the conclusion of Second Stage.  If what that submission says is the case, the Bill must be amended to take account of the difficulties that will be posed by the fact that patent applications can become void without any mechanism for retrieving that situation.  One of the objectives of the Bill is to enable effect to be given to the European Patent Convention. However, the Bill as published contains no provision equivalent to articles 121 and 122 of that Convention.  The Minister at the end of his speech said:</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to mention another patent convention, namely the Community Patent Convention.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether or not that is the one signed by Ireland and other Community member states in 1975.  I understood that this Bill was to do with that Convention.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister used a similar <i>modus</i><Col N="219" /><i>operandi</i> with regard to the Competition Bill, with the result that the Bill went through this House in an unsatisfactory manner.  If any member of the Government is basing legislation on existing European legislation, the protocol in the European law should be imported directly into law here.  This Bill as published demonstrates a tendency to include in the statute procedural matters which had previously been dealt with in the rules.  It would be more sensible if the Bill were used to outline the principles and general policy of patent legislation and matters of procedure and administration were dealt with in rules.</P>
    <P>One of the welcome innovations in the Bill is the introduction of short-term patents. Such a provision must be carefully framed and drafted.  The Bill as currently drafted is questionable in his area.  The only requirement to establish the validity of a short-term patent is the mere novelty of the invention.  This is a point that was put to me by three of the people to whom I spoke about it.  There is no requirement for ingenuity or originality for short-term patents to be accepted.  This provision is of concern to those involved in patents and in trademarks.  Will this mean that a patent will be granted for a trivial alteration to a product which may in its own way be novel but does not represent ingenuity and inventiveness?  The existence of such patents will become a nuisance to industry and could bring the whole patents system into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the extension of patents from 16 to 20 years will affect the generic pharmaceutical industry.  I hope the Minister is taking this into consideration. While we must attract foreign chemical industries, and in fairness we have to extend the patent for them from the existing 16 to 20 years, the generic industry which is allowed manufacture drugs after the expiry of the patent is also a valuable industry here.  It will certainly be more important in the much more competitive market we will have to face from 1 January 1993.  The generic pharmaceutical industry has been expanding very rapidly in this country over the last <Col N="220" /> number of years.  Turnover trebled in one case and employment has increased and is now 100 per cent.  New export markets have been opened up and one group that I know of have initiated a capital investment programme of very considerable proportions.  Because of what we are doing here today their ability to recoup that investment would be extended by four years from 16 years to 20 years.  That is of serious concern to them even though they understood it was coming.</P>
    <P>This industry is dependent primarily on the expiring of patents before they can start manufacturing their generic drugs. Growth in this area is achieved either through the development of the generic equipment to the branded product or, in their post-patent period, the development of an improved version of the original products.  Last week's edition of <i>The Economist</i> dated 26 October to 1 November has a very interesting article on medicines.  It makes the very interesting point that the life of some of these medicines is very much shorter and investment is very much dearer.  The life is shorter because drugs, which normally would not be imitated for seven to eight years, no longer have this privilege.</P>
    <P>Huge sums are involved and ironically so many of the bills for medicines are picked up by the taxpayer and not the individuals, so companies are continually chasing one another to invent new and better drugs.  It is now thought that the life of a drug may be only two to three years before it is replaced by something better or as good.  This process will continue. The people who manufacture generic drugs would have had a valley period between the eight year expiry of the patent and the 16 years before they could start manufacturing the generic drug.  If this article is correct, all they will have is the valley period between two to three years and 20 years which makes the profitability of their industry more open to question in the future than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>The reality is that we have to get into line with the European procedures.  We <Col N="221" /> are committed to the fundamental objectives of the Treaty of Rome and the elimination of obstacles to the free movement of goods.  That certainly was perceived as and was an obstacle to the free movement of goods.  The achievement of the international market is central to the future of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Government should be a little more vigilant as to the effects of all this. Has the Minister had discussions with both sides of the trade in this, the people who will benefit by the extension of the patent period on the one hand, the normal drug manufacturers and, on the other hand, the manufacturers of the generic drugs who will be affected by this extension?  Will the Minister be able to satisfy the latter that there will be some means to ensure that they will not be severely disadvantaged in this?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has done a thorough analysis of the impact of the legislation on the generic pharmaceutical industry which, though not as important as the branded one, is still a very important part of the industry.  Does the Minister realise that, if the proposed supplementary protection certificate becomes law, a further five years could be added to the life of a patent expiring after 1992?  Under the present proposals only patents lodged after 1 January 1976 would be eligible for the SPC.  I realise that I may be talking about the Community Patent Convention of 1975, but I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    <P>If there is no transition period in the proposed Irish legislation making all patents expiring after the date of ratification of the European Patent Convention eligible for a 20 year term, then such products may also be eligible for an SPC.  The effect of that would be to extend it for a further five years.  As I said, however, I may be mistaken in this because I may be referring to something that is covered by the Community Patent Convention rather than affected by this Bill which we are debating here today.</P>
    <P>It has been a concern of mine for some <Col N="222" /> time now that we have not been preparing the Irish economy and Irish business for what is to happen on 1 January 1993, that is, the end of this magic year 1992.  Irish business will then be operating in a very much more competitive and complex environment than it is at the moment.  In the case of the legislation before the House I am not sure if the Government have done a thorough examination and analysis of the impact it will have on Irish business.  The point I am making here was made, I am pleased to note, by the chairman of CIE last week when presenting the annual accounts for that company.  He said that many Irish businesses are due for a very rude awakening on 1 January 1993.  We are constantly being told that there will be a market of 350 million people available to us after that date without any barriers and that we can flood it with our goods and make fortunes.  However, the reverse is also true.  There are industries out there serving that 350 million people who will be flooding their goods into the Irish market as well.  Besides the necessity to make our products more competitive and attractive in a highly competitive market, to gain a foothold in Europe we must also make sure that what we are selling on the home market is capable of resisting the challenge of attractive, competitively produced goods from the other 11 countries.</P>
    <P>There has been no indication from what has been said in this House that the Government have done the necessary analysis of the kind of competition we will be open to in meeting the challenge and taking up the opportunities that will be available to us in the future.  The Government are beginning to realise that there is a crisis with regard to unemployment. The figures last Friday night were extremely disappointing in that regard.  We would have been expecting, coming up to the Christmas period, that there would be a drop in unemployment for seasonal reasons but there was not; there was a rise.  All new legislation coming before this House should be assessed to see what effect it will have on employment.  Will it help to increase <Col N="223" /> employment, to hold employment, or might it have the effect of increasing the level of unemployment?</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude to the present negotiation of a future Europe are also causing great concern at least to me.  I know that the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats review of the Programme for Government does say that a White Paper will be published before the referendum &mdash; not before decisions are taken at Maastricht next month, not before the conclusion of the intergovernmental conferences on political and financial union but before the referendum, when it will be a <i>fait accomplit.</i> After the decisions have been reached we will then be given a White Paper saying what it means to us.  We will have no chance to have an input into what the Government are saying.  This point has been made here continuously by all Members of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>We do not know what the Government are doing.  We do not know who is in charge of the negotiations, whether it is the Taoiseach at the Summit, the Minister for Finance on the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We do not know who is responsible for taking up positions on behalf of the Irish people at the intergovernmental conferences, and we do not know what proposals they are putting forward.  We know when the Taoiseach comes back from a Summit that he says he did not agree to that and he put certain views forward and that this or that was accepted.  That is all we know.  We do not know what he is going out to achieve on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had ample opportunity to study the impact of this legislation from a number of angles.  Last year at the party's Árd Fheis, Deputy O'Malley is reported as saying that the Bill will be finalised in six to eight weeks.  That was a year and a half ago and there are still a number of questions that have to be resolved.  The Bill has been published but a number of questions still remain unresolved and are unclear.  I understand from what the Minister of State said today that another Bill will be brought <Col N="224" /> forward.  It was reported in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said at a conference that a referendum to change the Constitution may be needed to allow Ireland to adopt European law on patents.  However I gather from what the Minister of State said today that in regard to this Bill a referendum is unnecessary but that if we pass another Bill to ratify another convention in the future a referendum may be necessary. If this is so, why was a combined Bill not brought in to allow us ratify both conventions at the one time?  It seems to be taking an unnecessary two bites at the one cherry given that we could have ratified both conventions in the one Bill today.  Will the Minister of State take that point up when he comes to reply?</P>
    <P>Some people are of the view that a referendum is unnecessary and argue that the European Communities Act, 1972 and Article 29.4.3º of Bunreacht na hÉireann cover this matter.  Is the European patent legislation going outside the scope of the Treaties?  I have been advised that the agreement relating to European Community patents reached at Luxembourg on 15 December 1989 seems to state categorically that the achievement of a common market is dependent on the creation of a Community patents system.  If that is so, it would not appear that a referendum is necessary but, again, I would like to have the advice of the Minister of State on that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should also be acutely aware of the difficulties facing the Patents Office to which I referred earlier. The fact that staff felt the need to resort to legal action to resolve the situation with regard to the backlog of work must mean the Minister of State has had to address the question of staff numbers at the Patents Office.  Yet, here he is introducing legislation without resolving the central question of staffing.  We must get an assurance from the Minister of State that if the Bill is passed the necessary machinery will be given to the Patents Office to do the work which this <Col N="225" /> House, through this legislation, is going to ask them to do.</P>
    <P>This is a further example of the approach and attitude of the Government to policy formation and decision-making. Everything appears to be decided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and there is no clear understanding of the ramifications of major legislation such as the Competition Bill which was passed earlier this year and now this legislation in relation to patents.  It seems to be a very short-sighted policy if the Department of Finance are calling for an embargo on staff numbers, yet in this area with adequate staff they could earn far more, perhaps one hundred times more, than the amount needed to employ them.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, the Government's attention for the past two to three months has been focused on matters much closer to home and their personal interests. They have had ample opportunities during the past two years to address these crucial questions.  This legislation has been left hanging around for a long time and it is regrettable, because of priority of party political considerations, that any notion of the national interest has receded.  That applies to the intergovernmental conferences which have reached a critical stage.  We are now only six weeks away from the European Community summit to be held in Maastricht where further decisions will be taken on the future integration of the European Community, yet the Government are ill-equipped and ill-prepared to participate at that conference.  They have no clear views on European Monetary Union, the reform of European institutions and implications for Irish foreign policy of the development of a common security and foreign policy.</P>
    <P>While the Fianna Fáil Party in particular were tearing one another asunder and the Progressive Democrats were examining their consciences an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 29 October laid out what the Netherlands paper to be put before the summit at Maastricht will contain, which is quite disturbing from an Irish point of view.  It would appear this has passed over the heads of the <Col N="226" /> Government.  It states that to be considered fit for European Monetary Union a country must have a rate of inflation close to that of at least three of the best performing member states in terms of price stability &mdash; I am not sure if we would qualify, we probably would qualify on the inflation rate element.  A country is expected to have a sustainable budget position without any excessive deficit and we would not qualify on that.  According to the article a country, having kept within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism for the past two years must have a durability of its convergence reflected by its long-term interest rates and these criteria were elaborated on in separate protocols issued the night before the article was published on 29 October. It is clear we would not qualify for membership of the European Monetary Union on those terms.</P>
    <P>There is a let-out in that the document went on to say that if any five countries &mdash; that is the significant figure &mdash; chose not to go ahead then, the other seven will go ahead without them.  The British Government have already said they are not going ahead and the other four are clearly Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland.  Under the proposals to be made by the Netherlands next week we are on the way to a two speed Europe which is not in the interests of this country.  I regret to say the Government are not addressing this matter in the way they should be.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendments to the Bill and clarify the matters raised today.  As I said at the outset, this legislation is crucial to the modernisation of the Irish patents system.  The Minister must ensure that the legislation passed is the best possible and works to the best advantage of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed during the summer about trademarks and the lack of controls here for the protection of trade marks.  One manufacturer of jeans felt that their industry was being undermined through the importation of cheap inferior goods which were similar in appearance but were not made of the same material or of the same durability. <Col N="227" /> I would like the Minister of State to state when replying if he has any proposals to appoint a trading standards officer, similar to the one operating in the United Kingdom, who would be able to take up complaints such as the one made during the year by one company.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope the Minister of State will accept my suggestion that after Second Stage the Bill should be dealt with by a special committee where I would hope we could help the Minister of State to make it better legislation and ensure that we understand fully the significance of all the sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the Bill and will support it.  It should not be necessary to waste time in the passage of the Bill through both Houses because all we are doing is regularising the situation in relation to European law.  If there is any criticism of it it must rest with all of us in view of the fact it has taken so long to get the Bill into the House.  I hope it will not take us as long to get it through the House.  Almost 20 years have passed since the various conventions were signed.  Many other Bills to give effect to European law are lying on shelves in various Departments and it is only now in the run up to 1992 &mdash; we are getting near to the finishing line &mdash; that we are being forced to push these Bills through.  We welcome this as there is not much point in us being members of the European Community under the Single European Act when most of our legislation is 20 years behind European law. While supporting the Bill we will endeavour to co-operate with the Minister in getting the Bill through the House as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome section 28 of the Bill which gives the Minister of the day the right to update the regulations which will give effect to international conventions, in other words, when we are a party to international conventions we will not need new legislation.  Legislation can be kept up to date by having the matter dealt with by order.  While I welcome <Col N="228" /> that I hope it will not be abused by this country being a party to conventions which would have a detrimental effect on us.</P>
    <P>The CII have been calling for the implementation of this legislation for quite a number of years.  Because of the delays under the existing structures many inventors were not encouraged to go through the process of registering patents or, alternatively, were going outside the country where I understand the process is much simpler and more secure in other parts of Europe.  I agree with Deputy Barry's comments in relation to this section because there is no point in passing legislation and finding that, because of voluntary redundancies within the Department, we are denuded of the expertise necessary to keep pace with the substantial level of applications.  As has already been stated, this section should be self-financing, indeed Deputy Barry made the point that it should be profit-making. It seems rather strange to let the necessary expertise go into private industry.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the section dealing with the small inventor.  The man or woman who comes up with a novel idea &mdash; the small inventor &mdash; is very often the backbone of small industry and, therefore, Irish industry.  I am glad that this is enshrined in the Bill and encouraged.  I hope it will be accompanied by a simplification in relation to application and registration.  If we are to encourage the small inventor not alone should we make the fees lower in relation to an application but we should also simplify it. Many good inventions are lost because people are not encouraged to register them.  Indeed they may not be able to afford the cost or time to have the regulations applied properly.  When the Minister is making regulations under various sections he should simplify and publicise them, as Government notices are very often complicated to the ordinary person. Inventors are not always aware of the fact that their inventions can be stolen, not just within their own country but outside it, which would mean robbing <Col N="229" /> Irish industry of good ideas or development; this applies particularly to small industry.</P>
    <P>The question of a referendum is confusing because I would have thought it should be possible to have a referendum which would change the Constitution in such a way as to allow the Oireachtas to put legislation through, thereby updating our law and bringing it into line with that of the EC.  This is the second time that the question of a referendum in relation to European law has come before this House in the last year.  If it means that we have to update Irish law to bring it into line with European law and that we have to have a referendum to give effect to each one, we would need one every six months.  A much more simple form of dealing with this type of development, particularly where it is a basic administrative one which will not have serious effects on the everyday lives of our citizens, is simply to update our law to help the men and women who are prepared to use their inventive brains to help the development of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party welcome the Bill and we will co-operate fully in having a speedy and effective passage of this necessary and important legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that this legislation is long overdue.  Now that it has finally come before the House we should facilitate its expeditious enactment as best we can.  However, I agree with Deputy Barry that it is the kind of Bill which is ideally suited to treatment in committee inasmuch as it is a very complex area which demands a degree of specialist knowledge and expertise which most Members in the House clearly do not have.  In the event of the decision being made for the Bill not to take up the time of this House formally in the Chamber &mdash; except to the minimum extent possible &mdash; perhaps we could have a far more useful discussion in a committee, calling on the necessary advisory resources, than will be the case now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area is very complex.  Deputy Barry raised the question &mdash; I have been <Col N="230" /> thinking about it since &mdash; of what &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; means.  That is a major question, not merely in the context of the legislation before us but in the context of our future direction in terms of industrial policy.  There still seems to be a worthwhile and indeed essential distinction which can be made between offshoots of foreign-owned companies locating here and us developing our indigenous industrial base.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barry said, in the world of free market, single market, free movement of capital and so on it is becoming more difficult to define &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; in the Irish context.  It is true that the few successful indigenous companies have decided to diversify and buy into countries from Britain to the United States to South America, but does that make them any less indigenous?  I do not think it does.  If it makes good sense from the point of view of corporate strategy that that is what they should do, so be it. However, one of the greatest weaknesses and defects in our extraordinary rate of dependency on foreign companies' subsidiaries based here is that at the end of the day too many of them have not put down roots here and too many of them of course export the profits made here.</P>
    <P>We have found no mechanism &mdash; I am not sure there is the political will in any event to look for it &mdash; to retain even a proportion of the profits for reinvestment for job creation here.  The black hole that was discovered a number of years ago has grown bigger and bigger, and more and more &mdash; over £2 billion &mdash; is repatriated to the country of origin.  That cannot be good.  It is no wonder, in an economy dependent to the extent that we are on such companies, that there are over 250,000 people unemployed and 100,000 people have emigrated in recent years.  I welcome the existence of these companies here and I very much welcome and understand the importance of the 80,000 jobs they create here but in terms of any kind of national industrial strategy, if we had one, we have no control over them at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>To answer Deputy Barry's question, <Col N="231" />&ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; means that these companies are rooted in Ireland.  It may be best symbolised by the fact that the headquarters of these companies are in Ireland.  I accept that many of them may find it necessary, as I have said, to diversify outside of Ireland, but at the end of the day they are rooted here, their headquarters are here and if they were likely, for example, to develop research and development, which is connected with the legislation we are discussing, those facilities would be located in Ireland, which would be the exception to the norm.  Unfortunately, almost invariably the multi-national companies are locating research and development facilities outside of Ireland and as a result we are paying the price.</P>
    <P>The length of time that has elapsed between the signing of the convention in 1973, when Ireland seemed to make a statement that was pro-investment, projobs and so on, and the bringing forward of this legislation is indefensible.  It would appear that we have been sending out the wrong signals to industry up to now.  We have refused to say to industry that if they create intellectual property rights in this country we will treat them the same as they would be treated elsewhere in Europe.  That as a general point of principle is wrong.  It is unfortunate that that is the way the matter has developed and that it has taken us so long to say that we will give them the same advantages as they would have anywhere else in Europe.  We certainly give them better advantages in terms of taxpayers' money, grants, back-up, tax shelter and so on. Therefore, I cannot see why we should not be clearly on the record as saying to these companies that if they create intellectual property rights in Ireland we will treat them the same as they would be treated anywhere else in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is of course an argument that I will refer to in a couple of minutes in more detail as between the perceived needs of the multi-national sector and those of the indigenous industry.  For example, it is probably best exemplified in the area of the drugs industry.  It is <Col N="232" /> very difficult, without the kind of teasing out that Deputy Barry argued for, to speak with authority on this question because the multi-national companies will make a very strong argument first of all based on employment, that they are providing a great deal more employment here than is the generic drugs industry, taking the drugs industry as an example. They will point to the number of jobs they create here as compared to the very limited number of jobs in the area of indigenous industry.  They will also argue that they reinvest vast amounts of money in developing a new product and that they have to be given a reasonable period of time to regain the cost of investment in that area.</P>
    <P>The generic drugs industry on the other hand will argue that they can supply drugs to our health services, for example, at a cost of 30 to 40 per cent lower than the cost of branded products.  I would have thought that is a major issue at a time when once again we are facing cuts in public spending, when the health service is already in some difficulty, to put it mildly, and we are now talking about having to effect further cuts in the area of the health services.  I would have thought that the provision of generic drugs, which would save an estimated £50 million for the health service, is a major issue and one that deserves consideration.  The multi-nationals would argue that a prerequisite to any generic industry in Ireland would be a strong primary-based research industry.  As I have said, in the absence of the kind of facility that Deputy Barry spoke about to tease out these questions, it is very difficult indeed to form a view on the matter.</P>
    <P>I would say in passing that I had intended to deal with the aspect to which Deputy Barry devoted some time, that is the capacity of the Patents Office to cope with the changes we are enacting in his legislation.  My understanding is, as Deputy Barry said, that the Patents Office has been seriously neglected and run down in recent years and, therefore, its ability to cope with the impact of this legislation is questionable.  That is very regrettable and inexcusable in an era of <Col N="233" /> computerised technology.  We had the same kind of argument during the passing through this House of the Companies Bill, that the Companies Office has been disgracefully out of date for a number of years, as we are now discovering in some very high profile cases.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has assured the House that changes and improvements have been made there but I am assured by researchers whose job it is to have virtually daily contact with the Companies Office that it is still far behind the times.  However, I will not dwell any longer on a point that Deputy Barry has dealt with at some length.</P>
    <P>The whole patents area is an extremely complex and specialised one.  It is certainly not an area about which the lay person generally knows very much and it is a subject on which he we have had difficulty in getting much informed advice.  Indeed the Government would seem to be in the same position having regard to the time it has taken to bring forward this legislation.  The Bill has been promised for several years.  It was eventually published in July of this year it took a further four months for the Government to come up with the Explanatory Memorandum.  That was produced only last week, just two days before the original date listed for the start of the debate on the Bill.  In many respects the Explanatory Memorandum is not much more informative or helpful than the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>On the surface, the objective of the Bill appears to be reasonably straightforward, the ratification of the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty which was signed by Ireland and 14 other countries in 1973. All our fellow members of the EC with the exception of Portugal have ratified the Convention by legislation, and it seems reasonable that we should also do so.  The Convention enables a single patent application to be made to the European Patents Office in Munich rather than having to make individual patent applications in all the individual countries.  This would clearly cut down on costs and on delays.  The impression <Col N="234" /> has been given in the debate so far that the European Patents Office is a creature of the European Community but as I understand it that is not the case and the European Patents Office has the allegiance of a number of countries that are not members of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there are very serious moral and ethical issues raised by the whole concept of patents.  There has been very strong lobbying for this legislation from the powerful multinational drug industry.  This Bill has serious implications for any move to promote the wider use of generic drugs, which most people acknowledge would be an effective way of reducing our massive drugs bill.  There are also implications for the developing countries in the Third World. A patent is a uniquely powerful and valuable resource.  In some promotional material issued on behalf of the drugs industry, a solicitor defines it as follows:</P>
    <P>A patent gives a statutory monopoly within the country to the person to whom the patent is granted.  It prevents anyone else imitating, producing, marketing, vending or indeed having anything to do with a product which imitates that in such a way as to duplicate the processes or the characteristics which are within the original invention. In short, a patent is a protection of inventions.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong in principle with allowing an inventor to protect his or her invention and to benefit financially from it.  There is nothing wrong in principle with allowing a company which has spent considerable sums in researching and developing a product from protecting it and benefiting from it.  It is a particularly straightforward issue if the invention is a new toy, a new tin can, a longer lasting light bulb or some such product.  Indeed any changes in industrial legislation that would encourage the location in Ireland of research and development facilities by some of the subsidiaries of the multi-national companies, is to be welcomed. However, the moral issue raises its head <Col N="235" /> when the invention is a new drug or medicine, for example a new drug which could reduce suffering or even save life.  Is it moral or just that someone who invents a new drug &mdash; and the inventor in this case will not normally be an individual scientist beavering away in a back-room laboratory but a huge multinational company &mdash; should have the sole right to exploit the invention for commercial and financial purposes alone, and to restrict and control the production of that drug and to determine the price at which it will be sold?  Let us suppose that a company discover a new drug that cures AIDS.  Is it right that the company should say they will sell this drug only to those who can afford to pay for it?  Is it right that a company can say to a Government that they know that the drug can be produced at a lower cost than that being charged by the company but they will not allow this to happen because it is in their commercial and financial interests to protect their patent?  These are fundamental moral and ethical questions that the Minister has not even touched on in his opening speech.  I would like to hear his views on those questions.</P>
    <P>There are particular moral and ethical questions relating to patent rights and developing Third World countries.  Is it right that hugely successful multi-national companies in the developed world can restrict access to techniques or products which could combat hunger, disease and economic want in the Third World?  Members could dwell on this major ethical question for some time.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, the principal group lobbying in Ireland for the introduction of this Bill is the multinational drugs industry.  They have claimed that the failure of this country to extend the operating length of a patent from 16 to 20 years, as is provided for in the Bill, has had serious implications for their investment in Ireland and has jeopardised the jobs of almost 12,000 people employed in the wider pharmaceutical industry in Ireland.  It is hard to see how an extention of just four years to a patent could have such a dramatic impact on the <Col N="236" /> industry, although I presume the promoters of this point of view know what they are talking about.  I am advised that it could take up to ten years to get a patent and therefore the period to regain investment is approximately only six years.</P>
    <P>The drugs industry is, of course, immensely profitable.  The cost of drugs constitutes more than half of the total cost of running the general medical service in this country.  More than £100 million per year is spent on drugs.  One of the principal hopes of reducing this massive drugs bill has been in the greater use of generic drugs.  A generic drug is a non-branded drug normally produced when the patent on the branded drug expires. The generic product is exactly the same in every respect as the branded product and has the same chemical constituents and medicinal impact.  Normally it can be produced much cheaper than the branded product, partly because the multi-national drug companies spend huge amounts of money in promoting and advertising the branded product.  One has only to look at any medical publication to get an indication of this.  Any doctor will tell you that they are deluged with promotional material from the drugs industry, and in my experience some doctors prove more susceptible to it than others.</P>
    <P>In addition many experts believe that there are far more branded products on sale than are actually needed.  There are more than 15,000 branded drugs on sale in this country; however, a huge number is simply the same basic drug under a different brand name, packed in a different carton.  Some years ago the World Health Organisation estimated that virtually every medical eventuality could be covered by about 1,000 generic drugs. One Irish manufacturer of generic drugs has claimed that his company could supply 40 per cent of the drugs on sale on the Irish market at below 30 per cent of the price.  The passage of this Bill will certainly help the multinational drug companies protect their exclusive rights to produce certain products over a longer period of time and will make it more <Col N="237" /> difficult for Irish producers to manufacture and to provide cheaper generic drugs for the GMS.  Is this really in our interest?  I do not have a closed mind on this subject because I do not think the answer is simply black or white. However, I would like the Minister to refer to this point.  On the question of substituting generics for the branded product, the multinational companies would argue that it would stop the clock of scientific research if that were the case. As against that, critics of the multi-national drug companies argue that they do not spend all that much on research and development and that, in the case of genuinely new products, which the critics say are rare, the companies should be allowed to charge high prices to recoup their investment and make a decent profit for the period in which the product is under patent.  Another argument against the adoption of a cheaper drugs policy by the Irish Government is that many of the big drug manufacturers are located in Ireland and they may be less inclined to invest here if the Government pursue a policy of not allowing them to charge high prices for their products.  However, the vast majority of these companies do not manufacture the finished products which are sold in Ireland, they manufacture part of the drug which is then exported and manufactured in complete packaged form elsewhere.  I think that a cheap drugs policy by the Department of Health would have little impact on the level of sales and profitability of these companies and it is probably somewhat heavyhanded of the industry that, because they are located here where they can make huge profits anyway, they can force the Department of Health and the consumer to pay through the nose for branded products.</P>
    <P>There must also be concern about where the whole patent process is going, and particularly about the possibility of its extension into areas not previously covered by patents.  The European Commission has produced a draft directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions.  When the European Convention which this Bill seeks to ratify <Col N="238" /> was being drawn up it excluded plants, animals and biological processes from patenting.  The EC Draft Directive brings it into a completely new area and raises the spectre of patents being sought for plant varieties, species of animals and even life itself.  If memory serves me, a recent BBC &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; programme showed a struggle for control of the patenting of the life gene itself.  This raises far-reaching questions which so far this debate has not sought to deal with.  For example, in today's <i>Irish Times</i> an article written by Tom Wilkie states:</P>
    <P>The European Patent Office has granted the first European patent on a living animal, throwing into confusion efforts to harmonise European laws on patenting biotechnology.</P>
    <P>The Munich-based EPO has decided to grant Harvard University a patent covering a laboratory mouse genetically engineered to be susceptible to cancerous tumours.</P>
    <P>My illustration shows that already the business of patenting has moved considerably beyond the convention that led to the legislation currently before us.  As has already been remarked, this Bill is completely unclear on our position on the Community Patent Convention.  Because the Convention provides for a European court to have higher jurisdiction than our Supreme Court, it is suggested that a referendum is necessary.  I should like to hear the Minister address that particular question in his reply.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Bill seems to be overdue; everybody in the House acknowledges that point.  The Bill seeks to modernise our legislation on intellectual property rights and patents generally. We need to ensure that a back-up is provided in the form of the Patents Office to cope with the Bill's impact.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I should like to ask the Minister a further question about transitional provisions.  After reading the Bill, I am not clear that a question does not still remain in relation to transitional provisions for expired patents which are the subject of petitions for extension of term under section 27 of the Patents Act, <Col N="239" /> 1964.  I understand that question was resolved in current Australian legislation by providing that where recently expired patents are the subject of extension of term proceedings, the patentee has the option of choosing the four year extension for patents for medicines or continuing with his proceedings for a longer term.</P>
    <P>My party will support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government for bringing the Bill before the House.  The Bill has two functions: first, to update our domestic law as set out in the Patents Act, 1964 &mdash; this update applies to a variety of functions, including the examination, granting and ratification of patents; second, to associate our domestic law with laws of other jurisdictions both within and outside the European Community that have already been ratified by the European Patents Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.  The thrust of the Bill is to ensure that patents are handled as efficiently as possible.  In this context I particularly welcome the streamlining role of the European Patents Office as well as the procedures that apply for patents protection in the short-term as well as in the long-term.</P>
      <P>The measures that provide for one central application are also to be welcomed, as are those devised to protect the interests of the small inventor.  Short-term patents of ten years are a firm protection for simple innovations and inventions. Small to medium-sized businesses will find that these are very helpful as they will mean fewer official fees and they will also be quicker to obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will also expedite the present backlog of applications for patents. Under the present system the patent agent sends in an application together with supporting documents.  The matter is then left with the Patents Office until they raise relevant queries.  The streamlining in this Bill is very welcome. Most of the backlog &mdash; which, I understand, is in the region of 20,000 applications &mdash; is due to the delay in the <Col N="240" /> Patents Office raising queries.  Under the proposed legislation the applicant's agent will be in a position to initiate any of these amendments, which will obviously have the impact of reducing the backlog I mentioned.</P>
    <P>In a High Court judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Barron some years ago it was held that under existing law patent examination staff have a certain authority independent of the controller.  The particular case before the court concerned a dispute as to the manner in which the backlog of work in the Patents Office could be reduced.  When the present controller was appointed on 14 September 1983 the number of applications awaiting examination amounted to about 13,000. The controller then devised a more rapid procedure for dealing with applications. He found that certain shortcuts were possible without detriment to the final product.  A circular was issued to examiners telling them how they could streamline the process of dealing with patent applications.  However, on technical grounds, the High Court ruled that the controller could not proceed as planned if the process involved shortcircuiting existing patent application procedures; it added that the examiners and their duties were specifically mentioned in the Patents Act, 1964, and that since this gives them a certain legal independence in the performance of their duties, the controller was not entitled to direct them completely in their work.  In other words, the controller was no longer in effective control.  The new Bill takes account of that judgment and omits reference to examiners altogether.  Henceforth all responsibility and authority in relation to applications will rest firmly with the controller, a clarification I welcome.  I am sure that will ensure also greater consistency, efficiency and effectiveness in reducing the backlog of 20,000 applications for patents.</P>
    <P>The Bill adopts a fresh approach also to the examination of patent applications, the old system having created an unacceptable backlog of applications awaiting examination in the Patents Office.  Every Member of the House will <Col N="241" /> be aware of the urgent need to create new ideas and employment.  This House cannot tolerate circumstances prevailing in which over 20,000 applications for patents remain in the Patents Office.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the motion of confidence in the Government last week I stressed the need for the involvement of communities in the creation of employment. Local initiative needs to be encouraged. While in general terms the Government can create the right climate for such eventuality, at a more technical level we in this House must ensure that as many obstacles as possible are eliminated. The provisions of this Bill in regard to short term patents, their importance for smaller and medium-sized businesses will ensure the removal of one such obstacle I greatly welcome because it is an important factor in the creation of employment.  We all represent constituencies that are perhaps dependent on one large factory to solve our unemployment problems.  Again, when speaking on the motion of confidence in the Government I stressed the need for a positive approach to the creation of jobs on the ground, removing every obstacle in that path.  I greatly welcome the Government decision to introduce a short term patent which was one obstacle to the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>Under the transitional provisions of the Bill any patents granted under law obtaining when the Bill before the House is enacted will carry a term of 20 years. The present patent term is 16 years. During the last two years of the extended term third parties will be afforded an opportunity to engage in certain activities relating to an invention without being guilty of patent infringement.  This will enable companies to undertake research and testing of a patented product before the patent expiry date.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill also recognise the need for generic drugs to be made available in the marketplace quickly.  We are all aware of the problems experienced by our respective health boards and their need for extra cash.  We all tend to talk about the provision of <Col N="242" /> generic drugs as a means of solving some of these problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked why the term of 16 years had to be increased to 20 years. The important point to be made here is that, if we are to conform to the European patent term then we must legislate for a 20-year period.  I welcome the Minister's decision to allow research commence after 18 years into generic products.  The Minister has been particularly astute in including this provision. In my constituency the South Eastern Health Board spend in excess of £5.5 million on drugs.  Therefore, a small percentage reduction in their cost would be a significant saving.  To that extent the provision of generic drugs will be an important factor in reducing the drugs bills of the various health boards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not a subject to excite public imagination.  However, it comprises legislative proposals in an area critical to the performance of many businesses and, through them, the performance of many segments of our economy.  The last time a Bill was enacted in this area was almost 30 years ago.  That Act has served us well in the interim although the speed with which change has taken place in so many areas of industry has highlighted deficiencies therein.</P>
      <P>The Bill affords us an opportunity to re-examine important legislation, to retain provisions that have proved to be good in the old Act while, at the same time, allowing us revamp and develop those provisions of that Act which we perceive to have been the cause of procedural and administrative problems not in the best interests of an applicant or the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In offering comment and opinion on the provisions of the Bill I am critical of individual segments while appreciating their overall tenor.  For example, the Bill contains some serious anomalies and unfair impositions on applicants.  It is my hope that our discussions here will serve to iron out the remaining difficulties.  The existing Patents Act dates back to 1964 <Col N="243" /> which, in terms of the lifetime of an Act requiring change, render it relatively recent.  Nonetheless, the rapidity with which technological change has taken place within the past three decades &mdash; a change with which Ireland has kept pace and, in many instances, been the leader &mdash; has brought associated problems in the area of patents and patents ownership.  In turn, this has lead to major difficulties caused by the sheer volume of applications and the difficulties of dealing with them under the law as it has obtained to date.  In such circumstances the system may well have been susceptible to problems not of its making.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that the earlier Act was in need of being overhauled and revised or updated, not merely to clear the backlog in the processing of applications but to advance further the harmonisation of patent legislation in line with that of our EC partners and other states outside the EC amenable to the widespread ratification of the Patent Co-operation Treaty and the European Patent Convention. We contend that the simplification of procedures and the removal of restrictions is the correct way to advance this international harmonisation.  The granting of a patent should be oriented towards facilitating applicants since the State ultimately benefits from the granting of such patents and their attendant rights by way of the productivity of participants.  Therefore, it follows that the energies of the State should be directed to rendering it a relatively simple procedure for an applicant while maintaining the balance of correct procedures and legal safeguards.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, while we welcome the fact that the Minister, through this Bill, is taking a fresh look at the whole area of patents this can be welcomed only if it brings notable and measurable improvement of existing legislation, providing a more streamlined procedure from the point of view of applicants and the controller. We contend that is not the case and hope to explain that contention.</P>
    <P>For example, the Bill provides for a number of circumstances in which there is no fail-safe device under which a patent <Col N="244" /> application could be rendered void without providing any corresponding recourse to rectifying that position.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to give expression to our desire to ratify the European Convention Treaty, Ireland and Portugal being the only two member states not to have done so already.  Yet, the Bill does not include any provisions equivalent to Articles 121 and 122 of the European Patent Convention, widely held to be desirable and necessary.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill relating to the granting of short term patents is an innovation which will be welcomed by individuals and smaller businesses whose commercial existence is dependent on their ability to modify and change quickly and able to do so without the financial impositions or time constraints normally attending a full term patent application. But there is an element of the &ldquo;bending over backwards&rdquo; syndrome here.  For example, section 63 (4) states:</P>
    <P>An invention shall be patentable under this Part if it is new and useful and susceptible of industrial application notwithstanding that it may not involve an inventive step.</P>
    <P>That is an open invitation to trouble. Goodness knows what kinds of difficulties this provision could give rise to through expedience on the part of an applicant and lack of firm guidelines on the part of the controller.  For example, in whose view will it be &ldquo;new&rdquo;?  How does one define &ldquo;useful&rdquo; in the context of an untried convention?  Whose definition will be accepted?  Will it be that of the application or the controller?  Such an approach may well ease the passage of a patent application through the system but I have no doubt it will add greatly to the volume of applications, in addition to introducing a level of frivolity which should never be intended or acceptable under any legislation.</P>
    <P>On a further broad, general note it is a matter for concern and clarification that rules arising under the provisions of the Bill &mdash; which under existing legislation would be the subject of a statutory instrument to be introduced by the Minister &mdash;<Col N="245" /> henceforth may be the preserve of the controller.  Since the overall granting of patents is very much one for ministerial and departmental supervision it is vital that there be no diminution or dilution of ministerial power and responsibility in this area.  The provisions of the Bill purport to give the controller independence of action and authority not previously vested in that office.  There is need for an explanation why the Minister now sees fit to adopt this course.</P>
    <P>That is a broad perception of the Bill and what it seeks to do.  I will now deal with some of the specifics in the sequence in which they occur in the Bill.  I have already mentioned the apparent dilution of ministerial responsibility proposed and I would ask for further clarification of section 6 (3) which appears to give the controller an independence not envisaged in the 1964 Act and to pre-empt the ministerial guidance and direction bestowed by that Act, and which would be vital to the implementation of such a critical function.</P>
    <P>The wording of section 9 (5) relating to the Minister's power to change provisions regarding the patentability of inventions in the contex of the European Patent Convention needs to be examined from the point of view of Irish law as it relates to the EPC.  Section 19 (2) is another provision which is new to this area and in my view it should allow for statutory power to make decisions on questions of fact or in providing for a solution since this is an area where there may not be an agreed arbitration procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 25 (1), in tandem with section 18 (3) and section 23 (2), relates to the payment of a filing fee, something which should not be part of the Act but should be covered by the rules, as should all matters relating to administration and procedure.  The inclusion of reference to a filing fee is a departure from the provisions of the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>Regarding sections 29 to 35, it appears that the spirit and perhaps even the principle of the EPC is being infringed, as is our own current legislation, by the absence of a mechanism whereby an interested third party is allowed the <Col N="246" /> opportunity of presenting information to the controller in order to prevent the grant of an invalid patent.  This is a right which should be an intrinsic part of such proposed legislation and unless incorporated into the Bill it would merely add to the burden of the existing procedure rather than ease the position.</P>
    <P>Section 31 (5) contains a provision which is at odds with a later provision in the Bill.  This section states that the controller may refuse to grant a patent in pursuance of more than one application in cases where there are two or more applications for the same invention, all with the same date of filing or the same date of priority but all filled by the same applicant or his successor.  According to section 60 (2) where an applicant has had a patent granted under this part for an invention for which a European patent designating the state has also been granted, then the Bill states that the controller shall give the proprietor an opportunity of making observations and of amending the specification.  Failure to do so would result in the revocation of the patent but not before the applicant has had a chance to carry out amendments.  This is completely at odds with the principle proposed in section 31.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of the Bill is to facilitate the applicant in processing his request with a minimum of stumbling blocks.  With this in mind, I would see section 32 (3) as being in direct contravention of the spirit of the Bill. Amendments are generally found to be necessary because of an oversight or lack of knowledge on the part of the applicant. An amendment should not be refused because of procedural difficulties but should be referred back to the applicant for reappraisal as suggested by section 42 (4).  I would submit, therefore, that section 32 (3) should be deleted.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Bill does not contain any provisions equivalent to Articles 121 and 122 of the EPC.  These are the provisions in the convention which allow for further processing of applications or the reinstatement of applications which have unintentionally lapsed.  This is a most <Col N="247" /> important consideration and should form an integral part of this Bill.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider his views on this and to appreciate the difficulties to which lack of these provisions would give rise.  Section 31 (1) (2) (3) cover the restoration of lapsed patents in the very spirit in which section 35 should have been written.  The same spirit of facilitating the applicant should be evident in both these provisions and I would recommend that the Minister reconsider these two sections with a view to incorporating my suggestion.</P>
    <P>Section 63 in Part III deals with applications for short term patents.  It is conceivably the part of the Bill which if enacted could lead to the greatest number of problems since it is new and therefore untried.  It also introduces a new set of ground rules on which an application must be based.  Section 9 states that &ldquo;an invention should be patentable under this Part if it is susceptible of industrial application, is new and involved an inventive step&rdquo;.  These three tenets are most important.  They are the requirements for patentability laid down in section 9 but in section 63 we are told that patentability as it relates to an application for a short term patent requires that it be both &ldquo;new and useful and susceptible of industrial application, notwithstanding that it may not involve an inventive step&rdquo;.  This means that it shares with full-term applications the requirement of being &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;susceptible of industrial application&rdquo; but, unlike the full-term application, it must be &ldquo;useful&rdquo;.  Does this, by implication mean that inventions submitted for full-term patents need not be useful?  So the Bill would have us believe.  The invention submitted with an application for a short term patent need not involve an inventive step.  What then will set it apart in order to render it patentable?  Certainly, the requirement of being &ldquo;new&rdquo; is merely restating an earlier and acceptable provision.</P>
    <P>Similarly with an invention's applicability to industrial use.  But what of its usefulness?  What renders it useful, or <Col N="248" /> indeed, what would render it not useful? Section 9 of the Bill tells us that usefulness is not a requirement for patentability, so why does it appear here?  It is also puzzling why, in order to qualify for a short term patent, an invention need not involve an inventive step.  Surely, by its very nature or by definition, an invention must involve an inventive step over prior state of the art.</P>
    <P>It may well be that this particular section was inspired by a desire to speed up the application process and, if so, that was not in the best interest of the Bill, however, laudable the desire.  &ldquo;Short-term&rdquo; should not be confused with &ldquo;secondhand&rdquo; and products submitted for short term patents should be as susceptible of critical examination as those submitted for full-term patents.  It is imperative that due care be taken to avoid any sense of expedience in the granting of patents and we feel that this is exactly what could happen if this particular section is not reviewed and reconsidered.</P>
    <P>By all means make it easier to submit applications and do as much as possible to ease the flow of the application through the system but in the heel of the hunt, the product and the process by which it was granted a patent must both be capable of standing up to the closest scrutiny, from whatever source it may come.  The Minister and the various bodies with expertise in this area must get together to arrive at an all-round acceptable alternative to section 63 (4) as it is framed.  Similarly, in relation to the application itself, section 63 (7) is at variance with section 19 (1) of the Bill in so far as it requires the specification to show only the invention and the best method of performing it known to the applicant, whereas section 19 (1) requires the application to be sufficiently clear for the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art.  This is applying two different parameters of fitness for use to a situation where a single parameter should apply.  Again, we would urge that the wording here be reviewed and reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Section 65 is also anomalous in so far <Col N="249" /> as it does not allow the same status to short term applications as is allowed to divisional applications under section 24. This would permit short term applications to be divided out of an ordinary application.  For section 65 to decree otherwise is to discriminate against short term applications.  The correction of this anomaly requires only changing the wording of the section to read &ldquo;Sections 29, 30 and 35 shall not apply in respect of an application for a short term patent&rdquo;. The Circuit Court has the right to revoke a short term patent in proceedings relating to an infringement.  This right should be made clear in section 66 (5) which only specifies that the court referred to is the Circuit Court and does not refer to the right to which I referred above.</P>
    <P>I previously discussed the lack of an inventive step in the requirements for a short term patent application.  This should form part of such requirements. Similarly, it appears that if the claims in respect of a short term patent are not supported by a description of the invention this should form grounds for revocation of the patent as there would otherwise exist a possibility of claims being made which are too wide in scope to be sustained.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to my belief in the need for statutory instruments relating to the provisions of the Bill.  It appears the Bill proposes to hand over some of the powers which would normally be vested in the Minister to the controller.  This is a matter of concern.  This feeling is reinforced by section 68 which relates to the granting of voluntary and compulsory licences.  The section does not give statutory direction to the controller, showing how best he should carry out his duties under the section.  This should not be construed as being critical of the office of controller but merely as voicing a concern about the way in which the holder of the office will be asked to make critical decisions in regard to the issuing of licences without ministerial or statutory directions on which to base those decisions.  It is an area which should have a significant bearing on the advantages <Col N="250" /> accruing to the owner of the patent and the State, as well as ensuring a wide base of use for the invention.</P>
    <P>Viable use of an invention to the benefit of all interested parties must be the ultimate aim of a grant of patent system. It appears to me and my party that statutory guidelines must form an integral part of legislation governing this area of activity.  An element of uncertainty is introduced when these statutory guidelines or directions are not provided for in the Bill and gives it a degree of variability which is not in keeping with its subject matter.  Section 60 (3) of the Patent Bill 1981, incorporated a provision to cover such an area.  It might be productive to re-examine the wording of that section with a view to introducing changes in the Bill under discussion.  Any new wording I have suggested should provide: (a) that the controller should ensure the widest possible use of the invention in the State consistent with the owner of the patent deriving a reasonable advantage from the rights devolving on him by grant of the patent; (b) that the controller should ensure the maximum advantage will accrue to the owner consistent with the invention being worked by the licensee at a reasonable profit in the State; (c) that the controller would seek to ensure that there would be an equality of advantage accruing to several licensees and, if necessary to achieve this, reduce the royalties accruing to the owner under any licence previously granted, and (d) that the controller would make it a condition of the granting of a licence so that the licensee would be precluded from importing goods into the State, such goods not being made by the owner or his agents, in cases where the importation of such goods would be an infringement of the patent.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, in view of my earlier remarks concerning the lack of statutory direction for the controller, I now want to deal with a Part of the Bill in which there appears to be a complete lack of input expected from the controller.  This, of course, would give rise to an equally anomalous situation.  I am referring to Part VI and, more specifically, to section <Col N="251" /> 80, which deals with co-ownership of patent applications and patents.  The 1964 Act contains the precedent which gives the controller the power to give directions to co-owners.  It would seem correct to include such a power in this Bill.  That power would (a) permit the Controller to give directions regarding the sale or lease of the patent applications or the patent or any interest therein, the grant of licence under the applicant or the patent, or the exercise of any right under section 80; (b) empower the controller to give directions in a situation where an applicant for, or owner of a patent fails to execute any instrument or to do any other thing required for carrying out any direction under this section within 14 days of being requested to do so, and (c) empower the controller to notify the other person registered as applicant or owner concerned in (a) above and notify the person in default in (b) above.</P>
    <P>In the case of co-ownership, the rights of the trustees or the representatives of a deceased person would be protected from any directions given under this section.  It would be my contention that any person should be entitled to request a search relative to a short term patent, provided the request was made in the prescribed manner and accompanied by the desired fee.  However, section 66 does not appear to allow this, while section 89, which deals with search requests, does not spell out what the search would encompass and whether it would be broadly based enough to satisfy what I perceive to be a basic entitlement.  I suggest that a further sub-section be added to section 66 to cater for this, with the wording clarifying the point that any person would be entitled to request the controller to carry out a search relating to a short term patent.</P>
    <P>Yet, again, there is another anomaly in relation to the controller, this time in section 102 which provides that the controller may apply to the Attorney General for advice in any case where he has a doubt or a difficulty in the administration of any of the provisions of the Act.  The corresponding section of the <Col N="252" /> 1964 Act provides that the controller may apply to the Attorney General for directions. I have no strong opinion on either stipulation but it would be interesting to know why the Minister now sees fit to change the requirement and whether there have been cases to justify this change.  If this provision has worked well since the enactment of the 1964 Act, why change it now?  If it has not worked well, then maybe it needs a more radical change than that proposed by the Bill.  In either case, I would welcome clarification from the Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to patent agents, the Minister will have discretion under the proposals to permit persons who are not registered as patent agents to act on behalf of others for the purpose of obtaining patents, subject to any conditions he may consider appropriate.  There may be an element of restriction in this in so far as it confines the non-registered person to act only for the purpose of obtaining patents and not for the more broadly based section 105.  The wording of this section would serve a more useful purpose if it was based on the provision in section 86 (2) of the 1964 Act, which says that &ldquo;Provided that if in any circumstances he thinks it right so to do the Minister may authorise any person whom he considers suitable to act as a patent agent in a particular case at a particular time&rdquo;.  This provision is less restrictive and gives the applicant a facility to which he may be entitled by right.</P>
    <P>Section 108 (2) proposes to authorise the controller to remove from the register the name of a person who, in his opinion, is no longer eligible.  I would see this as empowering the controller to make an entirely subjective judgment, something which should not form part of any legislative provisions.  A person's eligibility to be included on the register should be based on objective parameters and any procedure to remove a person should be simiarly based on objective requirements, as a result of due inquiry by the controller and not on his opinion.  This could, under certain circumstances, place the controller in an intolerable situation and divert him from the work which this <Col N="253" /> Bill would primarily require him to do. The laying down of objective parameters would also bestow on the affected party the prior knowledge of the possibility of being removed from the register, something which I would regard as a basic right.</P>
    <P>Section 114 (2) is yet another instance where the controller appears to be given power to make arbitrary decisions, which should rightly be the province of statutory instruments introduced by the Minister and being of the opinion that this particular section adds nothing to the Bill I feel it should be excluded.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that transmission of documentation relating to the Bill be restricted to post only.  This is stated in section 115, and it is to ignore the other methods of despatch, including courier, facsimiles, computer disc, and so on.  I see no good reason not to have at least one of those methods cited in addition to the postal service, since they are equally secure.  This provision should be changed as I have suggested.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provisions regarding international conventions, it is my belief that Ireland should have an identity under the Patent Co-operation Treaty and should be designated as such in any application filed under the PCT rather than solely in the context of a European application.  The effect of this on the workload of the Patent Office would be minimal, and we should endorse any efforts at broadening the application of the patent grant system internationally. This must be the ultimate aim of our attempts at harmonisation of our laws with those of our partners abroad.</P>
    <P>There are some points in the transitional provisions on which I would like to comment: The Bill makes no provision for a Patent of Addition, unlike the 1964 Act, which provided for such an appendix and there are many of them which may be in force at the time of the enactment of this Bill.  Under the terms of the Bill this would render them invalid, as it is now proposed that a Patent of Addition under the 1964 Act should be now treated as an application for an independent <Col N="254" /> patent.  This could place an unfair imposition on certain cases and I would therefore propose that existing Patents of Addition granted under the 1964 Act be allowed to continue for the life of the parent patent.  Allied to this in the Bill is a requirement which places a retrospective imposition on an existing application which had elapsed at the time of the enactment of the Bill, but which would be the subject of restoration.  This seems to be highly unfair and, in my opinion, should be deleted from the transitional provisions.</P>
    <P>The question of retrospective imposition arises again under paragraph 7 (k) which would cause a grave injustice to many applicants and amounts to judgment in retrospect.  The present law allows the controller a discretion as to the form of evidence of novelty which he is prepared to accept, and there is no apparent reason why this should be changed.  To permit or even countenance such a change in this instance is tantamount to changing the rules in the middle of the game, and that is unfair play, whatever language or currency we use.  I cannot quantify the number of cases to be affected by the proposal, but it may be substantial and would give rise to serious procedural problems on both sides of the fence.  I urge the Minister to look again at the wording of the paragraph in question and ask him to reconsider it in the light of the problems it would cause if passed in its present form.</P>
    <P>As an overall statement on the transitional provisions it seems to me that the Bill seeks to adjudicate on applications for patents and on patents using different parameters to those used under the 1964 Act under which those applications were made or those patents were granted.  It would be unfair to examine such applications or grants retrospectively if the ground rules are to be changed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this new look at an area of significant interest.  The advances which our country has made in the area of technological development in recent years demands of us that we remain fully alert to the needs of industry and commerce from a legislative point of view.  This is <Col N="255" /> an important Bill and I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to offer my proposals on the provisions contained in it.  I hope the Minister will give due consideration to the amendments we will be tabling to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party &mdash; Comhaontas Glas &mdash; have grave reservations about this Bill.  The whole principle of patents is very dubious in that it gives businesses a competition-free 16 years to exploit the invention.  This has enabled many large firms to rip off the consumer.  The present law is bad enough but the Government proposes to extend the already extremely lengthy period of 16 years to 20 years as provided for in section 36.  It is commonly said in favour of patents that they encourage either individual inventors or firms or, indeed, Departments to spend money on research on various products.  This is undoubtedly so but we must ask ourselves whether all the products, or even the majority of products, produced as a result of these inventions benefit mankind. We have only to look at drugs such as thalidomide, pesticides such as DDT which were all patented.  There are probably many patented drugs on the market today which will be withdrawn tomorrow. This is a much greyer area than people realise.  We should not go overboard on this matter.  There are many other examples of products which have done more harm than good to mankind.</P>
      <P>I would dispute also the Minister's desire for uniformity.  Uniformity throughout Europe in this area is not necessary or desirable.  I can see no reason to extend the period from 16 years to 20 years.  I am opposed to section 36 (4) which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order alter the period for which a patent shall remain in force....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such order should require the sanction of Dáil Éireann.  Another area with which I would have a problem is the issue of licences under section 68 in cases where a patentee has failed to exploit the <Col N="256" /> patent.  In such cases the grant of a patent should be revoked.  Finally, on balance, I will be opposing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The current Patents Act has been in operation since 1964, 27 years, and it is timely and opportune that there should be a review.  I welcome the review.  I understand the controller was recommending an updating and a revising of the legislation since 1987.  The Bill will have the effect of helping to streamline the affairs of the Patents Office. However, I warn that the introduction of the Bill in itself will not resolve the backlog of applications.  Up to the end of 1990 the backlog had grown to almost 20,000 applications.  Staffing levels in the Department will also have to be addressed. Currently there are more than 77 staff: I dread saying there are 77.5 but I understand that is due to job-sharing. That figure is less than what it was in 1971 when there was much less to do in the Department.  We are all aware of the rapid advances that have taken place in technology and computerisation over the years.  Therefore, it is regrettable that staffing is at this level.  It will, therefore, be necessary to strengthen the manpower in the Department if we are serious about streamlining it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note in 1990 they made a profit of over £1.7 million.  In this day and age that is a commendable achievement and when one considers the difficulties under which that department labour.  The work done by the present staff involves not alone patents but design works, trade marks and so on.  I am pleased also to note that the Patents Office participated in discussions on the new regulations for the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicine products which was submitted by the Commission during the year.  We are all aware that in the area of medicine ultra-caution is required.  It is interesting to note also in 1990 that out of a total of 4,735 patents applied for, 734 were from Ireland.  Indeed, I found this surprising because I did not realise there were that many.  It is interesting to note that out of 7,516 trade mark applications, 620 were <Col N="257" /> from Ireland and out of 546 designs 92 applications were from Ireland.  We can see from that that, from the point of view of technology, we are quite efficient.  It is understandable also that the vast bulk of the applications come from the USA. It is important to implement this legislation as Ireland was not a signatory of the European Patent Corporation which has its head office in Munich.  If we pass this legislation and become a member of the European Patent Corporation we will simplify the process in the patent business. Notification will enable anybody seeking to protect the invention to protect it within a wide number of European countries, namely, those who have ratified the Convention, and a person will only have to make one application to Munich.  This contrasts with the situation which prevailed in the past.</P>
    <P>This is timely legislation.  If the resources are provided for the Patents Office they will continue to produce a sound financial return to the State as heretofore.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the contributions made. Deputies have generally welcomed the provisions of this long awaited legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry mentioned staffing in the Patents Office.  The Government are considering establishing an independent office which would ease this major difficulty caused by the heavy workload in that office.  The backlog of cases means unrealised revenue but it is not as high as the figure suggested by Deputy Barry and others.  Any area of unrealised revenue which would give opportunities for additional employment must be acted on by the Government.  This Bill is the forerunner to the general rationalisation of the Patents Office, a very important office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the submission made by the patent agents we are ready to put down Committee Stage amendments to improve things in that regard.  In relation to the Community Patent Convention, <Col N="258" /> the Bill does not deal with the ratification of the Convention as there is a constitutional problem involved.  This Bill enables us to ratify the European Patent Convention.</P>
    <P>In relation to short term patents, we will amend the Bill to avoid patents being granted for unworthy inventions.  In relation to generic companies affected by the increase from 16 to 20 years, this area is dealt with adequately in paragraph 4 of the First Schedule:</P>
    <P>In the case of a patent the term of which has been extended under paragraph 2 (1) or 3 (1) of this Schedule, proceedings for infringement of such a patent may not be instituted against a person who, during the final 2 years of the term of that patent, as extended under those provisions, makes only such preparations (other than the importation or placing on the market of a product protected by such patent) as would enable that person to put the invention into effect commercially after the term of the patent expires.</P>
    <P>In relation to drugs there is a long period of evaluation and examination by Government Departments.</P>
    <P>We will deal with the effect of the EC draft supplementary certificate on Committee Stage.  A referendum is necessary to enable us to ratify the Community Patent Convention.  This opinion is based on close scrutiny by the legal experts.  We could not include the Convention in this Bill without first having a constitutional amendment, and that will be done in due course.  In relation to trademarks protection, we propose to draft a new Bill on trademarks very shortly.  A question was raised about the interpretation of the words &ldquo;indigenous Irish companies&rdquo;. These refer to companies which are wholly Irish owned but in the case of smaller pharmaceutical companies it is more appropriate to refer to them as generic companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte dealt with the moral issues and they are covered in the section dealing with the use of inventions for the service of the State.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EC Directive on the <Col N="259" /> patenting of new genes, the Bill does not deal with this Directive which has not been adopted yet.  We are conscious of the aspects of this to which Deputy Rabbitte referred as being undesirable and we are making our arguments very clear in the debate on the relevant directive.</P>
    <P>On most of the points raised by Deputy Lowry we have secured a submission from the patent agents and we are examining it.</P>
    <P>This is a very significant Bill.  I agree that it has taken far too long for it to come before this House, but I am pleased to be in a position to bring it before this House today with the support from all sides for its speedy passage.  There is a backlog of approximately 20,000 patents applications and this backlog would continue to grow if certain measures are not taken.  The current intake of applications is about 4,700 per year while output is only about 1,000 per year.  If measures are not taken to reduce the backlog, and if the volume of applications per annum continues at the present level, it would take 12 years to grant applications for patents made now.  That would be totally unacceptable and that is why this Government have taken action.  Bearing in mind the necessity to take legal advice from the Attorney General's Office and the time it takes to draft a Bill, it was imperative to introduce this legislation. This is a good Bill, an extremely important Bill with major consequences for the future of Irish industry.  I appreciate the indications of support for the legislation from Members of the House.  I hope we can process the Bill through Committee Stage as quickly as possible.  We have had an opportunity to closely examine the requirements and we are satisfied with the content of the Bill.  However, I am always interested to receive submissions and amendments from all sides of the House and I will carefully consider such amendments.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in commending this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.  In May 1989 I introduced in this House Bills to confer university status on the then National Institutes for Higher Education at Limerick and Dublin.  These were historic Bills since they established the first universities since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The two Bills before the House &mdash; Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991 and Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991 &mdash; are no less historic since they mark a stage of development of the non-university sector of higher education which warrants putting it on a statutory footing and vesting more authority and responsibility in the individual institutions in the conduct of their day to day affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> At the outset I would like to sketch out in broad outline the historical context in which our present system of technical and technological education evolved.  An organised system of technical instruction did not develop in Ireland until the early years of this century.  However, a number of individual institutions were making contributions in this field from the second half of the nineteenth century.</P>
    <P>The Samuelson committee on technical education in Britain published their report in 1884 in which they pressed strongly for the expansion of technical education in Ireland with State support. The State's role in providing financial assistance to technical education was recognised for the first time under the Technical Instruction Act of 1889 which empowered local authorities to provide financial aid for such education out of local rates.  The local authority system in Ireland at that time was less than satisfactory and in the event only 12 of the 228 local authorities which could have given grants for technical education did so.  I suppose they suffered from lack of money as we do today; history has not moved that much.</P>
    <P>The report of the Recess Committee in 1896 called for reform and recommended that technical education should be the responsibility of a new Government Department to be established to administer State aid to agriculture and industry. This Recess Committee was part of the conservative movement to kill Home Rule by kindness.  The people here were to get some very worthy measures like the Light Railways Act, the Technical Instruction Act, the Congested Districts Board Act and others.  With these we were to be tranquillised and become subject to orders from across the water.  What happened was that we took into our hands all the powers we got and kept marching onwards.</P>
    <P>This committee also recommended a new type of second level school for agriculture and practical industry, the establishment of evening and continuation courses for those at work and the setting up of higher technical colleges.  It is interesting that a view of this committee <Col N="262" /> that the development of practical education was essential for the economic development of the country has not changed in almost a century.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Ireland) Act of 1898 set down the framework for a more organised local authority structure for the country and enabled the new county and borough councils to levy rates for the support of technical education. This Act, coupled with the Agricultural and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act of 1899 which established the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction as envisaged by the Recess Committee of 1896 are two of the great landmarks in the development of technical education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Act defined technical instruction as &mdash; instruction in the principles of sciences and art applicable to industries and in the application of branches of science and art to specific industries or employment.</P>
    <P>As well as the Department itself the Act provided for a board of technical instruction to advise on all relevant matters submitted to it by the Department. The councils of the county boroughs, urban districts and counties, set up local statutory committees which prepared schemes of technical instruction for their areas for approval and provided the necessary local funding which was a prerequisite to securing financial assistance from central funds.  The system of a combination of central and local funding and control which has served us well over the years thus came into being.</P>
    <P>Let me dwell on the history of this. The history of technical instruction and education and how it all came about is remarkable.  This is the first occasion since the Vocational Education Act, 1930, that we have been able to have a debate on matters such as this.  It is, therefore, useful to dwell on the past.  It is very good for us to look back on what was done to draw inspiration from those early steps forward.  I know I digress a bit, but this is a chance for us all to look back.  I hope the Bill will be not so much <Col N="263" /> leisurely but not frenzied and that we will all have time to contribute to it.</P>
    <P>At the turn of the century when we had the Local Government Act, the Recess Committee and the Technical Instruction Act, in the time of Horace Plunkett and the co-operative movement, people of enterprise and endeavour were attempting to bring to local communities a spirit of self-reliance and self-help.  It was a remarkable achievement in the Ireland of the times.  There was very great poverty but there were the stirrings of the nationalist movement, the flowering and renaissance of poetry, writing, drama and all that.  It was a time of realisation that much endeavour and enterprise rest on the potential of people with their own activities and their own ideas to help one another and to help the local communities.</P>
    <P>In 1922 technical education came under the Department of Agriculture and in 1924 it became the responsibility of the newly established Department of Education. A commission was appointed in 1926 &ldquo;to enquire into and advise on the system of technical education in Saorstat Eireann in relation to the requirements of Trade and Industry&rdquo;.  They reported in 1927 and the main recommendations of the Commission on Technical Education formed the basis of the Vocational Education Act of 1930.  This Act retained the concept of a combination of local and central control and funding and established the system of vocational education as we know it today.</P>
    <P>Technical education was seen as having two main purposes, to train young people for entry to particular types of employment as well as to improve the skills of those already employed.  Each vocational education committee established under the 1930 Act was to provide or aid the provision of technical education in its area.  Technical colleges which existed in the main cities since the last century and to which is owed much of the present thrust and pattern of technical education, were brought under the control of the new vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> The sixties saw a major thrust in the development of technical education with the publication of <i>Investment in Education</i> in 1962 and <i>Training of Technicians in Ireland</i> in 1964.  The then Minister for Education, Dr. Patrick J. Hillery, in May 1963 signalled the Government's intention to arrange with appropriate vocational education committees for the provision of a limited number of technical colleges with regional status.  In September 1966, a steering committee on technical education was established to advise the Minister generally on technical education. The 1969 report of this committee formed the basis for the establishment between 1970 and 1977 of the present network of regional technical colleges.  The steering committee broadly defined the role of these colleges, and by implication the role of other technical colleges as being to educate for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations ranging from craft to professional level, notably in engineering and science, but also in commercial, linguistic and other specialties.</P>
    <P>The steering committee related the colleges to economic growth both nationally and in their own particular regions.  They saw a distinction between the demand for technical education and the need for it and they held the view that the regional technical colleges would provide one means of stimulating demand for skills which the economy needed.  This general view led to a strong emphasis being placed on the need for continuing adaptation of the colleges which would be determined largely by initiatives at local and national level.</P>
    <P>This adaptation has in fact happened. In the early years most of the work of the colleges was concerned with leaving certificate and other second level education as well as apprentice and technician training.  The development of the colleges over the years has seen a phasing out of second level education, a scaling down of apprentice training coupled with an increased involvement in certificate, diploma and degree level courses.</P>
    <P>The growth of the colleges has been <Col N="265" /> phenomenal.  In the period since 1980 wholetime student numbers in the regional technical colleges have risen from 6,500 to almost 20,000 an increase of over 200 per cent.  In the same period wholetime enrolments in the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology have risen by over 100 per cent from 4,000 to 8,600.  The Vocational Education Committee third level colleges therefore have over 28,000 wholetime students which represents about 40 per cent of the present total enrolment at third level in the country.  Provision for part time study has always been a significant feature of the work of these colleges.  The extent of their contribution in this area can be judged from the fact that part time students, including apprentices, account for over 20 per cent of the wholetime equivalent student numbers in the colleges.</P>
    <P>In the 21 years since the first of the regional technical colleges was established &mdash; Athone and some of the others are celebrating their twenty-first &mdash; they have developed and adapted to the stage that they can truly be said to have come of age.  One now comes of age at 18 but it is a nice analogy.  These Bills represent in a symbolic sense the key usually associated with such an event.  They are the key to greater autonomy, to self-governance and to an improved and more effective interaction with business and industry which is a vital function of third level institutions in the modern world.</P>
    <P>These concepts are of equal importance in the Dublin Institute of Technology which was formally established in 1978 by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to bring about better co-ordination of the work of its six third level colleges.  It would be wrong however to date the development of technical and technological education in Dublin from this time.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should look back briefly on their features also.  The origins can in fact be traced to an artisans exhibition on the site of the present Concert Hall in Earlsfort Terrace in 1885 when it was suggested that the premises might be <Col N="266" /> used to provide education for the working classes in the city.  After great deliberation it was decided that more suitable accommodation for a school of the type envisaged was to be found in Kevin Street, where the present college stands. Financed by public subscription and aided by a grant of £500 from the Dublin Municipal Council, it was opened for classes in October 1887.</P>
    <P>The additional funding available following the establishment of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in 1899 led to a rapid development of technical education including the setting up of the Technical Institute in Rathmines in 1902.  In 1904, the Dublin Technical Education Committee took over responsibility for the Municipal School of Music and in 1907 it was housed at its present location at Chatham Row.</P>
    <P>The premises at 18 Parnell Square were acquired in 1906 and became a centre for commercial education and domestic economy.  In that year also the approval was given for the building of a new technical institute at Bolton Street which opened in 1911.  Over the first half of this century these Dublin institutions developed a wide range of technical courses, mainly on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>A further significant input to the ongoing process was the establishment of the Commission on Technical Education which reported in 1927.  This report, as I have said, provided the basis for the 1930 Vocational Education Act which was to prove very enlightened legislation, facilitating all the developments in technical and technological education which have taken place in the Irish vocational education system since then.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me at this point not to pay tribute to the originators, framers and deliberators on that Bill.  It has always been said, and I freely acknowledge this, that that Bill was most amazing legislation.  If it was noted for one thing it was the flexibility inherent in it which enabled the vocational educational committees to be set up &mdash; that was its purpose &mdash; and build on the historical events we spoke about earlier. They were enabled in the decades which <Col N="267" /> followed to push out their boundaries.  I read the debate on that Bill and little did the legislators in 1930 envisage that 60 years later we would be talking about vocational education committees catering for 28,000 third level students many of them studying for qualifications of university standard.  One wonders if the boundaries of the Bill have been pushed out with great imagination in many instances but I do not think so.  While they could not possibly have envisaged in 1930 what was going to happen in third level education the form of words used and the flexibility inherent in them, the spirit, thrust and intent of the Bill facilitated all the developments which have taken place.  I would like on this historic occasion to pay tribute to the originators, the framers and the legislators of 1930 who brought in that legislation.</P>
    <P>The late forties and early fifties saw the development of the first wholetime post leaving certificate courses in the DIT colleges. The increasing pace of technological change brought new demands in the sixties when a series of full-time technician courses were established for the first time in Ireland in response to the requests of a number of major employers.</P>
    <P>The seventies were a period of considerable progress for the Dublin colleges. Several new programmes were established and the numbers of both wholetime staff and students increased significantly.  The foundations for the establishment of the Dublin Institute of Technology were laid in 1970 when a joint academic council was set up to co-ordinate and oversee the third level academic work of the individual colleges with a membership comprising appropriate senior academic and elected members.  In 1975 a partnership agreement was signed with the University of Dublin, Trinity College, under which degree awards are made available to successful graduates from a number of the higher level courses.  An Apprenticeship Board was set up in 1976 to co-ordinate and oversee the work of the apprenticeship sector, and in 1978 the Dublin <Col N="268" /> Institute of Technology was formally established by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to co-ordinate the work of the six colleges.  The major extension to Kevin Street College was completed in 1987 and I had the pleasure of opening a major new extension to Bolton Street College in September 1990.  Planning is ongoing on the new college to be built at Bishop Street to accommodate the colleges of commerce and marketing and design and most recently when I opened the DIT Information Technology Exhibition, I saw at first hand the developments in the computing area reflecting spectacular growth in demand for computing resources in the colleges.</P>
    <P>The DIT now offer a very extensive range of courses at apprenticeship, technician, degree, professional and postgraduate levels.  As I said earlier, there are currently over 8,000 wholetime students and some 15,000 part-time day and evening students, including 5,000 craft apprentices enrolled.  Some would claim that this makes it the largest education institution in the country.  Certainly, more people applied this year for a course in the DIT, through the CAO/CAS system than to any other institution.</P>
    <P>The wider activities of the institute include a number of special centres to provide specialised training and computer based services to industry and an increasing involvement in research and development.  Reflecting on the current position and on the history of technical and technological education in Dublin over the past century as I have outlined it one cannot but commend the wisdom of that enlightened group of people who came together after the 1885 Artisans' Exhibition and decided to establish courses for the working class people of Dublin to improve their general education and skills.</P>
    <P>They would, no doubt, be astounded and proud of the institute and their activities today, their commitment to providing a wide range of courses that are relevant to the needs of industry and society as well as those who enrol in <Col N="269" /> them, the institute's ability to respond to changing demands and new technological advances, the continuing availability of part-time and evening courses and their links with the community they serve.</P>
    <P>As the institute prepare to enter their second century of educational endeavour &mdash; and indeed in the year in which the College of Music celebrates their centenary and the College of Catering their Golden Jubilee &mdash; it is particularly appropriate that the tremendous achievements should now be marked by this Bill which will establish the institute on a statutory basis and through its provisions facilitate the continuing development and progress of the institute.</P>
    <P>I will outline shortly to the House the provisions of both Bills as presented but I would like, at this juncture, to refer in particular to the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and to say that colleges of the institute have been making their own academic awards for over 40 years. Industry and the professional bodies have recognised these awards and accepted them for appointments to professional positions and admission to membership of professional bodies.  The high standing of the awards is attested to through national and international recognition. This proud tradition is recognised in the Bill through the provision that the functions of the institute shall include power &ldquo;to confer, grant or give diplomats, certificates or other educational awards&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The special relationship with the University of Dublin is recognised also and will no doubt develop within the terms of the provision in the Bill that the institute may enter into arrangements with any university in the State for the purposes of having educational awards conferred, granted or given.  This link is further marked by the provision that a member of the new governing body shall be nominated by the University of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The changed nature of the activities of the Vocational Education Committee third level colleges over the years has led to concern about the limitations placed on them in having to operate under the 1930 Vocational Education Act.  This Act, since it relates predominantly to <Col N="270" /> second level education, is inappropriate to third level institutions in the way they must operate today.</P>
    <P>The International Study Group on Technological Education &mdash; the Hardiman report &mdash; was presented to me in 1987, about four or five months after I came to office.  I think of it with great fondness because it was very brief.  There were three main thrusts in their recommendations, that the two NIHEs &mdash; one in Dublin and the other in Limerick &mdash; should become universities and this has been achieved.  Indeed, the legislation in this regard passed through the House on the day the Government fell.  We are all talking like that nowadays, let us hope that nothing of that kind happens when debate on this Bill is concluded. However, it is scheduled to be debated for weeks so we need not worry.  The third recommendation was that the Dublin Institute of Technology should be a statutory body and there were also recommendations in regard to the regional colleges.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not go as far as the Hardiman report envisaged, which was the breakaway of the colleges from the Vocational Education Committee structure and giving them independence in the fullest sense.  We debated it, I thought about it and discussed it at Cabinet level and with various interests.  My immediate predecessor in the Department of Education, MEP Paddy Cooney, before he left office, brought out the heads of a Bill giving effect to some of the Hardiman recommendations with regard to the Dublin Institute of Technology which clearly set out their separation from the Vocational Education Committee system.  I am not making a political point in that regard, I am just outlining its evolution.  When I came to office I studied the heads of the Bill and the speeches and preparations in relation to it.  I was strongly of the opinion that these colleges very badly needed a measure of autonomy, to have a statutory basis for research and development and to be freed, in an everyday sense, from the apron strings.  However, the Vocational Education Committees have served them <Col N="271" /> well and they have served the Vocational Education Committees well, we thought that there should be a balance between the separation envisaged in the Hardiman report and the Cooney Bill and the total inclusion under the Vocational Education Committees.  I hope we have got the balance right; it remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>The International Study Group on Technological Education were fulsome in their praise of the way in which these institutions have fulfilled their role and have become a significant and vital element in higher education.  The group, nevertheless, pointed out the difficulties about the legal basis for the involvement of these institutions in research and development work for business and industry and recommended that statutory provision be made for them.  These difficulties were further highlighted in the NBST discussion document <i>Barriers to Research and Consultancy in the Higher Education Sector.</i></P>
    <P>Activity in the research consultancy and other industry and business linked areas is an important element of the role of higher education institutions in contributing to national development.  The lack of adequate statutory provisions to allow the regional and technological colleges to engage fully in these activities represents a serious problem.  The Bills as presented seek to address this problem in two ways: first they seek to strike a reasonable balance between greater freedom and autonomy for the institutions in their day-to-day operation while maintaining traditional links with the Vocational Education Committee system; secondly, they will enable the institutions to engage in research, development and consultancy work for business and industry as well as to enter into arrangements, including participation in limited companies, to exploit the results of this work.</P>
    <P>While continuing to play a vital role in the provision of highly skilled personnel essential to our evolving industrialised economy, the institutions will also be able <Col N="272" /> in the future to increase and improve their interaction with business and industry and reach their full potential in contributing to national technological development.  In this context the contribution made to business and industry by the highly skilled staff involved must not be forgotten.  Suitable arrangements will have to be worked out so that they, too, can benefit from the innovative and enterprising approach they bring to the provision of much needed services to the business and industrial community.</P>

      <P>Before I concluded on 23 October I was dealing with the extraordinary contribution of Deputy Mac Giolla who stated that the present Minister is the worst Minister for Education in the history of the State.  I proceeded to explain to Deputy Mac Giolla how incorrect he was.  I am sorry he is not here tonight to listen to the remainder of the lesson; but perhaps he has heard <Col N="273" /> enough.  I said the Minister has made enormous achievements in Irish education. I will now proceed to outline other features of her achievements since becoming Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>One of the most important questions in Irish education today is that of remedial teaching.  Remedial teaching has not been seriously addressed hitherto by politicians or Ministers.  However, the present Minister has changed that.  She has increased the number of remedial teachers by 80 this year and, hopefully, the number will be increased by a further 80 next year.  This is more than double the number of remedial posts created by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition between 1983 and 1987.  There is a need to recognise that there are children attending schools who have learning difficulties.  If it can be discovered at an early stage that a young person has learning disabilities something can be done for that child. For far too long the problem was not recognised at an early stage and those children had literacy problems in later life.  I hope we will continue to look at this disadvantage and help those concerned in the way the Minister is doing.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also created 325 additional teaching posts in primary schools in disadvantaged areas.  In addition, 120 schools at post-primary level which were deemed to be disadvantaged have obtained additional teachers.  Speaking about the disadvantaged areas, the Minister has increased three-fold funding for primary schools in these areas.  The junior certificate, which is designed to cater for all options, is a welcome innovation and major reforms in the senior cycle are now proposed.  In short, over the last four years we have seen revolutionary changes in Irish education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many commentators will agree that not since the days of the late Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, have we seen such a revolutionary and innovative Minister for Education.  Her achievements in the last four years have been considerable and they will stand the test of time.  In this regard I look forward to <Col N="274" /> the Green Paper on Education, followed by a White Paper on Education and an Education Bill, which I have no doubt will be acceptable to all reasonable people in this House.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the extraordinary statement by Deputy Deenihan that Fianna Fáil have a very poor record when it comes to introducing legislation in the education area.  Ironically, Deputy Deenihan had to go back to the days of Cumann na nGael to boast to the House of the achievements of Fine Gael in the area of education legislation.  However, the record speaks for itself.  It was Fianna Fáil in the sixties under the late Donogh O'Malley who introduced free education and who, for the first time, gave the people in a disadvantaged position, people who were not wealthy, the opportunity to be educated.  How can Deputy Deenihan honestly come before the House and say that Fianna Fáil have a poor record in the area of education?  If he were to look honestly at the achievements of this Minister over the last four years he could not but conclude that we have entered a new era in Irish education. The foundation stones have been laid where the disadvantaged and those with learning disabilities have been recognised, perhaps the first time, in a realistic way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion it is my sincere wish that, in the Green Paper and White Paper on Education, the Minister will consider seriously the position of the mentally handicapped.  I hope the Green Paper, the White Paper and the new Education Bill will recognise their place in society, their need to be educated and the valuable contribution they too can make to Irish life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this debate on the Education Bill, 1991, introduced by Fine Gael.  This Bill lacks detail and imagination.  It makes no provision for facilitating change.  The introduction of the Bill at this stage seems to have more to do with political opportunism than a real desire to promote consultation between all those interested in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> A comparison must be made between this Bill and the approach of the Minister for Education.  The Minister proposes to introduce a Green Paper, a discussion document that will address all aspects of education on a consultative basis.  Real change in education will only come about through consultation and dialogue. There have been numerous examples of this during the present Minister's term of office, such as the Primary Curriculum Review Body and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Instead of introducing a Bill void of consultation and understanding of the real problems facing our students and teachers, the Minister has concentrated her efforts on removing the many anomalies that remain from the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Wexford the conditions in many of the primary schools were deplorable.  Between 1978 and 1990 many of these schools were proposed for construction and planning &mdash; Piercetown, Duncannon, Kilmyshal, Rathnure, Kiltealy, Castledockrell, Danescastle, Baymurn, Glenbrien, Crossabeg, Ballycullane and Kilrane.</P>

Through the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government have recognised that education is the key to the success of our nation.  Every effort has been made to involve all sectors and where anomalies exist action has been taken to correct <Col N="276" /> them.  Examples of this include the allocation of 60 posts to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas in 1990.</P>

Tá sé beagánin ait go raibh Teachtaí ó Fhianna Fáil ag déanamh comhgháirdas leis an Aire de bharr an &ldquo;Green Paper&rdquo; atá le teacht cé gur chaith siad ceithre bliana ag iarraidh an Green Paper a thabhairt os ár gcomhair.  Ach tá an seanfhocal fíor fós &mdash;&ldquo;an té nach bhfuil láidir, ní mór dó/di bheith glic&rdquo;&mdash; tá sé i bhfad níos fearr bheith ag cur milleáin ar an mBille seo nuair nach bhfuil aon Bhille agat féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill, I express disappointment that Fianna Fáil did not acknowledge this Bill as a great contribution by Deputy Jim Higgins to legislation. He has produced this Bill without <Col N="277" /> the benefit of a Green Paper or a White Paper.  The Bill could be amended if people had so desired.  Saying it is inflexible and that it does not do this or that is a sign that Members rushed in to make their speeches without reading the Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Bill can be used as an opportunity to advance education but unfortunately the system in Dáil Éireann means that the Government will oppose any Bill from this side of the House.  I regret that the Minister has not produced a Green Paper after four years in office and therefore we will not have a Bill from that side of the House for some time.  The Minister made use of alliteration to damn this Bill, saying it was arid among other things.  However, perhaps I could say it was arid alliteration that she used and describe similarly her efforts at producing a Green Paper as inept, inert, indifferent, inexplicable, inefficacious and above all inexcusable.  The Minister cannot have it both ways; she cannot sit on the fence and at the same time criticise those who got off the fence.</P>
    <P>A Green Paper would highlight the problems that need to be solved in education. One of the Government back-benchers mentioned that Deputy Higgins had stolen the Minister's clothes, but I find it strange that the clothes which were not even put on display could be stolen, as the ideas for the Green Paper were still in somebody's mind.  Deputy Higgins could not have stolen any ideas because there were none before him.</P>
    <P>The problem of large classes is still a national scandal.  It will not matter what else we do if we do not tackle this problem. Praising the Minister for the wonderful improvements she has made in the pupil-teacher ratio is a bit hollow, as obviously some Members who are leaving the House have not heard of the marches by parents and teachers throughout the country over the worsening pupil-teacher ratio in our schools. Indeed, I worked at the coalface of education in an eight-teacher school.  This is the ideal because there is one teacher per class but our position was disimproved when we lost a teacher and went down to seven teachers.  Anyone who ever put <Col N="278" /> their nose inside a school would know that having seven teachers for eight classes leads to problems &mdash; classes doubling up or split classes.  Certainly the children do not gain from that so-called advancement.  No matter how her back-benchers canonise the Minister, the facts still stand.  The latest statistics on class sizes from the Department of Education are a scandal: 6,367 classes have fewer than 29 pupils; however almost double that number, 11,160 classes have 30 or more pupils, and in the remaining group 600 classes have 40 or more pupils.  There is very little advantage for a Minister to talk about improving the position of education if we can tolerate the fact that there are 600 classes with more than 40 pupils.  I have stood in the classroom for more than 30 years so I know exactly what I am talking about.  I hope that the present Minister, if she remains in her partfolio and is not elevated to higher plains, will tackle the problems of large classes.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy O'Leary's concern about remedial teachers.  As I have said time and again, the intelligent pupil will survive and prosper in spite of teachers but the slow learner needs the skill and help of trained teachers.  I give the Minister credit for introducing more remedial teachers into the schools.  However, a great many schools in Dublin seem to be getting the greater proportion of remedial teachers.  While I realise that large schools can have problems, smaller schools can also have problems.  Many schools in rural Ireland have problems and they deserve to get their share in the allocation of remedial teachers.  Schools can share the services of a remedial teacher, as is happening.  However, sometimes the rural schools feel they are being ignored and that the city schools are getting the biggest slice of the cake.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to discuss the issue of discipline in any forthcoming Green Paper.  The lack of discipline is causing havoc in many schools around the country.  While I accept it is not the in-thing to talk about corporal punishment, I think the threat of corporal punishment often had a very steadying <Col N="279" /> effect on unruly pupils.  The absence of discipline in schools has made life very difficult for teachers who are drifting into middle or old age, because they were used to a different style of education.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to teacher training.  We have very good colleges who specialise in the art of training teachers.  I did what was supposed to be a very good H. Dip. course in Maynooth but I found that the amount of time on actual teaching practice was insufficient.  Things may have improved since then but much more emphasis should be put on the art of getting the information across.  It is all right to have an honours degree but if one cannot communicate, the pupils will not gain.  That is not a reflection on secondary school teachers who do marvellous work, but is a reflection on the Higher Diploma in Education course.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope the Minister brings out a Green Paper on Education.  If it does not appear quickly, I hope the Government would consider accepting this Bill, which gives scope for a major advance. As procrastination is the thief of time, so also is procrastination the thief of Green Papers.</P>

Chífidh muid cad é a tharlóidh.  Sa Bhille seo tá an bhéim ar bhunoideachas agus ar iar-bhunoideachas. Sílim go n-aontaíonn gach duine go bhfuil an bunoideachas thar a bheith tábhachtach, mar go gcaithfidh gach dalta dul tríd an chóras bunoideachais.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go gcuirfí acmhainní a ndóthain isteach na chóras bunoideachais mar go bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach sin.</P>
    <P>Más rud é go n-éiríonn deacrachtaí sa chóras &mdash; bíonn deacrachtaí ag an dalta go minic &mdash; láiríonn na fadhbanna sin iad féin sa chóras bunoideachais agus, mar sin de, múinteoirí feabhais agus seirbhísí eile, ba chóir go mbeadh siad ar fáil sa chóras bunoideachais mar, go minic, bíonn seirbhísí cosúil le múinteoireacht fheabhais agus comhairleoirí eile anmhall nó rómhall nuair a thig siad go dtí an córas iar-bhunoideachais.  Sílim gur ceann de na fadhbanna móra atá ag múinteoirí i láthair ná huaire ná an uimhir dhaltaí atá sna ranganna.  Tá an coibhneas idir daltaí agus múinteoirí sa tír seo níos airde, is dócha, ná in aon tír eile sa Chomhphobal agus cothaíonn sé sin deacrachtaí do na múinteoirí.  Sílim anois, ó tharla go bhfuil uimhir na ndaltaí scoile ag dul i laghad agus go bhfuil an daonra ag titim, de réir na staitisiticí agus an eolais atá againn, gur chóir don Aire úsáid a bhaint as an titim sa daonra faoi choinne an PTR, nó an coibhneas idir <Col N="281" /> daltaí agus múinteoirí a ísliú.  Tá sé anard i láthair na huaire.  Tá sé ag cur isteach go mór ar mhúinteoirí agus sílim gur chóir iarracht níos mó a dhéanamh chun é a ísliú.</P>
    <P>Is é an dara rud atá ag cur isteach ar na múinteoirí agus ar an chóras oideachais ná an córas smachta.  Luaigh an Teachta de Brún seanfhocal ansin, &ldquo;An té nach bhfuil láidir ní mór dó bheith glic&rdquo;, agus tá seanfhocal eile &mdash; agus tá mé cinnte go dtuigfidh an tAire Stáit thall ansin é, is cinnte gur chuala sé cheana é &mdash;&ldquo;Ní bhíonn an rath ach mar a mbíonn an smacht&rdquo;.  Tá aithne agam ar go leor múinteoirí; chaith mé féin beagnach fiche bliain i mbun scoile, agus nuair a chastar mo chairde orm anois atá ag teagasc go fóill, is é an scéal a bhíonn acu go léir ná go bhfuil siad ag fanacht leis an am gur féidir leo éirí as.  Níl said sásta fanacht go dtí go mbeidh cúig bliana is seasca slánaithe acu.  Chomh luath agus tá cúig bliana agus tríocha curtha isteach acu tá go leor acu ag iarraidh éirí as.  Is comhartha é sin ar an strus agus ar an bhrú atá ar mhúinteoirí i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Deirtear go bhfuil an t-oideachas saor. Ní shílim go bhfuil sé saor.  Tá boird bhainistíochta agus múinteoirí ar fud na tíre agus ní amháin go mbíonn siad ag teagasc i rith an lae, ach gach tráthnóna caithfidh siad a bheith páirteach in imeachtaí chun airgead a chur ar fáil faoi choinne na scoileanna a reachtáil.  Bíonn crannchuir agus rincí, silver circles, bazaars agus rudaí mar sin acu le hairgead a chur ar fáil le go bhfaigheadh na daltaí oideachas.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag caint le príomhoide scoile Gaeltachta seachtain ó shin, scoil cheathrar oidí, agus dúirt sé liom go bhfuil siad £3,000 i bhfiacha ag an bhanc.  Sílim nach aon eisceacht é sin, go bhfuil an chuid is mó de na bunscoileanna ar fud na tíre i bhfiacha agus go bhfuil na bainc ag reachtáil an chórais oideachas in ionad na Roinne Oideachais.  Ar an ábhar sin tá sé ríthábhachtach go mbeidh níos mó airgid agus acmhainní á gcur isteach sa chóras bunoideachais.</P>
    <P>Mar urlabhraí Ghaeltachta agus mar fhear Ghaeltachta, ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh agus a insint go bhfuil <Col N="282" /> deacrachtaí ar leith sna scoileanna Gaeltachta. Bhí mé ag cruinniú aréir i mo dháilcheantar, áit a raibh múinteoirí, tuismitheoirí agus bainisteoirí i láthair agus imní an-mhór orthu.  Tá paróiste amháin sa chontae agus chaill beagnach gach scoil sa pharóiste sin múinteoirí le cúpla bliain anuas.  Tá an uimhir dhaltaí ag titim ach tá an uimhir mhúinteoirí ag titim freisin.  Sílim gur chóir go dtuigfeadh an tAire, an Roinn agus an Rialtas go bhfuil deacrachtaí speisialta agus deacrachtaí ar leith sna scoileanna Gaeltachta i láthair na huaire.  Táan saol ag athrú sa Ghaeltacht agus tá an-chuid de na daltaí a thagann ar scoil anois, go minic ní bhíonn an Ghaeilge mar theanga dhúchais ag na tuismitheoirí.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag duine amháin agus go minic nuair a thagann na daltaí ar scoil ní bhíonn an Ghaeilge acu.  Ceann de na rudaí a chaithfidh múinteoirí na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh sa chéad chúpla bliain nuair a bhíonn na daltaí seo ar scoil ná an-chuid ama a chaitheamh chun an teanga a theagasc go maith dóibh.</P>
    <P>An dara deacracht atá ag na scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht ná an easpa mhór téacsleabhar. Tá ganntanas mór de théacsleabhair fhiúntacha agus théacsleabhair fhóirstineacha sna scoileanna Gaeltachta. I mo chontae féin &mdash; agus tá sé ag tarlú i nGaeltachtaí eile &mdash; tá na múinteoirí tar éis grúpaí oibre a chur ar fáil, grúpaí oibre a bhfuil sé mar chuspóir acu téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil agus a fhoilsiú agus iad a thabhairt do na múinteoirí agus na daltaí.  Tá na múinteoirí ag tabhairt a gcuid ama féin, tar éis na scoile, don obair an-tábhachtach seo.  Sin cuid de na deacrachtaí atá sna bunscoileanna Gaeltachta. Ag an am céanna, tá siad ag cailliúint múinteoirí.  Ceann de na comharthaí dóchais a fheicim féin san oideachas ná na Gaelscoileanna atá curtha ar bun ar fud na tíre: i mBaile Átha Cliath, i gCorcaigh, i gCeatharlach, i Muineachán agus i ngach dáilcheantar.  Is comhartha dóchais é, mar a dúirt mé, agus tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil sé sin ag tarlú.  Tá súil agam go rachaidh siad ó neart go neart agus go mbeidh tacaíocht an Tí seo agus an Rialtais le fáil acu sin i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Ach is é an pointe a ba mhaith liom a <Col N="283" /> dhéanamh ná go bhfuil an coibhneas idir daltaí agus múinteoirí sna Gaelscoileanna níos fearr ná mar atá sa Ghaeltacht. Sna Gaelscoileanna ar fud na tíre tá múinteoir thar an chuota i ngach ceann acu.  Tá siad ag déanamh obair thábhachtach. Tá an Ghaeilge le teagasc acusan do na daltaí chomh maith.  Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas breathnú go báúil ar iarratas mhúinteoirí na Gaeltachta, go mbeadh an coibhneas céanna sna scoileanna Gaeltachta agus atá sna Gaelscoileanna mar tá obair dheacair le déanamh ag múinteoirí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>D'inis mé cad é atá le déanamh acu agus sílim gur chóir don Aire breathnú ar an chás sin agus, idir seo agus an chéad scoilbhliain eile, go ndéanfadh sí socrú go mbeadh an coibhneas céanna sna scoileanna Gaeltachta agus atá sna Gaelscoileanna.  Is cinnte go dtabharfaidh sé cuidiú mór don obair atá á déanamh chun an teanga agus an cultúr agus an traidisiún a choinneáil beo agus iad a chur ar aghaidh chuig an chéad ghlúin eile.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom ár mbuíochas a thabhairt don Teachta Higgins as an Bhille a thabhairt isteach. Tá an t-oideachas an-tábhachtach i saol na tíre.  Caitheann an Roinn Oideachais £1.3 bhilliún gach bliain.  Tá lúcháir orm go raibh deis agam an cúpla pointe sin a dhéanamh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh deis againn gach bliain as seo amach tagairt agus plé a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí oideachais anseo sa Dáil, mar go bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach sin d'aos óg na tíre seo agus don tír i gcoitinne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is history-making since I understand it is the first time, since the foundation of the State, somebody has had the energy, intelligence and foresight to introduce this type of Bill in the House.  I congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins on being that person.  The Bill speaks volumes for the man in that, in the short time he has been spokesperson on education for our party, he has had this truly remarkable achievement.  I was both surprised and disappointed at the <Col N="284" /> attitude the Minister adopted &mdash; dog in the manager; one could advance all sorts of descriptions of the way she handled the debate two weeks ago.  Certainly one would not have thought it was a speech of a Minister for Education.  Nonetheless, that is what we have to deal with.  For example, the Minister said the Bill lacked philosophy.  It does not set out to be a philosophical document.  It simply aims to provide the legislative framework within which to deal with primary and post-primary education, nothing more, nothing less; there is no room in the document for philosophy.  If I have a chance later perhaps I will talk about the Minister's philosophy and the measures we have had of her philosophy to date.</P>
      <P>In its 18 sections the Bill provides a comprehensive framework for dealing with primary and post-primary education. The provisions of section 4 clearly define the functions of the Minister.  I might add that our Minister is a Minister for <i>ad hocery</i>.  She does not work within any legislative framework whatsoever. Rather she issues letters, directives, circulars and cheques to schools all over the country for which there is absolutely no legislative basis.  Nobody really has to obey her directives.  I must confess to having worked in a school myself and therefore would know, so I predict the only reason people do obey her directives is that, otherwise, she might refuse to issue a cheque.  She would have power to do so.  Surely that does not constitute proper and correct procedures to be adopted in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 gives the Minister power to make regulations in relation to primary and post-primary education.  The provisions of section 6 deal with the boards of management of schools, how they should be constituted and so on, while section 7 provides similar provisions with regard to the Curriculum Review Board, stipulating their membership and functions. Section 8 provides for regulations regarding curricula for primary and post-primary schools while section 9 deals comprehensively with the Examinations Board.  Section 10 deals with the staffing of schools.  Sections 11 and 12 deal with <Col N="285" /> the functions of teaching staff.  Section 13 deals with codes of conduct for pupils, section 14 with the functions of school principals.  Section 15 refers to parents' associations.  From my experience of teaching the provisions of section 16 are extremely important in that they deal with an independent Inspectorate of Education.  Section 17 deals with the provision for special needs and section 18 with religion in schools.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will clearly be seen to be a very comprehensive document.  The Minister's attitude to the Bill left much to be desired.  She could have been quite positive about it.  For example, she could have said it was a marvellous achievement. She could have said that Deputy Jim Higgins &mdash; who does not have recourse to the kinds of people on whom the Minister can call, experts in the Department and so on &mdash; had produced a very comprehensive document.  The Minister could have said the Bill was full of good, honest endeavour, encompassing a number of good ideas.  Seeing that there is no other Bill before the House at this time &mdash; and none on the Statute Book &mdash; she could have acknowledged that, while it might have short-comings &mdash; it would be surprising if there were none &mdash; its provisions could have been changed, by way of consultation between Deputy Higgins and herself in ways she might have wanted and then be enacted.</P>
    <P>Certainly the Minister did not take that line but the very opposite one.  For example, she was of the opinion that the Bill was absolutely no good.  The Minister will be more or less alone in that view because most people would acknowledge that it constitutes a fine piece of work on which its author ought be congratulated. For example, its provisions introduce accountability to this House.  It is interesting to note that schools nationwide receive quite a large amount of money from the Department annually. Having worked in education I have no doubt but that they spend it wisely and well.  However, they never have to give an account of how they spent that money. Members of this House must ask schools and of course do not have to obtain <Col N="286" /> answers, in an effort to ascertain how the money is spent.  The Minister certainly cannot say for sure how the money will have been spent.  It will clearly be seen that there is complete lack of accountability for the money spent by the Minister on primary and post-primary education annually.  The only thing we know for certain is that there is insufficient of it available.  That is the information fed back to us but no other.  Surely accountability is a very important principle and it is time it was introduced into education?</P>
    <P>When one talks of accountability teachers may well get the wrong impression.  For example, they may think that the heavy hand is descending on them, that Members of this House are anxious to shackle them in some way, to watch every move they make, as it were, to have an eye to the keyhole while they teach and so on.  That is not the kind of accountability about which I am talking. Teachers may be worried about the inspectorate.  From my experience of post-primary education there is no inspectorate as such.  I frequently telephoned the Department of Education requesting a Minister to visit my school in Carrickmacross and discuss with me elements of the teaching of mathematics. It was rarely that I got a positive response because there was nobody available.  The position is the same today and will be the same tomorrow.  If a teacher needs to have a discussion with an expert regarding the changing nature of pupils and subjects, there is no inspectorate. Teachers might well feel that an inspectorate would be heavy-handed but that is not the intention.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by giving an example of the Minister's philosophy of education. She spends approximately £690 on each pupil in a national school, approximately £1,183 per head on post-primary students and about £3,163 per head on students who attend third level institutions.  The Minister would say that the very young children aged four, five or six are vulnerable and innocent and she would spend a long time discussing their needs. <Col N="287" /> The amount of money spent on such children as compared with that expended on older students shows that while the Minister has a philosophy she is not delivering on it.  Unfortunately time constraints do not allow me to develop that point, but I will return to it another time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I will not be over-critical of the Bill presented by Deputy Higgins.  He has put much effort into drafting the Bill and I am aware that he has a genuine interest in education.  I do not agree with a number of provisions in the Bill, but any Bill relating to education must be welcomed as giving us an opportunity to debate this very important subject and put forward our ideas for changes in the system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins could have waited until the publication of the Green Paper on Education.  In 1990 the Taoiseach announced the Government's intention to introduce a comprehensive Education Bill and that the first step would be the preparation of a Green Paper.  The Minister said last week that the Green Paper is in draft stage and will be published shortly.  This will afford an opportunity for detailed discussions and consultations. Apart from teachers and parents, there is a general interest in education among the population.  The Green Paper will afford an opportunity to put forward views and ideas before the Education Bill is drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us seeks to introduce a system of dictating from the top down, which is completely different from what the Minister has been trying to achieve. She has involved herself in consultations with all interested parties in the field of education.  This is the way to continue in the years ahead because it is important that all those involved should participate in the education debate.  An example of the Minister's approach was her setting <Col N="288" /> up of the curriculum review body and other educational bodies.  Reports have been published which have allowed for wide-ranging debate.  The Bill before us seeks to change the direction and to lay down strict criteria and guidelines for teachers and for parent-teacher associations.</P>
    <P>Since the mid-sixties there has been a radical overhaul of the education system. The late Donogh O'Malley is credited with the introduction of the free education system.  The degree to which the system is &ldquo;free&rdquo; has been dictated from time to time by the national finances under different Governments.  It must be admitted that there have been tremendous strides in education during the past 25 years and I hope to see continued expansion and improvement of the system.  Our young people are generally regarded as highly intelligent and well educated.  This is a credit to successive Ministers for Education and to the teachers.  Criticism is often levelled at teachers and there will always be a certain number who are not up to standard.  At every level, however, we have teachers of the highest calibre and we must be proud of the teaching profession.  It is recognised worldwide that our students are top class.</P>
    <P>I should like to see changes in the higher education grants system.  In the sixties third level education was largely the preserve of the élite.  That has changed and there are large numbers of young people attending universities and other colleges.  The problem regarding grants must be tackled seriously.  Families with one or more children cannot afford to send them to third level colleges if they do not get a grant.  The PAYE sector are severly penalised with regard to grant allocations.  The self-employed are seemingly able to get around the system and it is certainly questionable how some of them qualify for grants.  It would seem in certain cases that their income would be above the qualifying level.  The PAYE worker is stuck with his P60 and if he has a few bob over the limit he does not qualify.  I welcome the statement in the new Programme for Government that <Col N="289" /> where more then one child is attending a third level college consideration is being given to a different system of qualification for grant or scholarship.  I ask the Minister to introduce that system as quickly as possible to enable many more people to qualify.  Nobody should be denied the right to third level education because he or she is slightly over the qualifying limit.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the present system of assessing eligibility for grants.  At present gross income is taken into account in assessing eligibility.  Sure it would be fairer to take into account the take home pay of people from which tax and PRSI has been deducted?  A case can be made for taking net pay into account in assessing eligibility for grants in the future.</P>
    <P>Another issue which needs to be looked at relates to school books.  This has probably been flogged to death but it is important that the Minister takes into account the high cost of school books which seem to have escalated out of all proportion.  In many ways this has become a national scandal.  Of course, the publishers are creaming off the profits and getting rich at the expense of the less well off in our society.  The time has come for the Minister to call in the publishers and tell them that the frequent changing of school books is not acceptable and parents cannot afford to keep buying new school books.  When I was attending school, books could be handed down to younger brothers and sisters.  That does not seem to be the case any longer.  The frequent changing of school books is putting a major burden on families.  I hope the Minister will shortly have discussions with publishers so that this problem can be resolved.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister announced a significant increase in the number of teachers assigned to schools in disadvantaged areas.  Like Deputy Browne of Fine Gael, I ask the Minister to take rural areas into consideration when making these assignments.  Many of those teachers seem to have been assigned to schools in Dublin, Cork and other major centres of population.  I do not have any problem with this but there are many <Col N="290" /> disadvantaged areas in rural Ireland which require such teachers.  For example, many housing estates with an unemployment rate of 75-80 per cent could be classed as disadvantaged and this could lead to many problems.  I should like the Minister to assign more teachers to schools in disadvantaged areas of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, with the Minister for Labour, recently announced the extension of the Youthreach programme to enable early school leavers to avail of courses.  One such course is starting next week in my home town of Enniscorthy.  Up to 30 young people will be able to avail of this course which is under the control of County Wexford Vocational Education Committee.  I would like to see this worthwhile project being extended to other urban areas so that young people who, through no fault of their own, left school early, can pursue courses which will give them extra qualifications and help them secure jobs. Young people who left school at 14, 15 or 16 years of age have little chance of securing jobs.  Statistics show that people who sat their leaving certificate examination or attended third level colleges have a better chance of getting a job than people who dropped out of school at 14 or 15 years of age.  It is important that the Youthreach programme be extended to cater for as many young people as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some sections of the Bill.  Section 10 states that a teacher means a person holding a valid teaching licence.  Perhaps Deputy Higgins will clarify this provision when he is replying to the debate tomorrow night.  I do not know how he intends teaching licences to be operated.  That provision does not seem right.  Will teachers have to pass some kind of test?  If they are not up to scratch, will their licence be endorsed or will it be withdrawn for one, two or three years.  If that happens, will they be able to return to teaching?  I should like the Deputy to explain what this provision entails.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the posts of principalship and vice-principalship of <Col N="291" /> each school shall be filled by a board of management of that school on the basis of merit of each applicant for the post. That is the position which obtains at present.  Is Deputy Higgins saying that some teachers got their jobs otherwise than on the basis of merit?  Generally speaking principals and vice-principals are of the highest quality and I hope it is not being implied that there is some problem with these appointments.  I know many principals and vice-principals and I have not heard any complaints about them or their ability to teach.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that the Minister shall, by way of regulation, make provision for codes of conduct to be observed by all students.  I am not sure that one can legislate for conduct by students.  While guidelines in this area have to be laid down for teachers, conduct can be described in many ways and teachers have their own way of dealing with misbehaviour by students.  This may involve imposing a severe penalty on the student or just talking to him.  Discipline should be left to the discretion of the teacher concerned rather than providing for rigid codes of conduct in legislation.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking there is a discipline problem in many schools.  I may be old fashioned but I believe discipline has gone from one extreme to the other. When I was going to school, pupils who stepped out of line usually got a few belts of a strap or, as one Christian Brother used to call a big six foot stick he had, the board of education.  Today teachers are at a disadvantage in that if they even shout at a student usually the mother or father visits the school the following day threatening all sorts of action against the teacher.  It is very difficult for teachers to operate any code of discipline within schools at present.  In many cases parents have adopted a soft attitude to discipline of their children.  My sympathy lies with the teachers, both primary and secondary, who have to maintain discipline in schools.  The Minister needs to seriously consider how this problem can best be tackled.  I have no easy answers to this problem but discipline has gone <Col N="292" /> from one extreme to the other; while it was too harsh when I was going to school it is too simplistic nowadays.  This is causing many problems within schools.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to refer to a matter which is near to my heart, and I suppose the hearts of many Deputies, the quality of education for mildly and severely handicapped children.  Institutions such as St. John of God House, Foley House and St. Patrick's Special School in my home town of Enniscorthy have a particularly good record in this area of education which tends to be forgotten in our overall education system.  I appreciate that the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and the previous Minister for Education, Mrs. Gemma Hussey, allocated substantial grants to schools in Enniscorthy for the provision of facilities for handicapped children.  It is important that any education Bill provides specific allocations for the development of accommodation and educational facilities for mildly and severely handicapped children.  At present those who provide this education have to rely mainly on voluntary subscriptions and the goodwill of people.  It needs to be put on a proper footing and I would hope that any new education Act would include that.  As I said earlier, I do not agree with Deputy Higgins' Bill but it has given us an opportunity to debate education in this House, and that in itself is a good thing.  I hope the Green Paper will be before this House soon when we can have a further discussion on the whole education system and how to improve the quality of education for our future children in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting forward this Bill Deputy Higgins and the Fine Gael Party are jumping the gun because they are aware that a Green Paper on education is due, but they decided to get some publicity by publishing this document &mdash; I would not call it a deeply considered document.  As other parties in the House have been bringing Bills forward, Fine Gael felt they had to get in on the <Col N="293" /> act and Deputy Higgins duly brought forward this measure.</P>
      <P>This Bill makes no provision for consultation. Since 1987, when we assumed office, we have shown the importance of consultation.  When there is a consensus between the unions, the employers, the Government and all the other interested parties, great strides can be made.  The Teachers' Union of Ireland regret that there was no consultation with them before the publication of this Bill.  That consultation provision is lacking in Deputy Higgins' Bill and is, perhaps indicative of the attitude of the party to which he belongs.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss education.  We have only a short time in which to discuss it in Private Members' time, but when the Green Paper is published I am sure we will get much more time to discuss it.  Education is of vital importance for our children.  If they do not get a proper education from primary level upwards they will be at a disadvantage for life.  We have a very sound education system at primary, secondary and third levels but we must always be ready to adapt and change. This Government and every Member of the House want to ensure that our education system does not remain stagnant but that it will improve and give our young people more information to prepare them better for the years ahead.</P>
      <P>In the fifties and up to the mid-sixties, when most of us here were educated, the majority of the population enjoyed only primary level education and the late Donogh O'Malley and the Fianna Fáil Government introduced free secondary education.  In those days the three Rs &mdash; reading, writing and arithmetic &mdash; were drummed into people.  We have had a change in education over the years and perhaps those basic subjects were pushed into the background.  Sometimes I wonder whether more emphasis should be placed on those aspects of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays, teaching computer skills is vitally important.  In my national school, pupils in high infants, first, second classes and upwards are being taught about computers. Various languages &mdash; French, <Col N="294" /> German, etc. &mdash; are now being taught in national schools.  This is very important and it should be more formalised because in the years ahead we will have to compete more and more on the European scene; therefore, our children should be taught the languages of Europe.</P>
    <P>The success of a school nowadays depends on co-operation between teachers, management and parents.  Television is so all pervasive that it can make the life of a teacher impossible.  Very good teachers can spend all their time in the classroom but if students do not attend to their studies, much of that good work is undone.  It is important that parents realise the importance of their role in the education system, and this is something that will have to be stressed.  What the Minister for Education has done by involving parents and agencies in primary and post-primary education is very important.  It shows that the Minister and the Government realise the importance of parents becoming involved in the education process.</P>
    <P>An area which needs to have more importance placed on it is that of remedial teaching whether in inner city, outer city or country schools.  There are many pupils who require special attention. Even though 80 or so extra teachers were appointed to the remedial area this year, there is still room for more.  I am glad the Government recognise this need and that they have provided extra resources for that area this year.  I would urge the Minister to continue to recognise this need.  The pupil-teacher ratio is important also.  Both at primary and secondary levels the Minister has provided extra teachers: for example, 250 extra teaching posts at secondary level and 325 at primary level.  This is an area the Govenment will continue to address.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the part of the Bill dealing with central control.  In Ireland we tended to put too much control into central Government.  Central control stifles the entrepreneurship of the local school principals and teachers.  I could not agree with that.  School principals must be given more autonomy.  If teachers were to comply with the rules <Col N="295" /> put forward in this Bill, it would be a retrograde step for those schools, and that would not be acceptable.  The Bill is welcome in that it has given us an opportunity to say a few words with regard to education, but at the end of the day it is a narrow Bill.  It adds nothing further to the education system.  It was brought forward in order to gain a few scores before the White Paper comes out.</P>

      <P>I regret the ungracious manner with which the Minister for Education and the Fianna Fáil Deputies received this Bill.  Such was the ungraciousness that it bordered on vindictiveness and this is a sad thing when we are talking about education which is the concern of all Irish people.  Surely elected representatives should use their combined wisdom and experience, ideas and ideals to work for our children and for the future of Ireland.  Like any Bill, this Bill can be improved.  Can any Deputy point to any Bill that was not improved on Committee Stage?  This Bill is no different but the Government party's ungraciousness extended to the point where they were not able to praise the major part of the Bill which would be good for the Irish education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My namesake, Deputy Ahern, just said that Fine Gael were jumping the gun.  That certainly is not true.  The Deputy remarked that an education Bill promised by the Minister for Education is due.  It is not due.  It is overdue to such an extent that we on this side of the House concluded that the idea had been aborted.  We did not jump the gun.  It is not new for this side of the House to introduce Bills.  We moved a Bill on foreign adoptions which was adopted in the House and our Bill on vocational education resulted in the Minister writing to all the Vocational Education Committees to ensure they will do what we proposed <Col N="296" /> in that Bill which was to have representatives of teachers and parents on our Vocational Education Committees.  I would remind members of the Govenment that Bills moved on this side of the House resulted in action by the Government and that is what we intend to have as a result of this Bill &mdash; action by a Minister and a Government who have been so tardy in addressing this important matter.  We have been so successful in the past we are determined the Government side of the House will act in this case.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill, 1991, introduced by my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, is about one thing which has not been recognised, the pursuit of excellence in Irish education.  While we have been served well by a fine and worthy education system, nevertheless, the time has come to put our education system on a sound legal basis.</P>
    <P>In producing the Bill, Deputy Higgins considered the broad structure of our present system and he ably established where the need now lies for change and progress, as well as how best the considerable achievements of the past can be built upon.  I am glad he was not discouraged by the enormity of the task to be faced &mdash; nor did he see himself with a mission to achieve a total revolution of the system.  Instead, Deputy Higgins produced a Bill, well balanced between the strengths of the present system and the needs and demands of the newer generation. I congratulate him on a tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>We can be proud of our education system.  The standards attained are respected worldwide, but all aspects of education policy must be reviewed to ensure its relevance to our time and to update its procedures and structures as necessary.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a response to these needs. Its major strengths are in addressing the pressing needs of education today &mdash; its commitment to boards of management, to a curriculum review body, to ensure that we have good and competent teachers, to supply the much needed <Col N="297" /> resources in the form of in-service training courses and advice, and to help the staff in our schools to achieve their full potential.  The Bill also endorses the importance of parental involvement and it has many other fine aspects.</P>
    <P>In section 4, I welcome the call for a report on external assessment by external examiners of the standards and educational objectives achieved in Irish certificate examinations, by comparison with standards in equivalent examinations in other European countries. This is a very important step forward.  It is a recognition of the fact that we are in the EC and in the interests of our children and our country, we must extend our horizons to educational changes and standards in other European countries.  If, as a result of this section alone, we compare ourselves to other Europeans, we realise just how incompetent we are in the teaching of European languages in our schools then this section will have done a good job.  We must quickly give recognition to this serious vacuum in our education today and the resources must be provided for the teaching of foreign languages from primary school upwards.</P>
    <P>I was alarmed to find that when some primary schools were prepared on their own initiative and from their own resources to provide for the teaching of French and German it was difficult to get recognition for this initiative and to get permission from the Department of Education. Despite the views of the majority of our teachers and educationists that it is necessary to introduce children at primary school level to European languages, no positive step has been taken to date to try to rectify this deficiency. This Bill will play a unique role in steering our educationists towards preparing students for participation in the European workforce.  Whatever about saying that our children should move abroad, that they should get experience and that we can benefit when our graduates return from abroad, why are we so tardy in giving our students the most important prerequisite they need in order to join the European workforce &mdash; competence in European languages?  It would be in <Col N="298" /> the interests of Irish education if immediate resources and finance were made available and if steps were taken to ensure that at least one European language is taught in our national schools.</P>
    <P>Section 5 refers to the provision of in-service education for teachers.  This is an area of our education provision that has been grossly overlooked and seriously ignored.  Retraining and continuous updating is vital for teachers confined to a classroom for over two decades.  We must recognise that the focus of teacher training during the next decade will be on the professional development of teachers already in the system.  Because of the recent decline in our population the influx of new teachers into our teaching staff has greatly declined.  For innovation, for change and for expertise we have to rely on the present teaching staff. In order to ensure updating and renovation in our education system we must seriously consider in-service training for our teachers.  The recent review body on the primary curriculum, the report of the Primary Education Review Body, and the recently published OECD report, emphasised the need for continuous in-service educational opportunities for teachers if they are to keep in touch with a rapidly changing environment and prepare young people for a life beyond school.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of new teachers in our educational system is not in decline.  The problem we face now is how best to renew the skills and sustain morale in the existing teaching force.  Yet little or no effort is made in the Department of Education to provide in-service training.  The only in-service initiative for primary teachers has been in the form of a one week course in summer.  Such courses are frequently once-off courses unrelated to the work of the school staff.</P>
    <P>At secondary level in-service training is even worse.  It was only after several demands from the teachers and their unions that the present in-service training is now being provided for the junior certificate. It is not sufficient for the Department of Education just to provide in-service training courses for adapting to a <Col N="299" /> new syllabus.  In-service training should be geared towards adaptation and revising the art of teaching which will have long term consequences.  They are needed to advise and guide teachers in the light of the social changes our country is experiencing.  In-service courses are necessary to recharge the batteries.  Without them our educational system will be run on worn out resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is to be congratulated on focusing our attention on the necessity for a serious, positive approach on the part of the Department to in-service and continuous education for our teachers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the call for recognition of parent associations in both primary and post-primary schools.  The role of parents in education is of paramount importance if our education system is to be successful. A national parents council, as recommended, would be an important forum through which these important voices can be heard.  The Constitution states that the parents are the primary educators of our children, yet our education system succeeds in keeping parents on the side line.  For too long parents have been called upon by our schools only to raise finance and to run school functions totally unrelated to the essence of education.  That is an important role for parents.  Nevertheless they should have a say and have an important role to play in education at all levels.  When there are changes in our education system it is not sufficient just to relate those changes to our teachers and the principles of our schools.  All changes in our education system should be related to the parents because, while children spend six hours per day at school, it is with their parents at night that they have to cope with what our education system demands of them. There is no recognition of the interest parents may have in this area.  It is regrettable that we have not kept parents more in the front line of education reform.</P>
    <P>One area where parents should have a major role is in career guidance.  In many homes it is the parents who try to find out what is best suited to their child.  It is the parents who write away and get all <Col N="300" /> the background information.  If it is to be worthwhile, any career guidance service should include parents because young people making such a major decision about the future will discuss it with his parents.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we do not use television to inform parents about what is happening in education today.  This would not alone help our education system but would help to re-educate parents and keep them totally informed and interested in our education system.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that each school will produce a regular progress report.  I welcome this because it will enable us to see how schools are advancing in honouring any commitments they have made as well as providing a record of their achievements.  This will in turn help schools to redefine their targets for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which deals with boards of management, will give authority to individual school units.  This is welcome because it is at this level that day-to-day matters can be dealt with sensitively.  The local community can readily identify with the boards of management.  This Bill sees the boards of management as the basis of a partnership of interests, the interests of teachers, parents and local people all helping to make the school in any community a focal point.  This will result in the drawing together of the various interest groups so that the collective wisdom, experience and strength can be pooled together to provide an efficient and effective service.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the establishment of a curriculum review board for the purpose of undertaking a periodic review of the curriculum in primary and post-primary schools.  This is welcome in a rapidly changing world of new technology, increased organisation and basic changes in industry, agriculture and business which have closed off many traditional careers and opportunities while opening new ones.  The review board will turn old problems into new opportunities.</P>
    <P>As we all realise, appropriate education is the key to economic success.  We <Col N="301" /> must always support change within our educational system.  We must continually monitor what is taught and how it is taught to ensure that it conforms to the needs of the present generation.</P>
    <P>The Government parties have tried their best to tear this Bill asunder.  They have tried to find fault with it in every aspect.  In a major effort to undermine the Bill one night last week Deputy O'Donoghue spoke at length about third level education grants, as did Deputy Browne tonight.  I agree with every word he said about the inequities in the third level education grant system.  In what they said tonight they are supporting every proposal in the Fine Gael policy document produced last June aimed at solving the inequities in the higher education grants system.  On behalf of this side of the House, I thank them for such support.  However, Deputies O'Donoghue and Browne will face the same problems in regard to these proposals as we did on this side of the House.  They will face the reluctance of the Minister for Education to do anything about it. Sadly, we have failed to persuade the Minister to take any steps to deal with the injustices in the higher education grants system.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, at a time when the views of backbenchers are more important than they have been hitherto, Deputies on the other side of the House will be able to persuade the Minister to support the Fine Gael proposals.  I should like to remind Deputies O'Donoghue and Browne that in order to remedy the injustices in the higher education grants system which mitigate against the PAYE sector and low income earners, we do not need an Education Act; we do not need any Green Paper or a White Paper.  We need just one thing, a Minister for Education who cares about students who cannot afford to go to college, a Minister who agrees with equality of opportunity and, above all, a Minister and a Government who are prepared to do something about it.</P>
    <P>We have the richest of heritages.  We have come through a complex and turbulent history to a point where Ireland <Col N="302" /> commands considerable respect on the world stage.  Countless people proudly trace their ancestry to this small island whose outreaching influence is quite out of proportion to its size.  In this Bill, Deputy Jim Higgins has encompassed the entire primary and post-primary sectors of education.  I appeal to all Members to support the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Customs and Excise Staff Levels.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important issue so quickly on the Adjournment.  The report which was issued yesterday to staff members of the Customs and Excise service is a fairly lengthy document.  I would like to refer to one or two sections of it which are the source of grave concern for me, quite a number of other Deputies and others with an interest in this matter.  The report refers to the implications of the completion of the Internal Market in 1992 on staffing levels throughout the country, particularly in the ports and Border regions in which I have a particular interest.  It indicates that it is definite that problems will arise and it identifies a number of black spots: all the land frontier zone, including Dundalk, the major airports and ferry ports, Dublin, Rosslare and Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to the report in relation to my own area, the land frontier Customs and Excise staffing area, including Dundalk, where at present 285 people are employed.  The indications are that there will be a surplus of 164 or 57 per cent &mdash; a significant percentage &mdash; in this area.  In the Dundalk area alone where 140 people are employed at present it is anticipated that there will be a surplus of 73 staff.  Needless to say the effect this would have in the Dundalk area would be horrendous.  While I am aware the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have shown good will and will try to relocate staff in the areas in which they are located, I want to impress <Col N="303" /> upon the Minister of State the need to ensure that these staff are retained in the Dundalk area.  With an unemployment level of 30 per cent we can ill-afford to lose 70 or 80 jobs.</P>
    <P>I should also make the point that many of those employed in the Customs and Excise service are middle aged, have families, mortgages, have made commitments and set down their roots and they do not want to be relocated away from their homes in the wider public service. They have made their homes in the Dundalk area and want to remain there. I ask the Minister of State to concentrate on this matter in his negotiations.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation programme would fit in very snugly into the scenario in 1992.  Dundalk is one of the areas identified.  While the programme in relation to Dundalk has been dogged with bad luck during the past few years, I am glad there have been some moves. I ask the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to ensure that negotiations take place expeditiously with the local authority and private developers in the area so that a site in Dundalk is obtained as quickly as possible and work can begin on decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I am also glad the Minister for Finance has decided to decentralise sections of the Office of Public Works and the Revenue Commissioners to Dundalk.  I hope this will provide an opportunity to take up some of the surplus staff.  I urge the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance to ensure that in the negotiations that will take place with the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs and Excise service staff that those staff who will be surplus to requirements from 1 January 1993 will be relocated in the Dundalk area.  Finally, I urge the Minister of State to look very closely and carefully &mdash; this is on the agenda of the Customs and Excise service staff &mdash; at possible new avenues at work in the Customs and Excise area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank <Col N="304" /> Deputy Ahern for raising this issue at this time.  The completion of the Internal Market in accordance with the provisions of the Single European Act and in particular the abolition of internal frontier controls, will mean considerable staffing, operational and other changes for the Customs and Excise service.  The Revenue Commissioners have now produced a report on the staffing implications for the Customs and Excise service of the planned completion of the Single European Market on 1 January 1993 and in particular, the elimination of the fiscal frontiers and border controls between member states.</P>
      <P>This report was presented by the Revenue Commissioners to staff unions representing Customs and Excise grades yesterday.  In summary it shows that a potential surplus of 584 Customs and Excise staff will arise as a consequence of the introduction of the Internal Market. This surplus figure is based on the current assessment of post-1992 staffing requirements taking account of decisions taken so far at EC and national levels.  It will be necessary, of course, to review, on a continuing basis, the assumptions made in the report in so far as those might be impacted upon by decisions outstanding in relation to the completion of the Internal Market.</P>
      <P>Within this overall outcome, it is clear the impact of the Single Market changes falls unevenly on Customs and Excise locations.  Understandably, areas with a heavy customs preventive work element such as the border areas will suffer the most.  These areas will require special attention to avoid hardship to Customs and Excise staff and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report presented yesterday the Revenue Commissioners have outlined proposals aimed at reducing the surplus figure of 584.  These proposals envisage the enhancing of existing areas of work currently undertaken by Customs and Excise staff such as the control of drugs and other illicit traffic and the control of duty-free sales to better cater for the post-1992 environment.  Also, the commissioners have put forward proposals for the involvement of Customs and <Col N="305" /> Excise staff in the new areas of work which will arise post-1992 but on which final decisions have yet to be taken. These areas would include motor vehicle taxation, trade statistics and trade in excisable products.  I have no doubt that these proposals will prove fruitful in reducing the surplus referred to.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have made it clear that it will not be possible to address the surplus staff situation solely within the Customs and Excise area. They have, therefore, put before the staff and the staff unions concerned the necessity to accept that solutions to the surplus staff situation must be sought within revenue as a whole and within the wider public and Civil Service areas. They have put forward in this context a specific proposal to absorb surplus Customs and Excise staff through access to decentralisation posts in Revenue and in the wider public and Civil Service areas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the current phase of the decentralisation programme the Revenue Commissioners are relocating about 900 staff to the Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh areas.  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that in the next phase of the decentralisation programme the Government have decided to relocate staff to Tullamore, Cork, Portlaoise, Wexford, Kilkenny, Waterford and Dundalk, areas in which staff surpluses have been identified in the 1992 context.  It is obvious therefore that the relocations to these centres provide the opportunity to absorb staff in their local communities.  There are other proposals to absorb surplus Customs and Excise staff included in the report.</P>
    <P>The Minister is considering the report produced by the Revenue Commissioners following the above review together with their proposals to provide alternative work for the surplus Customs and Excise staff within Revenue or the wider public and Civil Service context.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these proposals will demand a high degree of flexibility and co-operation on the part of the staff and the unions concerned.  I would be hopeful that this will be forthcoming. Clearly the Revenue Commissioners have put a lot of effort into designing a <Col N="306" /> strategy, the ultimate aim of which is to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, a career is provided for all Customs and Excise staff in, or close, to their present locations.  The commissioners have acknowledged and the Minister also wishes to acknowledge the service to the State made by the highly skilled and highly motivated Customs and Excise staff.  I feel that every effort must be made to ensure the continuation of this contribution and that the negotiation process now being undertaken must be given every chance, through co-operative flexibility on all sides, to ensure that this is achieved.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tralee (Kerry) Hospital Cutbacks.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this very urgent matter on the adjournment. There is serious concern in County Kerry about recent cutbacks in our health services, the further proposals to close the Clonfert ward in Tralee General Hospital on 2 December for five weeks and to turn another ward into a day ward which would, in effect, take 45 beds out of use. I should like to remind the Minister that a day ward in a county like Kerry is of little use because people have to travel such long distances and they need to stay overnight after even a minor operation. As a result no hip or ENT operations, etc., will be carried out.  As Tralee General Hospital is the only acute hospital in the county, the closure of the ward will have major repercussions for many acute patients.  A similar closure in Cork Regional Hospital would not have the same effect as there is a wide choice of hospitals offering acute facilities in that county.</P>
      <P>The fear among the staff in Tralee General Hospital is that the Clonfert ward may not reopen in January and could remain closed for the remainder of 1992.  The ward closure will put tremendous pressure on the nursing staff, they are carrying a heavy workload at the moment as 14 temporary whole-time nursing staff were laid off during October with the result that the staff are under extreme pressure, physically and mentally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> I am also very concerned about the 50 per cent cut in mileage allowances for public health nurses in the country.  This will result in a curtailment of visits to old people and a reduction of services.  This will increase the waiting lists for long stay beds in our hospitals and block acute beds because patients cannot be released from the hospital due to the lack of support services when they return home. A back-up programme of six full-time general nurses has been cut to three nurses.  Indeed, the positive progress in services for the elderly made in our county in recent years is now coming to a standstill, which is very unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to point out the problem of the non-availability of wheelchairs and their maintenance because of a dispute between the Southern Health Board and their suppliers MED AID in Cork, as a result of the failure of the health board to pay their debts to MED AID.  I am personally aware of one child who has been unable to go to school since September because his wheelchair cannot be adapted by the Southern Health Board. Over 60 people, representing the nurses and the staff of Tralee General Hospital, SIPTU, the IFA, the ICMSA and the INO, picketed the Southern Health Board meeting in Kerry yesterday.  They were vocal and very angry.  I hate saying it and I am reluctant to say it, that this is the first of the type of protest march which will be organised against what is happening in Tralee General Hospital because the consultants and the nursing staff will just not accept it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that services are retained in Tralee General Hospital even at their present level and that the old and sick people of County Kerry will be protected and provided with a proper service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, first, like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity of clarifying the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, be well aware that the provision, organisation and management of services at Tralee <Col N="308" /> General Hospital is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board. Indeed, decisions on the level of resources available to Tralee General Hospital are essentially taken by the health board, having regard to their service priorities.</P>
    <P>The board have made a decision to close 15 five-day beds at the hospital during December.  Seasonal closures are a feature of hospital services throughout the country and have been for many years.  I would point out with regard to Tralee General Hospital that seasonal closures are planned with a view to facilitating patients and staff during the summer and Christmas holiday periods. The five-day beds in question are used for planned admissions rather than emergency cases.  The board are satisfied that there will be sufficient beds available to meet the demands placed upon the hospital and that all emergency and urgent services will continue to be provided.</P>
    <P>With regard to staffing levels for the Southern Health Board, my Department have approved an employment ceiling of 6,340 whole time equivalent posts.  This reflects the creation of 266 additional posts since December 1988 arising from the expansion and enhancement of services in the Southern Health Board area. I might add that my Department's records indicate that staffing in Tralee General Hospital increased from 557 &mdash; whole time equivalents &mdash; at December 1988 to 601 at December 1990.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of staffing proposals for the filling of both new and replacement posts in all health agencies, these are reviewed on a regular basis by my Department.  This review is undertaken having particular regard to financial and employment control criteria and to the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned.  The deployment of existing staff at local level is a matter for the management of each individual agency, having regard to operational, financial and personnel constraints.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me <Col N="309" /> this further opportunity to raise this especially pressing question for so many people in the Dublin south-west and surrounding areas.  Indeed, as I listened to Deputy Deenihan making the case for adequate staffing levels at Tralee General Hospital &mdash; a case I fully support and with which I am familiar &mdash; I could not be but struck by the fact that I am speaking on behalf of a region of 250,000 people who do not have any general hospital.  In a peculiar way that puts into perspective the desperate case which has to be made once again for the Tallaght Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>It is timely that this debate should coincide with the culmination of a series of protest meetings throughout Tallaght ending tonight with a public rally in The Square demanding that the building of the hospital is allowed to go ahead.  I have dealt on previous occasions in several parliamentary questions and on two previous adjournment debates &mdash; with the history of the sorry saga of the Tallaght hospital and I do not think it is necessary to do that again.  However, I reiterate that, with the possible exception of unemployment, this issue dominates the political agenda of the 90,000 people in the greater Tallaght area and the further 150,000 people in the adjacent areas of Clondalkin, Walkinstown, Rathcoole, Newcastle, west Wicklow and north Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, attended these protest meetings with me and heard at first hand the graphic description by the people at these public meetings of the desperate need which exists for this hospital to be given the goahead and the growing fear that, if a further year's Estimates pass without provision being made for the hospital, it may well be doomed.  I am sure the Minister of State was listening this evening to Mr. Pat Griffith on radio on behalf of the Tallaght action committee setting out once again the case for this hospital.  Will the Minister of State take this opportunity to reply to Mr. Smith's plea that the Minister would meet the Tallaght action committee at the earliest possible date to discuss the future of the hospital?  There is no point in Deputy <Col N="310" /> Flood, who told the people during the 1989 general election &ldquo;that the construction of Tallaght hospital will be brought forward to 1990, saying &ldquo;that he has provided for this in the Estimates of the Department of Health which have gone to Government.  The issue is, have the Government provided for it?  Will the Government permit Tallaght hospital to get under way next year?  If this Government at the drop of a hat could find £10 million to buy the Dr. Michael Smurfit Business School, surely they can find a lesser sum to enable the Tallaght hospital to be built.  I note that in tonight's <i>Evening Press</i> the secretary of the hospital, Mr. Des Rogan, is quoted as saying that the amount of funding needed to start the project is &ldquo;not very high&rdquo;: I understand he is talking about a figure of between £5 million and £6 million, which would allow the hospital to get under way by early summer.  That figure is almost the same as those people involved in the Johnson, Mooney and O'Brien site transaction managed to avoid paying taxes due to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister to explain how the proposed reorganisation of the Eastern Health Board can proceed if the Tallaght hospital is not built.  It is my understanding that the Tallaght hospital is central to the proposed restructuring of the Eastern Health Board.  How can the reorganisation which envisages a district health board linked to a general hospital in the south-west area take place when we do not have the general hospital?  To include the Tallaght regional hospital in the Estimates or to fail to do so is a political decision which, if it were made in the positive sense, would be a tremendous boost to the area, it would mean the provision of a desperately needed facility and would enhance employment prospects not only at construction stage but after the hospital is commissioned.  I plead with the Minister tonight to indicate that work will commence in 1992.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that the Deputy has once again afforded me an opportunity to explain the position in relation to the construction of the new <Col N="311" /> hospital at Tallaght.  As the Deputy is aware, the original plan for the development of hospital services in Dublin provided for six major hospitals, three on the north side, Beaumont hospital, the Mater hospital and Blanchardstown hospital, and three on the south side, St. James's hospital, St. Vincent's hospital and the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>With the recent opening of the new Mater Hospital and the commissioning of St. James's hospital later this year, Tallaght will be the only part of the plan still to be put in place.  I wish to reiterate that I am fully committed to this project.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I should perhaps remind the Deputy that it was on the invitation of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, that the three hospitals involved in the move to Tallaght &mdash; the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospital &mdash; came together to agree the management structure for the new hospital.  We look forward to receiving the group's report as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the fact that the Tallaght hospital project, costing an estimated £118 million, will be the biggest health project ever undertaken in this country.  I have previously informed the Deputy that the construction period involved is about four years, following which a further period of about 18 months would be required for commissioning.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has already indicated to the House, a series of meetings have been held in the greater Tallaght area &mdash; indeed, one is being held tonight which we both hope to attend.  I assure the Deputy that I have conveyed in the fullest and frankest way the views expressed by those who attended those meetings and the difficulties they put forward with regard to how they perceive the lack of a hospital will impinge upon their ability to obtain an adequate health service in the greater Tallaght area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office in the Department of Health, I have set out very clearly that Tallaght, because of its population and social structure, needs a hospital and that it should be provided at the earliest possible opportunity.  My regret is, of course, <Col N="312" /> that the hospital was not provided much sooner.  That matter has already been discussed in this House, as the Deputy has pointed out, and it is now a matter of history.  I am in a position to tell the Deputy that, as he has referred to a radio programme this afternoon and a call by Mr. Griffith to meet with the Minister, I will be informing the action group of a scheduled meeting with my colleague, the Minister for Health, at a time that will suit the committee.</P>
    <P>In relation to the commencement work on his project, the capital allocation available to my Department for 1991 does not allow for the commencement of the Tallaght project in 1991.  However, as I have indicated on several occasions previously, together with the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon I will be considering the development of the Tallaght hospital project in the context of the capital resources available to the Department in 1991 and subsequent years.</P>

I propose to call on the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Michael Finucane, Deputy Ted Nealon and Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of the delay in paying farm improvement grants and farm development grants in Cavan.  I understand from the Department's office in Cavan that the delay is due to the following factors. During the summer period farmers carry out the work and there is probably an excessive number of applications awaiting payment at this time of the year. The office in Cavan naturally have to structure their finances according to the sum allowed them by the Department. In other years a Supplementary Estimate was possibly pushed through before Christmas in order to expedite payments. <Col N="313" /> I understand the payment period is from three to six months at present.</P>
      <P>Farmers have to wait an excessive period to have their work inspected at local level, getting the application processed and cleared and getting payment from the Department in Cavan, and most of them can ill afford it.  They make their commitments to projects of that nature and because of the delicate cash flow position, many of them are increasingly frustrated with the excessive delay.  As a public representative I am frequently approached by these people to see if there is any way of expediting payment. I understand from the office in Cavan that they are equally frustrated because they can only pay the grants as the finance is made available to them.  I would very much appreciate if the Minister would do something to expedite the payments to ensure that farmers are reasonably happy with the level of service provided by the Department.</P>

      <P>The sum of £45.6 million which has been provided under Subhead L1 to pay grant aid to farmers for on-farm investments during 1991 is among the highest ever allocated for that purpose.  However, the level of up-take under the various schemes has been so high that the funds are coming under severe pressure.  To date £43 million has been spent leaving a balance of £2.6 million for the remainder of the year.  This will not be adequate to meet demand.  As a result it is likely that there will be a carry-over of £5 million to next year.</P>
      <P>Claims are processed strictly in order of receipt and, therefore, the period between receipt of a particular claim and its payment is affected by the overall volume of claims to be processed at the time in question and the position in regard to budgetary resources.  Having regard to the level of claims currently on hands and the limited funds available, it may be up to two months before some of these grants can be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost all areas of agriculture are in crisis of some sort but for the store and weanling producers the <Col N="314" /> crisis is major and it is immediate.  Many of these producers are in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, many are in Mayo and Roscommon, indeed they are all over the west, following a traditional pattern of farming.  These farmers are now, in their own words, in extreme financial hardship and that is no wonder, considering the fall in prices over the past two years. Weanling prices have fallen by £120 a head since 1989 while single suckler producers face a drop of £75 a head on average this year.  Store prices, of paramount importance in my area, have fallen on average by £70 to £80 a head since 1989, but costs are rising all the time. Producers' income for weanlings and store cattle have been cut by half over the past two years, leaving them now in their worst crisis since the seventies.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is familiar with these figures but it is important to acquaint the House of what is happening behind the farm gate to these producers. Imagine the position one would find oneself in if any powerful grouping of wage or salary earners had their incomes cut by half in two years.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem for these producers is the lack of access to traditional markets. In this respect I was glad to hear the Minister talk today of the possible opening up of the Libyan market, which could absorb 150,000 head of live animals. This kind of development would immediately lift prices.  Will the Minister say just how confident he is of the revival of the Libyan market and when he thinks it may happen?  Are there any plans for Ministers to visit the area?  What is the position as regards the resumption of the cattle trade to Iran?  Have we satisfied these countries on BSE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever happens, however, it will not remove the financial crisis of many of these small producers.  He will have to take remedial action himself.  The farming organisations seek an annoucement regarding payment of increased headage premiums, up to £80 per livestock unit, and the speeding up of all premium and headage payments.  I know the problems, but the Minister should ask that the Department of Agriculture and Food <Col N="315" /> make a supreme effort to have all headage payments out for Christmas.  There should also be a substantial heifer premium and an increase in the suckler cow premium in view of the crisis.</P>
    <P>Also, I ask the Minister of State, I know he has an interest in this matter, to seek the co-operation of his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that farm incomes for social welfare purposes are based on the present prices and not on historical incomes from the good times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the store trade itself is concerned, prices for forward stores are holding at levels similar to last year.  This is a reflection of the stability resulting from the revision to the arrangements for processors' margins for intervention beef which the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, negotiated last August.  There is obviously a wide variation in prices depending on quality, with the good quality stores doing better.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that store heifers and weanlings are making somewhat lower prices than last year.  In this context I was pleased to support the recent Commission proposal to increase the suckler cow premium this year by up to 20 ECU, £17.58.  I am satisfied that this move will improve confidence and provide important income support for producers in the current year.</P>
      <P>On the question of developing new markets or reviving markets that have not been buoyant in recent times, let me say that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is always keeping an eye on the potential in this regard and the necessary initiatives will be taken.</P>

      <P>Under the conditions laid down in Commission Regulation 2944/91, measures will be taken in Ireland for the provision and installation, upgrading and testing of all on-farm milk-holding facilities and milking equipment; <Col N="316" /> also for the setting up of milk collection centres, if necessary with refrigeration facilities, and advice to individual milk producers directed in particular towards obtaining milk and its treatment.  There will be advice on the collection and transport of raw milk.  Finally, there will be measures for the improvement of water on farms.  Work undertaken in relation to the measures referred to by me will be eligible for grant assistance only if the work had begun after 17 June 1991.</P>
      <P>A large number of farmers was forced to go ahead and improve standards before 17 June 1991.  As a result they invested large amounts of money on refrigeration equipment and in some cases they have had to borrow from the bank to do this.  For example, a portable refrigerated tank to service a farmer with a 15,000 gallon output would cost in the region of £4,000.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to make a special case to the Commission, if possible, to have the grants for refrigeration equipment made retrospective to 1 January 1990.</P>

      <P>As part of the 1991-92 prices package, a sum of £4.3 million was secured by Ireland to fund measures for the improvement of Irish milk quality standards to bring them into line with the proposed EC standard on milk quality. It was agreed that these measures would be financed from the savings accruing to the EAGGF budget as a result of the elimination of the higher intervention buying in price for butter purchased in Ireland.  As the higher buying in price was eliminated with effect from 17 June 1991, the EC Commission provided in the rules governing milk quality improvements that only measures begun after that date will be eligible for financing.  It will therefore, not be possible to provide grants in respect of work carried out prior to that date.</P>

    <P>I understand that the operator concerned commissioned an independent study of the levels of radio frequency radiation which would be emitted from the installation in question.  The study has shown that even when making very pessimistic assumptions, the maximum level of exposure of humans is over 100 times lower than the levels considered safe by the IRPA.  I understand that the study has been made available to Cork County Council.  Planning permission for the tower was given by the county council and an appeal to An Bord Pleanála against the permission was rejected.</P>

      <P>Under the Radio and Television Act, 1988 the establishment of a national independent television service, selection of contractor, commencement of transmission, etc. is entirely a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission. The Deputy will be aware that the IRTC made a conditional offer of the franchise for the independent television service to the consortium known as TV3 in April, 1989 and that the IRTC have recently decided to withdraw their offer.</P>
      <P>Leave to seek a judicial review of that decision has now been granted and therefore I will make no further comment on the matter.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte are the lead agency for the marketing and promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination in overseas markets, including the United States.  There are also a whole range of organisations and companies, both in the public and private sectors, who promote Ireland in overseas markets including international carriers, tour operators, hotel chains, accommodation providers, specialist operators, etc.</P>
      <P>I am generally satisfied with the efforts being made to promote Irish tourism in the United States but there is more to be done.  This is a very competitive market and I am naturally concerned that the growth in United States tourist numbers to Ireland in recent years had been lower than in our other main markets.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, 1991 has been a particularly difficult year for the tourist industry because of the Gulf War and the economic recession in our two main markets, Britain and the United States. In view of these difficulties, I succeeded in securing this year for the industry additional marketing funds from the European Regional Development Fund, at a preferential intervention rate of 75 per cent, which enabled a special £1.25 million promotional campaign to be conducted in the United States.  Present indications are that the outturn for this year will be considerably better than originally forecast and I am hopeful of a resumption in growth next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>I have not yet received the report to which Deputy Owen is referring.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I understand that Eolas will not be in a position to finalise their report in the matter until such time as they have received and considered the views of the St. Margaret's Community Council on this issue.</P>
      <P>There is already legislation to control noise emission from aircraft.  This includes the Air Navigation (Noise Certification and Limitation) Order, 1984 (S.I. No. 13 of 1984); the European Communities (Restriction of Aeroplane Operations) Regulations, 1984 (S.I. No. 14 of 1984); the European Communities (Registration of Aeroplanes) Regulations, 1984 (S.I. No. 16 of 1984) and the European Communities (Restriction of Aeroplane Operations) Regulations, 1990 (S.I. No. 235 of 1990).</P>
      <P>The legislation is aimed at limiting and reducing noise pollution at airports within the State and is in accordance with EC and international requirements.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, a further EC Directive on limiting the operation of noisy aircraft is expected to be passed shortly by the EC Council and will be implemented by Ireland.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to aplications for career breaks and job sharing is set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The job sharing and career break schemes are operated in accordance with set guidelines laid down by Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I should explain that, in accordance with the guidelines, job sharing applications were not granted where the posts involved were not considered suitable for job sharing or where no partner was available to job-share with the applicant. Similarly, applications for career breaks were not granted where staffing requirements and/or the specialist nature of the work made it impossible to release the applicant.  In addition, applications in respect of career breaks were not granted in the case of staff members who had not completed their probationary period.</P>
      <P>However, I should say that my Department endeavours to operate both schemes in as flexible a manner as possible in order to facilitate the legitimate needs of staff.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Provisions in relation to actual or potential conflicts of interest for members of the boards of all of these bodies are enshrined in either legislation, memoranda and articles of association or both.  These provisions require that a board member declare his or her interest and abstain from any voting or decision in matters where there might be a conflict of interest.  Furthermore, the declaration must be recorded in the minutes of the <Col N="69" /> meetings.  If the Deputy so wishes, I can make available to him copies of the relevant legislative provisions and extracts from the relevant memoranda and articles of association.</P>
    <P>The question of a code of conduct for staff in relation to actual or potential conflict of interest is entirely a matter for the boards of these bodies.  I understand, however, that procedures are either in place in each body, or are being put in place, which either; require staff to declare any external activities which may give rise to a conflict of interest; or prohibit staff from engaging in such activities.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact, however, that these procedures fall within the area of day to day administration of each of the bodies concerned, it would not be appropriate for me to make them available to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I understand that a report has recently been completed by the secretary of the Department of Finance concerning the principles which govern the relationship between Departments of State and State bodies under their aegis, together with subsidiary and associated companies, which takes account of the procedures in place at present.  I also understand that the Minister for Finance is considering this report at present.</P>

    <P>The contribution of sports tourism to overall performance has also been recognised in the EC-assisted operational programme for tourism in which some £41 million is earmarked for grant aiding public and private sector investment in sporting facilities.

    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> This Regulation, which is likely to be adopted soon, proposes that: (1) every trader liable to account for VAT will show on his VAT return the values of his total imports from and total exports to other member states.  This will provide figures for the total value of Ireland's imports from and exports to other member states; (2) Additional detail &mdash; including commodity code, partner country and some transport detail &mdash; will be collected by a monthly statistical inquiry to those larger traders who are responsible for about 95 per cent of such imports and exports.</P>
    <P>Statistics of trade with countries other than EC member states will continue to be collected from the customs documentation which will, of course, continue to be available for such trade.</P>

      <P>Aerial surveillance at sea is provided by the Air Corps with the new Casa aircraft. Seven Air Corps personnel are involved.  The involvement of the Casa aircraft in fisheries surveillance has contributed significantly to the overall effectiveness of the national surveillance effort this year.</P>

      <P>The depth of awareness and the sympathy that exists in Ireland for the plight of the Cambodian people is something of which I am particularly conscious.  Many people have followed with sustained, genuine interest the protracted and very complex negotiations which led to the signing of the UN peace plan in Paris on 23 October 1991 on a comprehensive political settlement for Cambodia.  Since the beginning of October alone, my Department have received upwards of 80 communications from concerned members of the public, including telephone calls and letters, expressing the hope that the UN plan, in its final form, would indeed provide a just and lasting settlement of the conflict and ensure that a return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge would effectively be excluded.</P>

    <P>I have welcomed the UN plan as I believe it to be the best guarantee of a secure and stable future for the people of Cambodia, based on democratic institutions and respect for human rights. There is no denying that it presents the <Col N="75" /> United Nations and, by extension, the international community, with a challenge of considerable proportions.  But it is a task which the international community is ready to assume, fully conscious of its responsibility to ensure a secure and stable future for the Cambodian people.</P>
    <P>The position of the Khmer Rouge, and most particularly of their principal leaders Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Ta Mok, still raises a number of questions in people's minds.  Concerns have been expressed to me that any involvement by the Khmer Rouge is inconsistent with the objective of the UN peace plan to ensure that there should be no return to the barbarous policies and practices under Pol Pot.  I understand these concerns, but believe that the UN peace plan offers sufficient guarantees.  To have excluded any one of the parties would have undermined the prospect of a comprehensive political settlement and compromised any settlement reached.  This was recognised by the Cambodian parties themselves.</P>
    <P>The settlement is founded on a desire for national reconciliation and central to it is the right of the Cambodian people to determine their own political future through free, fair and internationally-supervised elections.  All political parties and candidates will be required to meet established criteria in order to qualify for participation in the elections.  It will also be a requirement that party platforms be consistent with the principles and objectives of the settlement.</P>
    <P>I keep in close touch with developments in Cambodia and I receive regular reports from various sources including our partners in the Twelve, the United Nations, Non-Governmental Organisations and other Foreign Ministries.  I consider that I have sufficient information to allow me to formulate Irish policy on the issues involved and that therefore a fact-finding mission would not be warranted at this time.  However, as I have pointed out in the past, I do not exclude the possibility of such a mission.</P>
    <P>The UN plan stipulates that Cambodian refugees and displaced persons <Col N="76" /> shall have the right to return to Cambodia and to live in safety, security and dignity, free from intimidation or coercion of any kind.  So that they may return in safety, there is clearly an urgent need to remove the vast numbers of mines from repatriation routes, reception centres and resettlement areas.  A UN Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC) will be put in place shortly.  This mission, consisting of both military and civilian personnel, will prepare for the more substantial UN operation under the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).  One of the responsibilities of UNAMIC will be to begin a mine-awareness programme. Once UNTAC becomes operational, it will take over this work. UNTAC will also be responsible for training programmes in mine clearance and organising teams for this purpose.  It will be assisted in this work by the factions in Cambodia, who have agreed to supply detailed records of their mine fields and to make mine-clearing teams available.</P>
    <P>Refugees and displaced persons also have the right to return free from intimidation or coercion.  This is a right of the utmost importance which the parties solemnly undertook to observe by signing the UN plan.  In welcoming its signature in Paris on 23 October, I specifically urged all parties to ahere strictly to the terms of the settlement and to assist fully the United Nations, and its relevant specialised agencies, in implementing the settlement.  I said this against a background of disturbing reports at the time of unilateral plans forcibly to repatriate refugees in certain border areas.  Swift and effective action was taken by the UN Secretary-General and others to recall to the parties their obligations in this regard.  It will be necessary for all of us in the international community to remain vigilant to ensure that the terms of the settlement regarding the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons are strictly adhered to.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always taken a positive stance on aid for the reconstruction and development of Cambodia.  With the <Col N="77" /> achievement of the comprehensive political settlement, we are examining with our partners how we might best respond to the immediate needs of the Cambodian people and prepare for the medium &mdash; and long term &mdash; reconstruction of the country.</P>

      <P>Ireland together with its partners in the European Community is greatly concerned at the military coup which has taken place in Haiti against the country's first democratically elected President.  Ireland joined its Community partners in a statement on 3 October unreservedly condemning the coup. Together with its EC partners Ireland subsequently co-sponsored a resolution, adopted by consensus at the United Nations General Assembly on 11 October, which demands the immediate restoration of the legitimate Government of President Aristide, together with the full application of the national Constitution. Pending that restoration, the European Community and its member states have suspended their economic assistance to Haiti.</P>
      <P>At present, Ireland together with its Community partners is examining further measures which might help to bring about the reinstatement of the legitimate authorities in Haiti.  We are also following closely the discussions which are currently taking place to that end between representatives of the Organisation of American States and the coup leaders. Decisions in regard to further measures will be taken in the light of the outcome of these developments.</P>

There is no requirement that individuals in category (iii) be attending third level education.

However, it is broadly estimated that the cost of providing income tax relief, on an <Col N="80" /> amount equivalent to the average grant paid under the higher education grants scheme, in respect of those students attending recognised Higher Education Authority colleges who are not in receipt of a higher education grant, would be of the order of £25 million in a full year.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly whereby the Revenue Commissioners have instructed local authorities to deduct full A. 1 PRSI of 7.75 per cent from temporary fire brigade personnel which is an increase from the J. 1 rate of 2.25 per cent and as these members in full-time employment are already paying full PRSI at 7.75 per cent they will receive no extra benefit from these additional deductions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, this year's budget provided for the extension of social insurance to part-time workers.  Part-time workers earning £25 per week or more are now covered by the social insurance system.  As a result, up to 27,000 part-time workers will become entitled to the full range of social insurances benefits, including disability, unemployment benefit and pensions.</P>
      <P>Another effect of these new arrangements is the removal of an anomaly whereby some people had full social insurance benefits while paying lower contributions than others on similar incomes.  Formerly, when PRSI was not charged on part-time earnings, a situation could arise where an employee with a main source of income of, say, £11,000, plus £3,000 from a part-time job, paid £605 in social insurance, while an individual with the same total income from one job paid £770 for the same benefits.  The new arrangements are more consistent with the principles that people with equal incomes and equal benefit entitlements should pay equal contibutions.</P>
      <P>It also means that earnings from both sources of insurable employment are aggregated when calculating pay-related benefit and can thus operate to increase the level of that benefit.</P>

      <P>The Government have again approved the payment of a Christmas bonus this year of 70 per cent of normal weekly payments.  The cost of the bonus this year is £28 million, an increase of £2.4 million on last year.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid to pensioners and other people receiving long term social wlefare and health payments including the elderly, widows, lone parents and the long term unemployed.  It will also be paid to those in receipt of the new carer's allowance.  In all, almost one million people will benefit i.e. 620,000 recipients and their 360,000 dependents.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus was introduced originally in 1980 for elderly and other pensioners.  It was subsequently extended to include the long term unemployed in receipt of long term unemployment assistance.  The long term sick in receipt of invalidity pension are also covered for the bonus.  Disability benefit is regarded as a short term social insurance payment and there are no proposals to extend the Christmas bonus to recipients of that benefit.</P>

      <P>My Department are committed to a strategy of improving client service, and to a more cost-effective utilisation of <Col N="109" /> resources.  An integral part of this strategy is the implementation of a new regional management structure, the creation of one-stop-shops through the localisation of the Department's services, and the introduction of modern payment methods for all social welfare claimants.</P>
      <P>The main focus at present is the introduction of new payment methods and more flexible signing arrangements for unemployed claimants at local offices.  A first step in this process is the transfer of long term unemployment assistance (LTUA) clients over the age of 55 to a book payment system.</P>
      <P>Persons transferred to this system will be given a book of personalised payable orders cashable at a nominated post office convenient to them.  In addition, most persons aged over 55 on the book payment system will only be required to sign on once every month.  The arrangements have already been implemented for clients who attend departmentally staffed offices.  It is intended to extend them as soon as possible to those attending branch employment offices which are run by branch managers who are employed under a contract for service by my Department.</P>
      <P>There are regular meetings between officials of my Department and the branch managers association which represents the managers of the branch employment offices.  Through these meetings, my Department are aware of the concerns of the association regarding the impact of the proposed changes on their workloads.  In June I met a group of branch managers to discuss their concerns. In addition, a senior official of my Department recently addressed the annual general meeting of the branch managers association and outlined the current developments under way in the Department.  Discussions in relation to these matters are continuing.</P>

He ceased signing the unemployed register on the 11 December 1990.  He re-applied for unemployment benefit on 5 September 1991.  His PRSI contributions had still not been paid and following an investigation to help confirm that contributions were payable in respect of his employment, a demand has been made for these contributions from his former employer.  When the contributions have been paid his entitlement to benefit will be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>The amnesty from prosecution, which applies to employers and employees, was introduced in March this year as part of the anti-fraud campaign being undertaken by my Department.</P>
      <P>To avail of the amnesty, employers are required to make arrangements to bring their PRSI payments up-to-date; keep proper records in relation to the earnings of employees and the duration of their employment; and co-operate fully with inspectors from the Department.</P>
      <P>The amnesty also applies to employees.  The new arrangements to visit employers as part of the anti-fraud campaign mean that the risk of exposure has been massively increased for all employees who fraudulently claim benefit particularly while working.  I felt it appropriate that employees should also be given an opportunity to get their position in order during the initial phase of the new control systems.</P>
      <P>The amnesty was introduced to give employers an opportunity to adjust to the new and ongoing control operation which is designed to stamp out the problem arising from certain employers who fail persistently to operate PRSI in a timely way.  A special emphasis has been placed on the issue of firms who fail to declare the full rate of wages in their PRSI records.  Many employers who were operating this particular form of abuse have already been identified and are being deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was intended, originally, that the amnesty would last until the end of September. It has recently been decided to <Col N="112" /> extend the deadline until the end of November. This corresponds with the progress of the investigations which are still under way.  This additional period will offer a further opportunity to employers who have not met their PRSI obligations, and for those who are wrongfully claiming social welfare payments, to come forward and put their affairs in order without fear of prosecution.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the many pressures on firms of all sizes.  The amnesty has allowed employers put their affairs in order without putting their employees' jobs at risk at the time when we are implementing extensive new control measures which will be an ongoing feature of our system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 to 94 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>A number of other questions from the Deputy relating to this particular case have been transferred to the Minister for Finance as they concern tax matters appropriate to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>As part of an ongoing campaign to detect and deter abuses of the PRSI system, the employer concerned was visited by the joint investigation unit which my Department operate in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.  Their investigation revealed that PRSI records were not up to date and arrears of PRSI were identified.  In accordance with normal practice governing confidentiality, I am not at liberty to disclose the amount involved without the consent of the person concerned.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the amount involved is not in any way substantial when viewed in the context of employers PRSI liabilities generally.</P>
      <P>Satisfactory arrangements for the clearance of the arrears have been made. The arrears are being collected by instalments with post-dated cheques being held in respect of all the outstanding balances. Accepting post-dated cheques is a normal practice.  In this case they have been honoured as they became due.  All the remaining post-dated cheques will have fallen due by July 1992.</P>
      <P>In the normal course, consideration would have been given to instituting proceedings against such an employer. However, earlier this year I announced an amnesty against prosecution for such employers who co-operated with officers of my Department and who made arrangements to clear any PRSI arrears due.  This amnesty, full details of which are given in my reply to Question No. 89, is part of a major campaign undertaken to visit up to 15,000 employers this year in an effort to stamp out abuses of the PRSI system.  This compares with some 2,400 such surveys in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Under the terms of the amnesty, the employer concerned was given the opportunity, which he availed of, to put his PRSI affairs in order and to make arrangements to clear the arrears.  If he had not done so, prosecution proceedings would have been initiated under social welfare legislation.  However, the employer concerned did co-operate within the terms of the amnesty, the issue of proceedings did not arise and the file was not referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office nor to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>There is on-going informal contact between officials of my Department and local State solicitors throughout the country about possible offences and the type of evidence that would be needed in particular cases and on other technical and procedural issues.  It is understood that informal consultations took place in this case.  However, there would have been no question of proceedings being instituted or of a summons being prepared until a case has been passed formally to the Chief State Solicitor which, as I have explained, did not arise in this case because of the amnesty.</P>
    <P>This case highlights the positive effects that the amnesty is having in the campaign to stamp out abuse of the PRSI system.  The amnesty arrangements, however, are temporary and are due to finish at the end of November 1991. Employers who are abusing the PRSI system will continue to be vigorously pursued and, where appropriate, legal proceedings will be taken using the full provisions of the social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>Allegations were made by Deputy Gilmore in Dáil Éireann on 18 October 1991 that I had intervened in the case to prevent proceedings being instituted.  I wish to categorically refute this allegation which is reprehensible and completely without foundation.  No interference took place.  Normal procedures and practices were followed in this case.  It is not the practice in my Department for cases of this nature to be submitted to me to authorise prosecution nor was it done in <Col N="115" /> this case.  Decisions to initiate prosecution are taken by certain senior officials of my Department who act under specific statutory delegated authority to do so.</P>
    <P>The allegations made by the Deputy also impugn the integrity of my officials and their actions.  I wish to state categorically that in my view they acted properly at all stages in their handling this case.  For my part I have followed a deliberate policy of not interfering in executive actions of my officials in the course of investigative work.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance, which I introduced in 1990, provided an allowance for the first time direct to people caring for elderly and incapacitated pensioners. Eligibility for the allowance was extended to a much broader range of people than were catered for under the former prescribed relative allowance scheme, including married persons living with their spouse.  In 1991 I extended the allowance to persons caring for recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate for the carer's allowance was set at the equivalent of the short term rate of unemployment assistance which was a very significant increase on the rate of prescribed relative allowance.  A person providing full-time care and attention would not normally be eligible for unemployment payments.  Where people transfer to carer's allowance from another social welfare payment there may be a loss of income depending on <Col N="116" /> the particular circumstances.  I am keeping this and other aspects of the scheme under review and any amendments which may be warranted will be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>The claim of the person concerned for unemployment assistance was disallowed on the grounds that she failed to furnish evidence that her means did not exceed the statutory limit, which in her case is £5,408 per annum.  She appealed this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.  The case was listed for oral hearing on 25 June 1991.  However, the person concerned was not available for the hearing as she was working in the Isle of Man at this time.  The appeals officer made a summary decision on her case on the basis of the evidence available and disallowed her appeal.</P>
      <P>The person concerned reactivated her claim on 7 October 1991, giving her uncle's home as her permanent residence. Her file was forwarded to the social welfare officer for reinvestigation. To date the social welfare officer has made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the person concerned at her uncle's address and at her original home address which is nearby.</P>
      <P>A further attempt will be made to contact the person concerned.  If this fails, she will be asked, in writing, to attend for interview at a time and place suggested by the social welfare officer.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I am conscious of the need for my Department to deliver a speedy and efficient service to their customers.  Since the setting up of the social welfare services office, I have implemented new procedures to bring about a continuous improvement in this service.</P>
      <P>I have introduced desk interviews for applicants to unemployment assistance on a countrywide basis, to shorten the time taken to process their claims.  As an extension of this, I have developed the decision making process on these claims to the local employment exchanges rather than having all cases referred to headquarters.  In some cases, where the customer obviously has no means, there is no referral to the social welfare officer for investigation.  In addition, I am extending the computer network throughout the country to help local officials to make more speedy decisions on entitlements.  In the last few weeks I have appointed regional managers to put new structures in place including a localised service and to extend the one-stop-shop concept which I introduced some years ago.</P>
      <P>As a result there are now much fewer cases in which there are significant delays.  My Department's experience has been that significant delays are usually attributable to some failure on the part of the customer to provide essential information. I am not aware of any case in which the customer has been co-operative and in which there has been a delay of five months by a social welfare officer. If the Deputy is prepared to give me details of any such case, I will have immediate inquiries made in the matter.</P>

In the event of an appeal the waiting period, at present, for an appeal hearing is 24 months, approximately; and (e) The date of payment of an award is determined by the date of acceptance of the award and awards currently being paid were accepted in November 1990.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of works on non-national roads, including the provision of the necessary finance, rests with the local authorities concerned.  The discretionary grants for non-national roads provided by my Department supplement local resources for such works.</P>
      <P>Special grants are occasionally made available to local authorities for projects on non-national roads.  However, as I have attempted to maximise the extent to which grants for regional and county roads are provided on a discretionary basis, so as to give local authorities greater control over their use, the funds available for special grants are necessarily limited.  In 1991, special grants represent less than £6 million out of a total provision of £240 million for road grants.</P>
      <P>Any selection of non-national road projects for special road grants in 1992 will be made in the light of the overall level of road grant provision, the competing demands for this type of project throughout the country, and the need for compliance with the criteria for ERDF assistance under the Operational Programme on Peripherality.</P>

      <P>The storm/flood damage grants which I announced earlier this year were allocated to 18 local authorities whose areas were considered to be the most affected by the severe weather in early <Col N="127" /> January.  The grants were made towards the cost of remedial works to roads, bridges and culverts only and have been paid in full.  At no time was it intimated that the cost of snow clearance would be refunded to any local authority.  Such costs may be met, in the case of national roads from national road maintenance grants, and in the case of other roads, from the annual discretionary grant allocation. In 1991 the national road maintenance grant allocation to Kildare County Council amounts to £684,000 and their discretionary grant amounted to £1,868,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual report on vital statistics classifies deaths under the following headings:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes 981 and 982, referring to the toxic effects of petroleum products and non-petroleum based solvents respectively, and ICD Code 304 which relates to deaths due to drug dependance which includes glue sniffing.</P>
    <P>The most recent report on vital statistics, 1988, records seven deaths in these categories.  While no separate classification is available for deaths from aerosol abuse such deaths are included in the above classifications.</P>
    <P>The likelihood is that official figures underestimate the number of deaths where the underlying cause is solvent abuse, since such deaths may be classified under different headings, e.g. cardiac arrests or respiratory causes.</P>
    <P>Section 74 of the Child Care Act 1991 makes it an offence for any person to sell, offer, or make available any substance to persons under 18 which they know or have reasonable cause to believe is likely to be inhaled for the purpose of causing intoxication.  The penalty for this offence is a fine up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment, or both.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department conducted an awareness campaign for parents, professionals and retailers pointing out the dangers associated with the misuse of many common products containing solvents.  It would be impossible to completely ban the sale of such products to young people.  However the campaign served to heighten the awareness of adults especially in retail outlets to the types of products abused so that they would keep a closer watch on the buyers of potentially abusable products.  An educational booklet on solvent abuse is available from the health promotion unit and is disseminated throughout the country through health boards, schools and other outlets and made available directly to members of the public on request.  Videos on the subject are also available free of charge from the unit.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the National <Col N="130" /> Youth Council of Ireland the health promotion unit conducted a seminar on solvent abuse in March 1991.  Invited youth leaders and health professionals working with young people examined the extent of the solvent abuse problem in Ireland. In accordance with the recommendations of this seminar resource materials are being developed which will assist those who work with young people to equip these young people with the skills necessary to avoid the abuse of solvents.</P>
    <P>Another programme for use in second level schools <i>The Substance Abuse Prevention Programme</i> has been jointly developed by the health promotion unit and the psychological service of the Department of Education.  This programme which involves whole school staffs and will be incorporated into a broad health education programme is being piloted in selected schools during the 1991-92 academic year.  It includes training for young people in such areas as assertiveness, self-esteem and decision making skills and when successfully piloted and evaluated it will become available to all second level schools.</P>
    <P>It is primarily by programmes such as the school based programme and the one being prepared for use by youth leaders and professionals who work with young people, together with vigilance on the part of retailers and most especially parents that this problem will be successfully addressed.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the problem of HIV-AIDS in Ireland is growing at an alarming rate; his views on whether it is crucial that young people be aware to the disease and how to protect themselves from it; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the AIDS Awareness Education Programme in schools was not evenly run and that some schools made every effort to fulfil their role in advising pupils while other schools were not as interested; and if he will outline the role which the condom has in the fight against AIDS.</Quest>

      <P>Up to 1988-89, the number of cases of AIDS was doubling in Ireland every nine months or so.  Since then there has been a slow down in the rate of increase; cases have been doubling roughly every 15 months.  This is in line with the epidemiology of the disease elsewhere. There were 216 cases of AIDS on 31 October this year as against 179 on 31 December 1990, New cases of HIV are growing at a rate of ten cases per month. A total of 1,133 persons have tested positive for the HIV infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's strategy for tackling this problem is a co-ordinated one and includes monitoring, education/ prevention, treatment and care of patients and research into the condition.  The dissemination of good information and the <Col N="132" /> provision of good education is considered to be of vital importance in controlling the spread of the condition.</P>
    <P>My Department in conjunction with the Department of Education, have striven to ensure that all young people, by the time they leave second level schools, are aware of the threat that HIV and AIDS poses to their health.  This has resulted in the provision of comprehensive resource materials accompanied by in-service training for teachers.</P>
    <P>The AIDS resource materials, jointly developed by the Departments of Health and Education, were distributed to all second level schools and vocational training centres such as FÁS centres in September/October 1990.</P>
    <P>In addition to being supplied with resource materials two teachers from every second-level school in the country will have had the opportunity, by early 1992, to participate in in-service training seminars which address any queries which teachers might have regarding the materials.</P>
    <P>To date 22 such seminars have taken place at centres all over the country.  Seminars are facilitated by the Department of Health, Department of Education and health board personnel.</P>
    <P>The AIDS resource materials may be adapted or used in conjunction with other programmes which may already be available.</P>
    <P>A national evaluation of the programme will be undertaken in early 1992 when all schools have had the opportunity to avail of the in-service accompanying the materials.</P>
    <P>However, evaluation forms distributed to teachers during the in-service seminars indicate overwhelming levels of satisfaction both with the quality of the materials provided and with the quality of the in-service seminar itself.  Furthermore, during seminars teachers generally indicate a willingness to tackle the HIV/AIDS issue in their schools, as a matter of urgency, if they do not already have a programme in place.</P>
    <P>The resource materials have been welcomed by schools and are considered to <Col N="133" /> be comprehensive, appropriate and very easy to use.</P>
    <P>The role of the condom in any campaign against the spread of HIV/AIDS is clearly spelled out in both the AIDS education resource materials and in the health promotion unit's booklet &ldquo;AIDS &mdash; the Facts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For sexually active people who are not in a &ldquo;one faithful partner&rdquo; relationship a good quality new condom, correctly used, is the single most effective defence against HIV infection, but condoms may be faulty and/or fail during use and therefore do not eliminate the risk.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the GMS payments board wrote to general practitioners in August setting a budget for drugs for the period May to November; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that this has caused major difficulties for doctors who had prescribed up to or close to the budgetary limit by the time they received the letter from the GMS payments board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In the course of the 1990-91 review of the GMS contract it was agreed, between the Irish Medical Organisation and management that, as part of a co-ordinated drugs costs strategy, indicative prescribing targets would be determined for all doctors in the GMS scheme.  It was further agreed that these budgets would be based on the best information available and that they would be refined and adjusted annually.  This process commenced with the circulation to doctors last August of targets for a six month period this year, prior to the circulation of the annual targets for 1992 which will be determined following discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arrangement which is voluntary would not cause difficulties for doctors as the target figures are indicative and will not interfere with the doctor's right to <Col N="134" /> prescribe as he or she considers necessary. Indicative drug targets will facilitate general practitioners in objectively assessing their overall prescribing levels with comparable practices.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board provides geriatric and psycho-geriatric subvented beds for patients in private nursing homes under two arrangements: under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 the Eastern Health Board pays a fixed subvention for patients in private nursing homes which are approved under the Act; and under section 26 of the 1970 Act it uses beds in private nursing homes under a contractual arrangement in respect of patients who are entitled to health board nursing accommodation but for whom there are insufficient places in health board homes.</P>
      <P>The equivalent number of full-time beds in private nursing homes subvented by the Eastern Health Board under both arrangements for the years in question is as follows:</P>

    <P>In relation to research the Health Research Board provided a total of £237,000 over a period of five years for a female fertility research unit in University College Galway in respect of a project &mdash; completion date 31/12/90.  The objectives of the project were (a) to develop rapid, cost effective, non-isotopic methods for measuring reproductive steroid hormones in saliva and (b) to evaluate the clinical applications of those assays in natural family planning, the management of female infertility, the return of post-partum fertility, habitual abortion and in postmenopausal women undergoing hormone replacement therapy. The final report of the project is expected to be published next month and I will arrange to let the Deputy have a copy of this report.  In the meantime, I am sending him a copy of the annual report of the HRB for 1990 in which the main achievements of the study are summarised.</P>

My Department are in regular contact with the organisation and have had a number of discussions recently with the alliance in relation to their activities and role.

      <P>As regards the general issue of Government AIDS strategy, I am satisfied that our strategy to date is in line with all of the requirements to deal with the evolving epidemiology of the disease and I can assure the Deputy that it will be developed to ensure that the matter is addressed, comprehensively and effectively.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board, as all other health boards, receives cash from my Department on the basis of cash profiles established at the beginning of the year. These profiles are linked to the approved expenditure levels of the board and are adjusted from time to time during the year to take account of approved increases in expenditure, including pay increases, cash allowances and other service related items.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this arrangement, it is the responsibility of each health board to manage it's cash and credit in line with its operational requirements and within approved expenditure levels.  The timing of payments to suppliers of goods and services is entirely a matter for board management to decide.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Eastern Health Board is experiencing some pressure in this area.  However my Department gives every possible assistance to each agency on this issue, but always within the level of cash available, based on approved expenditure limits.</P>

      <P>This ensures that where people have expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines they will not have to pay more than £32 in any month at the pharmacy counter.  Any expenditure in excess of this amount is claimed by the pharmacist from the GMS payments board.</P>

In this regard I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to Questions Nos. 9 and 217 on Wednesday, <Col N="150" /> 30 October 1991, when I provided information on the steps being taken.</P>
      <P>There is regular and constant contact with schools, via the in-service programme outlined in my reply of 30 October, on the use of the AIDS education resource materials which have been developed.  The feedback is that schools are making every effort to provide AIDS education for their pupils with the help of the in-service and the resource materials. The programme of in-service and the use of materials is kept under regular review and it is planned to have a more detailed review when the current phase of the programme is completed in early 1992.</P>

      <P>An inter-Departmental transport accessibility committee, chaired by the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, have been in operation for some years.  The task of this committee is to identify and provide advice as to the appropriate measures to improve accessibility for the disabled to all modes of public transport. The work of this committee is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In the particular case of school transport for handicapped children, the committee have recommended that due attention be paid to accessibility in selecting buses to operate this service.  My Department and Bus Éireann are fully committed to this objective.  The level of this commitment is reflected in the fact that over £6 million or 20 per cent approximately of the total expenditure on school transport is devoted to the provision of special services for the handicapped, notwithstanding that such children constitute only 5 per cent of the total population availing of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148, 149, 150 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to actively encourage the integration of travellers children into mainstream education and where appropriate, resources are deployed in a manner which facilitates this process.</P>
      <P>In the case of travellers' children from the south County Dublin/north Wicklow area, my Department have been concerned at the extent to which such children have been travelling out of their local areas to attend St. Kieran's school for travellers in Bray.</P>
      <P>In recent months, my Department's inspectorate have been seeking to arrange the placement of such children in their locally based national schools in an integrated setting and this process is continuing.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the ongoing staffing needs of St. Kieran's must have regard to the above development.  It is also necessary to recognise the reality that in such a school, the real level of actual attendance can be significantly and consistently below the numbers enrolled. The need to have regard to these factors, in the context of St. Kieran's School, was mentioned in comments made by an official of my Department to a journalist who inquired into the matter.</P>
      <P>However, because progress in securing greater integration of these children at local level has not been achieved as quickly as was hoped, it is now intended to allow the temporary appointment of an additional teaching assistant to St. Kieran's and the school is being so advised.</P>
      <P>The pupil/teacher ratio in the school recently has been of the order of 16.5 to 18:1.  The temporary appointment will serve to reduce this further.</P>
      <P>The ongoing needs of the school will be monitored in the context of the above developments.</P>

      <P>Following a meeting I had with parents of children of the Cherry Orchard area a wish was expressed for the provision of a new primary school specifically to serve the Cherry Orchard area.</P>
      <P>Arising from this I arranged for officials from my Department to meet the management of the existing primary schools serving the area.  I understand from this meeting that of the 1,400 primary school children in Cherry Orchard, 1,300 attend schools in Ballyfermot.  I understand that all of the schools in Ballyfermot indicated that they currently have spare capacity and would be in a position to facilitate all of the children from Cherry Orchard.</P>
      <P>There is no provision under the scheme which would allow for the introduction of a special subsidised transport arrangement for the children in question.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not yet available to <Col N="162" /> my Department for the 1991-92 academic year.  However, the relevant details for the 1990-91 academic year are set out in a table which will be circulated in the Official Report.  In the three year cases listed in the table where a breakdown of grant holders between full and partial grants is not yet available to my Department, the information is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The total cost to my Department in the financial year 1990 for this provision was £27.212 million.</P>

      <P>As is the case in other vocational education committees the allocation of teaching resources to County Longford Vocational Education Committee in respect of a particular school year is made on the basis of the Vocational Education Committee as a whole in accordance with approved pupil-teacher ratios.  It is the responsibility of the Vocational Education Committee to allocate those resources to individual schools within the scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department are providing adequate funding for authorised staffing levels in County Longford Vocational Education Committees, including Lanesboro, community college.</P>
      <P>My Department are considering an application from County Longford Vocational Education Committee for sanction to fill the posts of principal and vice-principal in Lanesboro community college on a permanent basis.  A decision on this matter will be made shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 to 166, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I wish to state yet again that in the process leading to the purchase of Carysfort College by UCD, no meetings, correspondence or contacts of any kind took place between myself or my officials and the vendors or their agents.  All such contacts were made by the UCD authorities.</P>
      <P>I had no information regarding the various owners and vendors, at that time, other than that available from media reports.</P>
      <P>At no stage was any indication given by officials of my Department, either orally or in writing, that the Department did not wish Carysfort to be retained for educational purposes.  On the contrary, in repeated letters to the Mercy Order, including the letter of 30 April 1989 referred to by the Deputy, my Department sought suitable leasing arrangements to permit the flexible use of the premises for third level educational purposes.</P>
      <P>The letter of April 1989 set out a basis for the continued use of the premises for third level educational purposes.  This was further confirmed and amplified in a letter from my Department dated 5 May 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to a parliamentary question on 12 February 1991, <Col N="165" /> any decision to purchase Carysfort and the allocation of funds for that purpose are matters solely for the Government.</P>
    <P>The allocation made in December 1990 for this purpose was additional to the ordinary grant for capital purposes made available to the Higher Education Authority in that year.  All the normal procedures in relation to the Supplementary Estimate of £9.7 million passed by the Dáil on 18 December 1990 were followed and the money was made available in the normal way to UCD through the Higher Education Authority.</P>

The main activities with which they are concerned are: the provision of Border patrols including assistance in dealing with Border incidents; assisting the Garda at permanent and temporary road checkpoints; the protection of explosive materials used for industrial purposes; guarding of installations of vital national importance; the provision of bomb disposal teams; escorting and guarding prisoners; the provision of escorts for the protection of movements of cash; aerial support for operations in aid of the civil power, including aerial surveillance of the Border area; and maintenance of constant stand-to parties for the purpose of rendering <Col N="184" /> assistance to the Garda where this may be required (e.g. marches and demonstrations).</P>
      <P>Requests for aid to the civil power are normally made by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector.</P>
      <P>For reasons of security it is not the practice to disclose details of the number of such operations.</P>

      <P>Because of the illegal nature of pirate radio stations we are not always aware of their establishment or changes in name. My Department believes that there are three pirate radio stations in Donegal, three in Monaghan and two in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The situation 12 months ago would have been similar except that a station in Kerry was closed and a pirate station in Dublin started up.  All illegal operators are liable to have action taken against them at any time.  Prosecutions are pending against five persons in Donegal and one in Dublin.</P>

    <P>*Mr. G. T. P. Conlon (CIE) and Mr. M. Dully (BFE) operate as full-time executive chairmen of the bodies concerned.  Separate fees are paid to them as members of the boards.</P>
    <P>&dagger;The normal fee for the chairman of An Post is £2,400.  However, as an exceptional measure sanction was given to An Post in July, 1991 for the payment of a gratuity of £7,600 to the current chairman of An Post for year ending 15 February 1991 bringing the total fee for that year to £10,000 and for a total fee of £25,000 for one year ending 1 May, 1992, when the matter will be reviewed. The sanction took account of the major executive input of the chairman in relation to the reorganisation of An Post.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer subvention to Córas lompair Éireann in 1991 in respect of essential public services will amount to £108 million of which over 80 per cent is in respect of expenditure on railway services.  This represents a very substantial level of State financial support for the railway.  In addition, the Public Capital Programme for 1991 provides for capital expenditure by CIE of £36.2 million of which £10.3 million has been allocated for expenditure on railway signalling, track replacement, rolling stock and other railway-related infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The allocation of resources to individual expenditure programmes, including the maintenance and development of the railway, is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the board of CIE.</P>
