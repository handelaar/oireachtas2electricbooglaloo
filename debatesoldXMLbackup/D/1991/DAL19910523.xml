      <P>I would like to raise two matters.  First, may I suggest that when a short sitting is arranged for a Friday that we sit through late on Thursday evening <Col N="2214" /> as it is quite ludicrous that the House should adjourn at 4.30 p.m. this evening and come back tomorrow morning?  That suggestion may be worth considering in the future.  Just like the Taoiseach, many people have appointments on Fridays in other parts of the country and most of us do not have helicopters at our disposal.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he has had an opportunity to consider item No. 8 on the Order Paper since we raised the matter on the Order of Business yesterday?  Would he outline to the House when that committee will be formed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be seen to be persistent in this matter but it is a matter of concern.  Yesterday during the course of the debate on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill there was an extensive discussion on the provisions dealing with the Temple Bar project when the Minister for Finance did not find himself in a position to outline the way in which the company would operate.  The Taoiseach has given an undertaking to respond as <Col N="2215" /> quickly as possible and outline the details of the legislation.  This is the Government's flagship project for the European City of Culture year.  They have already been given access to property and money. I ask the Taoiseach to tell us when the details of this legislation will be outlined. Will we see it before the end of the session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it will be before the end of the session.  There is nothing spectacular about it; it is routine legislation to set up these companies and give them their powers.  The powers in the Finance Bill are far more important than the details of the other Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I will come back to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Quinn.  It is important that those Bills be considered together as without the instrument with which they will be applied the tax concessions cannot be considered in the proper context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach to indicate what progress has been made to date in preparing the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill which has been promised for this session?  In view of the fact that we are running out of time can he indicate when it will be circulated and published?</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach come to any conclusion on when the House should go into recess for the summer?  I understand that there are at least five more Bills dealing with the environment which have been promised for this session.  Would the Taoiseach <Col N="2216" /> state therefore if the Housing Bill, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the new dogs control Bill and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill will be taken this session or are we going to sit right through the summer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte. Amendment No. 2 is an alternative.  I am proposing therefore that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 be discussed together.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;Section 6 of the Finance Act, <Col N="2217" /> 1987 and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989 shall not have effect in relation to the year 1991-1992 and subsequent years of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Given that interest rates continue to be very high, the amendment seeks to acknowledge that many home owners are finding it difficult to meet their mortgage repayments and that we are living in a climate where homes are being repossessed both by the conventional building societies and financial institutions as well as by the Housing Finance Agency through the local authorities.  The amendment seeks to acknowledge also that the people who pay the lion's share of taxation in the form of PAYE are the same people most affected by interest rates remaining high.  Accordingly, I urge the Minister to restore 100 per cent mortgage relief for those affected in this manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may refer to his amendment but we have alread a motion before us in respect of amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, a Cheann Comhairle.  We had a very adequate debate on this matter on Committee Stage on Tuesday.  I am disappointed that the Minister will not accept this amendment.  However, I must make the point that it is absurd and ridiculous that there was not a decent interval between Committee and Report Stages.  Surely the whole purpose of the way this House works is that a reasonable period is allowed &mdash; I suggest at least a week &mdash; between the end of a Committee Stage debate and the beginning of Report Stage.  The purpose of the way we do business is to give the Minister an opportunity to give mature consideration to the amendments put forward by the Opposition. The Opposition put forward many amendments, and with the greatest respect to the Minister who is not a superman, there was no possible way he could <Col N="2218" /> have assimilated the arguments put forward in the debate over the past two days.  This is just another very bad facet of the way this House works.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need repeat the arguments I put forward on Tuesday in support of my amendment.  People on relatively low fixed incomes, and small business people, are very much disadvantaged and, even at this late stage, the Minister should consider these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are hearing a repeat of the points raised on Committee Stage. I appreciate that the Minister, and his officials, have had little time to consider these matters.  Will the Minister, in response, to this amendment which he is clearly going to reject, outline the Government's thinking on mortgage interest relief having regard to two factors?  First, every taxation report published, particularly the report of the Commission on Taxation, recommended the elimination in a phased orderly manner of all tax allowances, and in particular mortgage interest relief.  The second factor is that the OECD recently recommended that we should have some kind of property tax having regard to the present imbalance in our tax base, which will be further squeezed during the process of harmonisation in 1992.  I am positive the Minister must be getting advice from officials in his Department that he is going too slow in reducing this tax allowance because the cost is quite substantial. The figures the Minister gave yesterday were substantial and it would be no harm if he repeated them in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument is being made for those people who are experiencing problems with their mortgage repayments and those who are having difficulties getting into the housing market in the first place. I do not think that a blanket income tax relief for mortgage holders is the way to deal with the problem, having regard to our overall fiscal problems.  I am sure every Member agrees that there is a fixed amount of money we can take from the economy in taxation.  In fact, the amount <Col N="2219" /> of money we take in taxation is, broadly speaking, within the mid-European average, approximately 43 per cent of GDP. However, for a variety of reasons our tax base is very badly skewed, partly by design and partly by legal interpretation &mdash; for example, the High Court's judgment on agricultural rates which was an enormous windfall for farmers who have a very vocal array of advocates as we saw late last night.  They fail to recognise that since that High Court decision they have been paying no rates and yet they benefit immensely from local government services.</P>
    <P>We have a whole raft of amendments on PAYE and income tax allowances which I support.  In all honesty we cannot have it both ways.  That the tax base be broadened, that the tax take should remain relatively constant and the economy should grow are the basic objectives shared by everybody in the political environment.  That is the considered view of an array of economists, irrespective of their ideological disposition or personal prejudice.  For these reasons it would be no harm if the Minister outlined his thinking on this.  People trying to get on the housing train for the first time need specific help.  What has happened is that the value of any help, other than the grant to first time house buyers has been eroded. If memory serves me correctly, the new house grant for first time buyers is £2,000 while the average cost of a house in the Dublin region &mdash; as per the figures published in the past week or so, and I am speaking from memory &mdash; is £67,000. When house prices were of the order of £10,000 the grant was of the order of £500 to £1,000.  The help for first time house buyers has been dramatically reduced.</P>
    <P>I benefit from the mortgage interest relief, as indeed do people who have a mortgage.  I am not suggesting that we should disrupt mortgage interest relief in an unconstructive way.  We should not be giving a broad-based subsidy to people, many of whom are trading up through three or four houses, without recognising that it is getting increasingly more difficult for people to get into the housing <Col N="2220" /> market for the first time.  I would like to hear the Minister's considered response, if he is in a position to give it, to those points.  Will he restate for the record the total cost to the Exchequer of mortgage interest relief?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  A similar amendment was tabled in my name on Committee Stage and was disposed of.  I am glad Deputy Rabbitte has re-entered his amendment so that we can have a second chance to express our views.  This is a very important matter.  Interest rates are high and it looks as if they will remain high.  We spoke about them yesterday and the views expressed by this side of the House were confirmed by an EC Commissioner who said in a newspaper report that it was very unlikely that interest rates in Europe will come down for the remainder of the year.  He said there might be a reduction here and there for a limited period but that the average interest rate is likely to stay very high.</P>
      <P>The second reason I would like the Minister to give this amendment serious consideration is that not only are interest rates high but the Minister's actions in this Finance Bill and in last year's Finance Act have made it more difficult for certain classes of mortgage holders to meet their repayments &mdash; I am talking about those with endowment mortgages.  In his budget speech this year the Minister said he was leaving mortgage interest relief alone.  That was strictly correct but it was not the full picture.  Over the last number of years the agencies, particularly the banks who are increasingly involved in the mortgage business, have been pushing endowment mortgages very hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have taken out endowment mortgages on the basis of the arguments made to them by the lending agencies that not only will they get mortgage relief on the interest but they will be able to claim life assurance relief on the capital repayments.  The Minister has reduced the relief on insurance last year and this year.  Consequently, a person with an endowment mortgage can only claim 12.5 per cent, or one eighth of <Col N="2221" /> the premiums which are being paid in mortgage relief.  It has got to the stage where the benefits of endowment mortgages seem to be exaggerated out of all proportion by the lending agencies.  I should like the Minister to pay some attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>People who now approach the banks for a house loan are being pushed in the direction of an endowment mortgage.  I suggest that they are being pushed in this direction in the interests of the lending agency but not necessarily in the interests of the borrower.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is happening because banks are in the business of selling financial services.  A person interested in setting up a small business which will give employment to three or four people can no longer get venture capital from the banks.  They will give a person a house loan if it is backed up by an asset.  However, not alone are they getting the interest on the mortgage but they are also getting the premium for selling the insurance policy.  They will then sell him a second policy, a mortgage protection policy.  The banks are the only ones who will win if they can sell a person an endowment mortgage; they will get three cuts from it.</P>
      <P>Banks are exaggerating the benefits of endowment mortgages to persons who do not fully understand the implications of what is involved and who certainly do not understand the changes which were introduced by the Minister for Finance in both last year's and this year's Finance Bills in regard to life assurance relief which reduced the benefits of endowment mortgages to the point where there is now very little tax advantage, whatever about any other advantages.  Because the Minister is reducing the advantages of endowment mortgages, there is a further case to be made for restoring full mortgage interest relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to predict interest rates and all we can do is go along with what seems to be the majority view, which is that interest rates will remain high.  This <Col N="2222" /> category of borrowers are experiencing increasing difficulties.  Their choices are very limited and, to use an old phrase, their hands are in the dog's mouth when they go looking for a mortgage to buy a house.  These people do not have a great choice and when they are offered an endowment mortgage by the bank they have to either take it or leave it.  The bank will get the interest and two sets of commission from the arrangement.  I do not believe this is a fair way of doing things and I should like the Minister to look at this arrangement.  I should also like him to look at the associated area because increasingly the lending institutions are going into a safe asset-backed type of lending which is not in the interest of job creation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look at a third area.  Those of us who have experience of local authorities had great respect for the old SDA loans which enabled many people to buy houses at fixed interest.  This system was particularly suitable for people in rural Ireland who frequently got a site from their parents, a neighbour or a relative at less than the economic cost and sometimes at no cost. The combination of a cheap site and the old SDA loan was one of the main factors which reduced the demand for local authority houses, especially in county councils as distinct from the corporation areas.  I should like the Minister in any review of housing policy, which now seems to be inevitable as we are again in the first stages of a major housing crisis, to reexamine the role played in the past by local authorities in this area.</P>
    <P>The present arrangement where people must have a pocketful of refusals from lending institutions before a local authority will look at their applications is not satisfactory and is of benefit to no one.  Even when a person has a pocketful of refusals the income limit is so low that it is of very little benefit.  We are drifting into the wider context of housing policy. There is a housing crisis and it will have to be solved by public policy, private incentives and people accommodating themselves.  The measure we are advocating here will help people to buy their <Col N="2223" /> homes and enable them to continue to pay for the mortgages they have taken out.  The other measures to which we have referred should also be looked at by the Minister.  As we have seen before, there is a kind of cycle in regard to housing problems.  In view of the number of emigrants returning home and the fact that virtually no local authority houses have been built over the past three years, we are facing an imminent major housing crisis, with all the social problems this will lead to.  Action must be taken now in this area both by the private and public sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. Indeed I would go further and suggest that the mortgage income tax allowance should be restored to what it was.  This amount is being reduced at a time when house prices are escalating. As Deputy Noonan rightly said, those of us who are involved in local authorities are aware of the existing housing crisis. As public representatives, we are trying to encourage more people to purchase their houses because we know the State can no longer provide the required number of local authority houses to house them.  These people must be housed somewhere and this proposal will give these people an incentive to house themselves.</P>
      <P>Wearing my councillor's hat, I agree with the points made by Deputy Noonan in regard to local authority loans.  People have to be refused a loan by a bank or building society before they are entertained by the council as being eligible for a loan.  This is a very humiliating process for people who are trying to house themselves. It is extremely important in the context of mortgage interest relief that we recognise that people are prepared to house themselves.  If the State cannot provide houses they should be given incentives to house themselves.  Mortgage interest relief is one incentive. Having regard to what this relief cost the State in the past and what it costs now, I believe the State is getting very good value in terms of this allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to get into a debate on housing policy on the Report Stage of the Finance Bill except to say that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, has included many provisions in the new housing policy which will help people to purchase their own houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main objectives of most Irish people is to purchase their own house and this has been acknowledged by the Government by giving mortgage interest relief.  Deputy Quinn put his finger on the problem &mdash; you cannot have your cake and eat it; you cannot have each way bets.  We are preached to day in and day out about the need to widen the tax base.  Yet now that I have proposed a minor widening of the tax base every Member of the Opposition, with the exception of Deputy Quinn, has said that we should make up our minds about which road we are travelling.  This is a very expensive relief &mdash; it costs £223 million at present.  If we were to restore it to where it was, it would cost £56 million.  The numbers who would benefit from the restoration would be 325,000 persons and the average benefit would be £172 each per annum.  The budget concessions of £674 million in the past four years, of which this was only a minor contribution, benefited 869,000 people and the average benefit was £776 per annum.  It is quite clear where the balance of advantage lies &mdash; it lies with the minor adjustment I have made in widening the tax base and will be of benefit to more people.</P>

      <P>Is she in a consultancy role now, or what?  The whole <Col N="2225" /> question of mortgage interest relief is being dealt with in different ways in different countries.  In 1990 the OECD produced a discussion document from which I will quote for the benefit of Members of the House:</P>
      <P>The deductibility of interest on mortgages is in most countries the most single costly expense-related relief.</P>
      <P>Here it costs £226 million.</P>
      <P>Many commentators have argued that this treatment subsidises home ownership and distorts savings decisions.  This view appears to have been influential in a number of countries. Thus Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United States are among countries that now provide a less favourable treatment of home-ownership&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>albeit in our case not very much less favourable,</P>
      <P>than was previously the case ....</P>
      <P>Of the other nine countries, eight (including Ireland) applied ceilings to the relief. The OECD reported that the remaining country, Germany, abolished this relief in 1988 and, according to information available from the OECD, unrestricted mortgage interest relief was available only in Denmark and the Netherlands. We are talking about trends.  We cannot be dishonest in the debate and say that we want this and that, that we do not want the widening of the tax base, but we want tax reductions to continue and tax reform to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of distortion of savings, the reduction in interest relief for premiums of life assurance is another case of where to go about widening the tax base.  Any honest commentators would agree that that relief is a distortion in the savings market where we try to create a level playing pitch for the savings market.  Everybody knows exactly where that has been going over recent years.  In contrast to what Deputy Noonan says, it is interesting that although this relief for life assurance was abolished altogether in <Col N="2226" /> the UK in 1984, it appears to have no effect whatever on the take up of endowment mortgages.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  It is a buyer's market and it is up to the building societies to compete on the other aspects of their business that have been threatened by the banking institutions.  I have said it time and again that they have to look at where their future lies post-1992 in a competitive world.  They asked for the changes in legislation in this House. They got those changes and it is up to them to compete.  There is no point in them saying that they cannot compete with the banks, that the banks are taking their business.  It is a competitive market, it is a buyer's market and that is what competition is all about.  The customer has the choice and it is up to him or her to make that choice.  It may well be that endowment mortgages are pushed very hard in advertising and every other way but in the end it is up to the customer to decide, and that is the sort of direction in which everybody would like to see us travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the whole area of taxation I have made it clear that we cannot have our loaf and eat it.  There is no point arguing one side of the coin on one occasion and another side of the coin on a different day.  In regard to the actions and policies <Col N="2227" /> pursued not alone in this financial year but in the last financial years, in the last few days one would have seen the OECD and the ESRI say what they believe is the direction our economy should be going in, the policies that should be pursued and the projections that are made.</P>
    <P>I know what Deputy Noonan takes up what the EC Commission are saying about the European economy but I would remind him that the Irish economy has out-performed the EC economy over the last number of years in average growth and in many other aspects, and consequently I think we are managing the worldwide recession well.  We are suffering from it because, naturally, we cannot insulate ourselves when over 60 per cent of our output goes into the export markets.  If export markets are down, inevitably we catch cold.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless we have been able to manage the economy through this difficult year of 1991 with low growth in comparison to other countries which have minus growth, recessions and so on.  It is beginning to be realised that we are doing the job pretty well and managing very prudently.  In fact, it is a long time since anyone would have expected to see editorials in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper, as appeared yesterday, saying how much they would like to have their economy in the shape the Irish economy is in.  That is a turn up for the books anyway.  Indeed the <i>Financial Times</i> were not so far behind either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One would expect a <Col N="2228" /> Minister for Finance to read the <i>Financial Times</i> or at least keep an eye on it and one would expect him also to read the OECD and ESRI reports.  I also read the other commentators a month ago saying that I was living in fantasy land. Well, at least somebody is going to live in fantasy land with me at this stage apparently.</P>
      <P>This is the situation.  I want to reiterate the Government's concern for those paying mortgages.  The problem with the tax structure &mdash; and the mortgage interest rate is part of that structure &mdash; is that the rates are too high and the bands are too narrow.  It is as simple as that.  Quite clearly I have the utmost sympathy with people paying mortgages.  I do not accept what Deputy Noonan says, that it is all upward trend on the interest rates market.</P>
      <P>I accept the difficulties in the German market.  It would be interesting to see how the other member states react to the situation because what is good for Germany at the moment is not necessarily good for the other 11 states of the EMS.  There is a big push worldwide by the Americans and others to try to bring down interest rates to stimulate the world economy again.  We have to wait for that. I do not accept the trend is upwards. At worst it is static and hopefully the downward pressure will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Rabbitte might think, money has not been flowing out of the country in recent days or weeks.  We had a period when the margin looked too narrow to those investing money here which has a major effect on interest rates, and I would subscribe to some of the views expressed here that for many years back interest rates were the instrument for bringing inflation.  Now that we have low inflation it is not needed for that here, but it is now the instrument for stopping money from flowing from one economy into another.  Of course, with the full liberalisation of capital movements at the end of 1992, we will be subject to a changing situation every day of every week where money can flow freely through the 12 member states of the Community.  We will have to adjust <Col N="2229" /> to a different way of thinking as to how we are to deal with that post-1992.</P>
    <P>It is the policies the Government pursue that will determine how others see us and the level of interest rates that will operate here.  We do not have independent choice in that regard.  We would hope that the downward trend would continue. There will be no change in Government policy to make matters much worse. The reduction in the reliefs that did take place &mdash; and it was not touched this year &mdash; were there to make their contribution to a six point drop in the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 29 per cent, a cut in the top rate again by four points from 56 per cent to 52 per cent, a 40 per cent expansion in the standard rate and the generous increases to the lower paid by exemption limits and child additions.  That is what the contribution was made for, a small contribution when one considers what the end-of-the-road benefit was for the greater number of taxpayers.  Those achievements are impressive.  We hope to continue and to reach our tax targets of 25 per cent standard rate in 1993 and a single higher rate as low as economic circumstances permit at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see much point in pressing this amendment to a vote, having regard to the debate we have just had and the decision we took yesterday. However, I must say I regret enormously the fact that the Minister continues to argue that what he is doing here is a minor adjustment to widen the tax base. The whole thrust of this amendment is that the Minister's provision does nothing of the kind.  The fact remains that it is the PAYE sector who bear the brunt of taxation.  Nothing really has changed over the last ten years.  This was the issue that brought three quarters of a million people on to the streets because of the unfairness of the tax code.  The people who have two-up, two-down houses in the suburbs and small towns and who are in hock to financial institutions and building societies and are suffering in the higher mortgage repayments area at the moment are the very people who are <Col N="2230" /> paying the bulk of taxation.  Therefore there is nothing in the measure that constitutes a widening of tax base.  It is merely catching the same people again. The people who are already paying almost 90 per cent of the tax are home owners because of our uniquely high level of home ownership.  It is plainly wrong for the Minister to say that what he is doing here is a minor adjustment towards widening the tax base.  That is patently not what he is doing.</P>
      <P>Interest rates are high at the moment. There is no point in going back on the debate we had about interest rates, but whatever about this downward trend that the Minister detects, interest rates are high at the moment and likely to remain high.  Whereas the Minister concedes that what is in the best interests of Germany at the moment may not be in the best interests of the other members of the EMS, our link with the DM through the EMS means we are likely to suffer the pressures that are on interest rates in Germany at the moment.  Thus I cannot see why there is any expectation of interest rates coming down here, and mortgagees will continue to have high repayments to make.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister decided to adduce the social housing policy of his colleague the Minister for the Environment as some kind of contribution towards the dilemma we are discussing here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I want to make the point that it contributes nothing to the problem we are trying to address here.</P>
      <P>In reference to the distortion of savings policy raised by Deputy Noonan and replied to by the Minister, it never ceases to amaze me that the financial institutions in this country at the moment are permitted to accumulate the hard earned savings of people who work in this country and to fritter them away in the US or wherever and we all fold our arms and accept it with equanimity.  It is disgraceful. Because it is a buyer's market and the policies are biased in favour of the lending agencies as distinct from the borrower, they can do that.  We had a question to the Minister for Finance yesterday showing that the gap between the lending and borrowing levels established by the building societies has not been wider for a very long time than it is at the moment.  That is not surprising in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister cannot make some concession to the spirit of this amendment.  It is not confined to the financial institutions alone.  The Housing Finance Agency mortgage terms are extremely stringent particularly on a section of the home-owning population who can least afford that.  This device of income-related mortgage repayments is extremely punitive and in my certain knowledge has led to cases of homes being repossessed.  People have not been able to maintain the repayments on an income-related basis because of the rate at which they are spiralling at the moment, and that can be accelerated in any given year for any windfall reason, special overtime payments, special pay increases or whatever.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The group of amendments may be straightforward enough for those who have been dealing with this.  We have dealt in the last couple of days with a great many amendments to this Finance Bill and I think we all as Opposition spokespersons would agree that some of them have been advanced as an opportunity to ventilate certain arguments and to discuss certain aspects of fiscal policy. On this lead amendment I want to say that I regard this with more conviction than any other single amendment on the amendment list.  It seeks to address the question of the threshold at which people ought to become liable for tax.  Effectively it seeks to address through the method of the Finance Bill the question of poverty and the alleviation of poverty in this society.  The view is abroad that poverty is merely due to unemployment. Of course that is not the situation.  Poverty is also due to low pay and a great many people on low pay find themselves amazingly in the tax net.  A recent survey on this matter by the Economic and <Col N="2233" /> Social Research Institute established that somewhere between 11 and 18 per cent of those living in poverty contradictorily are liable for income tax and PRSI.  In addition to that, they showed that the actual amount of tax paid by these people is significant in the context of their total income, many of them paying more than 20p per week.  It is unconscionable in my view that people who are earning less than £70 per week are theoretically liable to income tax.  This amendment seeks to establish a threshold of £100 per week or £200 for a couple.  I do not think there is anybody out there, even the most right-wing ideological economist, who could argue that it is proper or fair or equitable that anybody earning less than £100 should be liable to income tax.  Quite frankly, I cannot see what sense it makes in any event.  Why do we have family income supplement? Why do we have to use a different mechanism to claw back some of the money and pay it to people who are in desperate need?  This is the kind of measure we must introduce because of the level at which income tax bites.</P>
    <P>It is important for this House to recall &mdash; and the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Labour will bear this out with elaborate figures &mdash; that a great many people in our society are on low pay and that the structure of the economy nowadays means there will likely be a great deal more people on low pay, and that the incidence of part-time work is increasing.  A number of people must go into part-time work because either they are the options that are available to them or they want to go into part-time work. Whatever the reason the fact is that the problem of low pay is likely to accelerate rather than diminish.  In that context we have to address whether it is right that people on such minimal subsistence incomes have a liability for income tax.</P>
    <P>We have had discussions on what constitutes tax reform during the course of the debate on this Bill.  The Minister has just confirmed that it is his intention to bring the standard rate down to 25 per cent.  This is the argument being advanced so frequently and so noisily by <Col N="2234" /> the junior partner in Government as if it somehow magically constituted tax reform.  The real issue is how quickly somebody comes into the tax net, not whether one is paying 25 per cent or 29 per cent.  It is untenable that people become liable for income tax at the levels proposed in the Bill.  I refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29 September 1987 by Cliff Taylor at a conference on poverty and taxation policy.  He referred to the fact that many low-income families end up below the poverty line because of the impact of income tax and PRSI on their spending powers, according to a paper presented to ESRI economists.  He went on to make the point that the ESRI researchers said that between 56 and 66 per cent of those living in poverty and paying tax would move above the poverty line if their tax burden was removed.</P>
    <P>Surely that is the sensible way to tackle poverty, at least in so far as it relates to people who are at work.  People who are unemployed are a different category.  We cannot deal with that under this amendment. It has been a favourite hobby horse of the fringe right wing of Irish politics for many years to talk about people being too lazy to go to work and being shirkers and so on, but we have to accept that there is an element of employment disincentive here, not because of shirking but because people simply cannot afford to take up low income jobs having regard to the structure of the tax code.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I must dissuade him from making what the Chair regards as a Second Reading speech, especially in view of the time factor involved in dealing with Report Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your intervention, a Cheann Comhairle.  I want to underline the point that even as compared to the social welfare code if we do not tackle this question of the threshold for tax liability the head of a family, whether it is the woman or the man, cannot afford to avail of low income <Col N="2235" /> employment as compared to their situation on social welfare.  That is an additional argument for accepting this amendment.</P>
      <P>Finally, I refer to the report by the Combat Poverty Agency entitled <i>Tackling Poverty in the Nineties.</i>  That organisation recommends that we should reduce the tax burden of those on the lowest incomes with further increases in general exemption limits and increase additional exemptions for those with children. Much thought and consideration has gone into the formulation of that recommendation.  It is a sensible, coherent, logical approach, and nobody in Irish society can challenge the basis in equity of such a recommendation, that we look at the threshold and the exemption limits.</P>
      <P>I concede the Minister's argument that there was an element of special pleading in the case made by the Opposition on my last amendment.  However, having regard to how endemic the poverty trap is in part of my own constituency and in several parts of urban Ireland, and indeed in rural areas, although in those areas it is probably not because of being in paid employment in most instances, it is imperative that, rather than hurtling headlong after the Progressive Democrats and their very special well heeled constituency, the Minister give some concession to the people who are struggling to make ends meet and stay in the workforce and who do not want to be a burden on the Exchequer.  It is disgraceful that they ought to be liable for income tax as is provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments behind Deputy Rabbitte's amendment. I, too, wish that the exemption limits were higher.  The initiative to exempt people below a certain level of income from income tax was introduced here three years ago by the present Minister for Finance.  When Deputy Rabbitte urges the Minister to have some consideration for the less well off he seems to ignore the fact that this Minister has shown great consideration in practice, and that he has introduced necessary <Col N="2236" /> reforms and initiatives into the tax system to cater for the less well off.  As Deputy Rabbitte will be aware people earning somewhat in excess of the limits are entitled to marginal relief.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to be congratulated on his initiative three years ago in introducing exemption limits in legislation which The Workers' Party opposed. While we would all like to see exemption limits increased we cannot just come in here and make suggestions to solve all our problems without taking into account surrounding economic circumstances. The series of amendments proposed by Deputy Rabbitte would cost £109 million in 1991 and £183 million in a full year. Deputy Mac Giolla was upset last night about a miniscule change in the capital acquisitions tax system which will probably cost the Exchequer about £15,000 next year and suggested that we should not make that change in order to allow us to make more concessions on the PAYE front.  If Deputy Mac Giolla has any suggestions in relation to capital acquisitions tax which would allow us to make real concessions on the PAYE front, I would like to hear them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the cost of this amendment, surely the last thing we would want to do is to plunge the country back into the vortex of borrowing and rising national debt which we experienced between 1982 and 1987.</P>

      <P>If we move too quickly on the income tax front we will have a loss of revenue in the short term which will plunge the country back into that vortex of borrowing and increasing national debt.  The result of going down that road would be that interest rates would rise and the burden of taxation would rise.  A grip of the public finances would have to be taken again at some stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte made an interesting point about the family income supplement. We all admit that there were teething difficulties with the FIS, but I compliment the Minister for Finance on the increased allocation for the FIS in this year's Estimates.  Due to a good advertising campaign people have been becoming more aware of their rights and there is now a 60 per cent to 70 per cent uptake of the FIS.  I regret that the takeup is not yet 100 per cent.  I do not know whether there is a mechanism whereby we can calculate in advance who would be entitled to FIS for a year.  Deputy Stagg during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill suggested that he could devise a computer programme to predict who would be entitled to FIS for a coming year so that they would be automatically paid.  If Deputy Stagg can devise a computer programme to tell the future he can become a very rich man.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte made the point that we can combat the poverty trap by focusing on the taxation exemption limits alone.  For many years the poverty trap has been a problem.  Successive Governments have found that the taxation system on its own cannot solve the problem.</P>

      <P>The FIS was introduced some years ago.  It is not perfect, but some combination of that, tax exemption <Col N="2238" /> limits and other measures will have to be introduced to tackle the poverty trap.  I agree that it is a real problem and that there is a disincentive to work among certain sectors of the population.  It will cost some people money to go to work or else the reward for doing so is so miniscule that it is not a feasible option. The introduction of exemption limits was a radical, good initiative and it has worked in practice.  I compliment the Minister on that and on the real increases in taxation exemption limits introduced in the last three budgets.  There is no doubt that the Minister increased the exemption limits in real terms in every budget he introduced despite financial constraints.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments behind Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  The Minister has gone a certain way along the road and he will go further as he has a special interest in this area which he has proved in practice.  But, to try to move too quickly at a prohibitive cost to the Exchequer is not a feasible option.  Ultimately it will increase interest rates and the burden of taxation which we all will wish to see reduced.</P>

      <P>In relation to this measure, the House should maintain the standards of open honesty that have been the hall mark of this debate since Second Stage. This country lost the run of itself somewhere in the mid seventies in the wake of the first oil crisis.  The borrowing which successive generations will have to carry will be with us for a long time.  If we disregard the lessons of that time we will double that burden.  It does not help the belief in politics or in the democratic system in the school children in the Public Gallery from time to time, if we fool <Col N="2239" /> ourselves and say that the problem started in 1982 or in 1977.  History shows that it started in 1973.  The crisis was nearly overcome in 1976 but because the Government of the day dug too deep in trying to apply classic Keynesian economics when we were coming out of a recession and the political climate was soured for non-economic reasons, we made a dreadful mistake in 1977.  I sat on these benches and heard the array of Fianna Fáil Deputies, the greatest majority ever, and perhaps the worst Government ever, cheer loudly when the late Deputy George Colley announced at the end of the budget speech that the total amount of borrowing amounted exactly to 13 per cent GNP.  That is how far removed from reality we all were in those days.  It does this House no good to forget that lesson.  The long hard road of getting back to any sort of sensible taxation will not be easy, no matter who is in Government.  Perhaps some day Deputy O'Dea will sit on the Government benches and I hope he gets the same degree of constructive opposition Fianna Fáil have always got from this side of the House but which Fianna Fáil have never given to a non-Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment very strongly.  The raising of the allowances is critical to making the kind of impact on the thresholds that members from The Labour Party, The Workers' Party and, I believe, Deputy Garland from the Green Party want.  The nominal rates, which have great rhetorical appeal to the chairman of the Progressive Democrats, and others, would be eroded without the effective and substantial indexing of the bands and the thresholds at which they start to impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Rabbitte I have a frequent procession of people coming to see me at my clinics.  The people who concern me most are those who were in occupations in which, in addition to paying full PRSI, they contributed towards a small industrial pension.  By small I mean a pension that perhaps would give them a pension of about £10, £15, or £20 a week.  In some cases they are retired <Col N="2240" /> people who not only pay income tax on that income but are also, by virtue of receiving that income, debarred from the effective marginal benefits available to people who are on social welfare benefits exclusively.  I am talking about people on low incomes who could in socio-economic terms be described as working class or lower middle class.  I am concerned for that category of person, who is today working or who is in some cases retired and has to pay tax.  I have attempted to signal to the Minister the constraints he has to operate under in relation to the overall tax base, but to focus on the bands exclusively &mdash; which is a political commitment, admittedly, and one set out in the PESP &mdash; will not solve the problem. The Minister should allow for some changes in the bands even at this stage.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Opposition Deputies tried to set out an alternative schedule that indicated what could be achieved over three years.  We did not persuade the Minister of the acceptability of that, even though at the time he was able to say that the commitment had been made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and did not have to be written into law.  I do not accept that view.  The validity of the programme, and the approach of the social partners to consensus, will take on real strength only if it is given some kind of democratic underpinning that it does not possess at present.  In the absence of that three year schedule for income tax rates and allowances being built into this year's Bill, because it is not acceptable to the Minister, I find myself, on behalf of the Labour Party, supporting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 4 is similar to Deputy Rabbitte's, except that I suggested figures of £8,000 for married couples and £4,000 for single people. Deputy Rabbitte wants to be a little more generous and suggested figures of £10,000 and £5,000.  I wish to take up a point made by Deputy O'Dea, which is a very good one.  Deputy Rabbitte, well intentioned as he is, is being a little overgenerous. Members have to be <Col N="2241" /> concerned about the level of Government borrowing and about the budget deficit.  It is highly irresponsible of any party to encourage a higher budget deficit than already exists; God knows it is high enough.  In spite of the Minister's best efforts, the country is still facing a very high budget deficit this year.</P>
      <P>By pitching in at my figures I do not want to increase the budget deficit.  On Committee Stage when discussing any of my amendments that would increase the budget deficit I made it clear, and I wish to make it clear now, that there was ample scope for collecting the extra revenue required from the corporate sector. I am not going to spell out for the Minister exactly from where that should come.  I have already referred to section 84 schemes, section 23 schemes, the BES scheme and the low rate of corporation tax.  I know the Minister has made moves to broaden the corporate tax base and I accept that the percentage of tax paid by the corporate sector has increased in the past two or three years, which we all welcome.  However, the Minister has gone nowhere near far enough.  My amendment could be accepted without any increase in the budget deficit.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to the poverty trap, of course, there is a very serious poverty trap.  I put it to the Deputy, to the Minister, and to every Member that there is only one way to eliminate the poverty trap, by introducing a system of basic income for all citizens.  That policy is espoused by the Fine Gael Party and by The Workers' Party but, for some reason best known to themselves &mdash; perhaps Members from those parties might tell us a little more today &mdash; they never mention it.  It is as if the policy is one of those unmentionables stuck away in their manifestos because the parties are half afraid or half ashamed of it.  I do not understand that.  I seem to be the only Deputy to make a coherent case for basic income on all occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage the top priority in the income tax system &mdash; in so far as there should be an income tax system, and the Green Party feel that there should not be &mdash; should not be the <Col N="2242" /> reduction of the standard rate to 25 per cent, it should be to increase exemption limits and allowances to those who are in special categories or who have special problems.  We must all agree that the underprivileged, the handicapped and those who are long term physically disabled or sick have to be targeted.  To an extent they are targeted, but we must continue to be vigilant to make sure that they are cared for adequately.</P>
    <P>Consideration also has to be given to the very high cost of administration.  The keeping of PAYE records is a major burden for the small employer.  The raising of exemption limits, thus taking lower paid people out of the tax net, may eliminate all such paperwork for a person who employs two, three or four workers. Apart from such a measure being of benefit to the employees concerned, it would be of immense advantage to small employers.  Ireland will become increasingly dependent on small employers for job creation as more and more multinational companies fold their tents and disappear in the night, an example of which is being experienced in Clonmel with the pulling out of Digital International. Every day of the week multinational companies come and go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Garland, I hate to interrupt in this way, but Deputies have to realise that there are many more amendments to get through, unless the House feels that this is the only amendment that should be dealt with.  It seems that we are trawling far and wide, much wider than is permissible on Report Stage.  Deputy Garland said, &ldquo;Now I will come to the amendment&rdquo;, having addressed the House for nearly five minutes.  He should speak to the amendment at all times.  I ask the Deputy and other Members to confine the debate to what is in the amendment.  Deputies should avoid the temptation to repeat over and over matters that occurred in the past, or other matters.  That would enable the House to follow a more perfect kind of business, which we all desire.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. It is the first time I have been present for a debate on the Finance Bill and I have been impressed by the constructive Opposition approach. However, it was unfortunate that Deputy O'Dea considered it necessary to give us a history lesson this morning in relation to certain periods.  He was selective because I remember in 1977 when road tax was abolished every young man with a Honda rushed out to vote for Fianna Fáil; we all know that we have paid the price for the mistakes of that time. However, I will not go into history because it would not be in keeping with the spirit of the debate over the last few days.</P>

      <P>In relation to the exemption limit of £6,800, of course we appreciate developments in that direction but I also support the amendment on the basis that it is the only way forward in relation to eliminating the poverty trap which has been spoken about on many occasions.  It would also create an attractive differential between working and not working.  When we refer to a figure of £6,800, we are talking about an income of £136 per week.  The way forward is to increase the exemption limit and it is a positive amendment in that direction.  It would be worthwhile to do something like this because, although the average industrial wage is supposed to be about £230, I am aware of unionised companies in my constituency who pay something between £145 to £160 per week.  It is not attractive for many people to work, it is <Col N="2244" /> more advantageous to be unemployed because of the benefits.  Many people have to make a positive commitment to work in those circumstances.  Therefore, I support an increase in the exemption limits to widen the gap and to increase the innovative spirit in people to look for work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to increase the limits set out in the Bill by £3,200 for married couples and by £1,600 for single and widowed persons. This would cost £109.8 million in 1991 and £183 million in a full year, which would mean exempting about 130,000 people from the tax net.  However, if the amendment was accepted it would substantially increase the current budget deficit which is already under considerable pressure because of the increase in the numbers out of work and other aspects.  However, I hope that throughout the year we may be able to recover. The amendment would also mean an increase in borrowing which is not what Deputies want, judging from the various contributions.  We cannot have our loaf and eat it, we must face up to reality and I know that Deputy Garland is less generous with his proposal; nevertheless his proposal would mean a cost of £28.4 million in 1991 and £47.4 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already set out on Committee Stage that the Bill provides for generous increases because of the tax exemption limits of £300 in the case of married couples and £150 in the case of single and widowed persons.  In addition, in recognition of the difficulties faced by low income families, the sum of £300 per dependent child is being increased for each third and subsequent child to £500 per child.  This child element, especially the increase for each third and subsequent child, is intended to focus and target relief specifically at a group which has been identified as being particularly in need of State support &mdash; low income married couples with large families.  With the increase in the basic exemption limits, this will go a long way towards alleviating the tax burden on low income families. <Col N="2245" /> The child addition to the exemption amount is intended to top up the general exemption limits by adding a sum of £300 per child for the first two children and £500 for the third and subsequent children. The addition gives an effective tax exemption limit for married couples with children significantly greater than the general exemption limit.  For example, a married couple with four children have an effective exemption rate of £8,400 or over £160 per week.  The married couple with six children have an effective rate of £9,400 or over £180 per week.</P>
    <P>Over the last three budgets general exemption limits for married couples have been substantially increased.  For instance, a general exemption limit for a married person with two children has increased from £5,500 in 1988 to £7,400 in 1991, an increase of 35 per cent.  In the case of a married person with four children the increase was from £5,500 to £8,400, a 53 per cent increase.  This, however, is not the end of the matter; it would obviously be unfair to subject a person whose income is only a little more than the exemption limit to the normal taxation rules.  Accordingly, there is a transitional stage &mdash; marginal relief &mdash; spanning the gap from total exemption to full liability to tax.  All taxpayers on marginal relief pay less tax than they would under the normal taxation provisions. Marginal relief was mentioned in this debate and it is worth imparting more information in relation to it.</P>
    <P>Persons with income not exceeding the new limits will not be liable for income tax and the new basic exemption limits are: under 65 years of age for single or widowed persons, £3,400; from 65 to 74 years of age, £3,900; and 75 years of age and over, £4,500.  The amount relating to married couples under 65 years of age is £6,800, for those aged 65 to 74 years of age the figure is £7,800 while for those aged 75 years and over the figure is £9,000.  That area has been a source of dicontent for a long time for older people on pension who had to pay tax, having worked very hard throughout their lives <Col N="2246" /> rearing a family and making a contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>The basic exemption limit has been increased by the figures I just mentioned and indexation does not come into the argument or debate in dealing with exemption limits.  The best way to illustrate it is by saying that the lowest percentage increase which I have given over the last three budgets has been 24 per cent; it ranges from that up to 71 per cent at a time when the cost of living over the same period increased by 10 per cent.  I do not consider the question of indexation relevant in this area because it would make no impression, good bad or indifferent on it.  Very generous increases have been given.  Everybody has done very well.</P>
    <P>Clearly, when you talk about exemption, you come to the marginal relief area which has caused problems.  It became clear, as the system was introduced, that it would be unfair to subject a person whose income is only a little more than the exemption limits to the normal taxation rules.  Accordingly, there is a transitional stage spanning the gap from total exemption from tax to full liability.  It is commonly called the marginal relief system which means that if a taxpayer's income is in excess of the appropriate exemption limits for his or her circumstances, the maximum liability to income tax will be set at 52 per cent of the difference between the income and the appropriate exemption limit.</P>
    <P>All taxpayers on marginal relief pay less than they would under the normal taxation provisions.  Marginal relief can be quite significant depending on the taxpayer's circumstances.  For example, a married man with three children who earns £9,000 a year, pays tax under PAYE and is subject to the normal rate of PRSI, will be £505 better off as a result of the application of the marginal relief system.  Needless to say, marginal relief will expire at the lower level where entitlement to other allowances such as mortgage interest relief exists.  Such additional allowances have the effect of easing the tax burden under the allowance based system, thus providing that <Col N="2247" /> the advantage of being taxed under the marginal relief system will expire at a lower level of income than would otherwise be the case.  Effectively, the more allowances a taxpayer is entitled to the quicker the advantage of marginal relief will expire.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to poverty traps against the background of the ESRI report published in 1987.  However a considerable number of improvements have been made since then.  The ESRI highlighted the problems in this regard and I have addressed them.  As mentioned by Deputy Garland, the exemption limits and child additions have been extended to small shopkeepers and farmers. Anyone who finds themselves in that income bracket can opt to be taxed under that system.</P>
    <P>The first point I would make with regard to the poverty trap is that we are really talking about the position of those in employment and what happens to them as their incomes increase.  We have concentrated a significant level of resources in recent years on an earlier point on the scale, that is, those on low incomes and we have improved significantly their net income position by substantially improving the family income supplement and the exemption limits and introducing a child addition to the exemption limits.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the second point which is that, given that resources are limited, there must come a point at which benefits are withdrawn and taxation commences. There are always likely to be tensions at this point of interface.  Nevertheless, it is important not to exaggerate their impact.  They arise only in a narrow range of income and only for a small number of people.  For example, as regards the family income supplement, only about 2,000 family income supplement beneficiaries pay tax.  In addition, where a person successfully applies of family income supplement it is not immediately withdrawn if his income rises.  Once a person qualifies for family income supplement it is continued for 12 months and only then is his entitlement removed.  Overall, there will always be <Col N="2248" /> tensions at the point of interface. Although these are neither as sharp nor as widespread as has been portrayed by Deputy Rabbitte in this debate, nevertheless this is an area which merits continuous attention.  I can assure the House that is being kept under review.  We are continuing to ease the problems through a combination of the family income supplement and the exemption limits.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that this topic was also considered in the first report of the Commission on Taxation. They described such an income tax system as consisting of two parts: those with incomes more than the sum of exemptions plus allowances would pay a positive income tax and those earning less than this or with no income would receive a negative income tax, in other words, an income supplement.  This would allow a more integrated system of personal taxation and welfare schemes. The objectives of negative income tax schemes were cited as follows: (1) to achieve administrative savings by simplifying the tax and income maintenance systems; (2) to remove poverty traps which face taxpayers in certain income ranges, which occur when a rise in income is associated with the withdrawal of certain benefits and an additional payment of tax; and (3) to increase the redistribution of income by providing a supplement to the income of the lower paid.  The commission concluded that any attempt to solve the problem of poverty with a single comprehensive system of income maintenance which was integrated with the income tax system would be very costly. That was also the conclusion in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare. In Chapter 8 they examined the area of negative income tax.</P>
    <P>The problem with negative income tax schemes as identified by both commissions is that the level of personal allowances or credits must be fixed at a high enough level to provide at least a subsistence level of income.  These must be extended to everybody.  Hence the benefits of a neater more rational tax benefits system at the lower end of the income scale would still be offset by <Col N="2249" /> implicit disincentives and a steeper progressivity at most income levels.  The Commission on Social Welfare made the further point that integrated systems of income tax and income maintenance are by their nature inflexible in the way they cope with income needs.  Income maintenance needs are varied and complex often requiring flexible and immediate attention and would coexist uneasily with a system primarily designed to collect tax. Both commissions recommended that the direct tax and income maintenance systems should continue to be separate.</P>
    <P>I think we all agree that this area merits continuous attention.  As I said earlier, the amendments proposed would impose a charge which would add considerably to the current budget deficit and lead to an increase in borrowing.  I have also dealt with the suggestion made by Deputy Garland that the money could be raised from the corporate sector very comprehensively.  I do not want to go back over the same arguments again.  I have continuously adjusted section 84 which provides relief to the corporate sector.  In addition, the amount raised in taxation from the corporate sector has increased from approximately £250 million to over £537 million in 1991.  No Minister for Finance will be able to solve all the problems but, on balance considerable progress has been made in improving the position of the low paid and I will continue to do so in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that because of his Keynesian instincts the Minister would like to respond to this because it is a real area of need and vulnerability in our society.  If we are talking about tax reform we should be able to focus on this group.  I have put forward other amendments but the rules of the House governing the Finance Bill make it very difficult to have them debated because there is a possible financial implication.  For example, I proposed a very minimalist amendment to the Wealth Tax Act, 1975, which would simply revive section 2 of that Act and would cause a wealth tax to be levied at 1 per cent as provided for within that Act.  Is anybody seriously saying that that would cause an outbreak of poverty in the country, if those who are sufficiently <Col N="2251" /> wealthy to be encompassed by that Act were to be levied to the extent of 1 per cent or if the banks were to be levied on some reasonable proportion of their profits, or if we were to look at the whole area of levies on property in its widest possible definition.  If there was any real distribution of wealth or progressive notion behind the reform of the income tax code there are areas where we could find some alleviation for people who are attempting to stay in the workforce but who are being punished by taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the changing structure of the workforce and the concentration on employment in the services industry, much of which is relatively lowly paid, it is important that people ought not to become liable for tax at the level they do at present.  These should be hell for people who by general consensus are caught in the poverty trap, living on subsistence pay while trying to make ends <Col N="2252" /> meet and rear their family; with no prospect of access to third level education on an equal basis or anything like that, because education still transmits privilege. Should we not try at least to use this Finance Bill to give them some measure of alleviation?  I agree with Deputy O'Dea.  I am not saying that one can tackle this element of the poverty trap entirely through the income tax code.  I accept that cannot be done but we could at least bring about some improvement, if the political will were there.  The Minister referred to the point of interface where benefits must be withdrawn the taxation must commence.  I take his point that such a point must be reached, but the level at which it is reached at present is unfairly punitive on the most vulnerable section of people in our society who are trying to stay in the workforce.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments, which are repeats of amendments put down by Deputy Mitchell on Committee Stage, is to extend the general and age exemption limits appropriate to married couples to widowed and other single persons with responsibility for children.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that there is already provision in the income tax code for the position of widowed and single parents, in that the widowed and single parent allowances bring their basic allowances up to the same level as those of a married couple.  In addition, widowed and single parents who are taxpayers will have benefited from the general income tax reliefs introduced in recent years, including increases in the personal allowances, the reduction in rates and extension of the standard rate band by 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>The fact that widowed and single parents have personal allowances equivalent to the married personal allowance means that their basic allowances significantly exceed the single exemption limit.  If they qualify for the PAYE and PRSI allowances, as is often the case, their allowances would substantially exceed the single exemption limit.  I would not be in favour of allowing such taxpayers the married exemption limits. The reason married couples receive the double exemption limits is simply because there are two adults to support while in the case of widowed and single parents there is only one adult to support.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) As regards 1991-92 and subsequent years of assessment, relief in respect of children shall be allowed at £300 per child.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was already discussed on Committee Stage and the Minister's response was very discouraging.  I brought this up last year and it looks as if I will have to bring it up again next year.  I do not wish to repeat the whole debate we had the last time.  This amendment is about reintroducing the child allowance in the tax code at £300.  The child allowance extended to those children in third level education.  The position of married couples having to maintain children is not adequately covered by child benefit.  In addition to child benefit it is appropriate to reintroduce children's allowances in this budget.  I would ask the Minister once again to consider this proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House by repeating what I said on Committee Stage.  This amendment is looking for a reintroduction to the income tax code of the child tax allowance which was taken out in 1986 and was incorporated in an overall child benefit.  It is a very extensive road to travel.  The general improvement in the tax area is the way we are travelling.  It is a matter of choice.  As Deputy Rabbitte said earlier it is a political choice to go for rates and bands.  We have taken on rates and whatever we can manage in regard to bands and when rates are down to what would be internationally acceptable as competitive, we hope to attack some of the other systems in the income tax code.  This amendment will cost about £42 million in 1991 and £70 million in the <Col N="2256" /> first year.  In the light of the arguments we pursued already about the huge cost of amendments being proposed here, this again would increase the current budget deficit and borrowing, to which all parties in this House are opposed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;For the purposes of income tax assessment married persons shall mean&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a man and woman who are married to each other, or</P>
      <P>(b) a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as man and wife.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister was sympathetic to the motivation behind this amendment and the reality that lies behind it.  The facts are that this kind of liaison is likely to be an increasing factor in Irish society until such time as the right to remarry is sponsored by Fianna Fáil, because only Fianna Fáil can cause such an amendment to the Constitution to be carried.  We have learned that.  Whether that will be done during the reign of the current Taoiseach on when the present Minister for Finance accedes, I am not sure.  I would like to think it would be done sooner rather than later.  When it is sponsored by Fianna Fáil it will unquestionably be carried, because it has the support of the other parties in the House. So until that day we have here an injustice that we can go some way towards remedying and acknowledging by way of the amendment that is put forward here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to believe that the Minister can rely on the argument he advanced on Committee Stage that it is the putative constitutional impropriety of it that prevents him taking on board if not the letter of the amendment at least the essence of the amendment.  This facility should be extended to mature <Col N="2257" /> consenting adults who, through no fault of their own, are denied the right to remarry and have stable and lasting relationships.  Indeed, there probably is a constitutional argument about the rights of the individual as much as there is an argument about undermining the recognition that the Constitution affords to marriage.  As I said on Committee Stage, there also is a recognition of the role of the family and in this case there are many very responsible law abiding citizens trying to rear their families in this type of liaison and I cannot see any reason they should be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the decision of the then junior Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Frank Cluskey, to introduce allowances for unmarried or single parents.  That has become a permanent feature now of the social welfare code.  Is that somehow to be taken as undermining the same concept of marriage? It is accepted in the social welfare code.  I cannot see the difference in the social obligations that caused the late Frank Cluskey to bring forward that measure being any different from the circumstances that confront us here.  I cannot see why Deputy Woods, the present Minister for Social Welfare, brought in a Social Welfare Bill that recognises this reality of Irish life for social welfare recipients.  If it is good enough for social welfare purposes, why is it not good enough for revenue purposes? I really think it is a bit fantastic to suggest that it would lead to the widespread breakdown of marriage.  The facts are that marriages do break down in this country.  It is a growing phenomenon and until we rectify it legally and constitutionally the Ministers should in the interim, having regard to the Murphy case to which we adverted on Committee Stage, and if he is not happy with the wording of this amendment, at least give a commitment that he intends to take the essence of it on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see a certain amount of logic in Deputy Rabbitt's amendment and I have to say that I have some sympathy with it.  In the context of capital <Col N="2258" /> acquisitions tax where two people are cohabiting, there would be no capital acquisitions tax if they were married, but in the case of two people cohabiting if property transfers from one to the other the donee is treated as a stranger in blood and very considerable capital acquisitions tax could result.  In the case of any child of that relationship if the child is the child of the donor there will be no problem regarding income tax.  If both parties are working each will be treated as a single person, each will get the single allowance and each will get the benefits of the various bands.</P>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy Rabbitte's point about the unmarried mother's allowance.  I do not think the case he makes about it is analagous to or on all fours with this.  I have not studied the constitutional aspect but the problem is an Article in the Constitution which obliges the Government to take special care to protect the institution of marriage.  It seems to me if two people living together were in a better tax bracket because they were married than if they were cohabiting, to bring up the cohabiting people and put them on a level with the married people could be taken by the courts as some sort of attack on the institution of marriage.  I take Deputy Rabbitte's point.  I see no wide implications if that were done, but that is the way it could be interpreted.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to cover a situation which is going to prove temporary. As Deputy Rabbitte said, we have a growing problem of marital breakdown. Deputies will be aware that the matter is being studied, and that a White Paper is imminent.  We will have to take this on board and do something about it. I believe &mdash; I am not speaking for my party &mdash; the only way this can be resolved is by providing for the right to remarry, and I hope that happens in the short term rather than in the long term.  If that happens then the amendment will be dealing with a temporary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is sympathetic to the spirit of the amendment.  He got advice from the Attorney General, <Col N="2259" /> whose office presumably studied the constitutional judgments of the Supreme Court, to the effect that it would not be constitutionally feasible to introduce this amendment into our tax legislation.  I know the Minister will confirm that he is sympathetic and if some way can be found to circumvent the constitutional difficulty he will be willing to examine it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment seeks to have the same tax treatment applied to unmarried cohabiting couples as applied to married couples. I opposed the amendment on Committee Stage and we had a very good discussion on it then.  I am opposing it today again.  I believe the treatment reflects the general law in relation to marriage, and that is not the function of income tax laws to lead the whole area of general law.  Provisions regarding the status of parties to a non-marital relationship would, if considered desirable, be contained in general law relating to marriage which would then be reflected in relevant tax legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what other Deputies have said.  We are all aware that a White Paper is being prepared by the Government in the latter half of this year and, in the circumstances, I believe it would be preferable to wait for the White Paper before making a change in the tax code in this area.  I have listened to the case made by Deputy Rabbitte but I do not think it falls to Fianna Fáil totally.  I never knew we enjoyed 63 per cent of the electorate, which was about the figure that voted against the introduction of divorce in the referendum.  Though we are not doing too badly in the polls, I did not think we had risen to such heights.  It was the people, not us, who decided and the people will decide the issue again when the opportunity arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a point Deputy Quinn on Tuesday and Deputy Rabbitte raised today &mdash; Deputy O'Dea referred to the general principle &mdash; regarding the treatment of married and cohabiting couples under the social assistance and other schemes.  I am informed these changes <Col N="2260" /> were enacted following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Hyland case in 1989.  In reaching their decision the court explicitly applied the principles of the Murphy case.  In effect the court found it was unconstitutional for the social welfare provisions in question in the Hyland case to benefit a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple.  Following this ruling the Oireachtas in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1989 extended to cohabiting couples the same restrictive treatment as applied to married couples. This is a follow through of the recognition in the Constitution of marriage and the family.  This year's Social Welfare Act included similar provisions as regards other social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>I live in the real world and I am well aware of the increasing problems.  Marriages break down despite the best intentions of the couples concerned.  I am aware of the hardships, problems and tribulations and, inevitably, society will have to face up to them.  I am also very aware of the serious problems, tribulations and pressures that are exerted as outlined by Deputies Rabbitte and O'Dea.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I was sympathetic to these problems. I undertook to have this matter thoroughly examined to see if a solution can be found.  Deputies will appreciate that many complex issues will need to be examined carefully.  Naturally, any solution must ensure proper control and administration and we must ensure it is not open to large scale abuse.  Nevertheless, I am sympathetic on the point raised by Deputies Rabbitte, O'Dea and Quinn.  I will have it carefully examined and work will start on it right away.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach confirmed today that the Government White Paper is on target to be produced later in the year.  Then marital breakdown will have relevance to this issue.  Work will start on looking at all the possibilities and trying to find a solution within the parameters of the Murphy and other relevant cases.  I am not saying whether a solution can be found but the matter will be approached positively by my officials straight away.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that as he sees it it is not the task of income tax laws to lead in this area.  Generally speaking, we all agree with that, but social mores and customs are leading the legislators at the moment and we are away behind the posse.  I do not want to reopen the question of my hopes for the role of Fianna Fáil in this, but it is not fair of the Minister to say: the people decided it, we had nothing to do with it.  The Minister himself may have had nothing to do with it but I know a great many of his colleagues who had more than a little impact on the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hyland case has been adverted to by the Minister.  The people concerned were constituents of mine at that time.  My understanding of that case was that the import of the decision was that they could not be treated any less favourably than two people living together.  That is not quite the same as saying that in this circumstance extending the benefit we are addressing in this amendment to two <Col N="2262" /> cohabiting people would mean that they would be treated more favourably than a married couple.  There is no advantage in what the amendment seeks to do as compared to a couple who are married. The least one could say is that it reduces it to a matter of interpretation but I do not think it necessarily the case that if the Minister were to accede to this that there would be an automatic cause for action that would find disfavour in the courts.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the care he has taken with this amendment.  He is undertaking to examine it immediately in terms of whether a suitable amendment can be framed to acknowledge the phenomenon of the breakdown of marriage in Irish society and the fact that a great many people are living in second relationships consciously and responsibly. While it is not a matter for the income tax laws to lead, it is equitable and just that we should recognise the problem in the income tax laws.  To underline the point, because I feel strongly on this matter, I wish to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between the Table and line 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1984, (inserted by this section), shall apply to persons with dependants who are widows, widowers or single parents.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not want to make a meal out of this amendment.  We already discussed it on Committee Stage.  Since we are talking about the Constitution, the protection of marriage and the family, this is what lies behind this amendment.  People who for one reason or another end up as single parents ought to be entitled to the same protection as a family unit and the benefit of the double tax bands ought to be extended to them.  It is not a very expensive decision for the Exchequer.  It is a reform that will be greatly welcomed by people struggling to rear a family in circumstances that may well have arisen through some tragedy in their lives.  I would like to hear the Minister on it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to extend the double rate bands which apply to married persons to single and widowed parents.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of our consideration of this amendment in Committee, the basic problems which give rise to requests to extend double rate bands to lone parents are the high rates of direct taxation and the low levels of income at which the higher tax rates apply.  If the vast bulk of taxpayers paid tax at the standard rate only, the distinction between the double rate bands and the single rate bands would become largely irrelevant.</P>
      <P>One step along this road is the Government's objective as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to get the standard rate of income tax down to 25 per cent by 1993 and to implement further movement towards a single higher rate of tax.  The measures in this Finance Bill signal progress towards achieving that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that general reductions in the rates benefit all taxpayers and reduce the disincentive effects of high tax rates.  This, undoubtedly, is the correct way forward.  On the other hand, providing special rate structures for selected groups &mdash; no matter how deserving &mdash; serves only to impede the <Col N="2265" /> progress towards lower tax rates and therefore runs counter to Government policy.</P>
    <P>Attainment of the Government's objectives in the taxation field will lead to the disappearance of most of the anomalies of concern to Deputies and will result in a better and more acceptable tax system for every taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The cost of extending the doubled rate bands to one-parent families would be about £4 million in 1991 and £6.5 million in a full year.  If the married entitlement to mortgage interest and life assurance relief were also extended to single parent families, as should logically be the case, costs would be even greater.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out again for the benefit of the House that the income tax code provides some help for widowed and single parents.  Widowed persons have a widowed personal allowance which stands at £2,600 compared with the single person's allowance of £2,100.  Both widowed and single parents benefit from lone parent allowances which, combined with their basic personal allowance, give such parents effectively the same personal allowance as a married couple, that is, £4,200.  There is no denying that lone parents may have particular difficulties but there are very serious practical objections to giving the double rate bands to them.  I outlined those on Committee Stage and I will just mention them briefly here.</P>
    <P>Double rate bands would be of value only to lone parents taxed at the higher rates, and at present, only about 30 per cent of them are on the higher rates.  Any concession would, therefore, be one for the better off lone parents while doubling the bands for the rest would be a meaningless exercise.  Double rate bands are given to married couples because there are two adults to support.  In this situation there is only one.  If a concession were made for lone parents because they had children there would be immediate cause, of course, for concessions for parents on lower incomes who could not benefit from a doubling of the bands.  As I said, that applies to only 30 per cent, and those who are better off.  The <Col N="2266" /> Government would then have to withstand the same argument being made in other directions.  I must repeat that the basic problem is the burdensome nature of our income tax structure.  The Government are committed to improving the structure in time.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, the choices are there and have to be made.  The Government have chosen to reduce the rates first of all and then to try to improve the bands as we go along. As we reach our objectives by 1993 the other anomalies will be dealt with then.</P>

      <P>The Minister rightly says that the matter has been debated on Committee Stage.  I should like to merely pick up the point made by the Minister that in terms of relief we are talking about a section of lone parents who are on higher incomes or are better off, as the Minister put it.  &ldquo;Better off&rdquo; is, of course, a relative term.  One does not have to be too much better off to be subjected to marginal income tax rates.  Lone parents in those circumstances are likely to have heavy commitments for their dependants, with education and so on.  The case is meritorious, but, having regard to what the Minister said, I shall not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I promised the House on Committee Stage that I would introduce a Report Stage amendment to section 4 of the Bill, which section presently provides for the introduction of a special allowance, for the three years immediately following the year of bereavement, for widowed parents whose spouses have died since 6 April 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2267" /> The amendments now being moved secure that in so far as widowed parents whose spouses have died in the tax years 1988-89 and 1989-90 are still within the three year post-bereavement period they will be given allowances for the unexpired portion of that period at the appropriate level.  For example, a widowed parent whose spouse died in 1988-89 will get an allowance of £500 for the year 1991-92, while such a parent whose spouse died in 1989-90 will get an allowance of £1,000 for the year 1991-92 and an allowance of £500 for 1992-93.  This is in response to an amendment put down by Deputy Cotter, and I was sympathetic towards the issue anyway.</P>

      <P>The amendment relates to the position of elderly tenants in houses that are no longer rent controlled.  The concept of this relief was introduced in the Finance Act, 1982, as a result of the move to decontrol rent, which left many elderly couples having to pay the full economic rent for their flat or house.  The principle behind the amendment is clearly recognisable and is a very good one.  Last year I put down an amendment seeking to increase this relief, and I am pleased that the Minister has made at least a partial response to my request.  However, I feel that the Minister does not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I was trying to make last year, which the Minister has not taken on board fully, is that in rare cases the relief provided to a single person, a widow, or a widower should be the same as that provided to a married couple.  The substance of my amendment would be to give an allowance of £2,000 whether a person was married, single, or widowed; it would be a household allowance.  I know that the Minister has approached the issue from another direction, by <Col N="2269" /> allowing £1,000 to a single person, £1,500 to a widowed person and £2,000 to a married couple.</P>
    <P>The arguments I made last year still hold this year.  Certainly with regard to widowed people the situation is that invariably those affected are elderly and the flats or houses in which they live were originally designed for two people; one of those people has died, the rent and other outgoings remain the same, but the allowance is reduced.  I do feel that that is a very important point.  I am sure that the Minister could tell us the cost of implementing the amendment&mdash;it would be very small.  It behoves the House to seek out these people, however small in number they may be, and to try to introduce a caring income tax system in so far as that is possible.  I commend my amendment to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to support the amendment promoted by Deputy Garland.  I have myself put down an amendment very similar in intent.  The case made by the Deputy is a very fair one, and the House should not forget that it is a diminishing number of elderly tenants who are caught in this problem.</P>
      <P>It is ironic to come back to the distinction between widowed and single persons as compared to married couples, because the liability in this instance is the same whether or not one is widowed.  As Deputy Garland has said, the experience now is that those tenants are liable for the full economic rent.  The tenants are inevitably pushed over the present limits of tax relief, and it is a rather restricted area.  Those involved are predominantly elderly, their number is declining, and it cannot be too expensive to the Exchequer to implement this provision.  It is not fair to distinguish in this instance between a couple and a widowed person as elsewhere in the legislation.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge the fact that we have argued this year after year; organisations like Threshold have done a good deal of research to identify the hardship caused to senior citizens in this bracket.  Will the Minister give a sympathetic response to the arguments?</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Noonan, tabled two amendments in relation to this matter.  I fully agree with the two previous speakers in relation to rent allowance for people over 55 years of age.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, they do not constitute a significant number and sometimes the rents charged are excessive.  They are a vulnerable sector who, in many cases, do not qualify for local authority housing and indeed may not have the financial means to buy a house of their own.  One can be sure that the landlords are not giving any largesse in relation to rentals they charge.  Therefore, I fully support the amendment.</P>

Whatever way one looks at this, it is obvious that there have been substantial increases.  Although I understand the Opposition looking for larger increases, I have responded well in a difficult year.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In my lone crusade on behalf of the hard-pressed PAYE worker I, unashamedly, again take up the cudgels in relation to any opening presented on behalf of that section.  The history of the amendment <Col N="2271" /> will be very well known to the Minister, if my memory serves me correctly it emerged as a concession to the widespread public outcry against the unfairness of the tax system after the street protests over a decade ago.  At that stage &mdash;I cannot recall for sure &mdash; it was probably pitched at £500 but it has been eroded since then, not only in real terms, but in figures, to the level provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will always highlight the fact that relief should be given to people who do not have any opportunity to avail of the various allowances, reliefs and escape hatches available to other sections of the community.  It is the duty of the Opposition to exploit an opportunity to talk about the burden on the PAYE workers' shoulders and to support this amendment.</P>
    <P>One could make a great many arguments in support of the amendment, apart from the tax code.  The fact that we all pay social insurance &mdash; those of us who have it stopped from their wages &mdash; does not necessarily mean that we get social insurance when we need it and to the extent that we need it.  A large proportion of the population do not want to be in the VHI but for a great many people it is essential, for the protection of their families, that they should join it.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is unashamed pleading on behalf of the PAYE sector as this is an opportunity to give them additional relief.  On Committee Stage we spent a great deal of time going through specialist corporation and tax areas where those who can afford to buy skilled expertise and advice can minimise their tax bill. The people who have disposable incomes and who can avail of the expertise have a number of avenues open to them to diminish their tax liability but, by and large, that does not apply to the people encompassed by this amendment.  I ask the Minister to restore it to the £500 level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall when it was at £500, I do not think it ever was. The special PRSI allowance for higher rates through social insurance was first <Col N="2272" /> introduced in 1982 to offset the decline in disposable incomes caused by the increases in the high rates of PRSI and the imposition of the 1 per cent youth employment levy.  The amount of the allowance was then set at £312 and was not available to public servants and others who contributed at a lower rate of PRSI.  The relief was confined to 1982-83 and since then the allowance has never been treated as a permanent one and requires renewal on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>The relief, nonetheless, was reintroduced in 1983-84 at a rate of £286 and has remained at that rate.  The allowance is now being retained for the year 1991-92 at the rate of £286 at an estimated cost of £36 million and £58.2 million in a full year.  The cost of the additional increase of £500 would be £26 million in 1991 and £41.5 million in a full year.  It is another area which we can continue to debate but, when one adds up the cost of all the amendments, we are talking about a figure in excess of £1.5 billion, which is unrealistic in a year in which the budget deficit will be under pressure.  It is not a year in which any Minister for Finance with a sense of responsibility could extend the problems of the budget although, we hope, in the second half of the year, to correct some of the imbalances.</P>

      <P>When the Minister puts forward the total cost of these amendments it looks very impressive.  However, I am reminded of the answer that the late Peadar O'Donnell gave to the late Mr. de Valera when they had a discussion about the low point of emigration in the fifties.  Mr. de Valera said to Mr. Peadar O'Donnell &ldquo;if you were in power the same number of people would be leaving the country&rdquo; to which Mr. Peadar O'Donnell replied &ldquo;They might but they would not be the same people.&rdquo;  That is the attitude I adopt in a tax debate.  I would apportion the burden in a different way and would make other people carry some of the burden carried by PAYE earners at present.  We have no choice but to deal with the Bill as presented within the rules of the House and take it amendment by <Col N="2273" /> amendment.  It is very difficult to deal with it, in terms of trying to levy revenue. I have listened to what the Minister had to say and I will not be pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 16, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Acts, provisions of this section shall apply to all tax payers who are liable to pay PRSI at the full rate and/or are chargeable to income tax for the year 1991-92 and subsequent years of assessment under Chapter II of the Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to extend PAYE and PRSI allowances to all professional and business people.  Unlike The Workers' Party, the Green Party are a broad church and represent PAYE workers, small business people professionals, and small farmers.  Their size is more important than how they are categorised under the income tax system. Members will recall that the PAYE allowance was introduced many years ago to correct a perceived advantage which was really illusory to employers in the deferment in the payment of income tax.  In the meantime, that perception is gone.  However this is no longer the case since the introduction of self-assessment and current year assessment.  Given that employees and Schedule D taxpayers are now taxed on the same basis, if the PRSI and PAYE allowances are to continue, they should be extended to everyone in receipt of earned income.</P>
      <P>I am aware that my amendment is somewhat flawed and I had hoped that had it been discussed on Committee Stage it could have been tidied up.  I would like to have the principle accepted that all those in receipt of earned income should be treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be <Col N="2274" /> aware that section 9 of the Bill already provides for the granting of the PRSI allowance for those taxpayers who contribute to pay related social insurance at the higher rates.  The amendment refers to Chapter II of the Bill but Chapter II of this Bill relates to the relief for investment in corporate trades.  The amendment probably refers to Chapter II of the 1990 Finance Act.  The purpose of the amendment is to extend the PRSI allowance to the self-employed.  The cost of that proposal would be £4.7 million in 1991 and £7.8 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with the background to the introduction of this allowance which was to compensate employees in insurable employment for the substantial increase in social insurance contributions and the introduction of the youth employment levy in 1982.  It was confined to those employees liable at the higher rates of social insurance.  To that extent there is no justification for granting the allowance to the self-employed by reference to the fact that the basis of assessment of their liability to income tax was changed to a current year basis.  In so far as liability to social insurance is concerned, the position is that the self-employed are charged to social insurance for the year 1991-92 at 5 per cent.  This 5 per cent rate covers both an employer and employee element.</P>
      <P>The employee element is approximately 1.8 per cent compared to the normal rate of 5.5 per cent paid by employees.  The self-employed, therefore, cannot be said to be paying social insurance in respect of the employee element at the higher rates.  In the circumstances there is no justification for granting them the PRSI allowance and I am, accordingly, opposed to the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 39 of the Finance Act, <Col N="2275" /> 1986, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsections (2) and (3):</P>
    <P>`(2) Where, in the year 1991-92 or any subsequent year of assessment (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;the relevant year&rdquo;), the total income of an individual includes any relevant interest and, apart from section 35 (1) (b), the individual would be entitled to repayment of the whole or any part of the appropriate tax deducted from the relevant interest, then not-withstanding section 35 (1) (b), the repayment to which the individual would be so entitled may be made to him on the making by him to the inspector, not earlier than the end of the relevant year, of a claim in that behalf.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to have the refund paid much earlier than have a person wait until the end of the tax year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the repayment of deposit interest retention tax, better known as DIRT, to people who are exempt from tax.  It will be recalled that when introduced the DIRT tax was intended to be a non-refundable tax deduction with few exceptions. However, to avoid undue hardship to the most deserving of cases, the legislation makes provision for the refund of tax deducted to certain categories of taxpayers, including incapacitated persons and individuals whose spouses are aged 65 or over during the relevant tax year and who would otherwise not be liable for the full amount of DIRT deducted from their interest.  This covers at least some of those people at whom the amendment is directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question I should point out that there are a number of savings options open to which DIRT does not apply.  These include interest on Government securities, interest from credit unions and interest and bonuses from the three small savers schemes operated by An Post &mdash; savings bonds, saving certificates and national instalment savings. <Col N="2276" /> By switching to one or a combination of these it is possible to minimise the impact of the retention tax on interest income.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners introduced a series of measures to ensure that refunds of retention tax are made with the minimum of delay.  First, a special simplified return was introduced in respect of such refunds in 1986.  Second, the commissioners conducted a successful advertising campaign in the press and on radio last year to draw attention to the circumstances in which an individual is entitled to a refund.  Finally, since 1990 the Revenue Commissioners have been maintaining a computerised record of all taxpayers who qualify for a refund of DIRT so that these taxpayers will be issued automatically with a claim form in order to facilitate the following years' claim.  I understand that the procedures for refunds are working satisfactorily and that there are no undue delays in processing claims for such refunds, which is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I have considered exempting non-liable persons from DIRT but have not done so for the simple reason that it would cost a considerable amount of money, money which I cannot afford to do without given the many demands on the Exchequer.  Apart from the cost which is very difficult to gauge but which could be considerable, a refund system along the lines proposed in the amendment would absorb revenue resources on a large scale in administration and the checking of claims, etc. and thus divert them from the real job of tax collection to tax repayment.</P>
    <P>A refund system would also leave scope for abuse by means of account-splitting, used by tax liable persons, of bank accounts in the names of non-liable persons.  It was to prevent such abuses which were taking place on a wide scale that DIRT was introduced in the first place in 1986.  The position is kept under review and this will continue to be the case.  As of now, I see no prospect of movement in this regard at least in the short term until other major problems have been sorted out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is similar to the response I recently received from the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, in reply to a matter raised under the grievance procedure.  I have been concerned for some time about the way the DIRT system applies to old age pensioners and the mechanism under which they may reclaim it on completion of the appropriate documentation at the end of a specific tax year.  I understand that approximately £15.3 million was reclaimed at the end of 1990 and that in excess of 20,000 claims were made, the majority by old age pensioners.  It has been brought to my attention by accountants among others that older people are not resorting to the mechanism of trying to claim back their DIRT tax.  Whether we like it or not older people have their own fears and concerns about paper work.  DIRT is probably inhibiting savings despite the alternative saving institutions which the Minister mentioned in his response and many older people are retaining cash in their homes and are probably having the attendant problems which are associated with keeping cash around.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing a previous Finance Bill I made those observations which I am making again today.  I ask the Minister and his officials to study the feasibility of a system similar to the system that exists in England where older people do not have to resort to waiting until the end of the tax year to claim back the refund of deposit interest retention tax.  They have a simple procedure which seems to operate successfully and people are not burdened with having to go through the system.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would review the situation which prevails in the UK.</P>

      <P>I tabled a similar amendment last year to which I did not get an adequate response from the Minister.

I think this was a very good and worthwhile distinction.  Surely everybody in this House would agree that income earned by the sweat of one's brow, whether as an employee or <Col N="2279" /> employer is intrinsically of more value than income derived from investments or rents which in many cases were not earned by the person benefiting but perhaps went back a number of generations. Under the rules of the House I am not allowed to propose any increased charge to the taxpayer so it is not in order for me to propose an amendment that would eliminate the reliefs in respect of PAYE and PRSI allowances.  However, I would see such a move going hand in hand with the implementation of the proposal before the House.  Once again I ask the Minister to reconsider the position and to give serious consideration to my suggestion of earned income relief.</P>

      <P>The distinction between earned and unearned income was abolished in the Finance Act, 1974, which introduced a new, unified system of personal income taxation and abolished surtax.  Earned income relief, in consequence, disappeared under the new scheme.  To compensate taxpayers for the abolition of the relief substantial increases in personal allowances were granted.  For example, the allowance for a married person went up from £474 in 1973-74, the last year of the old system to £800 in 1974-75.  These allowances have, of course, been greatly increased in the intervening years so that now, for example, the married persons allowance is £4,200.</P>
      <P>Given that earned income as a concept no longer exists and that its removal was compensated for by increased personal allowances, as I have just outlined, the introduction of a relief based on that concept would be totally inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment would cost in the region of £478 million in a full year and that answers the real question but it might not answer it as far as Deputy Garland is concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;Sections 13 to 21 inclusive of the Finance Act, 1987, are hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again this is similar to an amendment I tabled last year and it deals with this most iniquitous withholding tax on professional fees.  I have recieved many representations in the past couple of years from various professional organisations on this matter.  Withholding tax was brought in under the Finance Act, 1987. It was a cynical attempt by the Government to provide a once and for all additional cash flow to the Exchequer.  It is probably unconstitutional and I think it should be challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very cynical exercise which impinges very much on professional people and I would remind the Minister that not all professional people are earning large sums of money.  Indeed a great many professional people have very high outgoings which all have to be paid and on top of that they have to pay withholding tax.  It is a very long time later before they get the inevitable refunds to which they are entitled.  Professional people are busy people who are serving the public and they should not have to put up with this extra degree of bureaucracy. The position is now considerably worse in that we now have a system of current year self-assessment so in effect what the Minister is doing is singling out certain <Col N="2281" /> taxpayers in certain categories and saying that perhaps it is thought they are earning too much money or they are evading tax &mdash; I have seen arguments such as &ldquo;doctors are fine, they are always evading tax&rdquo;. I do not accept that argument for one minute.  Some doctors may be evading tax and human nature being what it is, there are, but I suggest they are a very small minority and the income tax code should not be turned upside down as has been done in this case to deal with the occasional evasion of tax.  The laws are there to be enforced.  If doctors or any other professional people are evading tax they should be dealt with under the existing laws.  They should not be subject to this kind of draconian legislation which is clearly discriminatory.  I call on the Minister once again to consider seriously removing these offending sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from doing away with the scheme for the withholding of tax from payments for certain professional services, the immediate effect of Deputy Garland's amendment, if passed, would be to freeze all withholding tax now in hands for all time; credit could not be given for withholding tax deducted last year nor could interim refunds be made from now on.  I am sure this is not what the Deputy had in mind.</P>
      <P>However, even if the amendment was altered to allow credit and interim refunds in respect of tax deducted up to now, it would have a very critical effect on the budget arithmetic.  It would reduce the tax yield for the year 1991 by £23 million.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the anti-evasion element in the withholding tax scheme would be removed.  It is well recognised &mdash; in fact, it has been advocated by the Commission on Taxation &mdash; that withholding tax schemes are a very effective means of curbing evasion of tax through the non-declaration of receipts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that in 1987-88, the year in which the withholding tax system was established, the cash flow position of some taxpayers was adversely affected. However, the withholding tax scheme has now settled down and taxpayers are <Col N="2282" /> able to reduce their normal tax bills by the amount of withholding tax paid and not refunded in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation contains provisions which allow for interim refunds where the tax withheld exceeds the amount of the tax correctly payable.  The amount of the tax repaid is that excess, the balance being held as a credit against the tax liability of the following tax year. These refund provisions are operating satisfactorily and claims for interim refunds are given priority so that the turnaround time for claims is kept to the absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>It was recognised that the interim refund procedure might not be sufficient, in certain cases, to mitigate the particular hardship suffered in such cases.  Provision is, therefore, made for these cases by giving the Revenue Commissioners power to waive the ordinary interim refund conditions in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Last year, in response to the debate I asked the Revenue Commissioners to issue, for the information of the public, a set of guidelines covering the more commonly met circumstances of particular hardship.  In December 1990 the commissioners issued a statement of practice outlining a number of situations where they might agree to the waiving of some of the requirements for an interim refund, such as in circumstances in which the ordinary rules relating to an interim refund would operate in such a way as to be unreasonably harsh on a taxpayer.  In all the circumstances, I see no reason for accepting the amendment.</P>

    <P>(g)  in section 30, by the deletion of subsections (1) to (4), inclusive.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will desist from the previous speaker's exercise.  I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage but, because of the guillotine motion, we did not reach it.  It is a fairly substantial amendment and has to be read with Chapter III of the Finance Act, 1986.  The object of it was to make <Col N="2285" /> risk investment capital available for research and development and to provide a tax concession in relation to it.  The perception at the time was that there was not enough research and development moneys in the Irish economy.  This matter has been well researched and reported elsewhere and, having regard to the time limit today, I do not propose to go into it in any substantial sense.</P>
    <P>If we exclude the multinational Irish companies and some of the bigger indigenous Irish companies, particularly co-operatives, the amount of research and development being undertaken in Ireland is extremely small.  In response to a parliamentary question yesterday, the Minister indicated that a substantial amount of direct grant money was being made available for research and development. I put it to the Minister that that is not what I am talking about and in many cases the grants are conditional on the agency in question being satisfied that the project in question is worthy of grant support.  This introduces a level of intellectual and organisational prejudices on behalf of the grant lending agency.</P>
    <P>If we want to have the benefits of a market system which can produce a spark of an idea which, if it attracts risk capital, can be turned into something practical then we cannot exclusively depend upon State agencies being the determinant factor as to what constitutes the future development of technology.  Any person who looks at the curve of technological innovation in State controlled economies will see how restrictive that has been that it has had to the subsequent collapse of those State controlled economies in Central and Eastern Europe.  This related in part to the monopolisation of intellectual ideas.  If we give all grant giving or investment powers to State agencies a different set of values, prejudices and constraints will be unnecessarily imposed upon our system.</P>
    <P>I am trying to refute the point made yesterday by the Minister that there is sufficient investment capital around for research and development.  The existence of grants <i>per se</i> is not sufficient and the way in which the grants are administered <Col N="2286" /> is fraught with many difficulties, some of which I have alluded to.  On top of that, there is the question of the availability of risk capital in the broadest sense &mdash; I will refer to this point in greater detail on another occasion.  The combination of the curtailment of the business expansion scheme, the effective abolition of NADCORP and the current practice of the banks in relation to any kind of investment which is not asset-backed, has virtually dried up all sources of risk or venture capital in this economy at a time we need to promote growth.</P>
    <P>The perception among many customers of the two main banks, AIB and the Bank of Ireland &mdash; I do not in any way wish to cause offence to the Ulster Bank &mdash; is that the squeeze on their liquidity, particularly if they are small or medium sized enterprises, is caused in part because of the unfavourable experiences both banks have had in markets outside the domestic economy.  Indeed, the annual reports of those two banks indicate that the domestic market is fairly buoyant and that the difficulties being experienced by them arise elsewhere. The banks will be at pains to say that this is not the case, they are not squeezing the domestic market to subsidise or cross-subsidise unfavourable experience elsewhere, but the perception by their customers and prospective borrowers of risk capital which is not asset-backed is that this is precisely the case.  I put to the Minister, and his advisers in the Department of Finance, that notwithstanding the existence of grants through the mechanism of Eolas, and other finance granting research and development agencies, there is a shortage of venture capital. That shortage of venture capital has been compounded and made more acute as a result of the merger of NADCORP and the curtailment of the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>Against this background, there is more than ever a need for a system which will allow for venture capital to be attracted into research and development.  The Minister may say that the experience with the 1986 Act was not one he was happy with and that it demonstrated that there <Col N="2287" /> was very little evidence or demand for this kind of provision.  I presume the statistics on the number of people who qualified for this capital are available to the Minister and are probably in single figures. This is probably a very good reason for not going to the source that drafted the first section of the Finance Bill.  I am not purporting to rewrite Chapter III in its entirety but, perhaps, we should look at it in a less restrictive way.</P>
    <P>The system currently in existence, and which will lapse this year, is one where a person can go into a bookies shop with their investment bet and claim tax relief before the race starts.  The system I am proposing is one where a person can go into a bookies shop with their investment and if the horse wins that person can claim tax relief on the winnings.  In other words, it is success-led rather than insurance-led. If, for example, Members felt that someone had a great idea and we were prepared to invest £500 each out of our income and we subsequently made £1,000 profit we could not claim tax relief on that investment until such time as the profits had been made.  The call-down would not take place until 1995 at the earliest.  This, by definition, is a system whereby the Exchequer basically cannot lose.  The only person who can lose is the investor who invests in an idea that does not work.  If it does not work no profits are generated and if there are no profits generated it cannot be collected.  It is success led, success driven, rather than insurance driven.</P>
    <P>The proposal has been put to me by people who work in the area of research and development, of trying to promote new technologies, of trying to apply them to areas of product development in the Irish economy and who are responding to all the exhortations that we frequently hear from Minister of State for Technology and Science, from Ministers for Finance and Ministers for Industry and Commerce, people who are not in the risk area of enterprise.  These people are exhorting people in that area to be more creative, more inventive and who <Col N="2288" /> apply brains and technology to Irish natural resources so that new products can be created and the wealth that will flow from that will be subsequently generated.</P>
    <P>The one that is most frequently referred to as being the classic dream story of technology applied to natural resources creating worldwide profits and worldwide markets is Baileys Irish Cream which had its origins in a laboratory somewhere in the middle of London and was rescued just as it was about to be transferred to Ireland, and the rest, as they say, is history.  However, for a lot of the creameries around Ireland with the increasing impact of the CAP and the increasing impact of reductions on the traditional use to which milk is put, Baileys Irish Cream or that kind of product has been a lifesaver.  That came from a research and development idea.</P>
    <P>Regard must be had to investment into research and development.  The present economic climate is such that other than the very small number of people who are investing in it and from which the benefits will not flow naturally into the Irish economy, we only have this provision in the 1986 tax code and its general experience has not been satisfactory.  I can understand why the Minister for Finance is allowing it to lapse and has no plans to renew it.  I concede that it has not been successful in its present form.  One might ask, if something that is insurance-led rather than success-led has not succeeded, why should something that is even more risky such as what I am proposing be likely to be more successful.  I do not really know.  I think the provision should be in there.  There is not necessarily any cost to the Exchequer from what is implicit in this.  There is absolutely no charge on revenue for the next four years and any charge that might be on revenue would be implicitly a charge that would bring additional revenue to the Exchequer in its wake.  The internal sections of the amendment which proceed to reduce the period of relief from five years to four years to raise the threshold minimum amount investment from £200 to £500 are all consequential and self-explanatory.  The essence of the <Col N="2289" /> scheme is an appeal to the Minister to leave in the Finance Act some provision for tax relief for investment in research and development but to back-load it rather than front-load it which is the way the present system works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Both these amendments seek a renewal of the scheme of tax relief for investment in research and development, commonly know as the R &amp; D scheme.  As the House knows, this scheme expired on 5 April last.  Deputy Noonan's amendment now seeks a renewal of the scheme for a period of two years.  Deputy Quinn's amendment seeks a renewal of the scheme for a period of three years with certain modifications to the terms of the relief.  Briefly, the main elements of his suggested modifications to the scheme are: a reduction in the holding period for shares from five years to four years; relief to be given as a tax credit instead of a deduction from total income, the tax credit to be equivalent to 40 per cent of the amount invested; an increase in the minimum amount that can be invested in any one company from £200 to £500; removal of the facility for withdrawing relief in certain circumstances; the sponsoring company to be precluded from acquiring any share capital of the R &amp; D company; an easement in the clawback provisions where shares are disposed of within the holding period for tax relief; and removal of the special capital gains tax treatment on disposal of shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment also proposes that no claim for relief will be allowed before July 1995.  I am not sure whether that is his intention but, if it is, I doubt very much whether many taxpayers would invest in 1991 to get relief in 1995.  Any experience of tax incentive schemes in the last while shows the Irish investors, especially those who are trying to get into the risk area &mdash; and I agree with the Deputy's sentiments in relation to risk capital &mdash; tend to want to go into areas which are bricks and mortar or asset-backed, and the same philosphy, unfortunately, has permeated the Irish banking system for far too long.  They are <Col N="2290" /> unlikely to go into a scheme that is even more risky than the one that expired on 5 April.</P>
    <P>The scheme that expired on 5 April was wide open for all sorts of tax hedging, tax evasion and tax avoidance and, unfortunately, it had a poor record of take-up. The whole take-up of that scheme from the time it was introduced in the Finance Act 1986 has been extremely small.  The total investment to date up to 5 April was £160,000 by 30 investors in six companies.</P>
    <P>The attractiveness of the scheme really came into focus when the restrictions in the BES were put in place.  Then we saw one scheme that did qualify being advertised as a better scheme to avoid tax than the BES was.  Here is a scheme that was on the books from 1986 to 5 April 1991 and that was the only attraction it had.  The chances of attracting with a less attractive scheme as is proposed in these amendments is, in my view, extremely poor.</P>
    <P>However, there has been a major increase in the whole area of IDA investment in R &amp; D.  In 1987, for instance, the Government allocated £3 million to a budget for science and technology.  That budget now stands at £25 million and it is involved in quite a number of areas of research and development both at institutional level and at industrial level.  We have those two areas of direct help and grant aid to people in R &amp; D.  I subscribe to the sentiments of Deputy Quinn about the need for producing new products in Ireland for the future because of the changing market place.  However, there has always been extreme reluctance, despite the attractive schemes that were there.  Also in the BES scheme, which has been remodelled, there is an activity that qualifies for tax relief in that companies can raise £500,000 for research and development.  Judging by the amount of investment that went into the old scheme that expired on 5 April which is the subject of these amendments &mdash; only £160,000 over a five year period &mdash; it would seem that in all the areas I have mentioned, the IDA, the science and <Col N="2291" /> technology budgets and the BES scheme, the matter is well and truly catered for.</P>
    <P>We have had the experience where people who wanted to invest, first of all ploughed their money into areas where there were guarantees of one kind or another, where the risk was taken out and there was asset-backing of one kind or another.  That is not in the best interests of the economy and consequently I took the actions I did in relation to the BES.  The BES scheme provides more than adequate facilities for the level of assistance that was being looked for. To go back to the scheme that was there would run contrary to what we are trying to do in taking out the worst abuses of the scheme.  The Deputy's points are well and truly catered for under the existing structure both in the grants area and in the areas of the BES itself.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> For some time a difficulty has obtained regarding the provision of venture capital.  A number of efforts were made to solve the problem and the National Development Corporation, NADCORP, were set up to fill a gap in the provision of venture capital for worthy enterprises who would not get venture capital from commercial sources.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has now taken a decision to merge NADCORP and their functions with the IDA, and it remains to be seen whether in the much larger organisation they will have any clout, whether their function is being progressed or whether they will be a strong department of the IDA actively involved in the provision of venture capital.  Sometimes if one wants to abolish an agency it is politically easier to do it by merging them with a bigger one.  I am not sure what the intention is <Col N="2292" /> or whether NADCORP will carry out any significant function in future.</P>
      <P>The importance of research and development is recognised by all.  Any modern industrial economy must have R &amp; D and it has been industrial policy for many years now when attracting multi-nationals to this country to favour particularly and grant aid to a greater degree those multinationals who put in R &amp; D facilities in association with assembly plants which tend to be the majority activity in the country.  I have no quarrel with Deputy Quinn's proposal or the Minister's reply in so far as we are all agreed on the need for the provision of venture capital for R &amp; D whether that is being done by indigenous companies or by companies coming into the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banks have changed policy.  I was talking to a bank manager last Wednesday and he said it was the policy of the bank now as far as possible to develop their property portfolio and the mortgage end.  He put it very simply.  He said: &ldquo;If we got somebody in, a teacher, civil servant, garda, somebody in a permanent job, we arrange the mortgage terms and the contract runs for 20 or 25 years.  We get the interest for 20 or 25 years, we have the asset backing of the house which is the first security, but the security on the repayment is the fact that the person is in a permanent pensionable job, and can meet the payments.  We have the first call on the asset and we have the first call on the person's income.&rdquo;  He went on to say that if they succeeded in giving the person the kind of mortgage we were talking about this morning there would be an insurance premium as well, then there would be the mortgage protection policy and they would get a little from that.  He put it bluntly; he said the bank wins because it is getting income from three sources.  Then he suggested I contrast that with somebody who wants to set up a small business employing himself, maybe a member of the family and two more people and is looking for £30,000, a sum roughly equivalent to the mortgage he can afford.  He told me that was a nuisance, they would have to have somebody sitting on top of that for the <Col N="2293" /> five, six or seven years watching all the time to see if the repayments were coming in, whether the cash flow was there to service that loan or whether the enterprise would collapse.  He said the monitoring for the amount of money lent for that purpose is not worth while when it is contrasted with the ease of repayment on a mortgage once it is set up.  The other side is if that enterprise fails the person attempting it is going to be blacklisted everywhere and will never get another loan.  He said we could not have employment in the country or develop the indigenous base for industry unless there is away which allows venture capital to be delivered to genuine investors in the face of the risk that they will go under. In other investment policy cultures, particularly in the US and within the US particularly along the west coast, failure was never stigmatised in the way it is stigmatised here.  Many of the case studies of leading entrepreneurs in places like Silicon Valley reveal that the first business set up maybe in a garage, usually went under, went into liquidation and the entrepreneur lost money, but the stigmatisation and blacklisting across the financial institutions does not take place.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem in this country in the provision of venture capital.  It is very hard to get a bank in the first instance to lend small amounts on the basis of a good business idea and, secondly, it is very hard to get them to sustain their support over the period of set-up and marketing of the new product. Thirdly, it is virtually impossible for anybody who fails to get a second chance not only from the bank involved but from any of the other institutions all of whom &mdash; despite data protection legislation we passed here in the Dáil &mdash; seem to have automatic access to the way each credit rate their customers.  It is a problem.  The Minister may be right.  His reply on this provision was not taken up to any great extent with anything which seemed to create jobs and there seems to be an incipient movement to abuse the provision for purposes for which it was never intended.  Probably my solution to extend <Col N="2294" /> it for a further two years does not solve the problem I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>Let me say in a totally non-contentious manner and a non-political way, there is a problem in this area and I am not too sure what the solution is.  People in this House know that if we were to line up on the basis of who is in favour of privatisation and who is not, I would be one of the people tending towards privatisation and I would have nominated the Industrial Credit Corporation as one of the prime candidates for privatisation after the Sugar Company and Irish Life. I am beginning to have second thoughts now because it is effectively the only State bank and it seems to me that it may have a role in the provision of venture capital.  As we emphasise job creation it is well worth looking at an alternative way of refocusing, say, ICC.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have gone and they were a rescue bank.  NADCORP have gone. They used to provide venture capital and their role, their policy function has been transferred to the IDA and it remains to be seen whether they will keep it.  They had the right historically to take out shares anyway and they did not do it. This provision is now gone.  The banks' policy has changed, and they make no secret of it.  They tell you quite clearly that if they can develop their mortgage market in Ireland they will do it because it carries more advantage and less risk than lending into risky business.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said. When the budget for R and D was brought in under the new Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1987 it stated at £3 million and has risen now to £25 million.  That is very welcome.  I think we can distinguish between different types of research. There is a type of blue sky research where people explore the outer regions of science and that research is very hard to quantify in economic pay off.  Blue sky research is better left to the third level institutions and to the academies because it has no place anywhere near the factory floor.</P>
    <P>Another type of research which I might call applied research is the industrial <Col N="2295" /> application of the fruits of other people's discoveries to the development of new products.  That kind of research should be encouraged.  Across the spectrum of industrial policies which we apply there is a gap and it is not being filled by the grant schemes available through the Department of Industry and Commerce and the agencies.</P>
    <P>I will not be pushing the amendment because I accept what the Minister said. I am advocating another solution to the problem I have outlined, but I would like him to acknowledge that there is a problem and to look at it with the resources available to him.  Something is missing from our industrial development policy and it is very important to put it in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's response and his assertion that the BES effectively is an alternative route or source for potential funding.  The Minister should recognise at this stage that the BES, for whatever reason, has been tainted with an asset backed culture.  The changes proposed in the BES are attempting to remove that but, quite frankly, what we are witnessing is the slow death of the BES as a possible source of investment.</P>
      <P>The number of people in this economy who are capable of making substantial investments in BES type ventures is limited. The number of people who have that amount of disposable income, according to the PAYE statistics provided by the Revenue Commissioners, is very small.  Most of those who were able to raise money in the last two to three years have probably done so and the ceiling that has been built into the Bill before us means that the BES as an attractive new area for financial activity, has substantially peaked and will probably decline.  It was perceived and unashamedly touted as an asset backed system for investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that we will not renew the research and development provisions because they did not work, that the amount attracted for investment was <Col N="2296" /> miniscule and that the record is not good. To rely exclusively on the research and development grant from the Minister of State with responsibility for Science and Technology and to say investment opportunities are available under the BES is simply not enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims he has no responsibility as Minister for Finance for industrial policy, but the Government have, and this is just taking away another component of it.  If you remove any kind of explicit provision for tax incentives for research and development in the Irish economy and do not put anything in its place, other than a well intentioned reference to the BES by the Minister for Finance, then we are going backwards. The charge that can and will be made politically is that this Government have no coherent industrial policy.  I do not for one moment suggest that Chapter III of the 1986 Act was a satisfactory one, that is the reason I propose to change it.  I have no illusions about the amount of capital that is waiting to be invested in this area; it is actually very limited.  The approach was made to me by people within my own party who are in this area. They drew to my attention the fact that this is closing in and that this is limited territory.</P>
    <P>We agree there is a need for an innovative industrial policy.  There is nobody out there who will give us a living.  The late Seán Lemass used to say that nobody owed us a living, we would have to earn it ourselves.  I will not press the point but I put the Minister and the relevant Departments on notice that because this provision has lapsed and because of the Minister's refusal to take on board any kind of re-enactment or amended form of it, it sends out a very serious signal. This is not the last the Minister will have heard of this issue.  From an industrial policy point of view, the Government will have to respond to it.  As he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, is much more familiar with that territory than I. I can understand why he might have reservations about it but reliance exclusively <Col N="2297" /> on the BES <i>per se</i> is not sufficient or satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14&mdash;(1)  In this section `tax' means income tax or corporation tax as the case may be.</P>
      <P>(2)  (a) This section applies to a gift of money which, on or after 6th April, 1991, is made to the Minister for the benefit of the youth service and is not deductible in computing for the purpose of tax the profits or gains of a trade or profession or is not income to which the provisions of section 439 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, apply.</P>
      <P>(b) The Revenue Commissioners may consult with the Minister in relation to any question which may arise in connection with paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a person proves that he has made a gift to which this section applies and claims relief from tax by reference thereto, the provisions of subsection (4) or, as the case may be, subsection (5) shall apply:</P>
      <P>Provided that, in determining the net amount of the gift for the purposes of those subsections, the amount or value of any consideration received by the said person as a result of making the gift, whether received directly or indirectly from the youth service or any other person, shall be deducted from the amount of the gift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  For the purposes of income tax for the year of assessment in which a person makes a gift to which this section applies, the net amount thereof shall, subject to subsection (5), be deducted from or set off against any <Col N="2298" /> income of the person chargeable to income tax for that year and tax shall, where necessary, be discharged or repaid accordingly; and the total income of the person, or where the person is a wife whose husband is assessed to income tax in accordance with the provisions of section 194 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the total income of the husband shall be calculated accordingly:</P>
    <P>Provided that the relief under this section shall not be given to a person for a year of assessment&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the net amount of the gift (or the aggregate of the net amount of gifts) made by him in that year, being a gift or gifts, as the case may be, to which this section applies does not exceed £100, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the extent to which the net amount of the gift (or the aggregate of the net amounts of gifts) made by him in that year, being a gift or gifts, as the case may be, to which this section applies, exceeds £10,000.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a gift to which this section applies is made by a company&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the net amount thereof shall, for the purposes of corporation tax, be deemed to be a loss incurred by the company in a separate trade in the accounting period of the company in which the gift is made, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the reference in the provision to subsection (4) to a year of assessment shall be construed as a reference to an accounting period of the company.</P>
    <P>(6)  This section, in so far as it relates to income tax and corporation tax, shall be construed together with the Income Tax Acts and the Corporation Tax Acts, respectively.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to provide extra funding for youth services and to encourage the public at large to make contributions towards youth services. This year youth service funding has <Col N="2299" /> been drastically reduced.  A number of organisations will have to let staff go. Already, 35 staff have been let go by a number of organisations and by the end of the year it is expected that 50 will be let go because of reduced funding.  Very important programmes which were developed over the past three years will now have to be curtailed and in some cases abandoned altogether.  The Minister will be aware that youth services fill the gap where our education system fails and provide very important social and physical education for a large number of children.</P>
    <P>As I have said youth services are starved of funding.  If this amendment is accepted it would result in very little cost to the State.  It should be seen as an investment in children's future, not as a cost; it would encourage people to invest and take an interest in youth activities where their children could be involved and it would combat the shortage of funds because of the cutbacks by the Government and the Department of Education.  I earnestly request the Minister to consider this amendment favourably.  A similar provision was introduced in the budget by John Major in England and it has worked very successfully.  A large amount of revenue for youth services has been provided in this way.</P>
    <P>As regards costing, a similar provision was included in the 1986 Act as regards grants for sports and organisations but, I understand, it was never fully taken up or exploited.  This amendment would be warmly welcomed by youth organisations. If accepted, it will not be abused but will be used very profitably for the development of so many of our young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the sentiments of this amendment.  There seems to be a contradition in Deputy Deenihan's argument: on the one hand he said it will cost the Exchequer very little and on the other he said it would generate considerable revenue for youth services.  If it generates considerable revenue for the youth services it will cost the Exchequer a large <Col N="2300" /> amount of money because many people will claim the deduction.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual cost will depend on how many people avail of it.  If, as Deputy Deenihan predicts &mdash; and I think he is correct &mdash; a large number of people avail of it, then the cost to the Exchequer would be considerable.</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) of the amendment there is a proviso to prevent tax avoidance. Time does not allow me to go into this in detail but I would advise Deputy Deenihan &mdash; and I hope he will accept my advice as bona fide &mdash; that there is substantial room for tax avoidance within that proviso; it is by no means watertight. If the youth service is to be supported the proper way to do so is by direct Exchequer funding.  At present we use the system of tax deductions to direct money into particular areas of the economy. The best way to deal with youth services is by direct Exchequer funding rather than tax deductions.  If we are to use the system of tax allowances and tax deductions to fund such activities I can think of many more deserving cases than the youth service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 2, 6 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Since November 1990, ten officers in my Department are engaged full time on special investigations into the illegal use of Beta-agonists, the substances known as `angel dust'.  These officers supplement the activities of over 400 veterinary inspectors and other authorised officers at meat factories and in district veterinary offices, who as an integral part of their normal duties react to suspicion or evidence of use of any illegal growth promoting substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where evidence of illegal use of these substances is found the matter is referred <Col N="2303" /> to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for prosecution.  A number of cases are in hand and summons will issue very shortly.  So far prosecutions are proposed in 17 cases.</P>
    <P>Since January 1991, there have been six seizures of illegal growth promoters. Evidence of illegal use of growth promoting substances has been found in 27 herds and laboratory analysis has confirmed the use of such illegal substances in 317 animals.  In the case of detection at meat factories the carcases concerned have been condemned and live animals will be excluded from the food chain either with the owners consent or by court order.</P>
    <P>Both my Department's meat control laboratory and the State Laboratory operate to the highest international technical standards and constantly keep abreast of the latest developments in analytical techniques.  They participate in regular meetings and workshops with colleagues engaged in similar work in other member states.  A variety of methods are employed in testing, depending on the material being analysed.  The current methods of detection and confirmation are more than adequate and are similar to those employed in other member states.</P>
    <P>Testing methods are approved annually at EC level as part of national residue testing programmes.  Naturally as technology advances and more appropriate methods and techniques are developed or perfected, they will be introduced.</P>
    <P>The Regulations which I introduced in 1988 and 1990 provide certain powers for members of the Garda Síochána to act independently to detect and apprehend those engaged in the distribution and use of illegal drugs.  The officers of Customs and Excise enjoy considerable additional powers under the Customs Consolidation Acts.  In order to address this imbalance, following consultation with my colleague the Minister for Justice and with the Garda authorities, I have decided to give all members of the Garda Síochána the full range of powers available to authorised officers.  Regulations to this effect <Col N="2304" /> are at an advanced stage of preparation. Additional powers are also proposed, which are similar to those available to the members of the Garda Síochána under the Misuse of Drugs Act, to stop, search and arrest persons suspected of being involved in dealing with illegal veterinary drugs.  In addition I have been pressing for harmonised action at Community level.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that responsibility for this problem should be laid clearly where it belongs.  Those unscrupulous people who would supply, use or encourage the use of substances like angel dust threaten not alone the image of our meat industry but its future viability.  Legislation and enforcement are only part of the equation.  It must have the wholehearted support of the beef industry generally. I know the representative associations all condemn this illegal activity.  Members must heed their associations and work actively against the use of these substances.  The problem can be eliminated very quickly if the collective will is there.  I, therefore, urge all persons who are using or encouraging the use of such substances to consider the dire consequences of their actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that spreads were introduced onto the market in Ireland in 1985 and that a range of products manufactured wholly or partly from non-dairy ingredients has been developed both within and outside the Community in recent years as substitutes for dairy products.</P>
      <P>Prohibitions by other member states on the import and sale of dairy substitutes have been overturned by the European Court of Justice.  Quite apart from any legal difficulties which might arise, a ban on the manufacture of dairy products in Ireland would, therefore, be ineffectual in the absence of controls on imports.</P>
      <P>However, action has been taken at Community level regarding the marketing of dairy substitutes by the adoption of Council Regulation 1898/87 which prohibits the use of dairy terms or imagery in the advertising of products which are not made exclusively from milk. Action has already been taken by my Department in a number of cases to enforce the requirements of this regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any statistics which tell us how much dairy produce is being displaced from the marketplace by the use of these imitation products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The butter sector has been most affected by this development.  In Ireland since the introduction of spreads on to the market in 1985, they have been responsible, certainly in part, for the dramatic decline in butter consumption from a level of 31,000 tons in 1985 to 13,000 tons annually at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the European Court has deemed that the prohibition of the use of these substances is not legal, would the Minister speak to the dairy co-operative movement in an <Col N="2306" /> effort to get a voluntary agreement, so that the use of these spreads and imitation products could be reduced if not eliminated immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's sentiments in this regard.  The impact of the development of spreads on the dairy sector has been significant, as has been underlined by the statistics I just quoted. I can certainly ask the dairy co-operatives to look at this.  From time to time the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, speaks out clearly on this issue.  Anything we can do to advise the dairy co-operative of the necessity to emphasise the importance of butter sales will be done.  It has clear implications for the dairy industry if the level of consumption of butter continues to decrease.  What Deputy Deasy has said will certainly be considered.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that ordinary individuals will have an opportunity to apply through the programme and to be successful in obtaining grants?  Is it not the case that big organisations, such as the co-operatives and Teagasc, are putting together particular proposals, and will the fact that only two programmes are to be accepted from each region not mean that the ordinary individual has no chance to be approved for any of these proposals?</P>

      <P>The Government are proceeding on the basis that there will be about 12 plans for Ireland generally, with about 100 groups in the communitywide scheme.  Individual projects will have to be incorporated and integrated into a business plan for each of those 12 regions. As I said in my original reply, the process of creating awareness and informing community groupings generally of what is involved and what is necessary for them to have their projects included is actively under way.  Countrywide there is considerable awareness about what is needed to participate.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the number and grade of all staff assigned in his Department to implement and oversee the EC Commission operational programme for rural development; the total amount involved in this programme and the period in which it will be spent; if he will outline the method being used to monitor the allocation of this expenditure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of EC and State funds envisaged under the Operational Programme for Rural Development, which will cover the period 1991 to 1993, is about £104 million.  The EC LEADER initiative on Rural Development is additional to the operatonal programme. A monitoring committee representative of the EC Commission and the various Departments and State bodies concerned, together with the social partners, has been established to monitor and oversee the implementation of the programme.  This Committee is chaired by an official of my Department. In addition, of course, all disbursements under the programme will be subject to the normal controls and procedures governing expenditure by the State.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Rural Development comprises a number of individual measures which are dealt with by various divisions within my Department and the other Departments and State bodies concerned.  I have established a specific division within my own Department with general responsibility for ensuring effective implementation of the overall rural development policy. This division is headed by a principal officer with the appropriate supporting staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the Department of Agriculture and Food disburse the various amounts mentioned in the press release to the individual Departments, who then apply their own criteria <Col N="2310" /> before spending it on the various categories? When is it proposed to give those Departments the amounts of money mentioned so that they can proceed with the options?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that of necessity there must be consultation between the unit, the Department, and the different State bodies and State agencies involved.  Consultation occurs on an ongoing basis.  The drawing down of funds would be very much dependent on whether the various projects eligible for aid come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two further questions. Does that mean, for instance, that the Department would give money to the Department of Energy for that Department to spend the money on forestry production or, indeed, on forestry roads, which are now in an appalling condition? Is there not an inherent disadvantage in all of that, for instance, under the aspect dealing with animal production, in that many parts of the country are unsuitable for the breeding of sport horses; for the rearing of deer, goats, commercial rabbits; or for greyhound breeding, as is mentioned in the release?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The different headings under which grant aid is available will be suitable for different parts of the country. It is reasonable to assume that applications for aid will come forward on that basis.  It is highly unlikely that someone in Mayo, for instance, would submit an application for consideration if its potential and viability were not suitable having regard to the physical characteristics of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly welcome the separate division and accept that they <Col N="2311" /> will consider applications in a professional manner.  However, the problem with most EC schemes is that grants are taken up by larger groupings and the small people do not receive the financial aid.  I hope that on this occasion cognisance will be taken of that and that there will not be just a pound for a pound grant but also an acceptance of the various projects put forward, especially from rural areas, under the rural development scheme.  I hope that those making decisions will be flexible and will take into account the financial position of groups that apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

I agree with Deputy Farrelly that the terms of <Col N="2316" /> reference of the scheme are so grandiose they are well beyond the qualifying limits of the vast majority of people who should be the beneficiaries?

Dry stock farmers are going to the wall and thousands are leaving agriculture every year.  Does the Minister think that this agri-tourism project, the LEADER project and the programme for rural development, will stem the flow of people leaving the land?

The areas with potential for development have been identified and when they come on stream which I hope they will, because of their labour intensive nature, we will come to terms with our difficulties because of lack <Col N="2317" /> of employment opportunities on our farms.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that much damage could be done to the scheme because of the difference between the terms of the 1989 scheme and the present one?  Under the 1989 scheme only 20 per cent could go towards providing accommodation but now, in disadvantaged areas it can go as high as 50 per cent.  It is important not to mix the two, it would give the scheme a bad name as it has been modified and changed to benefit the provision of accommodation.</P>

      <Quest>if, in the policy preparation for the review of the community milk quota programme in March, 1992, his Department will be putting forward the proposal of detaching the quota from the farm; and if so, if there has been a full study carried out of the regional implications of such a policy.</Quest>

      <P>The EC Commission is committed to examining the operation of the super-levy regime and to submitting its report to the Council of Ministers.  While it was envisaged that the report would be prepared before the end of March 1991, it is now expected to accompany the proposals for the reform of the CAP.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to predict any Council decision on the future operation of the milk quota system.</P>
      <P>I did, however, ask the Milk Quota Review Group to consider the possible implications of detaching the quota from the land under a revised system.  The general consensus of the group, and I can accept their recommendation in this matter, is that quota should remain land-linked as a general rule but that the regulations should provide for flexibility in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>There is a limit of three ewes per acre of mountain grazing on which payment may be made under the sheep headage scheme in Ireland's disadvantaged areas and I am satisfied that this restriction operates by and large to prevent overgrazing in upland areas.</P>
      <P>If any definite evidence of overgrazing arising from that scheme is tendered to my Department, it will be considered carefully, of course, to see whether any changes in the scheme are necessary.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that he will get plenty of complaints from me as a result of his response.  I have had considerable correspondence and telephone calls from environmentalists and ecologists in this area.  Would the Minister agree that there has to be a better way of keeping these farmers on the land &mdash; I accept that they should be kept on the land &mdash; and enabling them to earn their livelihood than paying this absurd premium on ewes, which bears no resemblance to reality and is subsidised by the EC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme has proved absolutely invaluable in areas where the aid has been available in keeping many farm families on their holdings.  Certainly on the basis of the statistics I have, the suggestion that there is overcrowding is not borne out, but if the Deputy has specific examples and conveys them to the Department they can be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the Community is approximately 82 per cent self-sufficient in sheep meat.  Given the restrictions in different farm enterprises we would have to be very careful about the suggestion in the Deputy's supplementary question, <Col N="2328" /> having regard to the fact that it is an invaluable source of income for many farmers around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme has been an invaluable source of livelihood for thousands of farmers over the years.  The Minister said there was a limit of three ewes per acre.  Is there now a trend towards paying a higher premium for a better quality ewe and a better quality lamb?  Does the Minister envisage any changes in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any specific proposal for change in that regard. The Deputy will be aware that in recent times there are restrictions on the number of payments that can be made to individual flock owners.  There has been a very significant increase in the number of sheep in the country generally.  It was around five million way back in the mid-eighties but there has been a significant increase in that figure, so naturally the scheme will be considered in that light.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> drawn up by the Government in 1987 provided for the creation, over five years, of 2,200 new jobs in the beef, pig processing and sheepmeat industries.  Up to the end of 1990 the number of new jobs created in those industries was 3,213.</P>

      <P>It is fair to say that there has been a process of rationalisation in the agri-food sector and jobs have been shed, but conversely there has been an increase in the number of jobs created.  The very fact that the target set out in the programme in 1987 has been exceeded to the extent it has is commendable.  For the benefit of the House I will give the figures. The projected increase for the beef sector was 1,000 jobs while the actual number was 1,939 jobs; the projection for the pig meat sector was 1,000 but the actual increase was 1,134.  In the sheep meat industry the projection was for 200 new jobs and the actual number was 140.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 142 of 4 December 1990, volume 403, No. 4 column 856 to 857.</P>
      <P>The statutory board, set up under the Bord Glas Act, 1990, have recently finalised their recruitment of staff.  Estimates of horticultural output for 1990 show that a number of sectors, such as mushrooms, hardy nursery stock and soft fruit, are making satisfactory progress.  Progress has also been achieved in production and exports of some field vegetables such as cauliflower and celery.</P>
      <P>In the potato sector the board have co-funded the employment of a market coordinator by the IFA with a view to bringing more order and organisation into this area.</P>
      <P>Some 990 full-time and 850 part-time jobs have been created in horticulture since the interim Bord Glas were established in 1987.</P>
      <P>An Bord Glas have been encouraging increased investment in horticulture.  It is expected that the funds being made available under the operational programme for rural development for the three year period up to the end of 1993 will be instrumental in achieving a substantial increase in investment in the sector.</P>

      <P>I do not have the Minister's reply to Question No. 142 of 4 December in front of me but I will study it later.  I am surprised at the Minister's reply.  He did not seem to indicate that any progress had been made since An Bord Glas were established under an Act of the Oireachtas on 21 February 1990, <Col N="2331" /> 15 months ago.  It would seem from what the Minister said that they are still trying to get staff.  Is the Minister saying that An Bord Glas have not gone into business and that the interim Bord Glas set up in 1987 are still in operation?  It appears that nothing has happened since the Act setting up An Bord Glas was passed.  An Bord Glas seem to be a dead body.  The rumours in regard to the importation of vegetables by people connected with them are disturbing.  In reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Deenihan on 23 April, the Taoiseach said that imports of fruit and vegetables amounted to £217 million in 1990.</P>

      <P>No distinction was made in that reply between imports of fruit and imports of vegetables.  I do not put any blame on the Minister with responsibility for horticulture for fruit imports.  A figure of £620 million has been given for imports of fruit but obviously, this was an error and should have been £62 million or a figure in that region.  That was the only reply I could find which referred to the amount of vegetables imported.  Will the Minister explain why this figure is so high and how An Bord Glas have improved the situation since they were set up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Mac Giolla's observation in relation to An Bord Glas.  They operated as an interim board until recently when they were established on a statutory basis. They have completed the recruitment of staff.  The interim board worked well but naturally when they assumed their statutory role they became even more significant. Clearly we are very much on <Col N="2332" /> target in reaching the number of jobs set in the development programme.  We have created 990 full-time jobs and 850 part-time jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>If this cannot be used as a barometer of the progress which has been made I do not know what can.</P>
      <P>The point so far as the industry is concerned is that the major development has been taking place in exports.  There has been a very significant development in mushroom production which by its very nature is tailor made for our small farm structure.  A significant number of jobs have been created in that sector.  For example, in 1987 mushroom exports were valued at £12.9 million while exports for 1990 are estimated at £35 million and are expected to reach £45 million by 1992. Developments have also been made in the export of celery to niche markets in Britain from areas in north County Dublin and elsewhere.  The reality is that we are rapidly coming to terms with the areas which have potential for import substitution.  It would be simplistic for me to say that every area under the general umbrella of horticulture has potential for 100 per cent import substitution.  That is not the position because of climatic considerations, economies of scale and inbuilt disadvantages with which we have to contend.</P>
      <P>The board have appointed four marketing executives and I can assure the Deputy that they are actively working alongside their sister body Teagasc, who have responsibility for research and develoment, in accelerating development. We introduced the grant-aid scheme for potatoes under the operational programme and a new scheme for commercial horticulture.  The fact that 506 applications were submitted up to 31 March last clearly indicates the increasing interest by those in the industry to get projects under way.  The figures I have given for the number of jobs created and the volume of exports in the mushroom sector clearly underline the wellbeing of the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the information I have here there are 28 exporting plants in the State and 38 officers are involved in operating the scheme.  They are on the SEO grade and naturally they are people of considerable experience in the operation of the scheme.  I understand there is a process of rotation of officers from different plants around the country. I could understand if farmers felt aggrived because the same officer dealt continuously with an area, but I understand there is a process of change of personnel and from the point of view of the operation of this scheme that must be very worthwhile.  There is a supervisory tier and there is provision for appeal to the supervisor on an informal basis where there is a feeling of dissatisfaction.</P>

      <Quest>if having regard to his speech to the conference on the The Horse Business at Thomond College, Limerick on 16 January 1991, he will outline the structural changes he wishes to see in the horse racing industry; if, in particular, he has any plans to make the organisations which control horse racing any more accountable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The body charged with the responsibility for the improvement and development of the industry is the Racing Board which was established under the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945 I am at present having legislation drafted which will amend and update certain provisions of this Act including that relating to the composition and constitution of the board.  I hope to introduce a draft Bill in the House in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that the Minister sees the need to revamp racing for infrastructural changes in the racing sector in particular.  As to what amendments will be made to the Racing Board Act, 1945, the Minister's reply was rather vague.  I particularly wish to know if it is intended to assist the small race courses and smaller breeders, particularly national hunt racecourses, rather than the up market Curragh and Leopardstown courses.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that some of these racecourses are keeping going by a miracle year after year and that some are on the verge of collapse. We have already had a major racecourse here in Dublin, the Phoenix Park, collapse. However, I am talking about ones which have only a couple of race meeting a year.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if the structural changes have any particular purpose. The Minister seemed to be putting the emphasis on the need for racing from the tourism point of view which would be closely allied to Bord Fáilte.  That was something that worried me very much because I thought the Minister for Agriculture and Food was the man who should be most closely aligned with it.  Had the Minister anything particular in mind when he spoke of restructuring?  Did he have any particular type of racecourse, any type of breeder in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister for Agriculture and Food referred at all to structural changes that he might or might not wish to see in the horse racing industry.  On the question of aid or assistance towards development, the Racing Board are appointed by the Minister and their responsibility is the improvement and development of horse breeding and horse racing generally.  Recently £12 million in grant aid was allocated to be spent over the period 1990 to 1993 to assist with such development.  Naturally the members of the Racing Board would be the people in the best position to gauge what the priorities should be as far as expenditure is concerned and I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Food <Col N="2337" /> will be having due regard to the recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that in this new legislation a degree of democracy will be brought into the affairs of horse racing in this country.  At present the Minister appoints the Racing Board.  Unfortunately the Racing Board do not control racing.  Racing is controlled by a small group of self appointed individuals who might classify themselves as aristocrats or the like and they are not appointed by any Government Minister, nor by any democratic system; they are known generally as the Turf Club and they have absolute control of racing here.  Does the Minister foresee that this legislation will eliminate that undemocratic system so that we will have a proper system that is answerable to this House and to the public in general?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Turf Club administer the rules of racing.  They have filled that role for the past 200 years and, I suppose, like every other regulatory body they have their critics.  I cannot say that I have personal experience of the difficulties on the race track so I am at a disadvantage in answering the question, but the criticism of the Turf Club by Deputy Deasy would appear to be unwarranted.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the very trenchant criticism by our most successful racing trainer on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; recently when he strongly condemned the whole administration of racing and looked for root and branch changes in the administration of racing?  Are his views as a man of great knowledge in this area not going to be at least considered for the betterment of the whole racing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the industry is so substantial and that more than 12,000 are employed &mdash; a significant number of organisations are involved &mdash; I am sure <Col N="2338" /> the provisions in the legislation will reflect the needs of the day.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister of State here said the Minister did not call for structural changes in his speech in Thomond College.  In fact, the Minister said specifically that structural changes would be needed in the racing sector.  I am interested in what he had in mind.  I hope the Minister of State will convey to him some of the concerns in this House.  I agree with Deputy Deasy in regard to the interference of the Turf Club in the business of the Racing Board. I also agree that the rules of racing are supposed to be their job, but they are concerned in more than that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>whether this country is running out of cold storage space for holding intervention foodstuffs, because of the high level of stocks in intervention; if there are plans to hire cold storage space abroad or to place food in freezer ships; if the Government have any plans to reduce the level of stocks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the situation with regard to the availability of cold storage space for both butter and beef sold into intervention is giving some cause for concern having regard to the current high level of stocks, continuing needs for current intake and the low level of disposal by way of sales in the past six months.  By the end of May, some 27,500 tonnes of Irish intervention butter will be stored abroad and some 14,000 tonnes of butter will be stored in two refrigerated ships in Irish waters.</P>
      <P>Discussions are in progress with the cold storage interests with a view to establishing what extra capacity can be created to meet medium term needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2341" /> Intervention product is the property of the EC and Ireland has consistently urged the EC to legislate for the sale and-or disposal of product out of intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that we no longer have any storage space and that we have to send 27,000 tonnes of butter abroad.  Does this mean extra cost of storage?  Have we to pay for the storage of the 27,000 tonnes abroad?  Are our costs increasing while we look for extra storage space in more remote places such as ships, etc?  What are the increased costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that specific information.  The Deputy will have to put down a separate question on it, but as I said in my reply, there has been a build up of stocks for various and varying reasons and it is causing concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The most interesting part of the Minister's reply is the information that 14,000 tonnes of butter was going to be stored in two ships.  Is this about to happen?  This seems to be a reflection of what happened in the early seventies when we had ships moored in Bantry Bay.  It is incredible to think we could have a repetition.  When will these ships take the intervention stocks on board? Where will they be located?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information with me but, as the Deputy will appreciate from his time in the Department of Agriculture, the problems with the present build up of stocks are a cause of concern.  Naturally there is an accumulating cost.  The possibility of disposing of some of these stocks naturally will have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this enormous increase in stocks in intervention and storage and the possibility of it going bad at some stage, is the Minister for Agriculture and Food pressing within Europe that these stocks be used now for the starving people in Africa whom we see practically every night on TV and about whom people all over the country <Col N="2342" /> are so concerned?  They will be even more concerned when they hear that all our stores are packed with intervention food and that it would be much cheaper for ourselves and the EC to give it away to those who are starving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>One can glean from the fact that the concern about the build up of stocks is such that the matter of their disposal is under consideration at present, but I would be getting into the realms of anticipation if I say what might or might not be done with them.  The cost of transport and the suitability of the product for use in particular areas where there is a need for food must be considered. The EC Agriculture Commissioner referred to this point in the last few days.  Consider frozen meat, for instance, taken to remote areas, its suitability for use there and the cost of getting it to these locations.  These are the logistical problems.  To say we have a huge volume of stock here yet people in other parts of the globe are starving tends to simplify the point.  On a superficial examination one can see the contradictions in the two situations.  It is not as simple as the Deputy implies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is on the same lines.  In the light of the international tragedies, surely it is not beyond the wit of people in this country, particularly in answer to all who have contributed so generously to fund raising events, to see that our Government endeavour to arrange that these extra foodstuffs be transferred.  We claim our foodstuffs to be of excellent quality, and surely they must be better than grass, or nothing at all, which are the alternatives for many people who face starvation at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally any product that would lend itself to easy transport and easy distribution and use at the point of destination should be transferred from the point of plenty to the point of scarcity, but it is not that simple.  There are problems. The whole question of a stock build up is under consideration at present <Col N="2343" /> having regard to the position in the industry and the storage costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not scandalous that our stores of intervention food are overflowing while, as Deputy Mac Giolla said, millions of people are starving?  The sight of ships at anchor in Irish bays with additional food storage will aggravate the dreadful public perception of this situation. I do not think it will be acceptable. It would be far better if the Minister said to the EC: &ldquo;Give that food away to the starving millions in the world rather than have it there going to waste in full sight of the general public in this country.&rdquo; Because eventually it will either be sold to the Russians for 10p a pound or it will be dumped as unfit for human consumption.  Is it not a source of great scandal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is an obvious contradiction.  It is a question of having supply and plenty in one location and a scarcity in another.  Whether the product is suitable for use at these destinations of scarcity and getting it from these shores to the parts of the globe where it is needed are the problems which must be overcome.</P>

    <P>Provided that, in determining the net amount of the gift for the purposes of those subsections, the amount or value of any consideration received by the said person as a result of making the gift, whether received directly or indirectly from the youth service or any other person, shall be deducted from the amount of the gift.</P>
    <P>(4) For the purposes of income tax for the year of assessment in which a person makes a gift to which this section applies, the net amount thereof shall, subject to subsection (5), be deducted from or set off against any income of the person chargeable to income tax for that year and tax shall, where necessary, be discharged or repaid accordingly; and the total income of the person, or where the person is a wife whose husband is assessed to income tax in accordance with the provisions of section 194 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the total income of the husband shall be calculated accordingly:</P>

      <P>Everybody agrees with the sentiment of this motion, that those who are engaged in youth services are doing important and valuable work.  Nevertheless, we are engaged here in an exercise of not narrowing the tax base but attempting to widen it to bring benefits to all taxpayers.  This amendment, if accepted, would narrow the base rather than widen it.  Already £9.8 million has been allocated this year as against £8.9 million last year.  That is not a cutback. We are all aware that inflation is running at less then 3 per cent.  In addition a further £5.6 million is provided for sports organisations where our young <Col N="2380" /> people would be the principal beneficiaries. When you contrast that with pre-1988 when £1 million to £2 million was spent by the Exchequer on youth services, then one can see that since the advent of the lottery, youth services have been the recipients of significant allocations.  We would all like to give them more but that is the reality.  There is no point in talking about a budgetary situation in the UK where they do not have a lottery from which such amounts of money can be allocated to youth organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised at the Minister's response.  I was disappointed at Deputy O'Dea's response and certainly he did not endear himself to the youth organisations this morning by implying that this was not a very worthy cause.  I put down this amendment not because it would be a cost to the Exchequer but to give an opportunity to people to invest in the youth services and to give them an incentive to do so. Whatever money we spend on young people is a good investment.  Nevertheless it is obvious that the amendment will not be accepted.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that whereas the allocation for youth work in general has been increased this year, the amount for various youth organisations has been reduced drastically in some cases.  As a result 35 people have already lost their jobs and more will follow.  Expenditure for the programmes in general has been increased but for the various youth organisations there have been marked and drastic reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to convey to his Cabinet members my personal disgust and that of the youth organisations. These people will be on the streets shortly; they will make it very awkward for the Government and they have every right to do so.  Their plight has been totally ignored both in this House and in general. These are the people who provide the service our education system should provide for all our young people.  In withdrawing the amendment I would like to <Col N="2381" /> express my dissatisfaction at what is happening in the overall youth service.  It is totally unfair and it is an abandonment of our young people by the Government.</P>

      <P>A sum of £4.8 million was allocated to disadvantaged youth. There has not been a breakdown of where that went.  I would like to see a breakdown showing where that half of the allocation went &mdash; to youth or community groups or to what area?  The Minister cannot say sufficient money has been allocated to youth organisations.  The fact that many of our youth have fled the country has influenced the Government in ignoring them.  Five, six or seven years ago youth held centre stage when special youth employment levies were imposed. Our youth were our greatest resource but now they have gone and the Government have lost interest.  This is no longer top of the agenda.  That is the main point Deputy Deenihan was trying to make and I support it.  The Minister should try to get the youth organisations back on centre stage and give them sufficient resources to expand.  A report issued in 1984 estimated that the amount of funding needed <Col N="2382" /> for youth organisations was £20 million. They are now getting £9.7 million.  That is totally inadequate.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Deputy Rabbitte is conveniently absent.  It is hard to rationalise the logic behind this amendment when one reads the budget night debate when he advocated the opposite to what he is advocating now.  The Deputy said then that if we were serious about the BES we should not curtail it. This is the biggest U-turn in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 31 was ruled out of order.  Is he not lucky?  It is no harm to mention it anyway, because the Deputy tried to convince me yesterday that he had not made a U-turn. Amendment No. 32 is difficult to reconcile with Deputy Rabbitte's approach on Second Stage, when he was highly critical of the introduction of transitional arrangements.  We introduced transitional arrangements in response to hardship cases where small operators had committed themselves under legal contract to carry out certain work and the season would be too short to enable them to use normal borrowing requirements to repay money.  The transitional arrangements took those hardship cases into consideration. Deputy Rabbitte was very critical of that and now he wants to broaden the transitional arrangements I introduced.  I do not understand the Deputy's logic.  This was debated on budget night in a fair and open manner and I met the arguments put forward then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the amendment.  There were <Col N="2383" /> abuses that needed to be rectified.  Big operators could use and abuse the BES to the exclusion of small operators.  This was a good scheme but it has to be properly focused.  The changes I have made will refocus the scheme on small companies who cannot borrow in any other way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 24, line 3, to delete &ldquo;£500,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£2,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The net effect of this amendment is to increase the amount a company can borrow under the BES.  It stands on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the BES only 35 out of 239 companies raised more than £500,000 and that is why I set the figure at £500,000.  Under the scheme some 115 companies raised amounts of £50,000 or less.</P>
      <P>Indeed, from the start of the BES up to the end of the 1989-90 tax year 55 per cent of all investments were less than £50,000 while over 90 per cent of the amounts raised were less than £500,000. On the reasonable assumption that this pattern will continue, the vast majority of the remaining eligible firms will still be able to raise required funds through the BES.  All that is changing is the cost to the Exchequer which has arisen from a small number of expensive, largely asset-backed and risk free projects.  The statistics clearly show that a BES capital ceiling of £500,000 is more than adequate for most companies' needs.  As we know, the multiple company concept was used by a considerable number of companies in this regard.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;18.&mdash;(1) Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1989, is hereby amended by the deletion of `£7,000' in each place where it occurs and the substitution therefor of `£9,000'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to increase the capital allowances paid in respect of motor vehicles.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the capital limit used in determining capital allowances and running expenses deductions for cars has lost relevance to the market value of a car which is adequate for commercial use.  Increases in both the 1988 and 1989 Finance Acts brought the limit from £4,000 to its current level of £7,000.  This is an expensive relief. Because I was reducing VAT which affected the cost of cars, I simply could not find room to do both this year.  It is a question of cost.</P>
      <P>Sales of cars went up from 54,000 in 1987 to 83,000 in 1990.  The motor industry benefited significantly from the reductions in the standard rate of VAT in the last two years.  This year's 2 per cent reduction will represent a saving of up to £10 million in sales purchases for the business community.  Economic circumstances have changed and have affected the purchasing of cars this year, especially in the first three to four months.  That is a reflection on economic activity and the worldwide recession.  To increase the limit from £7,000 to £9,000 would cost £12 million in a full year.</P>

    <P>Paragraph (iii) of the proviso to subsection (1) of section 265 (balancing allowances and balancing charges).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is something I mentioned on Committee Stage and Deputy Deasy has a constituency interest in it.  Certain tax reliefs are allowed for multi-storey car parks in designated areas.  These reliefs or other reliefs do not apply outside the designated areas.  There is room for some relief to encourage the building of multi-storey car parks in advance of designation of areas.  I understand that Deputy Deasy had in mind a project which is being undertaken by Waterford County Council to alleviate traffic problems in Dungarvan. Multi-storey car parks will only be built where there is a public demand, where people will pay for space.  The possible tax foregone would be quite small.  There will certainly not be a great rush to build multi-storey car parks.</P>
    <P>The provision to which I refer, and which Deputy Deasy seeks to restore, was, if I remember correctly, renewed in every Finance Bill in the late eighties.  I do not think there was any taker until the issue of designated areas came up. Certainly, in a series of Finance Bills this relief was renewed and there was no takeup.  Now that there is a specific public sector project in mind under which there would be an arrangement with a developer I should like the Minister to consider <Col N="2386" /> allowing the measure for one year to see if the project will go ahead.</P>

I could not accept the amendment as it stands.  The Deputy's statements are directed at one public sector car park project, but the amendment, as drafted, goes much wider than that.  I am not in favour of restoring accelerated capital allowances <i>per se.</i>  I could not accept the amendment in the way it is drafted because it would open up many issues again, but we could consider the matter next year if that is not too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1970 allowed the purchaser of a building to claim capital allowances on the cost of the building provided that the building was unused at the time of sale.  The provision gave rise to a problem in the designated areas whereby a purchaser of a building could be denied the capital allowances if the developer of the building put a tenant in place before selling the building to that purchaser.  Representations have been made that investors should not be denied the capital allowances if the building is sold within a short period after setting a tenant in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion section 21 provides an adequate response to the problem by ensuring that capital allowances will not be denied if the building is sold within one year after its first use.  Deputy Noonan's amendment seeks to remove any time <Col N="2388" /> limit from the provision.  I do not believe this is necessary.  The allowances are designed to encourage construction and should be made on or shortly after construction. To allow them to be deferred without limit may leave room for manipulation. The time limit will ensure that investors will be found within that period of one year thus freeing the developer to undertake new projects.</P>

      <P>I am glad to note that Deputy Noonan has the same sense of timetable as I have.  This amendment was put down on Committee Stage but was not reached.  I was advised by my advisers that in order to facilitate the orderly taxation of companies in the business of acquiring shares within the company, and to have schemes cleared in advance by prospective purchasers, that there should be some statutory system of clearance, a procedure that would be agreed and established by the Revenue Commissioners, than allow people to walk into the system in anticipation.  I am not <Col N="2390" /> sufficiently expert on taxation to comment on the practicability of the amendment. I was advised by a practising accountant and the amendment seems to have many merits.  I was a little worried about whether its wording is in order.  Is the Minister prepared to take on board the principle and allow the Revenue Commissioners introduce the same mechanism by a different route?  If so I would be happy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2391" /> In page 85, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;82.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in the Value-Added Tax Acts, tax payable on motor cars imported by disabled persons for their personal use only, shall be zero-rated.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My reason for moving the amendment is that there is a particular sense of urgency about the issue.  The Minister has been very helpful and he understands the position. My amendment would cover the case of a person who is seriously injured in any way.  I wish to make reference to a person who was seriously injured in a sporting accident and is now quadriplegic. That person is trying to import a car that has been especially adapted and designed for a person who is physically handicapped.  The individual in question has no power in either of his legs, has no power in his right arm and has very limited power in his left arm.  The car has been adapted in such a way that it could be driven by that person.</P>
    <P>There are simple procedures whereby a person can get in and out of the car because the seats are movable as a result of adaptation.  Also, by pressing a button a wheelchair can be taken in and out and put in such a position that the person can move it without great effort.  If the person imports a car he will get an allowance under the regulations if it is purchased but, in this instance, the car has not been purchased as the person cannot afford it. The Trevor Jones Trust are providing the car on loan and because of that it is not covered by the regulations.  If I thought there would be widespread abuse of any regulation I would not make a case to the Minister but this is a specific case and the Minister should make every effort to accommodate this person.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he did not want to include it in a Finance Act, that he is anxious to bring it in in the form of a regulation.  A review has been carried out and I would not press it except for the great sense of urgency.  From correspondence with the Minister, I know his heart is in the right place and I do not <Col N="2392" /> want to press the matter unduly. However, I should like the Minister to favourably consider it and I thank him for his help so far.</P>

To further the goodwill which exists between all parties in dealing with the disabled, I have moved in advance of the review to reduce the cost of adaptation where it is not less than 20 per cent.  We all have sympathy with the specific case mentioned by the Deputy and I have asked my officials to address it.  I assure the Deputy that a solution will be found well in advance of the review.  We will be in touch with the Deputy very shortly to tell him how he can approach the problem to get the result he wants.</P>

      <P>The figures of the Irish Hotels Federation appear to have put the cost of this measure at £4 million but we put the cost at £15 million.  The differential is probably made up by restaurants, take-aways and other areas which would not impact directly on the hotels sector of the whole restaurant business. However, we confirm our figure of £15 million.  A lot of play was made on Committee Stage about the cost of meals <Col N="2393" /> in other countries.  Madame Scrivener's statement has not been followed through in any shape or form and if the situation changes I will refer to it in my next budget.  For the benefit of Members the figures are as follows: Ireland 12.5 per cent; the UK 17.5 per cent; Belgium 17 per cent; Denmark 22 per cent; Germany 14 per cent; Luxembourg 12 per cent; the Netherlands 18.5 per cent; Portugal 0 per cent; Spain 8 per cent; Italy 9 per cent; France 18.5 per cent.  Those figures show that we will still be very competitive but I take on board that the tourist sector will be a bigger contributor to our economic wellbeing in future and, consequently, we must ensure that it stays competitive.</P>

      <P>In page 101, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;113. &mdash;Section 58 (2) (a) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 is hereby amended by the insertion of the following after subsection (2) (a) (ii):</P>
      <P>`(iii)  a person or a child of a person with whom the disponer is living as man and wife.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I re-entered this amendment having regard to the Minister's positive and constructive response last night.  I am not trying to use legislation in regard to finance to change the social code, that is for a different Minister and a different set of arguments.  In section 117 of the Bill as amended in Committee it seems that the Minister has discretion in relation to the value of an inheritance.  I refer to a position where one partner dies leaving an inheritance &mdash; which becomes a gift &mdash; to the other but which attracts a tax liability. I appreciate that we will not change the law in the Finance Bill but subsection (iii) states:</P>
      <P>has resided in the house with the disponer continuously for a period of not less than 5 years ending on the date of the inheritance,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2394" /> which seems to offer a vehicle for exploration. If the Minister can find a way anywhere in the tax code to avoid the hardship to which I referred I would not be fussy about how it is done; the laws of marriage are for another Minister and for another day.  I am specifically concerned with hardship in relation to tax in this instance.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for appreciating that general law should lead in this area; it will come under active consideration towards the end of the year when the White Paper on Marriage Breakdown is prepared and ready for debate.  I appreciate that Deputy Quinn and other Members have spoken about this growing problem which cannot be ignored.  We will certainly take on board the suggestions made by Deputy Quinn in trying to find a solution outside the constitutional problems created in this area because of the special position of marriage within the Constitution.  We will look at it in a positive light and see if we can find a solution which does not impinge on the Constitution.  I assure the Deputy that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, together, will approach it positively to seek a solution without creating further problems for everybody.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 107, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;126. &mdash;As respects the year 1991-92 and subsequent years of assessment, section 141 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1986) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the substitution, in subsection (4), of `£2,100' for `£720' and the said subsection (4), as so amended, is set in the Table to this section.</P>
      <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
      <P>(4)  No deduction shall be allowed under this section in respect of any child who is entitled in his own right to an income exceeding £2,100 a year, except that, if the amount of the excess is less than the deduction which apart from this subsection would be allowable, a deduction reduced by that amount shall be allowed:</P>
      <P>Provided that in calculating the income of the child for the purposes of the foregoing provision no account shall be taken of any income to which the child is entitled as the holder of a scholarship, bursary, or other similar educational endownment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment fulfils the commitment I gave on Committee Stage yesterday to amend section 141 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I had many representations from various associations dealing with this area, as I am sure many other Deputies had, and in response I am lifting the level from £750 to £2,100 which is the limit on the income of incapacitated children for the purpose of an allowance under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section a person may claim <Col N="2396" /> an allowance of up to £600 in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated. The allowance, however, is reduced pound for pound where the child's income exceeds £720 so that no allowance is due where the child's income exceeds £1,320.  This can impose a burden on the parents of such children.  To ease the situation therefore, as I promised to do yesterday, I am increasing the income limit for the child to £2,100, which is the same as the single person's tax allowance. This will mean that the child can have an income up to that level and the parent can still qualify for the full £600 tax allowance. I think this will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate on the Finance Bill last year the Minister made various commitments but he did not have the time to meet them between the Committee and Report Stages.  However he has done so in this Finance Bill.  That should be recorded and acknowledged. Debates can at times prove to be very frustrating for those of us on the Opposition benches if it is only talk for the sake of it but at least on this occasion it appears <Col N="2397" /> that we have achieved some results.

I ask the Deputies present to bring this suggestion to the attention of their Whips.  I certainly intend to do so.  Given that it is inevitable that time will be limited with regard to the date on which the fiscal, or financial year starts, we should make better use of the time available.  If the Minister is in agreement, I will convey this suggestion to my own Whip and hope that other Members will do likewise.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going to raise the following question on Committee Stage but I was advised that it would be more appropriate to raise it at this stage.  I wish to refer to <Col N="2398" /> section 73 which deals with the grouping of companies.   Concern has been expressed that the provisions dealing with the registration of companies for VAT may be applied retrospectively.  I think the Minister has indicated that this will not be the case but I would like him to confirm this in the House.  Second, would the Minister outline what will happen in a case where directors of a company in receivership are associated with an existing company?  Will they be grouped together under this legislation?</P>

We have had a couple of arduous days given the temperature in the Chamber.  I agree with the suggestion that there is a need for more time to be allocated for the debate on Committee Stage rather than for the debate on Second Stage.  I can assure Deputies Noonan, Enright, Mac Giolla and Quinn that the points which were not dealt with will be addressed between now and the next Finance Bill.  I will be in touch with the Deputies on the question of updating the provisions dealing with disabled drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the question raised by Deputy Callely, a trial scheme has been in operation since 1989 and I understand that the business community are quite happy with it.  All we are doing is putting <Col N="2399" /> it on a statutory footing.  If the Deputy wants to have further discussions with the officials concerned he should feel free to do so.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it proposes that veterinary services be subject to a VAT rate of 12.5 per cent.  I tabled a question to the Minister on the benefit to the Exchequer from the imposition of VAT at 12.5 per cent on veterinary fees.  It was stated in the reply that there was no net gain to the Exchequer and it was strictly a bookkeeping exercise.  I believe it is important that we should not do things purely as a bookkeeping exercise.  This imposes a cost on people and puts a charge on veterinary services and agriculture services at a point when the agricultural services are experiencing such difficulties.  There is no point in imposing a charge for purely bookkeeping reasons.  It appears the European Community are imposing <Col N="2400" /> regulations which are of no benefit to a particular country and this should be looked at seriously.  I would like to hear the Minister's response if he should get the opportunity to reply to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 18th VAT Directive adopted in July 1989 we are obliged to move in that direction.  The additional costs in relation to it will be negligible and as I have just mentioned the sixth VAT Directive does not permit me to zero-rate anything additional in future.</P>

There are additional bookkeeping overheads on the veterinary practices and they have to collect it also.  It involves additional bookkeeping for the Revenue Commissioners.  It is unfortunate that it is of no benefit to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Sea Trout Infestation.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a lovely run of sea trout smolts in Connemara this year.  Everyone had hoped that the cold winter and cool spring would mean that the sea lice problem would not be as bad this year as it was in the past three years and that, consequently, the smolts would <Col N="2403" /> be able to get safely to the open sea where they could feed and grow.  Unfortunately this was not the case.  More smolts have returned prematurely to fresh water this year than in previous years and have come back in worse condition.  Moreover, the returned smolts are absolutely teeming with sea lice, as is evident from the photograph in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt that the salmon farms are responsible for the rise in sea lice numbers and the other problems now facing sea trout.  Dr. Edward Fahy's climatic theories for the decline of sea trout have now been thoroughly discredited and the notion that disease or acidification as a result of afforestation could be responsible for their decline will be eliminated within the next two months. Even scientists in the Department of the Marine who have been reluctant to blame salmon farming for the decline in the number of sea trout are privately beginning to do so.  It is apparent that the Minister for the Marine has refused to accept the evidence which proves that salmon farms are guilty of causing this decline.</P>
      <P>Although it is now too late to prevent this disaster which has cost the economy of the West far more in income and employment than is currently provided by salmon farms, the Minister must now undertake to do five things in an effort to salvage as much as possible from this environmental disaster.  First, he must give an undertaking to implement the main recommendation of the STAG report which was that fish farms which are unable to control their sea lice problem should be closed down.  He should make it clear to the industry that he intends to do this and that he will order the cages of offending farms to be removed at least three months before next year's run of sea trout smolts in order that the sea lice population time can be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, he must give adequate finance to the regional fisheries boards to police the sea trout protection by-laws he <Col N="2404" /> has introduced.  Last year Michael Kennedy, the manager of the worst affected board, the Western Board, was able to employ 15 summer staff to help protect the remaining sea trout and enforce the regulations.  However, he does not have adequate funds this year to take on even one protection officer for the summer.  Is the Minister serious about fishery protection or is he just too weak to negotiate funds from his colleagues?  Thirdly, the Minister must ensure that adequate funding is made available to STAG so that they can continue their research into the causes of this disaster and restock affected rivers.</P>
    <P>STAG have requested information from the Minister's Department about the history and records of some of the fish farms in the affected areas but to date they have not seen fit to release this information.  Will the Minister say why this information has not been released?</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister might like to tell the House what he intends to do for all those people in the West who have lost all or part of their livelihood as a result of the sea trout collapse.  He can no longer pretend that the decline of this fine fish is an act of God.  It was a result of acts of man, of the over-rapid expansion of a new industry long before anybody knew what the environmental consequences might be.  For allowing this, the Government were responsible and the Government must pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West):</i> First, I reject utterly any suggestion that there has been inaction on my part or that of my colleague in the Department of the Marine in relation to this matter.  The Minister for the Marine dealt fully and comprehensively with the development of the problem with sea trout stocks that has arisen in the West over the past few seasons when this issue was last raised on the adjournment in this House on 14 February.  During the course of his reply on that occasion the Minister outlined the action that had been taken up to that <Col N="2405" /> stage by the Department in response to the problem and referred to the report that had recently become available from the Sea-Trout Action Group.</P>
      <P>A considerable number of the protection measures for sea trout stocks that were sought in that report have since been introduced.  By-law No. 670 of 1991 reintroduced the prohibition on the retention, possession or sale of sea trout that was first introduced in 1990 and extended the area in which that prohibition applies.  By-law No. C.S. 161 of 1991 introduced a much shorter open season for sea trout angling for 1991 in the areas covered by By-law No. 670. By-law No. 672 of 1991 extended the boundaries of the existing sanctuary areas where drift-netting for salmon and sea trout is prohibited in the western fisheries region.  It also created a number of new sanctuary areas and prohibits drift-netting for salmon and sea trout within 200 metres of the coast in the same region.</P>
      <P>These measures go a considerable way towards meeting the requests made by STAG in their report and I understand that members of STAG have expressed their appreciation of the measures in question and the alacrity with which they were taken.  My Department continue to look at further measures put forward as being helpful to conservation of sea trout stocks but as the Minister indicated on 14 February, some of these cannot be dealt with immediately as they call for changes in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foregoing puts paid to any suggestion that anyone in the Department of the Marine has been inactive in this matter.  The Deputy should further note that an expanded research programme has been put in place for 1991, with increased funding from my Department, which will look into: (a) the physiological mechanisms involved in sea trout's transition from freshwater to the sea; (b) possible differences in the selected physiological parameters between depleted sea trout stocks and those less severely affected; (c) the dynamics of relevant brown trout populations, including interactions between the resident and sea run components of these stocks; and <Col N="2406" /> (d) the role of sea lice in relation to the above.  My Department have also instituted a programme of inspections of salmon cages with a view to assessing sea lice densities.</P>
    <P>I hope that this research effort will enable my Department to identify the root cause of the problem and I am sure the Deputy and the House generally will share my aspirations in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Deputy in his opening remarks suggested that some new facts had come to light in relation to and cause of the problem.  That is not so.  What has become clear in recent weeks is that the problem is a continuing one and that certain hopes that had been entertained that improved weather and water-flow conditions this spring would have improved the situation have not been realised.  This is not a new problem.  It is a seasonal one and only manifests itself when young sea trout migrate to the sea in April-May and adults return in May-June.  As soon as it became apparent that the problem was recurring, my Department moved quickly and decisively and mounted a rescue operation in close co-operation with STAG and the Western Regional Fisheries Board in order to trap and retain as many as possible of the remaining sea trout smolts and adults in order to ensure a continued spawning stock in the affected rivers in years to come.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear from all I have said that my Department have responded quickly, decisively and positively to the requirements of the situation here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension which has been brought about as a result of the submissions made by this Minister since he reactivated the disadvantaged areas scheme submission on coming back to office in 1987.  I would like to congratulate all concerned since it was announced today that 96 per cent of the <Col N="2407" /> original submission has been found to be acceptable and the extension will go ahead once the Council of Ministers give their final approval.</P>
      <P>It is the largest extension which has taken place in a disadvantaged areas scheme review.  In previous extensions the average increase in land area nationally was 3 per cent.  This one was 12 per cent going from 58 per cent to 72 per cent. That fourfold increase on the previous average increase in extensions is reflected in County Offaly.  Prior to this submission only 6 per cent of County Offaly had been included in the less severely handicapped areas and 6 per cent as mountain sheep grazing area.</P>
      <P>The proposals which now have been accepted by the Commission and about which an announcement will be made before the end of this week, shows that 72 per cent of Offaly will now be classified as less severely handicapped for the purposes of the scheme.  This is a sixfold increase on the situation prior to this announcement.  I would like to congratulate the Minister and give due recognition to the Department and the officials on the survey carried out which has brought about a significant improvement for Offaly.</P>
      <P>My concern at the moment relates to the reclassification proposals.  There is no doubt but that a very serious case can be made on behalf of those delineated district electoral divisions which border the Shannon valley which suffer from severe and extensive flooding.  The Minister of State and the Minister know this from experience.  This flooding got worse in the last decade with extensive flooding in 1980, 1981, 1985, 1986, 1989, 1990 and again in 1991.  Unusually, in April this year, further flooding was apparent in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers with 45 to 50 acres tell me they stripped the callows in the Shannon Valley on 18-19 October last year and still cannot put cattle back on that land. Not only will the callows not be available for meadow this year, they are unlikely to be available even for grazing because of the damage caused by that extensive <Col N="2408" /> flooding.  When these farmers in west Offaly look across the river to east Galway, Roscommon and Westmeath they see that under the proposals for reclassification in this submission, those areas will attain more severely handicapped status.  This is illogical and untenable. The Department should recognise that in the 1985 submission 49 townlands in that Shannon Valley region were deemed less severely handicapped.  The perception within the county, was that those areas were recognised as more disadvantaged than the rest of the County of Offaly.  In the present submission there is a six fold increase in the land area included in the extension of less severely handicapped status, but we have only two DEDs, Hynes and Clonmacnoise, being proposed for severely handicapped status.</P>
    <P>I contend the Department should take the clear, common sense position of providing that at the very least the 49 townlands in that west Offaly area which were less severely handicapped prior to this submission, are approved as severely handicapped under this proposal.  Apart from that, under the five criteria and the 40 per cent average farm income, it is clear that all the townlands in those DEDs now are eligible for severely handicapped status.  The Minister should do this before the Commission give their final approval to the reclassification proposals rather than wait for the appeal tribunal to adjudicate on these DEDs.  There are other DEDs and townlands in west Offaly which are not immediately adjacent to the Shannon and which Teagasc officials would contend come within the severely handicapped status proposal.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by mentioning that 430 farmers are involved in the west Offaly area, 171 farmers are involved in the five DEDs in the Sliabh Bloom area.  Of the 4,200 herd in Offaly, as many as 3,000 will now come under the disadvantaged areas scheme as a result of this Minister's submission, but I suggest to the Minister that we deal with this anomaly in west Offaly and the whole Shannon Valley region and get those 600 farmers into the severely handicapped areas and let the <Col N="2409" /> appeals tribunal deal with any further reclassification proposals and extension from other areas not yet designated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some hours ago the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, announced in Brussels that the proposals of the Irish Government to extend our disadvantaged areas by some 2 million acres had been adopted by the European Commission.  I am happy to inform Deputy Cowen that County Offaly benefits considerably under these proposals and that in that county alone some 250,000 acres of an extension to the existing areas is included in the proposals. This represents a six fold increase.  Let me say in passing that my county of Louth in addition to many other counties is benefiting under this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Government also made reclassification proposals to the Commission but as these are still under negotiation I am precluded from giving details of the areas to be reclassified in County Offaly.  I can, however, say that they fall into two sections: first, all existing mountain sheep grazing areas were proposed for reclassification to less severely handicapped status on the basis of the five criteria used for designation of new areas.  These are laid down by the EC for member states and are expressed either in absolute terms or geared to national agriculture and demographic statistics. We have no discretion in proposing changes to them other than changes to reflect significant shifts in land use and population trends over time.  Second, the proposal sent to the EC was to reclassify less severely handicapped areas to more severely handicapped status and the further national criteria used were (a) land quality, (b) low farm income, that is family farm income for farm worker not exceeding 40 per cent of the national average family farm income and (c) high dependence on agriculture, that is more than 40 per cent of the working population engaged in farming.  It will be open to the appeals body to review these national criteria in marginal areas and <Col N="2410" /> make recommendations to the Minister in relation, for example, to income thresholds having regard to the cost implications and availability to the necessary credits under the Structural Funds. Approval of national reclassification proposals is a matter which requires approval by the EC Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this issue regarding the Bank of Ireland posting monthly Access statements from an English address, Southend-on-Sea.  I put it to you, Sir, that this may be in contravention of section 63 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. I know this statement has been made in the past and the Bank of Ireland have denied that they may be in contravention, but they deny it on the grounds that the material originates in England and, therefore, can be posted in England under the Act.  I put it here this evening that I am a card holder and most of my business originates in Ireland.  The paperwork is done in Ireland, posted to the Bank of Ireland headquarters in Dublin and then taken by courier to the British computer centre.</P>
      <P>I contend the Bank of Ireland is availing of a cheaper postal rate in Great Britain and, as a result of their activities, there is a serious loss of revenue to An Post at a time when An Post are struggling for survival, when there is a threat of 1,500 job losses and the closure of sub-post offices and the possibility of downgrading major offices, for example, in my county in Charleville, Youghal and Clonakilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was raised by the Communications Workers Union and by Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan in January 1990.  The Bank's response so far has been very poor, especially since the situation is so serious for An Post.  I contend the Bank of Ireland are doing very well out of the Irish economy and should act responsibly at a time when An Post are in deep crisis.  They are a highly profitable organisation and I say today that the <Col N="2411" /> bank's continued failure, despite correspondence between the bank and An Post on re-examining their situation, to respond to date is most unpatriotic.  I call on the bank now to cease operating from this English address.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is unable to act on this issue then the card holders may act. People like myself can take our own line of action by returning our cards.  The bank should adopt a more responsible role; they are being irresponsible.  An Post are providing a good service, a social service.  It is outrageous that a major Irish bank should act in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion that the Minister should prevent the Bank of Ireland from using the UK postal system in relation to the despatch of monthly statements relating to credit cards is no doubt based on the assumption that a contravention of Irish legislation is taking place.  The Minister has looked into this matter and the Bank of Ireland has given me a report.  The bank has informed the Minister that it is one of a number of banks serviced by the Access computer in Southend-on-Sea.  As pointed out on an adjournment debate on this subject on 14 December 1989, the computer centre at Southend-on-Sea processes all Access transactions for those banks, produces cards and prints and despatches monthly statements for all the banks, and the statements are posted in accordance with the regulations of the Universal Postal Union.</P>
      <P>Under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, it is an offence to take or send outside the State a postal packet with a view to having the packet posted from outside the State to an address within the State to evade the exclusive privilege given by the Act to An Post for the conveyance of postal packets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has no evidence that the <Col N="2412" /> law is being broken, but if the Deputy has such evidence, he should furnish it to me.  The Bank of Ireland also informed me that to enable the bank to have full control over its credit card operation and to provide an improved level of service to its customers, it has decided to develop its own data processing facilities at Cabinteely in relation to credit cards.  The Minister understands that these facilities are due for introduction in October 1991. From that date the Bank of Ireland will post all credit card statements from Ireland and not from Southend-on-Sea, as applies at present.  The Minister also understands that the new facilities at Cabinteely will give rise to 50 new jobs. As the Deputy will appreciate, An Post will benefit from the new facilities in terms of increased postage revenue. Until such time as that development takes place, there is nothing illegal or improper about the present system.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Defence.  I propose to call on the Deputies who have been selected in the following order: Deputy Dukes, Deputy Lowry, Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Owen and Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  Each Deputy has two minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Saint Joseph's Academy in Kildare which is run by the De La Salle Brothers was given sanction for an extension some years ago.  While that extension was under construction the old building was burned down in an arson attack.  That necessarily interfered with work on the extension but a formula was agreed with the Department of Education so that work could continue on the extension and, indeed, be accelerated while replacement of the old building went ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2413" /> At the end of the work, late in 1986, the past pupils' union which ran the project claimed an extra payment of £79,000 under the price variation clause in the contract.  The Department of Education included an amount of £69,000 in their final payment.  The past pupils' union contested this and there was lengthy correspondence with the Department of Education.  The Department queried every conceivable aspect of the work carried out and of the extra work necessitated by the combination of work on the extension and on the replacement of the original building.  Indeed, the Department even asked some inconceivable questions notwithstanding the fact that the principal contractors involved were highly reputable and accounted fully for their sub-contractors.  At no stage did the Department indicate that they had any reason to doubt any aspect of the information provided.  The Department simply reduced the amounts allowed for the work in a totally arbitrary manner.</P>
    <P>The matter came to my attention after some frustration on the part of the people running the project, and I met the Minister on the matter on 19 February 1990. On that occasion the Minister told me, very graciously, that she would arrange for the balance of £10,000 to be paid.  She repeated that undertaking in a letter to me of 11 June 1990, in the course of which she said: &ldquo;I am again pleased to confirm that these additional moneys will be paid by my Department very soon.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding the Minister's clear and unequivocal undertaking &mdash; for which I thank her &mdash; the Department still have not made the payment.  It is clear that that payment should be made now.  It is unacceptable that a voluntary group who have devoted a great deal of time and energy to bringing an unexpectedly complicated project to a successful conclusion, should be treated in such a cavalier fashion by the Department of Education in spite of the Minister's clearly expressed agreement on two occasions to make the extra payment required.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for <Col N="2414" /> raising this matter.  As the Deputy said I met him, and was glad to do so, and freely committed myself to the payment of the extra money which was almost £11,000.  Since that time the Department have written to the school authorities on several occasions, the last being November 1990, pointing out that moneys are still owing on foot of the account.  The Department's senior quantity surveyor has been inquiring into the matter.  The information given on 10 July is not enough.  If they reply to that letter I will see to it that the moneys are paid.  Like the Deputy I feel aggrieved that it had to reach this point.  It is neither a professional or proper way for a small amount of money to be spoken of and, obviously, the money was put to good use.  I ask the school authorities, through the Deputy, to reply to the letter of 9 November.  I repeat my commitment to pay it and I want to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the application for the provision of a remedial teacher at Holy Cross national school in my native parish.  As Department records will show there is a school population of 224 pupils.  The divisional inspectors supported the obvious belief that remedial services should be provided for this school and sought unsuccessfully, for such provision last year.</P>
      <P>The board of management and general parent body are extremely concerned that the school continues to be disadvantaged in this extremely important area of education.  It is especially frustrating for teachers who see schools in close proximity with more favourable pupil-teacher ratios having access to the full-time and part-time services of a remedial teacher.  The present pupil-teacher ratio in this school is 32:1 which is above what is educationally approved and the already unsatisfactory high national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of management have been restraining and tolerant regarding the disadvantaged but in the present climate of concern towards improving primary education they trust that the application <Col N="2415" /> will be favourably received by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some brief points to highlight the validity of the case.  The 32:1 pupil-teacher ratio places a child with learning difficulties at a further disadvantage, because the individual attention required cannot be provided by the class teacher.  Indeed, some teachers have up to 37 pupils in their class.</P>
    <P>The psychological department of the South-Eastern Health Board have urgently recommended remedial teaching for many of the pupils referred to them from the school.  A considerable number of pupils in the school are in need of and would benefit from the services of a remedial teacher.  In fact, as many as 40 children have been identified.</P>
    <P>Accommodation and facilities are already in place at the school for such a service.  I am proud to have been involved during the past six years in ensuring that considerable public money has been spent in providing five new classrooms, a GP room and other amenities to bring the school to its present very high standard. Local parents' committees have also raised and spent in excess of £25,000 to provide play space, playing field, ball courts and generally landscaping the grounds.  This investment, and the local enthusiasm of parents for our national school, should be acknowledged by providing this urgently needed service even if it has to be shared with schools in the adjoining area or with the Ursuline Convent in Thurles.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lowry for bringing this matter to the floor of the House.  It is commendable that he seeks to support his local school; we would all be of the same mind.  He made the point that the inspector has approved of the provision of a remedial teacher; in fact the inspectors have approved 1,000 remedial teachers throughout the country and 80 have been provided for.  This is the first time in six years there has been such a large tranche of remedial teachers and there are 1,000 applications.  The <Col N="2416" /> inspectors have made their reports.  They are now with the Department and they will be arranged in order of priority. These are based on professional reports. It has nothing to do with any political representation.  The remedial teachers are appointed on the basis of priority of need.  One would wish to appoint 1,000, but we at least have made a start this year.  The Deputy's representations and the inspectors' report are being looked at. We will more and more take the course of shared remedial teachers so that pupils in adjoining schools can be helped if only in a small way.</P>

      <P>The community school at Mountmellick, County Laois, has an excellent facility thanks in many respects to the Minister.  The school has three science labs, a superb gymnasium and a study hall of some repute.  It is a school with a proud history and it has the potential to be one of the finest educational establishments in the midlands. However, there are a number of matters upon which I base my grievance.  Some further funds need to be applied here as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Some of the building is in very poor repair and will not be able to withstand another winter.  There is no heating system in the school.  The Minister is in danger of being seen as wasting public funds by not addressing the immediate problem.  Significant sums have been spent on consultants' reports, planning and so on, but until refurbishment takes place, the money already spent will be seen to have been wasted.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider meeting parents' representatives who wish to be informed of the situation, as is their right? I trust the Minister will give final sanction for the works, but I cannot overstate the fine facilities available in Mountmellick for the children of the North Laois area. A small further cash injection would solve the problem.</P>

We have sent officials to examine the school and we are preparing costings.  Obviously the urgent work will have to be done and we will have to prepare a programme of works.

      <P>Paul is a young 16 year old physically handicapped student in Malahide community school, suffering from cerebral palsy.  He is hoping to sit his intermediate certificate in two weeks' time but he has not yet received in writing any humane decision from the Department as to how he will do his papers.  I understand that the Department indicated by telephone that he can use a tape recorder.  The application for the use of a scribe was made by his school and the parents as far back as November 1990.  It is a disgrace that almost two weeks before the exam there is still no sensitive and humane decision from the Department. Full medical certificates and psychological reports have recommended the use of a scribe, somebody who would write his answers during the exam.  Along with a number of other handicaps he has very bad hand misfunctioning.  He is a bright, above average student mainly studying honours subjects.  It would be most damaging to him if he was not given the opportunity to do a good intermediate certificate and to stay on to do his leaving certificate.  Paul is one of six handicapped children in Malahide community school, five of whom, including Paul, are wheelchair bound.  They are fully integrated into the school, which incidentally does not receive any recognition for having six handicapped students. Will the Minister cut through the bureaucratic red tape and give this young man the opportunity to do well in his intermediate certificate by assigning him a scribe so that he can participate fully in doing the intermediate certificate, and reach his full potential, considering the <Col N="2418" /> many handicaps he must live with in the life ahead.</P>

It must have seemed to them and to him at times that they were working against insuperable odds.  I compliment the young man who has so much courage. It is a salutary lesson to us all.</P>

      <P>Army pensions are paid on a monthly basis.  Army pensions are meagre but their payment on a monthly basis makes it difficult for many pensioners to manage.  In addition there is the added security factor as many of them keep their money at home.  Because of increasing crime many pensioners are apprehensive when they are paid.  Pensioners in receipt of Army pensions wish the payment to be made fortnightly.

      <P>Under present arrangements, all Defence Forces pensions are paid on a monthly basis.  This arrangement is of very long standing and is in line with the practice in other areas of the public service.  Moreover, the arrangement &mdash; monthly payment &mdash; is provided for by Statutory Instrument in the Defence Force pensions schemes in the case of former members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 13 categories of pension paid by my Department on a monthly basis including in all some 14,000 pensioners. Leaving aside considerations of cost, which would be substantial, the issue of pensions on a fortnightly basis would <Col N="2420" /> not be feasible given the existing staffing and technological resources available in my Department and in the Paymaster-General's Office, through which office the pensions payable orders are processed.</P>
    <P>Fortnightly payment would involve a doubling in the volume of payment transactions and, apart from extra computer capacity, would require extra staffing resources, resources which are not available at present.</P>
    <P>In any event, the question of issuing Defence Forces' pensions on a fortnightly basis could only be considered in the context of such a development in regard to other public service pensions generally.  I am sure that is a situation the Deputy would understand fully.  It is a matter that can be considered and will be considered on an on-going basis.</P>

      <P>Consideration of this matter concerns my Department in so far as land reclamation requires a lease under the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>
      <P>To date there is no application for such a lease under consideration for any area in Dublin Bay.  Relevant regulations have been made to require mandatory environmental impact assessment where significant reclamation is involved.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is <Col N="2356" /> referring to the Commission's Reflections Paper on the Development and Future of the CAP.  No concrete proposals have yet been made on foot of this paper but I have made my position clear to the Commission and to my colleagues in the Council.  I am determined to ensure that cereal growing remains a viable enterprise in Irish conditions.</P>
      <P>In that regard the following points will be of particular concern: producers should be assured of adequate compensation; adequate Community preference must be maintained to ensure that lower production of cereals is not replaced by imported cereals and cereal substitutes.  In addition the EC will need to maintain the rebalancing proposals as a priority in the GATT negotiations; any adjustments in support for cereals should take account of the competitive position of grass-based production systems as against more intensive production systems; set-aside arrangements should be on a short term basis which will be capable of responding to changing market requirements.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in continuous receipt of unemployment assistance since 1987.  His wife claimed assistance in March 1990.</P>
      <P>The basic provisions in this regard were first provided for in the Social Welfare No. 2 Act, 1985.  This provides that where both of a couple are entitled to unemployment assistance each of them is entitled to be paid one-half of the amount that would be payable if the other were his or her adult dependant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From March 1990 until February 1991, the person concerned was entitled to half the long term rate for a person with an adult dependant and three dependant children, of £58.  His wife was in receipt of half the short term rate for a person with an adult dependant and three <Col N="2360" /> dependant children, or £54.50.  Their combined payment was £112.50.</P>
    <P>His wife started a social employment scheme course (SES) on 23 February 1991 and is being paid at the rate of £85.50 per week being the personal rate plus half rate increases for three dependent children.</P>
    <P>The legislation on the assessment of means stipulates that the estimated value to the household of all income earned by a claimant or by his spouse be taken into account as means.  The person concerned was advised that his wife's SES income would, under the legislation have to be assessed as means against him and that it would be more beneficial to them if he were to cease claiming unemployment assistance and his wife were to claim for him and their three children at the full SES rate.  To date he has not chosen this option.</P>
    <P>If he withdraws his unemployment assistance claim his wife will become entitled to a weekly SES payment of £131.50.  If he continues with his unemployment assistance claim he will be assessed with the benefit of his wife's SES income and will be entitled to assistance of £40.50 per week which together with his wife's weekly SES income of £85.50 totals £126.00 or £5.50 less than if he were treated as a dependant of his wife on her SES claim.</P>
    <P>From 24 April the person concerned was paid at the rate of £32.50 per week. His rate of payment should have been £40.50 per week and this error is regretted. The amount underpaid is being issued to him.</P>
    <P>Should the person concerned cease claiming unemployment assistance he will be entitled to renew his claim at the long term rate provided he does so within 52 weeks.  This is a result of an improvement which I introduced in the Social Welfare Act of 1991.  Persons entitled to unemployment assistance at either the long or short term rates are eligible to participate in social employment schemes.</P>
    <P>The advice offered to couples by the Department regarding the most beneficial way to maximise their income from <Col N="2361" /> unemployment assistance-SES payments is without prejudice to the right of spouses of SES participants to sign the unemployed register for unemployment assistance purposes if they so choose.</P>

      <P>In the case of second level teachers, revised rates of expenses for attendance at in-service courses organised by my Department were introduced with effect from 1 January 1991.  The new rates are as follows:</P>

      <P>Delays in making payments relate only to the one-day junior certificate courses. It will be appreciated that, in view of the very large attendances at these courses (16,000 attended the courses in February 1991), all payments cannot be processed within the normal expected timescale.

      <P>It should be pointed out, however, that a school, may, if it so desires, appoint a career guidance teacher-counsellor within its quota of teachers.  Information on the actual numbers of such appointments is not available in the Department.</P>
      <P>Under the recently agreed <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a phased programme, starting 1992-93 and for completion in 1994-95 will be introduced to provide for the recognition on an ex-quota basis of 0.5 of a wholetime post for guidance in secondary and community-comprehensive schools in the 350-499 enrolment category, with a similar provision for vocational schools to be made on a VEC scheme basis in consultation with management and teacher representatives.</P>
