      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3, 9 and 10.  It is also proposed that the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 9, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which will be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 18.</P>

      <P>In view of the references to the topic by Ministers and others, will the Taoiseach consider setting up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of the Dáil to investigate allegations that Irish banks impose unreasonably high charges on customers for some transactions and may be recouping overseas losses at the expense of Irish customers?</P>

      <P>In relation to promised legislation, may I ask the Taoiseach when the legislation promised by the Minister <Col N="1370" /> for Agricuture and Food in this House on 24 April in relation to new penalties for people using angel dust will be introduced? Perhaps he will also explain the delay in relation to this.</P>

      <P>In relation to promised legislation, is it the Taoiseach's intention to bring the new Programme for Government before the House?  If we mention anything in regard to legislation arising from the new Programme for Government you, a Cheann Comhairle, will tell us that it has not been promised in the House.  Will the Taoiseach bring the programme before the House &mdash; as was previously the case &mdash; so that we will be able to raise issues arising out of it in the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be an opportunity to bring it before the House, although I do not rule it out. However, the Deputy can take it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I am now promising, in the House, all the legislation set out in the programme.  He will be perfectly at liberty to ask me any questions about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is such a comprehensive and far-reaching reforming programme of legislation that I will be absolutely delighted to keep the House fully informed of every aspect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach <Col N="1371" /> would be.  It might be called a single transferable problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday a historic agreement was reached between the EC and the EFTA countries.  Arising out of that I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions. Is it intended to report to the Dáil on the benefits &mdash; and indeed the disadvantages &mdash; so far as Ireland is concerned? I understand the agreement must be ratified by the Dáil.  When will that be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it needs to be specifically ratified by the Dáil as it is covered by the normal European Community legislation framework.  I promised the House a debate on European affairs generally before Maastricht and perhaps we could avail of that debate to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be satisfactory. I am not sure if I accept the Taoiseach's viewpoint in respect of ratification but the matter can be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government to which the Taoiseach just referred talked about establishing a European affairs committee.  I understand that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation, which deal with European legislation, have recommended that their terms of reference be changed and that they should become the European affairs committee.  Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to this matter?  If it is the same committee referred to in the new joint Programme for Government with the Progressive Democrats, when will it be re-established and when can we have detailed matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is on the right track.  It is proposed that the <Col N="1372" /> Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation should be transformed into a European affairs committee which will be proceeded with as rapidly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When will new terms of reference of that committee be available? Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that matters such as European political union and European political co-operation, which were previously excluded from the remit of that committee, will be included in the remit of the new committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the general intention is that all European Community matters will be capable of being discussed in the revised committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that the inspectors' interim report on the Greencore-Talmino affair will be published today. Will other parties in the House receive a copy of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The joint programme referred to earlier contained a statement that the sitting times and sitting days of the Dáil will be extended.  I understand there is a proposal that the Dáil shall sit on only two days next week.  When will the promised extended times begin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any proposal that the Dáil shall sit for only two days next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of whether the Dáil is sitting two days next week &mdash; my understanding is that that is the case <Col N="1373" />&mdash; when will the promised extended sitting time, contained in this document, take effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be getting on with that as rapidly as possible through the agency of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Government's commitment to abolish the Eastern Health Board and their replacement by a single Dublin regional health authority, will the Taoiseach say when the proposed legislation giving power to this authority structure will be before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that the legislation has not been promised. This document states that the Government have agreed to prepare legislation to provide a single new authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is promised legislation. It was promised three minutes ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been promised in documentation produced by the Department of Health.  The Government have made a decision on the matter.  Why should we deny that this is the policy of the Government when there is documentation to prove it is so?  It is either promised legislation or it is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to legislation specifically promised in this House, to quote the Taoiseach, can we be informed when the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications will introduce changes to that monument to legislative wisdom of last year, the Broadcasting Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not come within the definition of promised legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It was promised last week by the Minister in the debate on the motion of confidence, or are we to pay as much attention to that as to all other matters in that motion of confidence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach what is wrong with 140 residents on Cape Clear?  Inishvickillane is only a Robinson Crusoe island.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore the people of Oileán Chléire know that full well.  May I say, by way of conclusion, that the Deputy can stop interesting himself in the affairs of Cape Clear because he does not get one single vote there.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate when he expects the Book of Estimates to be published?  Secondly, as regards the legislation promised yesterday morning in respect of the forthcoming privatisation of B &amp; I, will the legislation deal solely with preparing for the sale of IGC rather than taking into account the proposals submitted to the Minister by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' group of unions in the B &amp; I? Will the legislation have regard to the submission made by Congress on behalf of the different unions in the B &amp; I?</P>

      <P>I asked yesterday about the 1987 report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I say that by way of not wishing to confuse matters because I wish to ask today about the legislation to update the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I understand from the Taoiseach that this legislation is imminent &mdash; it has been imminent for quite some time.  Can the Taoiseach tell us how imminent is the legislation?

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach to indicate to the House the Government's plans with regard to bringing forward legislation to facilitate the granting of loans through the social housing programme? This legislation has been promised in the House.  Local authorities are having great difficulty dealing with shared ownership loan applications at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is somewhat more urgent than that.  It was originally intended to sell in the region of 1,500 houses in the current year through that loan scheme.  To say that the legislation will be taken in this session means that no legislation will be effective this year, the target cannot be met and people attempting to buy houses under that loan scheme will not be able to do so.</P>

    <Title>Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider an amendment from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 6 to 13 deleted and the following subsection substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a)  Every ordinary member of a society for a particular year shall, if ordinarily resident in Ireland, be entitled to vote at an election held in that year for members of the regional board for the region which includes the society's area but, in the case of the election for any year subsequent to the first election after the commencement of this Act, only if he had also been an ordinary member for any two other years since the previous election.</P>
      <P>(b)  Every former life member of Iontaobhas Iascaigh Intire Incorportha (The Inland Fisheries Trust Incorporated) who registered under section 58 (4) of the Fisheies Act, 1980, in the register of a regional board and who is ordinarily resident in Ireland on the date fixed under the Fisheries Act, 1980, for the receipt of nominations at an election held for members of the regional board by which the register is maintained, shall be entitled to vote at that election.</P>
      <P>(c)  This subsection shall not prejudice the operation of section 13 of the Fisheies Act, 1980.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment provides for the restoration to life members of the former <Col N="1379" /> Inland Fisheries Trust their entitlement to vote in the regional board elections free of charge.</P>
    <P>The former Inland Fisheries Trust was dissolved under section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.  Section 58 (4) (a) of the said Act provided for persons who were life members of the former trust to be enabled to register free of charge with one of the regional fisheries boards on the register of trout, coarse fish and sea anglers as trout, coarse fish or sea anglers. Section 59 of the Act provided for the life members to enjoy certain benefits in relation to fisheries owned or managed by the central and regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>Under the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1987, the registration arrangement for trout and coarse fish anglers ceased to exist.  The registers became registers of sea anglers.  Licences were introduced for trout and coarse fish angling and the electorate for the boards was to be comprised of licence holders as is the case in relation to salmon anglers. Accordingly the arrangement whereby life members could be included in the electorate free of charge was terminated. The 1987 Act provided however for the benefits relating to fishing on board waters to be continued and improved.</P>
    <P>Since announcing my proposals last year to replace trout and coarse fishing licences with the new system as set out in this Bill I received several representations seeking to give some recognition in the system to the life members who, when there was very little support for inland fisheries, made contributions in order to develop inland fisheries.  This is a recognition of that commitment in the past.  Deputies Gilmore and Garland raised the matter during Committee Stage of the Bill and it was raised again on the Second Stage debate in the Seanad and I undertook to have a look at the matter.  Having considered the matter I proposed this amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad where it was warmly welcomed and agreed.  It is a very simple amendment which should not delay the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> In effect this amendment ensures that life members are entitled to vote in board elections whether or not they are members of co-ops.  They will not however have any entitlements in relation to the election of co-op management committees or ballots unless of course they become ordinary members of the co-ops.

      <P>I recognise what the Minister for the Marine is endeavouring to do in this amendment.  Now that we are discussing an amendment to section 14 let me say on behalf of the Fine Gael Party that our concerns and opposition not just to this section but to other sections of the Bill must be raised.  The terms of reference of the fisheries co-operatives are questionable because they are not within the terms of reference of co-operatives as we know them.  It is questionable whether voting rights will be able to be conferred on members at all.  Therefore, I am opposed to this amendment to section 14.  We, on this side of the House, have consistently questioned and opposed the proposed co-operative structure and questioned the constitutionality and the terms of reference of the proposed structure.  Being consistent with our opposition when the Bill was going through the Dáil, I am again placing on record our opposition to this section, as amended, and other sections.  The proposed co-operative structure is of doubtful origin and I question also its constitutionality.</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate in this House it was mentioned that life members should be included in the electorate free of charge.  The Minister has now done that.  Basically, this is a technicality because it would appear this was overlooked when the Bill was first drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Bill was debated in this House prior to the recess, developments have indicated serious flaws in it and it is only right and proper we should mention this during the course of the debate on <Col N="1381" /> this amendment which deals with elections and other aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to postpone the proposed elections to the co-operatives, as envisaged in the Bill in order to give people the opportunity to encourage members to become involved. The new season will be starting soon and time is running out for people to become involved.  A more serious aspect, and it again hinges on the elections to the co-operatives, is that its constitutinality is being questioned at present and I must put on record that there is serious doubt about the constitutionality of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but he is obviously straying very far from the amendment before the House.  I should remind the House that the amendment replaces section 14 (1) of the Bill as passed by this House.  The new subsection proposed to be inserted slightly rephrases the original subsection and includes a new provision relating to the entitlement to vote of former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust Incorporated.  We cannot have a rehash of the principles of the Bill all over again.  We are at present involved in considering a Seanad amendment under Standing Orders 137 and 138. These Standing Orders limit our discussion to the amendment before us and its acceptance with or without amendment, or indeed rejection, if the House so thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only amendments that are strictly relevant or consequential upon the amendment can be considered.  Accordingly, any mechanism of recommittal or extension of the debate is not appropriate at this time.  Furthermore, the suggestion of a recommittal motion may only be made prior to the order for Fifth Stage which in this instance has long since passed.  The Fifth Stage has long since passed.  I would ask Members to confine their remarks to the amendment before us.  We cannot <Col N="1382" /> have a reopening of the various aspects of the Bill or indeed its constitutionality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for the <Col N="1383" /> Marine rightly states, the specific issue of the granting of voting rights in elections to the regional fisheries boards to former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust was raised by me during the course of Committee Stage.  I think it is proper that the former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust should be entitled to vote in elections to the regional fisheries boards.  However, the amendment from the Seanad gives rise to two questions. The first aspect arises from the presentation again of section 14 as amended by the Seanad to this House and the second aspect arises from the timing of the presentation of this amendment to us.  Both of these aspects need to be considered by the Minister when he is replying and before the Bill goes to the President for signature.</P>
      <P>Essentially, section 14 is about elections to regional fisheries boards.  These elections, as I understand it, are due to be held in December of this year.  Normally, the Minister would make the necessary statutory instrument for the holding of these elections before the end of October.  The problem that arises now is that section 14, which we are dealing with at present, defines the electorate for the elections to the regional fisheries boards.  Given the paperwork that will necessarily have to be undertaken to get registers, nominations and ballot papers ready for any such election, it seems unlikely that the elections to the regional fisheries boards can proceed when they are due at the end of December.  In any event, the fisheries co-operatives to be established under this Bill are not due to be formally set up until 1 January 1992, by which time the elections for the regional fisheries boards will have taken place if they are held when they are due to be held.  At that stage the members of the co-operatives and the former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust, with whom we are immediately concerned, will have been prevented from voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> That point leads to the second issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Deputy will not stray too far from the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not straying at all. I am sticking strictly to the question of holding the regional fisheries boards elections and the definition of the electorate for those elections, which is what this amendment is about.</P>
      <P>The second issue it gives rise to, concerns the constitutionality of the Bill. During the earlier Dáil debate on the Bill, and I am not going to be repetitive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not going to.  I am sticking strictly to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have restricted other Deputies in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, and I am staying strictly with the amendment. If you bear with me, you will see the relevance of what I am saying and that I am sticking with the definition of the electorate, which is what the amendment is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, during the earlier debate I did warn that some sections of the Bill may be unconstitutional.  I have now been supported in that view by a legal opinion obtained by the National Anglers' Representative Association which has been forwarded to me and, I presume, to other Members of the House.  That opinion clearly states that the Bill will transform fishing, which has been a perfectly innocent and legal activity heretofore, into a criminal act subject to penalties unless the angler complies with the decision of the so-called co-operative society, of which he or she may or may not be a member.  I raise this issue because if the amendment before the House now had been accepted by the Minister when I proposed it on Committee Stage &mdash; and <Col N="1385" /> the Minister would need to address this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not table it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I put it to the Minister very strongly that this should be included in the Bill.  There were several occasions on Committee and Report Stages when the amendment could have been accepted by the Minister, and if it had, Deputies would not be back in he House now, on the eve of holding elections to regional fisheries boards, to consider the major questions of whether those elections can proceed and, if they do, whether the elections will be properly held in that a substantial section of the electorate, namely, the members of the co-operatives and the former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust, may be prevented from voting.  I should like the Minister to give consideration to the two aspects on which I have spoken, namely, the holding of elections and the constitutionality of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Minister.  I should like to basically agree with what has been said by other Deputies, and I put on record my grave doubts about the constitutionality of the Bill, particularly in regard to sections 9 and 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely all Deputies would agree that former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust should be facilitated in this way, although I am bound to say that the concept of a former life member is one that leaves me a little <Col N="1386" /> puzzled.  However, we all understand what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be voting in the Dáil elections next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Only for your party, Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      <P>The House is now considering the election of members to the fisheries boards, which, of course, have statutory functions under previous legislation and functions given to them under this Bill.  Until now they have operated on a basis that has been uncontested legally, that is, we have all agreed with the functions they have been given up to and including the time the Bill came before us.  I must point out that several of my Opposition colleagues and myself have doubts about the functions that are being given to the fisheries boards now.  As I said during the Second Stage debate, it seems that in some respects they are becoming instruments with which to wreak the Minister's will on the co-operative societies.</P>
      <P>The question concerning co-operative societies is much more difficult.  It seems that fisheries boards, which are now composed to some degree of members elected by the societies, could become tainted with the suspicion of unconstitutionality if a part of the process that elects their members is tainted with that suspicion. It seems that the status of the so-called co-operative societies, as provided for in the Bill &mdash; because I do not believe for a moment that they are co-operative societies &mdash; is suspect.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into the details of that matter because I am very much aware of the restrictions on this debate but, basically, the co-operative societies will be called &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; because the Minister tells people they must co-operate on specific terms or else they will have no status.  I cannot imagine that being the proper status for a co-operative society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The societies are being given functions in areas in which they seem to have no title to exercise functions.  They are being given functions to restrict the activities of individuals in areas in which they have no title to restrict those activities because <Col N="1387" /> they are not the possessors of any of the things they claim to be giving out or allowing people to do.  Therefore, the coopeative societies seem to have a very doubtful status.  They seem &mdash; a little like the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; to be only slightly constitutional, and thus any election of fisheries boards on that basis would in itself be tainted with unconstitutionality.</P>
    <P>For that reason, this amendment &mdash; taking it all together and without the slightest disrespect or ill will intended towards former life members &mdash; should be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up points made by Members of the House.</P>
      <P>First, in relation to the question of constitutionality, I had the Bill at all Stages examined by the Attorney General, a distinguished lawyer in his own right and now a judge in the European Court.  He had no doubt whatsoever about the Bill's constitutionality.  Consequently, I set my mind at rest in relation to the aspect of constitutionality.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes and Deputy O'Sullivan raised a point in relation to constitutionality. The postponement until now of the consideration of this amendment from the Seanad occurred because Deputy O'Sullivan in particular and the Opposition in general &mdash; although I think one could exclude Deputy Garland &mdash; refused to take this simple amendment before the summer recess.  For several days I appealed to the Whip, hoping to have made available to me the few minutes necessary to put the finishing touches to the Bill.  That did not happen. I regarded that as nihilism, negativism; an obstructionist tactic for its own sake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to state that there were very good reasons that the amendment was not taken before the recess, and they are borne out this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Sullivan is <Col N="1388" /> setting himself up as a constitutional expert&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;then perhaps I would accept his thesis, otherwise I do not.</P>
      <P>In my few general remarks I shall cover the point made by Deputy Gilmore, who also raised the question of constitutionality. I paid particular attention to the points made in the House when the Bill was passing all Stages.  It was for that reason that I recorded Deputies Gilmore and Garland being in favour of this amendment.  But, due to pressures of work and so on, perhaps it would have been better had I tabled the amendment seeing that Deputy Gilmore did not do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I fail to understand what Deputy Dukes means by former life members; he made some play out of words there.  There is now no trust so that people who were formerly members of the Inland Fisheries Trust are no longer members because the trust no longer exists.  The word &ldquo;former&rdquo; is quite a simple English word.  For example, Deputy Dukes was a former leader of his party, a good one, who supported a good Government, a good party in Government, and gained four seats for his party.</P>

      <P>Please, my ambitions are strictly limited.</P>
      <P>While I am pleased that the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990, has passed all Stages in the Dáil and Seanad I am disappointed to have to say that the system of fisheries co-operative societies provided for in the Bill would have been established by now but for a gratuitous refusal by Opposition parties to take a simple Seanad amendment before the summer recess.  The trout angling season for 1991 is over.  Consequently, the potential for selling share certificates for the current year is very limited.  Such a position means that, with the regional board elections due in December 1991 &mdash; as Deputy Gilmore pointed out &mdash; the electorate, for the purpose of electing a management committee, voting on the share certificate requirement and electing representatives to the regional fisheries boards, will be very limited.  In this regard I have been approached by all the fisheries interests &mdash; and now by the Deputy concerned &mdash; seeking the postponement of the elections to the regional boards. This implies the postponement of the elections and ballots of the co-operatives for one year to allow adequate time for co-operatives to be properly established and give anglers every possible opportunity to purchase share certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered the many representations made to me I am pointing out the difficulties which would exist if <Col N="1390" /> the elections were to go ahead in December 1991.  I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that, in the interests of having successful and effective elections/ballots to co-operatives, it will be necessary to postpone the regional board elections for one year.  That does not mean we are postponing the setting up of the co-operatives; they will be on schedule.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to lay a draft order postponing the board elections before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Such an order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft order has been passed by each House in accordance with section 15 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.  I am pleased with the interest, even the enthusiasm as shown in correspondence, with which the proposals have been received.  I am appealing to the spokespersons in this House, in the social and economic interests of the country, to support wholeheartedly this new, refreshing approach to development.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that the amendment deals in particular with the position of former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust because the Minister has not clarified to any great extent exactly what is their position rather than their entitlement to vote at board elections.  He very clearly specifies that they will not be entitled to vote in the election of committees to the co-operatives.  He has not specifically clarified their position in relation to membership of those co-operatives.  While it is specifically stated that they will not be able to vote in co-operative elections their membership of or involvement in co-operatives at any other level has not been clearly specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must welcome the overall idea of those former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust being afforded an opportunity of voting in fisheries boards elections. However, this amendment is <Col N="1391" /> indicative of something very fundamental in relation to the Bill, in particular to section 14, that is that all the flaws obtaining within and without the section and their inherent dangers may be subjected to a constitutional challenge.  The Bill may be referred by the President to the Supreme Court which is, of course, entirely a matter for her.</P>
    <P>While a portion of the amendment is welcome, overall it implies a much more fundamental difficulty in the Bill.  It will be very difficult for us on this side of the House to support it.</P>

Apparently, another election is to be postponed today.</P>

The Minister got himself into this hole.  Several times during the debate on the Bill, we on this side of the House made it clear that if the Minister simply abolished the rod licence and forgot about trying to replace it with a <Col N="1392" /> kind of back door method of raising money for fisheries, he would not be in this position.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with voting rights of former members of the Inland Fisheries Trust, in itself a welcome proposal.  Four years after this Bill was introduced, irrespective of the desire to see an end to the famous or infamous rod licence issue, as legislators, we will be responsible for whatever type of Bill becomes law.  The Minister, the people with whom he had so much discussion and so on, in the end will not be responsible.  Rather it will be the legislators who will be held responsible. Irrespective of my great desire to see an end to the rod licence issue we are aware that this legislation is a complete whitewash, for political reasons, to abolish the rod licence rather than the Minister having abolished it altogether and begun afresh with something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Member I am very reluctant to be recorded as somebody responsible for the enactment of this legislation.  I take the Minister's word that he sought the advice of the Attorney General and that, <Col N="1393" /> according to the Attorney General, the Bill is not unconstitutional.  I am in no position to argue with that.  I presume the Cabinet collectively studied the advice of the Attorney General and were satisfied.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied that we, the Members of this House, should be responsible for writing into legislation something over which there is a doubt. The abolition of the licence comes after four years of debate and we will be held responsible for whatever new legislation is introduced.  We must place on record our doubts about the legality of the Bill. It is a complete whitewash and farce for political reasons, although of course we will be happy if it gets rid of the rod licence.</P>

      <P>Without wishing to delay unduly this long saga, I should like to respond briefly to some of the Minister's remarks.  We on this side of the House must reject any suggestion of our being obstructionist or that we have been deliberately delaying the passage of this Bill. We almost begged the Minister for the guidelines again and again because we wished to work constructively and productively on the Bill.  The doubts which we have about the efficacy of the Bill are shared by outside interests, the people who will have to live with it and administer it.  If there is a question as to the constitutionality of the Bill, we must explore that possibility.  We engaged in principled opposition because of our doubts as to the constitutionality of the co-operatives.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael oppose the amendment.  In doing so we are symbolically opposing the Bill on the grounds which we have explained fully during its passage through both Houses.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to accuse the Minister of being less than careful in his approach to the Bill and I am prepared to accept that the Minister and the then Attorney General, now a Judge of the Court of Justice of the EC, went through it in some detail to satisfy themselves as to its constitutionality.  I should like to remind the Minister, lest he become too <Col N="1394" /> comfortable in his skin about it, that the then Minister for Agriculture and the then Attorney General in 1966 apparently were satisfied as to the constitutionality of the provisions of the Marts Bill of that year which was subsequently struck down by the courts on the grounds that the powers it gave to the Minister were too arbitrary.  This Bill gives arbitrary powers to the Minister to transfer in turn arbitrary powers to these co-operatives.  It is very likely to be suspect and the Minister should be a little less comfortable than he is.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), to delete line 20, and substitute the following: &ldquo;(a) damage caused by death or by personal injuries, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that in this Bill the Directive which is being implemented is given for convenience of reference in the Schedule to the Bill.  This is a welcome development which I hope will be followed whenever this kind of legislation is brought before the House.  All too often we have had to do tremendous research to find these documents.  This precedent should be followed on all occasions.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment. Something very strange has happened here.  I do not know whether it is intentional. The drafting of the Bill has moved away from the wording of the Directive, although normally one is at pains to follow very exactly the wording of the Directive.  The definition of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; has been changed from that contained in the Directive.  It may at first sight not appear to matter but it has very serious implications, intended or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> (a) death or personal injury, or</P>
    <P>(b) loss of, damage to, or destruction of, any item of property other than the defective product itself.</P>
    <P>If a defective product exploded or otherwise caused injury the Bill would provide for two categories of damage only.  An injured person could get compensation for that injury and he could also be compensated for damage to any item of property. One very important category is omitted, that is, the category of consequential losses.  It is an inherent and basic principle of our law, and has been for centuries, that if damage is caused a person can get compensation for injury, damage to property and consequential loss.  If a car has a defective mechanism which causes it to crash, serious injury may result which may cause a man to be out of work for two years or even permanently, say in the case of loss of limbs.  The consequential element, the loss of earnings, is excluded as the Bill is presented.</P>
    <P>All will hinge on the definition of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo;.  A person will get compensation for an injury and for any loss of property.  This important category of consequential losses, including things like loss of earnings or loss of the use of an article, such as a motor car, is being specifically excluded in the wording of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is all the more strange when one goes back to the directive.  We see that the wording of the directive has been changed.  The definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in the directive at Article 9 on page 11 of the Bill is as follows:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of Article 1, &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means:</P>
    <P>(a) damage caused by death or by personal injuries;</P>
    <P>At first sight that might appear to be the same thing but it is very different in fact because if one adopts the wording of the directive damage caused by personal injuries would clearly include consequential losses.  It seems quite clear that <Col N="1396" /> the intent of the directive is to include that category of damage.  Damage caused by death or personal injuries includes the normal use of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; which does include consequential losses. However, because the Minister has changed the wording of the directive, he is giving an entirely artificial and limited meaning to &ldquo;damage&rdquo; from the position it has under ordinary law.  I find that strange and I wonder is that intentional or did it work its way into the drafting of the Bill by accident.</P>
    <P>There is another strange thing about it.  If we were to adopt the Bill in its present form we would immediately be running into apparent conflict within the Bill itself.  I would like to draw attention to page 3, line 19, which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A word or expression that is used in this Act and is also used in the Council Directive has, unless the contrary intention appears, the meaning in this Act that it has in the Council Directive&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By that definition it is purporting to be giving a primacy of interpretation to the position in the directive which is in conflict with the definition of damage given here.  In a nutshell, what it amounts to is that the definition of damages is all too limited and a meaning has been given to it that would not be in accordance with the directive, and that, I am quite sure, Deputies would not want.  It is an important and very worthwhile new concept that is being brought in in the Bill.  However, it seems to be limited so that one would only get compensation for the injury as a result of a bad product and for damage to other property and if one loses earnings from being put out of work for a long period, one cannot recover earnings or damages for the loss of the use of the item itself and one might have to hire another item, say, a tractor or something one used for work.  I am rather puzzled about it and I hope we can correct that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Taylor for his comments on the Bill.  We have incorporated the directive in the <Col N="1397" /> annexe to the legislation.  Although Article 9 of the directive uses the same wording as that in the proposed amendment, it is felt that the terms used in the Bill &mdash; that damage means death or personal injury &mdash; is more specific than any other interpretation.  In consultation with the Attorney General, we have changed the words in section 1 slightly for clarification purposes, but I am very interested in the views expressed by Deputy Taylor.</P>
      <P>This subsection defines certain words and expressions used throughout the Bill. This is self-explanatory as the court must, in accordance with section 1 (3), construe it so as to give effect to the directive.  The text is included as a Schedule to the Bill. This definition is based very closely on Article 9 of the directive.  There are two elements to the damage for which the producer can be liable, damage to the person which is confined to death or personal injury &mdash; compensation for non-material damage, e.g., pain and suffering falls outside the scope of the Bill &mdash; and non-material damage, e.g. pain, suffering and anguish which shall continue to be governed by the existing law of tort.  Damage to property excludes the defective product itself and property used in the commercial sphere.  Damage in respect of the defective product itself is already covered in Ireland by contract law, i.e., the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  That Act incorporates two important implied conditions into every contract sale: (1) that the product or goods are of merchantable quality and (2) that they are reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are intended. If a product is defective when purchased it is almost certain not to comply with at least one and in most cases both of these criteria.  The present Bill does not preclude the injured person having recourse to his rights under the law of tort.  This is specifically provided for in subsection (1) (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Commission have had sight of the Bill and saw no difficulty with the wording for &ldquo;damage&rdquo;.  Though I accept the points put forward by Deputy Taylor which seem quite reasonable from the point of view that we have changed the <Col N="1398" /> wording slightly, it has not been changed to prevent litigation in this regard.  It has not been changed to ensure that, in a sense, the litigant would be in a better position.  The Attorney General saw the Bill and was satisfied with it.  Indeed, he recommended the wording included in the Bill before the House.  That is why at this stage, I would suggest that Deputy Taylor reconsider his amendment in light of the information and advice I have received from the Attorney General.  I will bear in mind the points made by Deputy Taylor.  I think consequential damage would not be excluded under Irish Law in relation to defective products. I am certainly interested in the views put forward by Deputy Taylor and maybe we could have further dialogue in relation to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I waited to see if the Minister of State would have anything positive to say.  He is clearly, as he says himself, interested in what Deputy Taylor has said but has not acknowledged that Deputy Taylor is doing quite a good service to the Government and to the House in highlighting this issue.  I am always amazed on Committee Stage at the failure of anyone in the Government to admit that an error has been made.  It is quite clear that what Deputy Taylor has put forward highlights a drafting error in the preparation of the legislation.  He has put the case well and explained clearly the area that would be omitted by the definition of damage that was there, that is, the whole area of consequential losses arising from damage caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said it is not intended that the Bill shall exclude other areas of legal remedy, namely, tort and contract rules in existing law.  However, that does not go far enough.  The whole intention of this leglislation is to introduce a standard of strict liability.  In other words, where a defect arises and damage is caused in circumstances covered by the Bill, there is strict liability, there is no loophole where the manufacturer or the distributor can say that while an article was defective he was not negligent in any way and therefore, should, not be made <Col N="1399" /> answerable as the fault lies elsewhere. That has been the bane of many consumers who have sought a legal remedy for defective products.  They have been simply pushed about and given the run around by various agencies, whether it be the manufacturer, producer or distributor of the goods.  Quite often they have ultimately failed to get a proper or adequate remedy.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has been deliberating on this issue since 1976 and produced a Directive in 1985.  It is now forcing the Irish Government to introduce this legislation by threat of legal action under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome.  It is doing this because it wants to introduce a regime of strict liability which will avoid dancing about on the rights of consumers which has been the hallmark of the free market as we know it in Europe.</P>
    <P>When we talk about who is entitled to compensation and in what circumstances, what amounts to damage is crucial because this lays down the parameters for when compensation can follow.  It is every consumer's entitlement in those circumstances that compensation should follow on a strict liability basis, all other things being equal and covered in the legislation.  If I understood the Minister correctly, he said that pain and suffering compensatory considerations were outside the scope of the Bill.  That is a worrying statement and I should like the Minister to elaborate on it, if he is using it as a justification for not including in the Bill the consequential elements Deputy Taylor has addressed in his amendment. The Minister should acknowledge that the omission from the Bill of the elements highlighted by Deputy Taylor in his amendment are a serious cause of concern and agree to look at the matter between now and Report Stage.  It is a matter for Deputy Taylor to decide what he does with his amendment but I would certainly regard it as a useful way of making progress in this matter.</P>
    <P>Clearly the definition of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in the Bill must run with the definition in the Directive.  If it does not, <Col N="1400" /> then I can borrow this point in pursuit of an argument I want to make in relation to a later matter in the legislation.  Even if it does run with the definition in the Directive it is equally an argument I want to use in the context of the definition of primary agricultural products where the Minister has slipped in the word &ldquo;fisheries&rdquo; in addition to what is included in the Directive.  We need to talk about this point before the day is out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor has commended the scheduling of the original Directive as part of the legislation proper.  As he said, this is a good way of dealing with it.  It is very simple and straightforward legislation and to some degree it is an extension of the very shoddy practice which existed heretofore whereby almost every EC Directive was introduced into Irish law by way of ministerial regulation. While much the same structure was used, instead of a Bill prefacing it there was a ministerial pronouncement that he or she was bringing a Directive into Irish law. The Minister would simply sign it without any debate in this Chamber or giving us the opportunity to look at the language to see how it would fit into the judicial and legislative language of our laws.</P>
    <P>Obviously one of the points which was not included in the information on the Bill was the addendum to the Directive that it should be introduced into domestic law by 1 July 1989, which is when this Bill should have been passed.  It is a very poor reflection on both the Government and this House that we are only debating Committee Stage here today simply because the European Commission has threatened this Government with legal action before the European Court of Justice under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome for inaction and failure to abide by the implementation deadline laid down in the Directive.  I wanted to make that point because while I believe that praise should be given where it is due I equally believe that criticism should be made where it is due.  Deputy Taylor has identified a very important issue in his amendment and it deserves much more <Col N="1401" /> consideration than the Minister has given it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Taylor's amendment which deals with a very important issue.  He is seeking to ensure consistency in the implementation of European Directives in Irish law.  I have often heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce say in this House that there must be consistency in regard to European legislation and that this is why he must conform as closely as possible to what is contained in a Directive.  This is the perfect opportunity for the Minister to do this.  There is no reason the Minister cannot conform with what is contained in this Directive which specifically states that compensation will be paid to consumers in respect of damage caused by death or by personal injuries.</P>
      <P>With the advent of the Single Market in 1992 consumers will be able to purchase goods more easily in transborder areas. By not adopting wording which is as close as possible to the wording in the Directive the precise meaning of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; could be misinterpreted in other jurisdictions.  This could cause consumers great distress and give rise to difficulties when seeking redress in other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we are debating this Bill today is that the Irish Government have already been found guilty by the European Court of Justice of not implementing this Directive on 26 July.  The report on that case states that the Irish Government did not even inform the Commission that they were introducing legislation to conform with the Liability for Defective Products Directive.  This was gross negligence on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government who had the audacity to turn up their noses at the Commission in respect of this Directive.  This is a further indication of the anti-consumer thinking of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to this matter.  I do not agree with his attempts to misconstrue in whatever small way he can the common notion of redress throughout the European Community.  The wording of <Col N="1402" /> Deputy Taylor's amendment is clearly consistent with the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; used throughout the European Community.  The fact that his wording is as close as possible to the wording used in the Directive meets with my approval, as it will eliminate the possibility of consumers experiencing difficulties in seeking compensation for damage in another jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>The Bill states that the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means &ldquo;death or personal injury, of...&rdquo; while the directive refers to &ldquo;damage caused by death or by personal injuries.&rdquo;  We have examined that and discused it with the Attorney General.  Deputy McCartan mentioned he found it frustrating on Committee Stage that we are not prepared, at times, to accept amendments.  I am very anxious to accept amendments where we are satisfied they can be of benefit to the Bill. I accept that all wisdom does not exist on one side of the House even with the best advice of the Attorney General and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, a Cheann Comhairle, bearing in mind that I am anxious, with the consent of the House, to have all Stages passed today, I am prepared to look at the matter in the course of the day, take further advice from the Attorney General's office if necessary, and, if the House is agreeable, come back on Report Stage when this amendment <Col N="1403" /> would be put forward by Deputy Taylor. I suggest we move on to the next provision and that I come back later in the evening or, if we do not agree to Report Stage today at a later date, when we can have further elaboration of this section. I am suggesting this because of the views put forward by the Deputies.  I did not accept this amendment initially on the advice available in my Department.  It proposes to go outside the wording of the Directive, which I am not very happy about.  It would be more satisfactory if we kept to the exact wording of the Directive. We received advice from the Attorney General that the wording in the Bill is more satisfactory, more specific and is closed to any other interpretation. At the end of the day the courts will rule on this legislation and the consequential losses.  My information is that the Bill does not exclude what the courts would decide in relation to consequential losses resulting in death or personal injury. Surely, personal injury will result in consequential losses.  It will depend on the personal injuries sustained.</P>
    <P>I am not committed to taking Report Stage today but it can be postponed to another day.  I am pepared to have a second look at this amendment from Deputy Taylor.  I accept he has strong grounds for moving it in that it is contained in the Directive.  I will be arguing in a few moments that we retain words in the Bill while Deputies opposite will be putting forward amendments to delete them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I am anxious to give the House an idea of what is coming later in the Bill.  I am not conceding anything at this stage.  When in Opposition I put forward amendments <Col N="1404" /> which were accepted by the then Minister, Deputy Mitchell, on the Communications Bill and others.  I am of the view that there is no lessening of the authority of the Government side of the House by agreeing to well worded and well argued amendments from either side of the House.  That is the case here.  I assure the Deputy I will give further consideration to this matter before Report Stage &mdash; whether that is today or on another day &mdash; and I will come back to the House to argue the point further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister accepts my point, will examine it and come back to us on Report Stage.  I want to make a number of points arising out of what the Minister said.  He talked about an injured person's rights under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  I appeal to the Minister to get away from that Act when considering this Bill which is new.  It brings in a whole new concept of strict liability &mdash; for want of a better term.  Let us not get caught up and say we could have a claim under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of a claim under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act are completely different as the provisions are more restrictive.  We should not hide behind the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act because we are breaking new ground in this Bill.  Let us not run for cover to that Act under any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am puzzled by some of the Minister's comments.  I understood him to say &mdash; perhaps I did not understand him clearly &mdash; that the concept of compensation for pain and suffering was excluded from the terms of this Bill.  The Minister said that and yet he said, on the other hand, that the intention was that consequential losses should not be excluded.  I beg to differ with him if he thinks pain and suffering are excluded; I do not think they are; they are included in the Bill as drafted. It would be completely unacceptable if they were excluded.  The Bill as drafted includes compensation for pain and suffering because that is what personal <Col N="1405" /> injury is.  Damage means death or personal injury.  Within the ambit of the personal injury classification compensation for pain and suffering would be included.  I do not know where the Minister gets the idea from that that is excluded.  If that was the case it would be too much.  I do not think the Minister is right about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say there was no intention to exclude consequential losses.  The fact that he concedes that point is a major step forward and I am very pleased to hear it.  That may be his intention but we have to see if his intention is being put into practice in the Bill.  It seems to me, in the light of what was said unintentionally, that it was not provided for.  In the ordinary practice of the law for generations &mdash; I do not want to get too technical &mdash; when the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; is used on its own and is not interpreted, it includes damages for personal injuries, pain and suffering, the loss of a limb or whatever, damage to property and all consequential losses. That is the standard practice.</P>
    <P>If one did not define the word it would have the definition given to it by law.  In law the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; includes all those things.  The Bill does not leave the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; to be interpreted by law in the ordinary way.  It gives it a special definition which restricts it to two specific categories, death or personal injury &mdash; compensation for the pain and suffering because of the loss of a limb or whatever &mdash; and damage caused to other property, not the item itself, but other property.  If we did not have that restriction it would include the item itself &mdash; that is excluded &mdash; but other property is included.</P>
    <P>Consequential losses are not provided for in this definition.  All a court can do is look at the definition and decide if the person injured is entitled to damage.  But what does damage mean?  It is given a special meaning in the Bill, not the usual meaning that the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; has in law, personal injury or damage to other property.  Consequential losses are clearly excluded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the wording in the Directive as a small differential, it <Col N="1406" /> may appear small but the effect of it is very substantial.  The Directive also defines the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; as meaning damage caused by death or personal injuries.  Damage caused by personal injury would include consequential losses.  It would be very dangerous to go away from the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; given in the Directive, which we are obliged to bring in, and introduce a narrower definition of our own.</P>
    <P>The matter could be dealt with in either of two ways, by going back to the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; as given in the Directive or &mdash; to cover the consequential losses item, which could be achieved &mdash; by adopting my amendment No. 4 which is related.  The Minister has already signalled to us that he has to abide by the wording of the Directive where other amendments are concerned.  The obligation of the House so far as the EC Directive is concerned is to bring in as a minimum what the Directive requires. There is nothing to stop the House being more generous to the consumer than the Directive requires.  Some of the amendments go towards that end.  It is open to the House to give what the Directive provides for, and a bit more as well.  What we cannot do and what this definition is doing, is to give the consumer less than the Directive provides for.  Apart from any consideration of the need to protect the interests of the consumer, I fear that here we are giving less to the consumer than the Directive requires us to do.  We could find ourselves in yet more litigation on the issue as to whether we are in default on the Directive.</P>
    <P>We have problems enough with litigation on all these sorts of things without deliberately inviting it by not complying with the wording of the Directive.  I am pleased that the Minister takes the point. I hope I have not been too technical about it.  I look forward to further comment on this from the Minister on Report Stage as promised.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the points put forward by the Deputies in this area and I am prepared to listen carefully to what they have to say.  The EC Directive says that the article shall be without prejudice to national provisions relating to non-material damage.  That leaves all existing legislation in place.  This is not a consolidation Bill which would bring forward previous legislation and make it more composite legislation.  This Bill is to incorporate the Directive in Irish law. That is our clear mandate and we are sticking to it.  Otherwise we would have further delays and difficulties.</P>

      <P>The EC Commission who saw the draft Bill did not have any difficulty accepting the wording.  The wording put forward by Deputy Taylor is similar to the original wording in the Directive.  The wording we put forward is a slight variation but it does not affect the thrust of the Bill.  The Commission found no difficulty in accepting the minor alteration we put forward in consultation with our legal advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 9 of the Directive excludes non-material damage which deals with pain and suffering and says that the article shall be without prejudice to the national provisions relating to non-material damage.  At this stage we should adjourn this debate until Report Stage.  I accept Deputy McCartan's point that it may be preferable to have a Report Stage on the Bill so that all in the House can be satisfied that the Bill is in line with the Directive as issued by the EC.  We could <Col N="1408" /> have an early Report Stage with the agreement of the House and the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 22, to delete &ldquo;other than&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;including&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 deals with the definition of damage in paragraph (b) where it says damage means</P>
      <P>(6) loss of, damage to, or destruction of, any item of property other than the defective product itself.</P>
      <P>No doubt the Minister will say he does not have to provide for that because of the Directive and that may be so, but it would be ridiculous if a producer put out a defective product, for instance, a motor car, which self-destructs, as they used to say in a popular television programme, and it crashes into a wall and the car is wrecked and we said the damaged wall is recoverable but the car which was defective could not be claimed for under this Bill.  That is the whole basis of the matter. An ordinary citizen would say that the first thing which should be recoverable is the defective item but that is the one item the Bill goes out of its way to exclude.  It is the first item that should be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not refer me to the Sale of Goods Act.  I know all about it.  That is different.  There could be sets of circumstances where a person might not be in a position to avail of the Sale of Goods Act &mdash; different criteria have to be proved to avail of a remedy under the Sale of Goods Act.  It might not be possible to establish certain facts under the Sale of Goods Act whereas it would be possible to come within the ambit of this Bill which breaks new ground and sets up new circumstances.  That is the <Col N="1409" /> sort of category we are talking about. Why legislate so that a producer can send out a defective or perhaps dangerous product which goes wrong and a person cannot claim for it?  Reason and logic rebel against it.  There is no reason to exclude the item even if the Directive allows us to do so.  As a matter of broad general principle the item should be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording in the Bill in this case is the same as that contained in the Directive.  We have no discretion in this matter.  In any event, damage to the defective product is already covered in Irish contract law, that is, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. That Act incorporates two important conditions into every contract of sale. These are that (1) the product or goods are of merchantable quality and (2) that they are reasonably fit for the purposes for which they are intended.  If a product is defective when purchased it is almost certain not to comply with at least one and, in most cases, both these criteria.  In this regard I feel I am on much safer ground in opposing the amendment put down by Deputy Taylor as I am complying 100 per cent with the EC Directive. I am quite satisfied that the matter is well covered by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.</P>
      <P>This is not a consolidation Bill as such although in Deputy Taylor's view it would be necessary to consolidate previous legislation in one Bill.  It is quite clear from the Directive what is intended. In the circumstances I would recommend that Deputy Taylor, in support of his first amendment, withdraw the second amendment to ensure the legislation before the House complies 100 per cent with the wording in the Directive as approved by the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my earlier contribution, I accept that the wording does conform with the Directive on this issue but there is nothing to stop the House, if it was minded to do so, going beyond the minima required in the Directive. The requirements of the Directive <Col N="1410" /> would be met if we did what they want and they would not mind for sure if we provided some additional small benefit to the consumer at the same time.  That would be the intent of this amendment.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding my request to him not to go into the question of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, the Minister of State did go into it but let me put a situation to him.  If a person buys a product which turns out to be defective and which causes damage and the person from whom he bought it is not available or amenable, has no money or the company has gone into liquidation, that person's rights under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, based on contract, would be confined to the vendor of the goods.  He would have to prove negligence if he was to succeed in a claim against anybody higher up the chain were it not for the terms of the Directive and this Bill.  If we were to extend the terms of the Directive by including compensation for the defective item that would meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain what I am talking about in simple terms to the Minister of State. If a person buys an article which turns out to be defective and it destructs, as the Minister of State quite rightly said, under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act they would have a claim against the person from whom they bought it.  There is no problem about that provided the person or company from whom they bought it is there and amenable, but let us say that the firm or the person from whom they bought it is not amenable, has no money or has gone into liquidation, if they are to get recompense for this defective item they would have to examine the question of whether they can proceed agaist a party higher up the sale chain.  They can do this provided they can prove negligence under existing law.  If they can prove negligence against a person higher up the chain they would be all right but if they cannot do so and all they can prove is that the product was defective and not that there was negligence on the part of the person higher up the chain, unless that person is in a <Col N="1411" /> situation of strict liability they would lose out in respect of the defective item.</P>
    <P>The purport and intent of this Bill is to introduce this new concept of strict liability without having very often the impossible requirement of having to prove negligence.  Let us face it, most consumers would find it extremely difficult to prove negligence on the part of producers who have all the resources behind them.  What I am saying is this: as we are very laudably introducing in this Bill this new concept of strict liability it seems in conceivable, strange and illogical that the very first item that should be included within it, the defective item itself, is the one item we single out for exclusion.  One can talk about consequential losses and remoteness of damage far away from the actual causation and there is much law on that matter &mdash; but the defective item itself is at the very top of that league.  Therefore, if the person from whom they bought it is gone they will not be able to avail of their rights under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act and since they cannot prove negligence in that category they will not succeed unless the person is brought within the ambit of this Bill.  That does not seem to be a lot to ask.  I know that we are not obligated to do this under the Directive but that would be no reason not to do so if we were so minded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point that Deputy Taylor is making and what he is trying to achieve.  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce the concept of strict liability.  It is arguable whether it will introduce that concept of strict liability as I note a certain defence is included in the list of defences which I will ask the Minister of State to consider as we have power under the Directive to seek a derogation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we come to that we can anticipate what will happen in the future.  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce the concept of strict liability for damage caused by defective products.  Deputy Taylor is arguing that this concept of strict liability should be extended to <Col N="1412" /> include liability for the defect in a product as opposed to any consequent damage cause to other goods with which it was mixed.  The Minister of State made the point that this matter is covered by the 1980 legislation which states that goods sold directly by a supplier to a consumer have to be of merchantable quality and have to be reasonably fit for the purposes for which they are required.  Quite reasonably, Deputy Taylor made the point that if one takes an action under consumer protection legislation one does not have to establish negligence, I think, to succeed; all that one has to establish is that the product&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That the item is defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is not of merchantable quality or not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it is required.  Deputy Taylor asked what the situation would be if the supplier has gone out of business or is no longer amenable.  That is a reasonable question but I am not inclined to think, from my brief reflection on the part of Deputy Taylor's contribution that I managed to hear, that we can extend the legislation that far.  One could just as easily ask if a person would have a right to bring an action, a strict liability claim, against the producer when this Bill becomes law.  If the producer has gone out of business or is not amenable, should that person have a strict liability claim against the supplier?  The argument in that case would be equally valid and I am sure we could think of many other situations to which we would have to extend the Bill if the logic of the amendment was accepted.  I do not deny that Deputy Taylor made a reasonable point but it comes to the fact that we accept there is a no negligence liability against the immediate supplier of a defective product.  However, we are seeking to extend the provisions of the Bill to a situation where the supplier has gone out of business.  People go out of business, which is very unfortunate for the plaintiff, but I do not think that hardship to <Col N="1413" /> the plaintiff justifies extending the proposal in Deputy Taylor's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Dea's contribution as far as it goes. However, the Bill puts a strict liability on producers, as defined, which includes various categories.  If a producer sends out a defective product which causes injury he is liable.  If the product damages other property he is also liable for that. For some reason which I do not understand &mdash; and which has not emerged from Deputy O'Dea's contribution &mdash; we are excluding the provision which should be included first, the product itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a case where a person is no longer amenable; if the person is amenable there is no problem, the matter is settled on a contract basis.  Very frequently the person from whom one bought a defective product has gone out of business, does not have any money or is in liquidation.  In those circumstances one must look elsewhere; if the product injured you or damaged other property you may recover but we are excluding the defective item. There is no logic in that.  For some reason, we are taking it on ourselves to exclude the defective item, which makes no sense.  Why exclude what should be the first item covered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as hardship is concerned, at the end of the day maybe the producer was negligent but, regardless of whether he was, the fact remains that it was a defective product which he produced and sent out.  Can anyone explain the logic in saying that if he makes a defective product which causes injury or damages other property he is liable but he is not liable for the defective product itself and does not have to replace it?  Why should that limited category be excluded when in all common sense &mdash; never mind law &mdash; it should be the first item for which he is responsible.  Let us not shed too many tears in relation to hardship because the <Col N="1414" /> producer manufactured and sent out a defective product.</P>

      <P>Ireland is not purposely singling out or excluding damage to the defective product, the Directive precludes such a remedy.  We cannot extend the legislation to incorporate what Deputy Taylor is seeking and this was pointed out by Deputy O'Dea.

      <P>I am ensuring that the Directive, as drafted in the EC, will be brought into Irish law.  The Bill contains the same wording as in the EC Directive and we cannot extend it.  In fairness, Deputy Taylor made excellent points in relation to consumer requirements but we are covered in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, admirable legislation available to and used extensively by consumers in relation to defective products.  I am not in a position to extend the terms of the Directive as agreed by the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael-Labour Coalition of 1985 agreed to this Directive after intensive discussions and negotiations with the member states.  My Department and I have responsibility to bring it into Irish law, it was brought before the House in 1989 but the general election intervened. <Col N="1415" /> I was very anxious to have this Bill completed before the summer recess of 1991 and I am under considerable pressure from the Commission to have it implemented without further delay.  I am not prepared to accept an amendment because it would be going outside the terms of the Directive as agreed by the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister of State has had extensive discussions with the EC in regard to the Directive.  However, I doubt that the discussions had much to do with the contents of the Bill.  They were probably about what our Government were doing about the implementation of the Directive.</P>
      <P>The intention of the Directive is to approximate the laws within the Community; it is not suggesting that there must be absolute uniformity between the laws in one state and another within the Community.  The point has already been made that the Directive lays down the basic minimum which will be required of all member states to comply with this effort towards approximation.  The Minister referred to 1985; in fact, the discussions began at EC level as far back as 1976 and have been ongoing since.</P>
      <P>At EC level we have been discusssing introducing a consumers' charter of rights, and that is basically what this Directive is addressing.  It is trying to ensure the best and fairest deal for the consumer recognising that you do not frighten out of the market the producer, manufacturer and distributor.  They at least have the profit motive to keep them alive and the consumer has the pressure of necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are trying to do is draw a good balance.  Having adopted the concept of strict liability &mdash; it has been adopted universally throughout the EC &mdash; and having introduced it into our law in the area of consumer rights we should not be afraid of it.  I welcome particularly the indication from Deputy O'Dea that he is at one with Deputy Taylor and myself as regards one of the defences, something we will talk about later.  We have to look <Col N="1416" /> to the whole area of scientific research, the state of the art defence and the balance that has to be maintained.  The important thing is not to stand back from this concept of strict liability.  In general terms the insurance industry will have an input into this whole debate, in protecting the interests of the producer, the manufacturer and the distributor.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea talked about the hardship to the plaintiff.  In this whole area I am thinking of the very small consumer who will save pennies and pounds or, what is usual, will go to a loan company or credit finance company to raise money to buy consumer items which are necessary for use in the home.  Deputy Taylor used the instance of the motor car but in the context of this legislation I am thinking more of items such as washing machines, cookers and electrical appliances that are essential in the home. Invariably because of their poor incomes these people rely on the credit finance corporation.  When the product breaks down because it is shoddy or defective and the unfortunate consumer living in the working class area brings it back to the shop, they find it has closed.  The shop may have been open only for a short period of time and was operated by some cowboy who then moved out very quickly.  There is no-one to whom the consumer has recourse at that stage.</P>
    <P>The first thing that happens is the consumer receives a letter of reminder from the credit company telling him that the state of the equipment has nothing to do with them, that they have a separate contract.  For the first time the unfortunate consumer realises that on the one hand he has a defective product which is worthless while on the other hand the credit finance company are demanding payment in full.  What seemed to the consumer up to then to be one transaction turns out to be two, leaving them losing out on two levels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor's amendment would give the consumer at that stage a good and firm hand to pursue the distributor, manufacturer or producer.  The consumer would be entitled to say: &ldquo;I do not <Col N="1417" /> care whether you bought this product having tested the market fully or whether you claim you are negligent because it was a reputably produced item and your only act was to move it down the line&rdquo;. The consumer in those circumstances should be entitled to say that the issue of negligence does not arise.  He should have rights under the Liability for Defective Products Bill which should state that the manufacturer or producer is strictly accountable and must ensure that the consumer is compensated.  That is what we are trying to address in this legislation. The Minister is right in that the directive does not put the onus on him to allow for compensation for the defective product. Deputy Taylor has a much better case to make than the very neat and comfortable case made by the Minister of State.  This is fundamental to the whole purpose of what we are trying to do in terms of providing a consumer charter, particularly for those who are less able to afford the items I mentioned.  That is why I take up what Deputy O'Dea has said about the question of hardship.  We might well be tilting the balance in favour of the consumer.  I have no doubt that Deputy O'Dea hears about cases such as these in his constituency, and we should do something for these people in this legislation. While to us the hardship might not appear to be great, for the people affected it is great.  The balance should be tipped very much in favour of the consumer.</P>
    <P>On the technical side, the provisions of the 1980 Act applying to standards of merchantable quality have been mentioned. The legal right is there but it is based on negligence and fault, on whether, in litigation, you can point an accusing finger at the distributor, manufacturer or producer.  Unfortunately in this jurisdiction there is no small claims court, no opportunity to pursue without too great a difficulty claims of this type at a reasonable cost to the consumer.  It is to easy to say that the 1980 legislation applies, but all the pitfalls of fault, liability, negligence and so on have to be <Col N="1418" /> considered, and the onus of proving negligence rests on the shoulders of the consumer.</P>
    <P>We should agree to Deputy Taylor's proposal.  It would make our legislation better from the point of view of the consumer. I would ask the Minister to reflect on this matter again and not to simply say that this is what is in the directive and that is the end of it.  In this legislation we are addressing the problems of the community.  The directive is an effort towards approximation, not towards uniformity throughout the Community.</P>

      <P>I will have no row with Deputy McCartan about the need for a small claims court, it is something I have been advocating within my party for quite some time, and I hope to see something of that nature in the not too distant future.  On the question of hardship and tilting the balance in favour of the consumer, of course we want to tilt the balance in favour of the consumer and we are making a start in this Bill.  I take the point made by Deputy McCartan about the people who endeavour to return defective goods to, to use his expression, cowboy operators only to find they have disappeared overnight.  Of course I have dealt with such cases in my constituency, but they are a very small percentage of cases.  I will not throw out figures of 1 or 2 per cent because I have more to do than add up the number of such cases and figure the percentage that has disappeared, but it is a tiny percentage.</P>
      <P>On Deputy McCartan's point about the 1980 legislation, it is my impression &mdash; I could be wrong and if so I am open to correction &mdash; that you do not have to establish negligence to bring a claim under that legislation.  Surely it provides a statutory right to proceed.  We are talking about an action in contract, not in tort, and negligence has to do with tort.  It has nothing to do with contract.  My understanding is that under the 1980 Act you have to establish only that the product in question was not of merchantable quality or was fit for the purpose required.  Negligence does not come into it at all.</P>

      <P>In response to the points made by Deputy McCartan, the draft Bill was discussed with the Commission in he first instance in May 1990, again in July and September 1990 and yet again during the first half of 1991.  The Commission suggested certain changes, a number of which the Government accepted.  A number of other issues raised by the Deputy in relation to consumer credit and cowboy operations are already or will be covered soon by other legislation. The point made by Deputy O'Dea, and indeed by Deputy McCartan in relation to a small claims court is being actively considered by my colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the number of representations on consumer matters he gets at his advice clinics, but, strangely enough, I have not received a great number of representations on this issue.  However, that does not mean that consumer problems do not exist, but that, perhaps, they are more common in urban areas.  Nevertheless legislation is being introduced to ensure that consumers are protected, and it is vital that they are.  I think the 1980 Act was very enlightened legislation, and it is still law.</P>
      <P>In line with the views I expressed on Deputy Taylor's amendment it extends beyond the Directive and, unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept it.</P>

      <P>That is the general procedure that is adopted.  I have no fundamental difference with this Directive.  I accept the decision made by the previous Government in this regard and it is vital that we introduce it into Irish law.</P>
      <P>I am not accepting Deputy Taylor's amendment but I recommend that we should not divide on his amendment because we are implementing an EC Directive.  We have not as much freedom to accept amendments in this case as we have when dealing with Irish legislation which does not have regard to a Directive from the EC Commission.  That is why the first amendment tabled by Deputy Taylor was on far stronger grounds than his second amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 27, after &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or for a business occupation or profession&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would extend somewhat the principle being established in this Bill, admittedly beyond the net, basic minimum requirements of the Directive, but let us be clear about one thing.  There is nothing in our Constitution or in the law which says we may not provide that bit more for consumers than what we are obligated to provide under the Directive. I know that if we do the minimum required by the Directive we will satisfy the EC and the Commission that is all we are obligated to do so far as they are concerned &mdash; but if we do that it is quite open to the House, if the House is so minded, to do that, but to do that bit more as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One should introduce an element of logic into this overall position because we are introducing into our law an important, basic, new principle, which is a good one, that if one manufactures and puts into circulation a defective product, one carries the can for that; one is liable for that whether one is negligent or not or, more importantly, whether the injured party is in a position to prove that one was negligent, which is not necessarily the same thing.  That important new principle is being established.  Either it is a good principle or it is not.  If it is a good principle it should be brought into force within the broad spectrum of human activity; we should not, in a niggardly fashion, be chipping away at it before we even introduce it.  That is precisely what we are doing here in that we are saying a person should be liable only if the damage amounts to more than £350, if it is not the actual item itself; if it is mainly for private use.  If it is a good principle we should do the big thing and bring it in properly and fully without limiting it.  It <Col N="1424" /> would be as though, in the general law of negligence, one was to start limiting it and say: he is liable only if the item concerned is worth more than £350.  In the law of negligence, would anybody dream of saying that if one is negligent and does something wrong one is liable only if one does more than £350 worth of damage or if the item was for private use?  We would not dream of doing that.</P>
    <P>The whole essence of legal principles is that they have broad application if the principle is right.  Of course, if one does not accept the principle that there should be strict liability, all right.  I am sure there is no way this Government would bring forward a measure providing anything on strict liability unless they were obligated to do so by the Commission.  Nonetheless, in modern futuristic thinking, the principle is right, that when a person produces a defective item they are responsible for its consequences whether they were negligent or not.</P>
    <P>When a defective product is produced and circulated and an injury or damage is caused, the injury or damage is done and one cannot get away from that fact. There is one issue only then to be determined, that is: who has to suffer for that? Is it the consumer who bought the article, who has the article, who received injury from it who must ultimately carry the can, or is it the producer who made and sent out this defective article?  It has to be one or the other because the damage has been done.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets up the principle that the person who produced the defective item is the person who is to be responsible. That would be fine were we not setting about hedging it with all these limitations and restrictions, which is precisely what we are doing.  I concede that we are drawing a distinction in the Bill as the Directive allows.  I know the Directive allows that but that does not mean to say that we cannot go beyond it, that it is confined to an item used by the injured person &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;&mdash; whatever that means &mdash; for his own private use or consumption.</P>
    <P>What I am endeavouring to add by way of amendment is that, even if the item was used for a business, occupational or <Col N="1425" /> professional purpose, why exclude that? Why say that a person who produces a defective item which is used by a small businessman, who suffers as a result of that defective item, should be excluded from responsibility?  We must always remember that it is a defective item about which we are talking.  We are not talking about making anybody responsible for a good item because, running through the Bill, one essential provision is that we are talking about defective items.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if a defective item is produced, manufactured and sent out and a small businessman uses it &mdash; it could be a tool, or anything else &mdash; and suffers, why should he be debarred from recovering damages for an injury he sustained or for damage to property that would be done by it?  Why on earth should the person who produced that defective item escape simply because, at the other end, it happened to be used by a person running a small business?  There are many items, possibly most, manufactured and produced whose producer does not know what will be their ultimate usage.  They may be items capable of having a private and/or business use.  The producer does not know what will be the ultimate use of, say, that particular machine, whether it will be used for a private or business purpose.</P>
    <P>Are we then in a lottery position, that if the item turns out to be defective, if it happened to be used for private purposes when it blew, he is caught and, if it happened to be used by a small businessman, he escapes?  Are we in the lottery business here?  Is that what this is about?  We must remember that it is purely a lottery consequence where the same item happened to go or was used.  If a small businessman buys a piece of equipment and it blows on him because it is defective &mdash; always remember it is defective; it was manufactured in a defective manner and turned out to be a defective item &mdash; he is to be debarred, he could be ruined, he could be put out of business, it could destroy him, whereas if he bought the item for a private purpose he would have a perfectly good claim in exactly the same set of circumstances.  Where is the sense <Col N="1426" /> or logic in that?  It does not add up.  There is no rhyme or reason to it; either the item is right or it is not.</P>
    <P>We are introducing an important, good principle but, if we are to do it, let us do it properly.  Let us be sensible about the matter.  Do we say to manufacturers and producers that they had better take care and ensure that the items they are producing or manufacturing and sending out are not defective, that they are all right, but, nonetheless if the goods they send out are defective and, as a result, destroy somebody's business &mdash; to say nothing of injuring him or whatever &mdash; they have to carry the can.  The mere accidental fact that it went to a person running a small business rather than, say, a person using it for leisure purposes is a relevant factor, in that he is caught in the one case and escapes in the other through that purely coincidental fact.  It is the same product, yet a lottery position creeps in in that if a businessman were involved he would escape &mdash; unless negligence can be proved against him, and usually it cannot &mdash; whereas if a private person is involved, he has to pay up.  There is no rhyme or reason to it.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the same section &mdash; subsection (1) (b) (ii) &mdash; we are also opening up a can of worms by the use of the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;; &ldquo;... was used by the injured person primarily for his own private use or consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means but the matter of its interpretation could well go to the Supreme Court and we do not want that.  At this early stage, in drawing up legislation, why do we not endeavour to be more precise about these things, try to foresee legal difficulties and legal arguments? One often wonders about the wide extent of litigation here.  We are regarded as a litigious people.  Part of the fault lies with the Legislature because we do not exercise sufficient care at the formative stage of legislation and often we leave things in too loose a format. One could foresee major court cases over the interpretation of the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;. A person could use an article <Col N="1427" /> sometimes for business and sometimes for private purposes.  It could be a car or any other equipment.  We could have a battle royal in the High Court and the Supreme Court as to whether that was covered.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the new principle being written into law by this Bill should be hedged around by confining it to private user consumption as opposed to business user consumption.  There is no reason in principle why that should be so. This is a fair amendment.  The Minister is not required by the Directive to accept it, but neither is it the position that if the House is minded to extend it in that way it could not do so.  The EC Commission will be quite satisfied if we apply the principle to private use or consumption. If we go beyond that, it is a matter for this House to decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I am speaking in anticipation that the Minister will reply that he is following the Directive only.  He is consistent at least in that.  In regard to principles, there is a case for consistency to be argued.  It seems ridiculous to suggest that a product which is capable of many uses by people in different circumstances should carry with it strict liability when it is used mainly for private consumption purposes. If used for other purposes it will not carry that liability.  The terms private and public use also need to be further defined.  Whatever the circumstances in which a product is used, the user is a consumer and we are endeavouring to protect consumers.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Taylor should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Directive uses the phrase &ldquo;mainly for his own private use or consumption&rdquo;. For some odd reason the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; has been replaced by the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; in the Bill.  I will not engage in a major discussion on the difference between those terms but there certainly is a difference.  &ldquo;Primarily&rdquo;, as its Latin origin suggests, implies that it is used in the first instance.  One might acquire something as a consumer in the first <Col N="1428" /> instance for business use but one might have a private use for it as well.  The motor car is probably the best example. A person in the legal profession might buy a motor car for business use because he needs to get to the office or to court. Such use might consume only a small percentage of the day and the motor car might be used mainly for private purposes, although purchased primarily for business use.  The Minister has access to legal minds and should consider that point before Report Stage.  Whichever term is used will give rise to debate. There is a qualitative and substantive difference between them but my preference is for the word used in the Directive, &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;.  I was alerted to this by Deputy Taylor's amendment which forced me to look more closely at the text of the Bill and of the Directive.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister not to take a narrow, restrictive approach to this amendment.  Our purpose is to introduce a comprehensive consumer code based on strict liability.  We must recognise that whether one buys a product for private or public use one is still a consumer.  Has the Minister been advised in discussions with various agencies here or in the Commission whether there is a clear definition of &ldquo;private use&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;public use&rdquo;?  I am not sure that if one uses something for business it immediately becomes non-private.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on the concept of private as opposed to public use in the context of this legislation.  We still pursue a private existence when we are at work or business.  Some form of definition of the term is necessary before I can be happy with the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy McCartan said in relation to the difference between &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; and &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;.  I did not follow the argument about something being bought primarily for use in business and then used for private purposes.  The definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; relates to use.  We should consider using the wording of the Directive. I prefer the expression &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; because I understand what is meant.  I am not <Col N="1429" /> quite sure that I understand the reason for using an alternative word in the Bill. The intention is that the item would be used by the injured party mainly for his own use or consumption.  Deputy Taylor's amendment seeks to extend that beyond the consumer into the business area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The businessman is also a consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that point.  Deputy Taylor intends to extend it to the consumer who buys something for business purposes or for use in a business.  The whole tenor of the Directive is intended to extend strict liability to protect private consumers rather than people who are purchasing items for use in a business.  I have no objection to that in principle.  I will not fall out with the Minister if it is extended for business use.  I do not know, and I do not want to know, who drafted the amendments on behalf of the Labour Party.  Perhaps Deputy Taylor drafted them himself.  In his subconscious mind Deputy Taylor must have seen the parliamentary draftman's point, that this was intended for protection of the private consumer.  If the Deputy's amendment is accepted strict liability would then be extended to items of a type ordinarily intended for private use which were used by the injured party primarily or mainly for business use.  All business use is not excluded.  I am sure Deputy McCartan did not intend to imply that it was but that could be inferred from some of his earlier remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who purchases an item which is of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption, if it is used by the injured party primarily for private use &mdash; that does not mean that in some instances he could not use it for non-private use &mdash; would have an action provided that the item was used primarily for private use. I would prefer to see the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; used there and that would extend the definition somewhat.  However it would seem illogical that the producer of an item would be strictly liable if he were to sell an item which happened to be <Col N="1430" /> defective and that defective product caused damage to an item of property which was of a type ordinarily intended for private use when it was being put mainly to non-private use.</P>
    <P>The whole tenure of the thing is to protect private consumers who buy these consumer items primarily for private consumption. As I have said, I will not fall out with the Minister if he wishes to extend the definition but it seems to be provided for by the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; being substituted for by the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;.  The definition would satisfy me as it would stand then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>First I will deal strictly with the amendment put forward by Deputy Taylor.  This subparagraph of section 1 (1) is taken verbatim from Article 9 of the Directive and is not subject to an interpretation which would allow its provisions to apply to property damage in the commercial sphere.  Also, in the preamble to the Directive, at page 9, line 7, it specifically states that damage to property should be limited to goods for private use or consumption.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Taylor's point about litigation where it was generally felt that people were orientated towards litigation, I would respectfully suggest to him and indeed to his colleague Deputy McCartan that their own profession have recently, by advertisements, encouraged people to go on the basis of no foal, no fee and that would in some cases encourage unnecessary litigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Deputy Taylor, it seems they have adopted it with great enthusiasm but I have certain reservations in that regard as have others.</P>
      <P>Deputies McCartan and O'Dea have made their point about the wording very clearly.  I am prepared to look at the question of substituting &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; as contained in the Directive for &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; as contained in the Bill and I am delighted that both Deputies have pointed this out. I will be having consultation with my Department before the Report Stage in that regard.</P>
      <P>However, my own feeling would be that we should stick strictly to the Directive and I will be consistent in this regard because I have to bear in mind the intensive negotiations and discussions which take place at the EC.  As recently as a week ago I was involved in discussions in the Department in relation to a new directive that will be coming forward in the consumer area and I appreciate how every word and section is argued very forcefully up to the level of the Council of Ministers so I would feel it only appropriate that I would adopt the proposal suggested by my colleagues, Deputies O'Dea and McCartan, and come back on Report Stage with my considered opinion. I feel at this stage that I am on very strong ground because what is being proposed is in the Directive and I am not enthusiastic about changing any word of that.  I feel we should go strictly in accordance with the Directive.</P>

    <P>In relation to the question of private and professional use I would make the <Col N="1432" /> point that a farmer might buy a tractor to use for farming purposes but if he uses it for transporting children to school, for instance, that would be private use. There is a clear line of demarcation and it is quite clear what is private use and what is professional use.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard that very much as domestic use and it may not be covered under the actual product.  We could debate this at length but I am quite clear that it is appropriate to have the section as contained in the Directive and not to extend it as suggested by Deputy Taylor to include &ldquo;or for a business occupation or profession&rdquo;.  It certainly would change the philosophy behind the Directive. It is not even a question of my willingness to allow for this change.  I would not be in a position to change that directive without going back to the EC Commission for further discussion and I am not prepared to do that because it would be extending the whole philosophy behind the Directive which is a limited, focused Directive.</P>
      <P>Things have changed in the EC since 1985.  This is 1991.  From my experiences of a week ago, I know there is a new emphasis which I fully accept and we in Ireland are at the forefront of consumer legislation.  There is far more emphasis now on consumer legislation, and rightly so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised a very important point.  Under section 21 of the Directive there is a provision whereby every five years the Commission would present a report and there are other provisions within the Directive for reviews under Article 18 every five years.  The provision is that the Council shall examine and if needs be revise the provisions.  Could the Minister, before we resume on this debate at 4 o'clock, advise us or perhaps circulate Deputies Taylor, Hogan, O'Dea and <Col N="1433" /> myself with some information as to whether such reviews have taken place, whether reports have been prepared and what they say?  The Minister is correct in saying that there have been developments in the EC in terms of this Directive as to how certain of its provisions have been implemented, derogated from or otherwise.  The House should be advised as to whether there have been changes recommended by reviews to the Commission in the operation of the Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond very quickly.  Only three countries complied with the deadline set by the EC and other countries, like ourselves, are implementing or bringing forward the legislation. At this stage, therefore, it would be far too early to have reports back on the implementation of the Directive.  We would have to ensure that all the countries would have the legislation brought into national law before there could be a report back to the EC on how the Act is being implemented.  Without getting bogged down in that sort of detail at this stage it is vital to bring the Directive into Irish legislation before we, like other countries, can see what reviews would be necessary in this regard.</P>
      <P>Progress reported, Committee to sit again.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A grant of £10,000 was provided in 1989 from the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust towards the <Col N="1434" /> acquisition of the house in question as a Shaw Museum.  It was then understood that the trustees of the Shaw Birthplace Museum Trust were to proceed with their own restoration and fund-raising programme.</P>
      <P>More recently I was made aware of the funding difficulties of the Trust regarding the acquisition and restoration of the premises and I have since allocated a further grant of approximately £54,000, also from the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust, to enable the trust to complete the purchase of the property.</P>
      <P>This grant will be made available on the condition that satisfactory arrangements are made in regard to the management of the restoration of the house and the running of the proposed museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank the Taoiseach for the letter he sent to the Shaw Trust indicating the payment of a further grant of £54,000 to enable them to pay off their bank debt for the purchase of the property.  That was very welcome news indeed.  In view of the fact that it will cost £80,000-plus to carry out a modest refurbishment of the house which is in a considerable state of dilapidation, does the Taoiseach acknowledge that a grant of £5,000 from the National Gallery is extremely disappointing when since 1950 one-third of the royalties from the Shaw works has gone to the National Gallery and enabled them to purchase a number of 17th and 18th century French Baroque paintings? In view of the considerable bequest to the National Gallery they should consider giving a more generous subscription at this stage for the refurbishment of this house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that at present only one of the rooms in the house has been brought up to a standard which would be fit to receive visitors?  Apart from its literary associations this house has considerable tourist potential as a typical house of the era during which the Shaw family lived there. Will the Taoiseach urge the National Gallery, and all other institutions, to follow the excellent example he has shown within his area of responsibility in assisting the development of this important tourist asset in the centre of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the house is of no particular architectural value and were it not for Shaw's association with it, it would be of no merit at all.  The number of people who can contribute is limited for that reason.  It really depends now on whether the trust can do what is necessary to ensure their objectives are achieved.  I have asked the City Manager and Bord Fáilte to see what they can do to help the Trust in achieving their objectives.  I take it that the view of the House is that it would like to see this brought to a successful conclusion and I will continue to take interest in it.</P>

Can he confirm that they are not in any sense intimidated by the prospect that if they give money <Col N="1436" /> away their position for seeking funding might be somehow or other reduced?</P>

      <P>Notification of the grant allocations under the amenities/recreational facilities grant scheme 1991, issued to the county councils, county borough corporations and Dún Laoghaire Corporation by registered post on 24 September 1991.  Nobody was notified in relation to any grant allocation prior to that date.  It was a matter for the local authorities to notify the sponsors of the successful projects without delay of the allocation of the relevant grant and to inform them of the conditions attached. Local authorities were also to notify the sponsors of projects who were not successful in obtaining grants on this occasion.  Accordingly, information as to when project sponsors were notified of the outcome of their applications is not available in my Department.</P>

      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that the notifications which were issued on 24 September by registered post would not have reached the local authorities concerned until 25 September. First, may I ask him to explain why letters from him were hand delivered in this House to members of his own party who are Members of the Oireachtas on the evening of 24 September, notifying them of the allocations?  Second, why had a number of local authorities still not heard of the allocation by 25 September and had to telephone his office who then issued the allocations by fax to them?  Third, how were newspapers able to carry reports on 25 September that members of his own party, on the evening of 24 September, had made announcements of the allocations in their own respective areas?</P>

      <P>First, the two gentlemen in question resigned: Mr. Benson by letter on 12 May 1990 and Mr. Paircéir by letter dated 24 September 1991.  Mr. Benson advised me that he proposed to resign and he gave his reason and issued a very lengthy public statement dealing with that matter.  He wished to resume his career in the private sector.  He was most generous in that public statement in the relationship he had both with the Department and with me.  Mr. Paircéir resigned <Col N="1442" /> on 24 September 1991, the details of which I gave on the motion of confidence last week.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is pursuing.  I can only refer him to Mr. Benson's public statement issued on 14 May 1990, a copy of which I have in my possession and I have taken the opportunity to look at it today.  His statement is very detailed; he gave his reasons for leaving, he mentioned what he had achieved, the good relationship he had with the Department and how things were going so well but that he felt the time was opportune for him to return to his career in the private sector and he tendered his resignation accordingly.  I accepted it under the terms of the Act.  I do not know what the Deputy is suggesting. There was no difference of opinion so far as that letter was concerned.</P>

      <P>I state categorically here and now that I was not aware of any wrong-doing.  Mr. Benson tendered his resignation to me in the normal way.  He had spent four years there and regarded it as a very effective and rewarding time but he wanted to pursue his private career.  I do not know what the Deputy is implying except to say there is nothing in what the Deputy suggests by way of wrong-doing so far as Mr. Benson is concerned. I put on the record of this House at some length last week the situation so far as Mr. Paircéir is concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to my full and detailed statements on this matter both in my contribution to last week's confidence motion debate and in reply to a parliamentary question of July 1989 (Official Report Vol. 391, No. 5, Cols. 282-284).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been normal for my Department to suggest improvements, whether by way of addition, modification or deletion, to local authority proposals for water and sewerage schemes.  It has been fully acknowledged that the Department suggested an addition in the case of the Feltrim/Kinsealy scheme and the objective grounds for this have been clearly set out.  The Department's suggestion was, of course, for a re-examination of the proposal by Dublin County Council. It was this re-examination by the council, at administrative and elected member level, which was effective in developing the amended proposal which was then adopted.  In common with all significant water and sanitary services capital works which have arisen since the commencement of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987, this scheme <Col N="1444" /> was wholly financed by a grant from my Department; the final amount of this grant will be within the cost estimate for the original scheme made by Dublin County Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Minister is very thick, and I do not think he is, he will be aware that if the suspicions surrounding this case are justified it will be one of the most scandalous cases of self enrichment in the history of Irish politics.  In view of that, will the Minister agree to an independent inquiry, under the aegis of Dublin County Council, into all the facts surrounding this matter, to establish the valuation of the property concerned before the pipeline was laid and the valuation now, and also to establish whether it was the Minister who took the initiative in this case and not his officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject what the Deputy is saying in this regard.  All of this was put on the record last week.  The council were free to consider the request to technical, administrative and political level and they could have reacted in any way they thought fit.  They thought fit to act in a certain way and approval issued. What the Deputy is now suggesting is manifestly incorrect.  The Department make suggestions in relation to the capital programme.  It has always been the case when major schemes are being put in place, that we tidy up loose ends and get the best benefit, cost wise and in terms of pollution control, from any new development like that.  Indeed, the county development plan for 1983 indicated that the policy was to complete the programme of drainage for isolated clusters of council cottages.  I agree that that is a good thing to do.  Deputies must remember that the scale of this scheme was never intended to facilitate any major developments.  The pipe size would not allow it.  I made that quite clear.  I gave the dimensions of the pipe coming out from Baskin Cottages, going into the treatment works, the outfall from that to the Sluice River and the connection of that to the Malahide Road.</P>

      <P>It is the same size as the pipe that serves Swords and Malahide. There is nothing small about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in that it is the same size pipe.  It was never intended to cater for any excess capacity or any other major developments.  In relation to the question of zoning, that ground was zoned as agricultural.  The planning and development Act, 1990 makes it absolutely clear that land cannot be assumed to have development potential merely because of its physical proximity to a sewerage pipe.  In all the circumstances, I have to say that benefit does not accrue to the land owner.  This was merely doing what would be regarded as normal practice in that when one is laying a major scheme one would connect up all the loose ends and thereby give the benefit of a pollution free environment to those serviced in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to deal with this.  May I draw the attention of the Minister to the records of Dublin County Council for 17 September 1984 and for 5 February 1985 in which the county manager categorically stated that there was not any need for this extension?  Will the Minister answer the question?  Will he agree to an independent inquiry under the aegis of Dublin County Council into the present value of the land and into the value of the land before the pipeline was laid?  In view of the fact that even in agricultural zoning, once there are underground services a number of developments are permitted, including hotels and leisure complexes, will the Minister agree to an independent inquiry to establish whether or not the value of this land has been greatly enhanced.</P>

      <P>Given that the recently published Programme for Government states that proposals in this matter are to be put before the Government by the end of October, would the Minister indicate which of the two options recommended in the Barrington report &mdash; district committees of existing authorities or new district councils &mdash; is being pursued by the Government?

      <P>If I were to say that I would treat this area in the same fashion as Tallaght or anywhere else was treated and if that area has been designated, then in effect I would be committing myself to the designation of other areas.  That is not the case.  The question has to be posed whether we saying town centres or any other major development, if it is to go ahead, can only succeed or be viable if they are designated.  That was never the intention under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  It was never contemplated at that time that green field sites would be designated in this fashion.  While I recognise the point the Deputy is making, that is not to say that each town centre application throughout the country must have designated status if it is to succeed.</P>

I recognise that there has been considerable representation so far as the possibility for designation of the Blanchardstown site is concerned.  I do not think it was considered or contemplated by the framework of the 1986&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Tallaght is a slightly different case and, as the Deputy knows, the village is part of the designation as there was considerable dereliction.  All these matters have to be considered as it can, in certain instances, be counter-productive to confer designation on certain areas so far as city centre trading is concerned.  Apart altogether from that, the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, is intended to remove dereliction and to build up centres which had fallen into decay.  That is what has been happening very successfully throughout the country and I believe my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, dealt with the matter yesterday and proved that point. We must talk in a different way as far as green field development is concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22, 48, 55 and 71 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environment action programme stated that the Government proposed to ensure the provision of a central hazardous waste incinerator and had decided, in principle, to make grants available towards the capital cost.  My Department has received proposals for such a facility from a number of qualified companies or consortia when a proposal was independently advanced by Du Pont <Col N="1459" /> (UK) Limited to locate an incinerator, with capacity to serve all of Ireland, at their Maydown Works, County Derry.</P>
    <P>I have already acknowledged that the Du Pont proposal may be relevant to the Government's objectives for hazardous waste incineration and, following receipt of a summary of the feasibility study on the Du Pont proposal, I am now considering this question in detail.</P>
    <P>The environmental implications of the proposal would require full examination within the environmental impact assessment process which will be necessary if a planning application is to be made to the Northern Ireland authorities.  This EIA would involve consultation with the Irish authorities.  I do not, therefore, propose to comment on any environmental aspect of this proposal until a formal planning application is made and these consultative procedures are activated.</P>

      <P>No, we have not abandoned the objective set out in the environment action programme announced by me in January 1990.  We had a competition and a number of interested parties and consortia submitted their plans and suggestions.  We made a choice and then Du Pont advanced a proposal.  That is the position at present.  Of course we have an interest because we have a certain amount of hazardous toxic waste which must be disposed of which, fortunately, we are able to dispose of now by exporting &mdash; at least we hope it is all being exported.  Two principles have to <Col N="1460" /> be established so far as dealing with hazardous toxic waste is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>One is the principle of proximity and these matters are discussed at some length at EC level on a continuing basis.  It was agreed by all, in so far as the disposal of toxic waste is concerned, that the closer the site is to the source of the waste the easier it is to dispose of.  The second principle which has to be considered at all times is the question of self-sufficiency.  That is increasingly becoming the situation in Europe where member states will have to provide facilities for dealing with their own hazardous toxic waste instead of exporting it to other countries.  With that in mind we need such a facility in this country; one would wish that the need was not there but, inevitably and eventually, irrespective of what new arrangements for recycling are put in place, new technology, new waste streams and no matter what we do, there will be a residual amount of hazardous toxic waste.  We want to know where it is going, from where it is coming and how it is disposed of.  Such a facility will be required in due course and that is why we have a particular interest in Du Pont.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that the Minister did not answer Question No. 48 in my name dealing with the proposals for the transportation of our toxic waste to Maydown if this project ever goes ahead.  The Minister, in his response to Deputy Shatter, mentioned, for example, it was very important that waste be disposed of close to the site.  Will the <Col N="1461" /> Minister agree that a proposal to site an incinerator in Maydown means it is very far from where most of our chemical plants are?  Will the Minister also agree that the time has come to change the Government policy on the need for a national incinerator bearing in mind that taxpayers' money will be used to subsidise industry of this nature coming into this country?  Will he reconsider the matter?</P>

It was our intention, as stated publicly, to proceed to provide that facility until Du Pont put forward a similar proposal, but that has not been finalised.  Finally, I would say to Deputy Garland that Du Pont have not <Col N="1462" /> made a direct application for financial assistance from the Irish Government.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that nothing in the history of this country, North or South of the Border, has united both communities as much as the opposition to the siting of a toxic waste incinerator at Maydown.  Not alone does it unite both communities north of the Border but it unites the people of the entire country, North and South.  Is the Minister aware that I shared a platform with an Ulster Unionist who spoke against this proposal at a meeting in County Derry a month ago?  The attendance at that meeting was equally divided between Catholics and Protestants.  Did the Minister consider that in the Government's pursuit to dump toxic waste away from their own doorstep they will be creating friction between North and South as well as bad public relations? Would the Minister not consider that the factories which generate toxic waste should have their own facilities for disposing of it rather than bringing it from the four corners of Ireland to Maydown, County Derry?</P>

I think they will agree &mdash; I did not ask them but I am sure the Deputy will find the time to do so &mdash; that the Minister responded to them in a very fair and even-handed way.  The Deputy is saying that he thinks it is preferable that every factory generating toxic hazardous waste should have its own facility to dispose of waste by incineration, but I do not share that view.  Incineration is a well known method of disposing of waste here.  There are many incinerators around the country, in factory sites, hospital sites and other facilities.</P>

May I ask him if, when he advertised for tenders for the building of a toxic waste incinerator, he was just trying to fool the people?  Secondly, will the Minister accept that, in the light of the delegation he met today, there is widespread concern about the siting of a toxic waste <Col N="1465" /> incinerator in Maydown, that it is not acceptable that it be sited there?  Would the Minister agree that the reason there is widespread public concern as to where all our toxic waste will be dumped is due to his failure to make a decision on the issue for over two years?  The Du Pont proposal the Minister is now supporting is a classic example, from Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party, of what could best be described as environmental partitionism.

      <P>The question of extending to local authority tenants the scheme for the improvement or extension of a private house <i>in lieu</i> of rehousing in local authority accommodation does not arise. It is already open to an authority to provide such an extension to one of their rented houses as a response to an established need arising from overcrowding of existing accommodation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that his social housing programme is lying <Col N="1470" /> stillborn in the councils around the country because of the legal mine fields he has not sorted out?  Does the Minister not accept that this specific aspect of the social housing programme is a catch 22 situation in that the scheme requires people to be on the housing list yet also requires that they own the house so that the local authority can provide the extension? Does the Minister realise that Dublin Corporation, for example, do not allow persons who own a house on the housing list, no matter how overcrowded their housing conditions are?  Does the Minister accept that the scheme will be stillborn?  Does he realise there are no application forms available for people who wish to participate in the scheme.</P>

That was done in a generous way in advance of the legislation.  I know legislation is required and it is my intention to bring it to the House.  I will be seeking the co-operation of all sides to allow it to be put in place before Christmas and then the full benefit of the scheme will come into play.

Will he accept that the actuarial view of the shared equity scheme, in particular, is that there will <Col N="1472" /> be a horrendous burden on those who take out shared ownership and that the total cost, in rent and shared equity, will be a very severe burden on people who cannot afford to take out a loan in the normal way?</P>

Does the Minister recognise that the local authorities do not have sufficient funds to implement that interim arrangement?  Does he accept that it is highly unlikely that any part of the social housing plan will be achieved before the end of the year?

      <P>I refer Deputies to section 110 of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, which provides for an increase in the penalties set out in the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, in relation to public health nuisances and for breaches of by-laws made by local authorities.

    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> In fact, the Minister of State made a commitment that it would be up and running last year.  That issue deals with the penalties, but there is also confusion about who can prosecute.  Could the Minister clarify that issue?  Will the Garda, the wardens or someone else prosecute under the new legislation?  Exactly who will be able to prosecute?  The new legislation simply changes the penalties, making reference to the old legislation, but the old legislation is unclear in relation to the prosecuting authority.</P>

      <P>While my question refers to a fine of £800, which is comparable to the fine under the Litter Act, I am even happier that the fine might be increased to £1,000.  Does the Minister know that in certain urban parks and public places <Col N="1478" /> there is no law and order?  For example, the amount of cider drinking and drinking of alcohol generally in our public parks is a disgrace, as is the amount of glue sniffing, particularly at night.  People take ghetto-blasters into closed parks, where the gardaí are afraid to go at night and park wardens are afraid to approach gangs.  Nobody has the will or interest to pursue those unruly elements, particularly at night, because of the existing miserable fine of £5.  Could the Minister guarantee the House that it will be only a short time before local authorities will be able to take on board the £1,000 fine for abusers of the regulations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to make a few final comments on this amendment arising out of the Minister's reply.  The Minister said that if he wanted to make any variation in the Bill he would have to revert to Brussels.  Quite frankly that puzzles me.  Certainly, if the Minister was <Col N="1535" /> proposing to do anything that would breach the minimal requirements of the Directive he might have to do that.  What I am asking him to do in my amendment is to do everything we were asked to do by Brussels, and a bit more, to protect a certain category of consumers.  I cannot see, if the House did that, that it would create any problem for the Minister in Brussels &mdash; far from it &mdash; I predict they would give him a pat on the shoulder and say that what he was doing was recognising the importance of the new principle being introduced by this Directive and in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that acceptance of my amendment would counter the philosophy behind the Directive.  With respect I want to take issue with him on that statement.  I contend the reverse would be correct.  What is the philosophy behind this Bill?  The philosophy behind the Bill is that a new very important, worthwhile principle be written into our law, that of strict liability.  What I seek to do is make that of more universal application than of the limited application given it by the provisions of the Bill, as at present drafted.  It would be a logical extension of the position to say that people who are hurt, damaged or injured by a defective product should be entitled to recover the cost of such damage or injury whether they were using that product for private purposes or for the purpose of their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister takes a very strong position in declining that request.  I have to say I find that just a little puzzling when one thinks of it in this way; who would be adversely affected by extending the application of the provisions of the Bill to a small businessman who received injuries using the product in the course of his business?  This provision is not something that would cost the Government one penny.  This is not something that would cost the taxpayer one penny. There are, or would be if my amendment were accepted, winners and losers, that is true; the taxpayer would not be one of them; the taxpayer is not involved in this transaction except in so far as an <Col N="1536" /> individual taxpayer may also be a consumer. Therefore, who would be the winner and who would be the loser?  The loser would be the unfortunate consumer who would not be able to make a claim under the provisions of this Bill because he had been using the product in the course of his business.  The winner would be the producer or manufacturer who would, thereby, be able to pat himself on the back and say: I have got away with something here; I have sent out into the market a defective product; it has caused damage and injury but I am all right, I escaped.  We must ask ourselves why. The answer is because it happened, through his good luck, that the item had been used in the course of a small business rather than for private use.</P>
    <P>In effect what the Minister is doing here is protecting the producer, the large manufacturers, at whose expense?  The answer is: at the expense of the consumer because the businessman who uses the product is a consumer just as is a private individual or consumer.  The Minister is going out of his way to protect the large manufacturers, most of whom are multi-nationals, large pharmaceutical and engineering companies, enormous conglomerate, billion pound companies, internationally-based for the most part &mdash; at the expense of an Irish consumer. That is what it amounts to; that is the nub of the issue.  The Minister's position is an anti-consumer one.  He is taking a whole slice of consumers of products and refusing them the protection of the principle being established under the provisions of this Bill.  He is doing all that to the benefit of the large manufacturers and producers, protecting them, notwithstanding the fact that they would be taken to account here for defective products; an essential prerequisite to any claim under the Bill being that the product be defective.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister and Government go out of their way to protect these large multi-national producers at the expense of an Irish consumer?  I do not see the logic in that.  By accepting my amendment, if I may say so, it would be logical, <Col N="1537" /> would make sense and would eliminate the strange anomaly obtaining, whereby when the producer sends out his defective piece of equipment, product or whatever &mdash; depending on the fortuitous chance of whether it be a private user who sustains the injury or a person in business who sustains the injury &mdash; will be the determinant as to whether he pays up.  There is no sense or logic in that.  Why protect the large manufacturer or producer? Why not protect the consumer?  I reiterate: there is no cost involved for the taxpayer.  This proposal is logical and would make good sense.</P>

They are not multi-nationals.  Deputy Taylor is overstating his point in an attempt to strengthen his argument.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that I am not deviating from the Directive because I have no discretion to vary it.  I made this clear at the commencement of Committee Stage. I did, however, undertake to consider amendment No. 1 before Report Stage. I am endeavouring to bring the EC Directive into Irish law on the basis negotiated by a previous Government of which Deputy Taylor's party were part.  He would have had an opportunity to discuss EC directives at parliamentary party meetings.  Perhaps he should have put <Col N="1538" /> forward amendments during the negotiations on the Directive rather than after agreement had been reached.  The principle in the Directive is to switch the onus of proof in favour of the consumer.  The EC define a small business as one having up to 500 employees; in Ireland many small businesses employ up to 50 people. I am not endeavouring to protect the multi-nationals.  They are very capable of protecting their own position.</P>
    <P>We have no leeway to change the wording of an EC Directive.  Deputy Taylor's attitude is that we could extend the scope of the Bill beyond the Directive. That is not my intention.  There will be other consumer legislation before the House where that might be more appropriate. I am endeavouring to ensure that this Bill is in keeping with the spirit and wording of the Directive.  That is my responsibility and I will carry it out conscientiously. I reject Deputy Taylor's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> In page 2, subsection (1), line 29, after &ldquo;nature&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, including any use of artificial additives, insecticides or fertilizers in the growth process,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are seeking an explanation from the Minister as to why the interpretation section &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; is restricted to meaning the industrial process.  Why is the agricultural process, for example, entirely excluded?  If the Bill imposes liability on a producer for damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in a product, irrespective of whether the producer is negligent, why should that apply only to the industrial process?  To restrict the definition of &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; in so far as it relates to primary agricultural products to any processing of an industrial nature is insufficiently wide in its scope.</P>
    <P>One can envisage a number of threats imposed by the use of artificial additives, insecticides and fertilisers in the agricultural context.  Since, in certain circumstances, these pose a direct threat to the food chain, why should the consumer not have the same benefit as if that product was subjected to some limited industrial processing, for example, vegetables directly sold to the consumer that have the same effect as is envisaged elsewhere in the Bill, provided this element of industrial processing was present? However, without the industrial processing, it may have that same impact for the consumer, why then should the burden of proof not be shifted in that situation for the consumer as it is elsewhere in the Bill?  I would like to hear from the Minister why there is this restrictive definition of initial processing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appreciated that Deputy McCartan's amendment, moved by Deputy Rabbitte, would like to ensure that primary agricultural products are marketed in as pure a state as possible. His suggested amendment, however, goes beyond what is allowed in the Directive which, in Article 2, simply excludes <Col N="1540" /> such products which have undergone initial processing.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to clarify what constitutes &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; we have included a definition &mdash;&ldquo;any processing of an industrial nature of those products which could cause a defect therein,&rdquo;.  It must be accepted, however, that it will ultimately be a matter for a court to decide whether liability applies in any particular case.  The activities mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte are unlikely to constitute initial processing of an industrial nature.  The phrase &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; used in the Bill related to primary agricultural products only.  The phrase is not defined in the Directive but the Bill's definition is based on the intention conveyed in the recitals to the Directive. What constitues &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; in any particular case in not always easy to define and in many cases may be a matter for the courts to interpret.</P>
      <P>In section 1 &ldquo;injured person&rdquo; means a person who has suffered damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in a product or, if he has died, his personal representative (within the meaning of section 3 of the Succession Act, 1965) ... is defined as the executor or the administrator for the time being of a deceased person.  An injured person may also be dependent within the meaning of section 47 (1) of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, i.e. in relation to a person whose death was caused by a wrongful act, it means any member of the family of the deceased who suffers injury or mental distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motivation of Deputies McCartan and Rabbitte is understandable particularly when products like angel dust are used as growth promoters in cattle. Nevertheless, the Government have taken this line in the Directive.  We have a discretion.  Luxembourg is the only country in the Twelve that has included primary products and I am quite confident that Deputy Hogan will ensure that this amendment is not included.  The <Col N="1541" /> Deputies would not have any farming constituents but I can assure them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>They must not be voting for the Deputy.  As an agricultural producer it is very important that we would not bring in a Directive which would be detrimental to our major industry.  That is the reason we have not included primary processing.  Though I sympathise with Deputy Rabbitte's concern, it must be remembered that there is adequate legislation in relation to substitutes and other areas where there is a danger to public health.  Particularly there is legislation being introduced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in regard to the use of angel dust and other products which would have an effect on the food chain. In the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has actually tried to interpret what I might say.  I am particularly grateful to Deputies McCartan and Rabbitte for raising this important issue because the fact that chemical substances and various ingredients are to be found in food products is very disturbing from the point of view of the consumer.  We have to ensure through legislation that we have no truck whatsoever with producers or means of processing that will damage our food industry in any way or damage the export potential of our major industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are responsible for the production of primary agricultural produce and they are enjoying the benefit of an exemption under this regime, but it is questionable whether one could regard agricultural products as constituting secondary agricultural produce by virtue of spraying and the use of hormones or angel dust as growth promoters in cattle. If there was a case it could be taken through the factory responsible for processing a particular animal where harmful and illegal hormones were found to be in a particular meat product.  However, the meat processing plant could pass the buck <Col N="1542" /> to the farmer which could cause a lot of political wrangling and discussion in the Department of Agriculture and Food and, indeed, could result in the setting up of another tribunal into the harmful effects they might have on some of our major exports like meat.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a difficulty in relation to consumer legislation.  He will have to be fearlessly on the side of the consumer and ensure that everything possible is done to protect the consumer in line with the spirit of the Directive and that as a Legislature we are not prepared to tolerate any activity on the part of the producer that would cause damage or injury to any person from the food industry, or any other industry.</P>
    <P>I certainly would have an open mind on this amendment.  I will be listening carefully to see if other speakers can convince me that the implementation of this Directive will not be found wanting, that the right signals will be given to the consumers that we are here to introduce legislation that is very much pro-consumer which will protect them from any damage or injury which might not be capable of being redressed under any other legislation.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister has other means at his disposal under the food standards and public health Acts to protect injured persons but under the product liability regime and this Directive there may be some doubt about whether this legislation is strong enough to deal with these matters and whether he could be more protective of consumer interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this very important amendment.  While the Minister says he strongly supports the Directive and cannot derogate from it he is in fact derogating from it in the interpretative clause.  That is a serious matter.  If one looks at the Directive to which the Minister pays such great heed and which he says he cannot detract from either to the right or the left &mdash; I say he can detract from it by giving concessions to the consumer beyond what the Directive requires &mdash; one can see that the Minister <Col N="1543" /> has taken from the position of the consumer. Article 2 which deals with this matter only goes so far as excluding products which have undergone initial processing. The Minister could have left the expression &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; alone, which is what we are talking about here. He did not have to bring in any interpretation clause.  He could have left it to the courts to interpret what initial processing meant within the context of the Directive.  The Minister, in his reply to Deputy Rabbitte, pointed out that the courts would interpret the expression if difficulties arose, and they will, but they will interpret it in accordance with the interpretation clause the Minister puts into the Bill.</P>
      <P>What has the Minister done in his interpretation clause?  He has put an entirely new element into the definition of the term &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; which is not included in the Directive.  He should not have done that.  I submit he is not entitled to do so because it goes against the interests of the consumer whom the Directive seeks to protect.  The Minister has introduced in his definition clause the words, &ldquo;of an industrial nature&rdquo;.  The Directive does not make any reference to the term &ldquo;of an industrial nature&rdquo;; it simply excludes products which have undergone initial processing.  The term &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; is a broad description and if it was left alone, as it should have been, it would include additives which Deputy Rabbittee's amendment seeks to address.  For example, feeding angel dust to cattle or using damaging sprays which are not recommended, are known to be harmful or whatever would very likely be regarded as initial processing.  However, the Minister did not leave this alone.  He has introduced an entirely new dimension which is clearly outside the Directive by saying that the only exclusion will be processing of an industrial nature.  That is a very serious and major restriction about which I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the words &ldquo;of an industrial nature&rdquo; or the definition clause should be included in the Bill.  If the definition clause has to be included we <Col N="1544" /> should at least go some way towards the Directive by making it clear that processes such as the feeding of angel dust to cattle and the use of damaging chemicals and sprays, although not of an industrial nature, constitute initial processing within the meaning of the Directive.  The consumer will be worse off under the Minister's interpretation clause than he would have been if the position obtained as laid down in the Directive.  The Minister, has said not once but many times today, that he cannot detract from the Directive, that he is bound by it, but he has changed very appreciably by introducing an entirely new element.  In those circumstances, the amendment should be supported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the points made by the Deputies, I should like to give a clearer explanation of the reasons for the exclusion.  It is very important that Deputies appreciate the reasons behind it.</P>
      <P>Of the nine member states which to date have implemented the Directive, only Luxembourg included primary agricultural products.  Agriculture does not bulk large in Luxembourg's gross domestic product of 2.6 per cent, compared with 10.2 per cent in the case of Ireland. Equally, Luxembourg accounts for only 0.1 per cent of total Community production whereas for Ireland this figure is 2 per cent.  Thus in the other eight markets, the UK, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Greece and Portugal, primary agricultural products are excluded from the implementing legislation. If we were to include them, it could send the wrong signals to consumers in other European markets by unwittingly giving the impression that our primary agricultural produce was in some way suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal reasons the Government decided to exclude them were that such products are particularly prone to hidden defects caused by environmental factors beyond the control of the producer. However, producers of primary agricultural products continue to be liable under tort and contract law.  Under the <Col N="1545" /> law of tort the consumer has rights against the producer for damage caused if negligence can be proven.  Under contract law goods are required to be of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose intended.</P>
    <P>There is also in place a variety of legislation which controls various aspects of quality in agricultural production.  Some examples of this type of legislation are the European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations, 1985, as amended.  These regulations prescribe various conditions which must be complied with in relation to the placing on the market of pesticides; Animal Remedies Act, 1956, which regulates the import, manufacture, sale and advertisement of animal remedies and the European Communities (Veterinary Medicinal Products) Regulations, 1986. These regulations control the licensing and manufacture of veterinary medicinal products.  In accordance with these regulations all such products sold must have an authorisation granted by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  These authorisations are granted on the recommendation of the National Drugs Advisory Board who test the preparations in question with particular regard to quality, safety and efficacy.</P>
    <P>Regarding primary agricultural products which have been subject to initial processing, even in cases where a defect in these types of products was not caused by the processing operation itself, the onus is on the processor to discover any hidden defects, no matter how they were caused.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group concur with our thinking in respect of the exclusion of primary agricultural products.  In the circumstances Deputy Hogan would be well advised to consult with his party before he makes <Col N="1546" /> an unwise decision to vote in favour of this amendment.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly when the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and other organisations are so clear in their thinking, and their submissions are clear also.  The main opposition to this exclusion is represented by the Consumers Association of Ireland, who feel there is no real relevance to the argument that primary agricultural products are subject to environmental factors beyond the control of the producer.  Because of the extent to which fresh vegetables, for example, are sprayed with chemicals and the land in which they are produced is artificially fertilised, no valid distinction can be made between natural and processed products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that the vast majority of other member states have excluded such products from their implementing legislation, it would be extremely inadvisable for Ireland to take any measures which would put our farmers at a disadvantage in respect of their community counterparts.  By way of clarification so far as the Directive is concerned, we had the right of derogation in relation to this area and we have availed of that right.  We are not changing the Directive as such; we are acting in accordance with its provisions.  This is in the <Col N="1547" /> best interests of our farmers and the consumer is also well protected by existing legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>To include primary agricultural products in the scope of the Bill would mean that farmers would be obliged to carry product liability insurance &mdash; I am sure Deputy Hogan will be very interested in this section &mdash; a development which would add substantially to their production costs and, as a result, have a negative effect on their competitiveness in respect of other EC members.  As someone who is directly involved in that area, I feel that, at this time, it would be a major blow to the agriculture industry which is under pressure in many regards in relation to prices.</P>

      <P>Farmers would not be in a position to carry product liability.  We do not know what will happen in the future in relation to primary production, but at this stage I am pleased to be in a position to ensure derogation from the EC Directive.  The cost would be prohibitive and would add substantially to their production costs.  This would have a negative effect on their competitiveness with EC members.  We would be putting our farmers at a major disadvantage compared with their counterparts in France, the UK, Germany and elsewhere in the Community.  That is a situation I could not accept.  Bearing in mind that Deputy Rabbitte's party may not have great support among the agricultural community, in the interests of Ireland Incorporated I recommend very strongly that it would be wise to withdraw the amendment.  It would be most inadvisable to press this amendment at this stage.  &ldquo;Product&rdquo;, as defined in the Bill covers a very wide area.  Any question of whether a particular product is covered by the legislation will ultimately be determined by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained precisely why we sought the derogation; we received the derogation and I recommend all sides to <Col N="1548" /> accept it to ensure that our farmers will not be put at a disadvantage.  I would like to say that 99.9 per cent of the farming community are very conscious of the need to produce high quality produce. We are highly regarded throughout the world for the quality of our produce, although we may have difficulties at a particular time.  Action is being taken to ensure that we highlight those difficulties and take the appropriate action for the future.  I stress that 99.9 per cent of the farmers are conscious of quality and the green image of Ireland and will not add insecticides or fertilisers which would present any danger for the consumer.  In that regard I am pleased to be in a position to oppose this amendment and to recommend that we seek this derogation.</P>

      <P>The last thing I had intended when coming to Deputy McCartan's amendment was to turn this into a farmers versus the rest debate or, indeed, to put Irish farmers at any competitive disadvantage with their French counterparts, but the Minister has very effectively done that.  I do not want to look a gift horse in the mouth.  If the Minister has returned to his normal cherubic happy disposition compared to his outlook on life last week, I am reluctant to introduce any note of acrimony, nonetheless, I am fascinated not so much by his formal script but by his constant interjections and lectures to Deputy Hogan that he had better come out behind the ICMSA position or else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the clear implication, the only inference one could take from the Minister's contribution.  It is an extraordinary comment on Irish politics and on our approach to public affairs that we have this Bill designed to improve the position of the consumer but we must exclude a very large section of the community from it.  If any other producer should inflict damage on the consumer, they would certainly have to pay for it, but if the farmer poisons someone or nearly poisons or cripples someone by <Col N="1549" /> reason of negligence, we dare not look at him because that would be attacking one of the sacred cows &mdash; forgive the pun &mdash; of Irish life.  It is an extraordinary argument to threaten Deputy Hogan with the ICMSA.  Look at the stance of the ICMSA over almost 30 years on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. Almost £1 billion of taxpayers' money has been spent on the bovine tuberculosis. eradication scheme and, if anything, the position is worse now than it was in the sixties.  The present ICMSA leadership are screaming to have Dr. Liam Downey removed from the chairmanship of ERAD.  What would one expect the ICMSA or the IFA to say about the Products Liability Bill?  It is a case of, they would say that, would they not?  That is their job.  To suggest that we ought not to broach this subject in the House because the farmers ought to be removed from liability &mdash; and it would be an enormous burden on their shoulders compared with other producers &mdash; is, I suggest, for the many hundreds of thousands of consumers outside this House, a bit difficult to understand.  God knows, it is not as the Minister would have us believe &mdash; I wish it were &mdash; a situation where 99 per cent of our farmers have behaved responsibly, maintaining the standards we would wish.</P>
      <P>Until recently, the Minister for Agriculture and Food denied in this House that we have a problem with the subject this Minister introduced into the debate &mdash; the use of angel dust.  We know now that this is a serious problem, I support enthusiastically the Minister's belated conversion regarding more severe action for the wrong-doers concerned because they are criminals and ought to be treated as such but this, too, is another example of how that Minister has been converted belatedly on a number of other matters too.  Those who use angel dust are doing much damage to a major industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our record on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis would not indicate any reason for complacency.  The Minister talks of sending the wrong signals to other countries but he does not seem to be concerned about sending the wrong <Col N="1550" /> signal to consumers.  The Minister says that nine states have already implemented the Directive and that only Luxembourg has imposed the responsibility in question but we do not know how many of the other nine states have tampered with the Directive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor introduced a very important dimension into the argument for the amendment when he referred to Article 2 of the Directive as adopted.  It is very clear in terms of the definition of primary agricultural products in that article that it excludes products which have undergone initial processing.  The Minister as a result of that now tells us that a derogation was available to us and that he availed of it.  I presume it did not happen just like that.  Somebody presumably made an argument for a derogation and it seems to me that the Minister has gone out of his way to introduce a definition on initial processing that cannot be in the interests of the consumer. What does this phrase &ldquo;of an industrial nature&rdquo; mean?  If a steer is bought off the land by a butcher and the subsequent interaction with the consumer takes place in the butcher's shop, for example, is that a process of an industrial nature?  It seems to me that it is not.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right.  It is an attempt to ensure that primary agricultural products get to the consumer in the purest state possible.  It seems to me that it is some sort of comment on Irish agriculture if it is suggested that somehow that objective is in conflict with the efficient and smooth running of the agricultural process.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a long serving and distinguished Deputy for an urban constituency comprising many consumers, will agree that it is difficult to appreciate how the objective of transferring primary agricultural products in the purest possible state to the consumer is somehow in conflict with having a healthy and thriving agricultural sector. I cannot see where the conflict arises if we have confidence in the agricultural sector to produce in accordance with the highest standards.  I do not see that the good sense behind the amendment has been argued down.  In the part of the <Col N="1551" /> debate I heard on the monitor today, the Minister seems to be consistently saying it is his job to import the provisions of the Directive as closely as possible into Irish law and not to depart from them. Like Deputy Taylor I cannot understand what prevents the Minister, if he wishes, from improving on any of those provisions in any way he likes.  In this case the Minister has chosen to derogate from one of the important provisions of the Directive and that is to the detriment of the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend saying any more, but the Minister has proceeded to lecture me on the attitude I should take on this amendment.  I am surprised that any Fianna Fáil Minister should lecture any Fine Gael Deputy.  We have minds of our own, thank God.  The Minister tried to threaten me with a Kilkenny man, the President of the ICMSA, Mr. Tom O'Dwyer.  Mr. O'Dwyer has a very forthright attitude on most issues; he is a man who likes to think he has neat answers to every problem.  I assure the Minister that the President of the ICMSA will not formulate my views on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce had difficulty in relation to deciding what attitude the Minister should take on this matter.  When the Minister presented his evidence to the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities in 1987, the Department stated that it was an open question as to whether the derogation was desirable in respect of primary agricultural produce.  The Minister's Department were not sure about what way to proceed with that matter.  The Minister has now formed a definitive view that primary agricultural produce should remain outside the scope of the Directive. I do not accept that there will be any substantial increase in product liability <Col N="1552" /> insurance for farmers and I am surprised at the Minister suggesting that there will be any increase in product liability insurance costs for any sector in view of the fact that the Minister and the Department have gone out of their way to say that the costs to small businesses, self employed people and business generally would be minimal in relation to the implementation of this Directive.  The level of liability insurance is far too high for businesses generally.  To gain access to appropriate premia for liability insurance in the business sector is very difficult but the farming community already have access to liability insurance and they can, at a very small extra cost, add product liability insurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not taken into account the fact that we are obliged under the EC regulations to comply with Directives in relation to conditions in milking parlours, in meat processing and so on. At producer level higher standards generally are expected of the farmers in producing agricultural products.  It is in line with European Community thinking, and the implementation of that thinking by the Department of Agriculture, to assist farmers, through grant aid and other measures, in improving their standards in farming so as to ensure that we have a pollution free, pure, naturally based product that will meet the requirements of the consumer.</P>
    <P>The CII and the Insurance Federation submissions were referred to.  The report of the joint committee also indicated that there was unease and far from unanimity in respect of the views of these organisations on whether primary agricultural produce should be a part of this Directive. My primary consideration is the need to look at the position in relation to Irish agricultural exports.  In Ireland today we need to enhance our image as a producer of agricultural goods to gain access to as much exporting potential as we can.</P>
    <P>The director of the quality assurance research unit at University College, Galway in a report advanced the case for including primary agricultural produce in <Col N="1553" /> this Directive on the basis of our international standing as a food exporting country.  He was of the view that the inclusion of primary agricultural produce in this Directive would send out the right signals to those countries with whom we are seeking to enhance our image as a country which produces pure and wholesome foodstuffs that we were prepared to back that statement up by including primary agricultural produce in this Directive.  I am prepared to support this amendment for that reason.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the right signals are sent out to consumers, that we are serious about tackling this issue of additives in food products.  We should signal that we want to stamp out this practice; that we are not nodding and winking at those with a vested interest; that we are prepared to stand up to them and say &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo; in relation to the malpractices we have had to put up with for so long and that we are not satisfied that the existing legislation and regulations meet the rigid requirements of consumer protection. If everything is above board we have nothing to fear in ensuring that the producers of primary agricultural produce are subjected to rigorous scrutiny, like every other business.</P>
    <P>For this reason the Minister of State should take another look at this amendment to see if we can devise an amendment on Report Stage which would meet the arguments being put forward and which would send out the right signals to enhance our image as a country which produces clean, wholesome and natural food without additives or insecticides. Only this week the Minister for Agriculture and Food had to apologise to the British market when it was discovered that in five cases angel dust had been used.  That will prove damaging to our industry.</P>
    <P>The least we should do to enhance and bolster our image is to tell the world, in particular the United Kingdom market, one of our major markets, at the first available opportunity that we are prepared to subject our food producing <Col N="1554" /> industry to the most rigorous scrutiny and include them in this Directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, under the Bill we are debating, is that people who manufacture or produce products which cause damage, death or personal injury will be held strictly liable for the damage caused by those products if those products are defective.  Primary agricultural products are excluded but primary agricultural products which undergo initial processing of an industrial nature are not excluded.</P>
      <P>While the initial producer may have nothing to do with a defect in a product which has undergone the industrial process which may cause damage, injury or loss he will be held liable.  The damage may be the direct result of the industrial process carried out, yet the primary producer will be held liable.  It seems that would be a dramatic extension of the law in so far as the initial producer is concerned.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Rabbitte's point on the definition of an industrial process because the strict liability regime will come in when the initial industrial process has taken place.  Like Deputy Rabbitte, I seek clarification of what this term &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; means, particularly in relation to the example he used, a butcher.  It would be no harm if the Department considered between now and Report Stage including a further subsection to clarify the matter or produce a directive to guide Members on what is meant by the term &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; in line 29, page 2 of the Bill.  We have to know in relation to primary agricultural produce what is in and what is out from the point of view of strict liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte went on to make the point that all farmers are not angels.  We know that and no pun is intended.  I do not have the figure for the number of people engaged in farming business here, it possibly runs into hundreds of thousands, but, naturally, some people will not obey all the rules and will deviate from the highest standards.  That applies not just to the farming community but to organisations with a smaller membership <Col N="1555" /> than the farming community such as the police force, teachers and so on.  To try to imply, as Deputy Rabbitte seemed to do &mdash; I am sorry if I am misconstruing his argument &mdash; that every farmer is blatantly disregarding the rules and is using illegal additives and angel dust is to totally misrepresent the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That should not stay on the record of the House.  I never said that and that should not be inferred.  I do not believe that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's assurance in that matter but that was my interpretation from the way the Deputy presented his argument.  If my interpretation is wrong then I accept the Deputy's assurance.  The question arises as to at what point we should move away from protecting primary agricultural produce and subject it to the strict liability regime.  Despite the fact that it is the producer who will be held liable when an industrial process has been carried out the Minister, and the Government, are correct to subject primary agricultural produce which has undergone initial industrial processing to the strict liability regime subject of course to a proper explanation being given as to what constitutes &ldquo;initial industrial processing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we get carried too far away we have to bear in mind that the farming business, and Deputy Hogan probably knows more about this than I, is in a very bad state economically.  It will be further affected by what is happening at European level over which we have very little control, despite protestations to the contrary. We have to think in terms of what a massive increase in product liability insurance would mean for an industry in such a state of crisis.  I take Deputy Hogan's point that we must get our image right but we should rigorously prosecute those people who break the rules.  In some cases they have been discovered. They will have to be made an example of.  No one can seek to justify the unjustifiable and I do not seek to do so but if anybody in this House thinks that <Col N="1556" /> employment, economic growth and prosperity will be advanced by driving the farming community further into the ground and by further increasing costs at a time when the farming industry is on its knees, they are, sadly mistaken.  We have to be very careful about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Deputy Hogan's question first.  At present most farmers do not have insurance as far as product liability is concerned and they have to individually obtain that type of insurance.  I know, from personal experience, that farmers are covered by public liability insurance.  This is now necessary as people are becoming more litigation conscious and I know that Deputy Taylor and his professional colleagues are aware of the situation regarding litigation, even in regard to trespassing on a person's land.  It is quite obvious that individual farmers would be required to have product liability insurance for their own protection.  Only Luxembourg sought a change in Article 2 which was accepted by the EC.  Another point regarding which Deputy Hogan should be aware is that his present &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;present&rdquo;&mdash; leader Deputy John Bruton, was Minister at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Government have made a wise decision in the best interests of the farming community and the consumer.  There was a question regarding the clear definition of &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo;.  It is quite clear the agricultural products which are processed through industrial use in a factory, the canning of vegetables and other processing of primary products are routinely processed and there should be no great difficulty in that regard as far as initial processing is concerned.  The clearer definition is: &ldquo;any processing of an industrial nature which could cause a defect&rdquo;, that is a broad definition and it is as well to have it that way as far as the courts are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear-cut and I do not need to go into it in much greater detail. It is quite obvious that if you bring a product into a meat farm factory it will be processed into canning or a finished product for the shelf.  Indeed, in the past we relied too much on the export of cattle on the hoof, for instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

We have been endeavouring to move from the exports <Col N="1558" /> on the hoof and sales overseas of unprocessed products.  Until now the practice has normally been to allow the courts to ultimately decide, which gives them a certain flexibility in relation to a particular Bill.</P>

      <P>We should bear in mind that nine of the Twelve member states are not seeking derogation under this legislation, although Luxembourg applied in regard to this section.

      <P>I accept that.  It is not up to me to estimate the cost of product liability insurance for a farmer.  However, as someone with experience of having public liability insurance on a farm, I can say that it is very expensive and if it can be avoided all the better.  In this case we are ensuring that the farming community will not have to have product liability. I do not want to bring you, a Cheann Comhairle, into the debate but I know you have vast experience in this area.  It is not appropriate at this stage but, if circumstances change, I do not rule out a future Minister deciding it is appropriate to consumer legislation and bringing it in.  I am not seeking the derogation in relation to the Article but I am not accepting the amendment moved by Deputy Rabbitte and argued by Deputy McCartan.

That matter was not referred to but I heard about massive increases in <Col N="1560" /> insurance costs for product liability for the farming community.  The Minister is well aware that it costs £80 per annum on average for public liability insurance.  It depends on the size of the farm.  To add employers' liability for casual labour, which is all a small farmer can afford with the way things are going under this Government, would cost £65 per annum, so we are talking about a gross premium of about £1,200 or thereabouts.  Public liability insurance would cost £140 to £150 per annum and you could not farm if you did not have that insurance as it is the most important cover you can have. No business person, whether in farming or otherwise, could operate without it. Product liability is not deemed to be a high risk insurance, and for businesses it is certainly not exorbitant.  I can assure the Minister that to add product liability to existing liability insurance, what is called in the business a tag on insurance to an existing policy, would cost very little per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, product liability insurance.  We are talking about insuring, and big businesses take out this insurance all the time, as I am sure the Deputy is well aware.  Farming is supposed to be a business also, and to extend this directive would result in massive compliance costs. I would be the last to talk in terms of what it would cost any member of the farming community to comply with this product liability directive if I did not have some knowledge of what I was talking about, but I accept that there will be massive compliance costs in the future if a huge number of claims is made against small businesses who can ill afford to meet them.  If a number of such compensation claims is made, insurance companies will, the following day, find a mechanism by which they will increase <Col N="1561" /> premia for everybody else.  We would then have a problem in relation to compliance with the Directive.</P>
      <P>We should try to spread the risk evenly among the entire population.  I am quite sure that the minimum compliance costs are very small at the moment.  I say that as somebody working in the business, somebody who knows the precise premia being paid by the farming community in respect of employers' liability and public liability insurance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan seems to be confusing the matter.  At present insurance is taken out against potential liability for negligence, but here we are talking about strict liability.  I would imagine that the insurance cost of strict liability would be much greater.  It is evident to me why that is the case and it should also be evident to Deputy Hogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate and waited to see if any hard information might come from the Government benches, and indeed from the Minister of State, to support the contention advanced by him that an amendment of this sort would be too punitive and onerous on the farming community. I was a member of the joint Oireachtas committee which first considered this Directive in 1987.  I spoke strongly against the proposal as contained in the legislation and insisted that the final report would carry the views of the people in the market, including the quality research unit in Galway University.  They argued from the same point of view, that of the enhancement of agriculture in this country, and for Ireland seeking a derogation from this provision in the Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister apparently cannot quantify his argument.  It is totally unacceptable in a debate in the national Parliament which is being asked to make important decisions with regard to legislative provisions that we cannot have quantified in real terms the reservations and concerns of the Minister.  Instead he asks us to accept his word in blind faith. I do not accept that as a way of doing <Col N="1562" /> business in this House and I do not think we should be asked to do so.</P>
    <P>The amendment I am proposing does not include all agricultural products.  It recognises that there are two ways of growing food: the clean, wholesome, organic way, that of using the natural environment to produce wholesome, good, clean food, and the way, as is referred to in the amendment, of using artificial additives, insecticides or fertilisers which artifically enhance the quality of food so that it will have a longer life span and will be of better value when it comes onto the shelf.  That is not an absolute inclusion of all agricultural products under strict liability process. The amendment refers to a farmer choosing to introduce artificial means to enhance the growth of the product, be it animal, vegetable or whatever.  I am sorry that the Minister throws his hands in despair.  It appears he is utterly unaware of the fact that there is a growing market for organically grown foods.  If the Government do not appreciate that the future of competitive agriculture from the Irish point of view rests in a massive expansion in the organic food area, in the not too distant future we will be lost entirely in the whole EC market that is swamping us with its false markets, false incentives and false trade.  I am very concerned in this regard.  In proposing this amendment we are not including all agricultural produce in the strict liability net.</P>
    <P>The third point that has to be made is that we must look at the rationale behind the Bill and the Directive.  It is stated that primary agricultural products should be covered by strict liability where &ldquo;it is subject to initial processing&rdquo;.  I have to ask what is the difference between artificially interfering with the product when it is growing in the ground and when it is being canned, chopped or packaged in the factory?  The thinking behind the operation of the Bill and the Directive is that if there is a farming lobby against a certain agricultural product we will not include that product, but we must act as soon as the farmer, manufacturer or producer begins to artifically interfere with it by introducing foreign bodies such <Col N="1563" /> as preservatives, in order to give it a long shelf life, or additives that will enhance its appearance on the shelf, or as soon as it is processed to form other foods or items.</P>
    <P>The same idea can easily be applied to the growth process where a whole range of artificial additives, fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides are used to artificially influence growth mechanism.  I cannot see the logic of introducing strict liability where a product has been processed one hour after it arrives at the factory while not introducing it when the product is growing in the earth.  I do not see that there is a difference.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to make has been made extremely well by Deputy Hogan, and I am very appreciative of his support and that of his party for this amendment. I am particularly appreciative of his support as a Deputy representing a rural constituency and one who is prepared to stand up and say that farmers are supposed to be producers; farmers are supposed to be engaged in business.  What is wrong with saying that if something is good and necessary in the area of small business, or indeed large business, it cannot be the same for the small or the big farmer?  The only argument against that is the proposition that it would prove too onerous in, as Deputy O'Dea has said, hard and straitened times when it is difficult to make an income.  Are we supposed to accept that argument without quantifiable figures being produced to support it?  It seems a weak argument if the figures to back it up are not available. To put it another way, if the figures were available they would be produced here in black and white.  Indeed, they were not produced at the committee when they were considering the Directive. The issue was raised then, it has been raised since, yet the figures have still not been produced.  As we are dealing with consumer protection legislation we should approach it from the viewpoint of the consumer and ensure that we put in place legislation which is as comprehensive and as broad based, as possible. It will then be up to the producers, <Col N="1564" /> manufacturer, the processor and others as to how they deal with the legislation.</P>
    <P>The farming community have very vocal and active national organisations which represent their interests &mdash; indeed one such organisation has a subsidiary insurance company.  It seems ridiculous that the farming community are in a position to complain about high premia when they have their own insurance company. I would have thought it time for that insurance company and its parent farming organisation to get their act together and address the issues that have been so clearly articulated by Deputy Hogan, in terms of introducing national comprehensive insurance cover for all developments in farming.</P>
    <P>The other point which deals with the problem Deputy Rabbitte raised &mdash; I do not think it needs repeating &mdash; has not been answered.  I accept the Minister's interpretation of what amounts to initial processing and I accept his enlightening interpretation of it.  Manufacturers have played about with the concept of manufacturing in order to avoid liability for tax in the export trade.  Tax and legal consultants can show great ingenuity to aid industry and the same ingenuity would be brought to bear in dealing with the concept of initial processing.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister is right about butchering.  There is an argument that the mere cleaning of muck from vegetables and putting it into a polythene bag does not amount to processing. It is packaging and, in my view, putting it into a can does not potentially add up to processing.  Again, it is a form of packaging and distribution and not processing. The scope of the concept of initial processing will, in my mind, be very limited and watered down.  The Minister says it is a broad proposition but I say it is as broad as it is vague and, in time, its broadness will be very poorly exposed and we will have a very restrictive operation of this Directive when the lawyers, consultants and advisers have finished with it.</P>
    <P>I think we should work to broaden it. To answer the proposition advanced by the Government that in industry as well <Col N="1565" /> as farming you will always have the cowboy because of a few bad performers, the people who will break the law and use illegal devices, we should not visit penalties on the greater number.</P>
    <P>However, when you look at the approach of the legislation to protect the consumer, you have to draft the legislation to cover all eventualities and to deal with the people who will break the law.  In this regard I do not think there is a better example than the sorry history of successive Governments trying to eradicate bovine tuberculosis from our national herd.  If one accepts the argument in favour of the few, in this case they have visited problems on the entire national herd and, as a result on industry.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced by the arguments advanced by the Minister that what we are proposing is an attack on agriculture and imposes on that sector a serious onus they would have difficulty in carrying. We should legislate to protect Ireland's fine reputation &mdash; the point made by the Galway research unit &mdash; as one of the cleanest and best producers of agricultural produce in the European market.  In seeking the derogation we should say that because of our standards we have nothing to fear from any liability, no matter how strict, and we would readily introduce into our law the regime of strict liability because our produce is better and we have nothing to worry about it.  In my mind that would be the single most important signal by any Government that Irish produce is better than the rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McCartan, I do not know why the figures for returns were not produced.  I would be happier if they were but it has been represented to me that the insurance costs would be very considerable.  I would have preferred if we had the figures but I do not know how useful an initial quotation from the insurance companies would be because, as Deputy McCartan knows, the premium is decided year by year.  Once the insurance company has the business within their grasp, the ball is in their court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> We have instances &mdash; this is not a debate on insurance and I do not want to get into that &mdash; of the insurance industry increasing premiums in one area in order to carry losses in another.  We would have to be very careful because the initial insurance quotation may mean nothing. The matter will then be decided by the insurance companies, and it is very difficult to predict what will happen there.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy McCartan's point on industrial processes, I agree that this is a grey area which needs to be clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that, to some extent, this debate is going off the rails.  It seems to boil down to what the liability insurance premium for farmers might be.  What about the interests of the consumers who may suffer very seriously and grievously as a result of defective produce?  What about their interest? People can become seriously ill or die from defective or contaminated agricultural produce.  Will there be insurance for them or their families?  The idea that whether the insurance premium for farmers would be large or small should be the be all or end all as to whether we should bring in this derogation on the modest safeguard being put in place by Deputy McCartan, is going off the rails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not lose sight of one factor.  The Minister and Government are availing of the derogation.  Essentially speaking it is a derogation, and farmers &mdash; as producers &mdash; like any other producer would be responsible for defective products &mdash; it is only defective products we are talking about.  The farmers are being given a very major concession that no other producer is being given.  The Government are taking advantage of a derogation to exclude farmers from liability on the primary production side.  That is a major concession and the only exception to it relates to processing of an industrial nature.  It seems the Minister has gone beyond what is permitted in the Directive by introducing as being necessary a new element of an industrial nature, while under the Directive any processing is sufficient to make that producer liable.  I am not impressed by the argument about <Col N="1567" /> whether it might cost a farmer £80, £160 or £260 for an insurance premium.  What would the insurance premium be for, and for whose benefit would it be?  The insurance cover is for the benefit of consumers &mdash; a person, a child or a family &mdash; who may be injured or killed as a result of the unwarranted use of chemicals or dangerous practices.  Therefore, whether or not it is expensive to purchase the insurance is a matter to which we may pay a little concern but we should not get carried away with it.  The basic principle we could all too easily lose sight of is the protection of the consumer.</P>
    <P>While the protection of the farming industry is important, it could nonetheless be argued &mdash; and it has been argued &mdash; that perhaps the best way to protect it would be to tell the world that there is nothing to fear, that our products are safe; that our farmers say they do not want to make use of every available derogation because they know their product is A1 and will not cause injury or death.  That would be a better and more open approach to the issue and it would put our agricultural products in a better standing in the outside world. They need an improvement in their standing, having regard to recent events that I do not need to go into now.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment is modest compared to what one might have looked for.  One might have looked for a removal of the derogation or the deletion of the expression &ldquo;of an industrial nature&rdquo;, and to have the provision apply to any processing.  The Deputy does not go to any of those lengths, he merely seeks that additives, dangerous insecticides and so on be included.  It is a very reasonable amendment and, in my view, the House should support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I wish to elaborate a little further.  We could be taking two directions in this regard.  We could have an interesting debate on the agricultural industry and, indeed, we could have an <Col N="1568" /> interesting debate on the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>However, I am sure Deputy McCartan is conscious of the effect his amendment would have.  He wants to include any use of artificial additives, insecticides or fertilisers in the growth process.  He should be well aware &mdash; Deputy Hogan is aware, as Deputy O'Dea, who has urban and rural areas in his constituency is aware, that fertiliser, nitrogen for instance, properly used is absolutely essential for agricultural production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I hasten to inform Deputies that without the advent of nitrogen and other artificial fertilisers agriculture would be in a very difficult state.</P>
      <P>We are anxious to promote the new concept of organic food, and such food does attract a premium price because less is produced by organic means than would be produced by the use of artificial fertilisers. There is now a great emphasis on organic farming.  The Government have a very enlightened approach towards such production.  That is true of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who, guided by the Taoiseach, has a particular interest in organic horticultural production.  We are giving support to organic growers.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of primary producers does not mean that the Government are in any sense encouraging the unnecessary use of insecticides.  The production of potatoes, for instance, requires the use of a spray to prevent blight.  Surely we should not exclude that.  The use of that spray would be excluded if the amendment was agreed to by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment would have enormous repercussions for the important agricultural industry.  Deputy McCartan's amendment would be detrimental to the best interests of this country and our farming community.  I do not wish to point to Deputy Hogan again, but I should be surprised, to say the least, if he supports this amendment.  I am in a <Col N="1569" /> position to provide guidance and advice more than anything else.  It is in order for me to encourage Deputy Hogan, a very reasonable Deputy with a great interest in the agricultural industry &mdash; I come from that area of activity &mdash; to consider the effect of Deputy McCartan's amendment, which should not be accepted by the House.</P>
    <P>I oppose the amendment absolutely, without any apology to Deputy McCartan. Deputy McCartan does not know what effect his amendment would have on the agricultural community if it was accepted.  The Deputy cannot be completely aloof from the farming industry, and he stated there are farmers in his constituency, particularly those engaged in horticultural farming.</P>

      <P>The amendment has been well debated.  I wish to refer to the matter of quantifying the cost.  The views put forward by Deputy Hogan in relation to public liability, is that the cost to insure against product liability would be quite expensive.  For calculation purposes, it would average out at about £100 &mdash; that is a minor estimate of the cost &mdash; and would add more than £750,000 in cost to the farmers of my constituency alone. That would be the net cost of the amendment to farmers in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> The amendment is unnecessary because, the majority of farmers are producing in total accordance with the highest standards and that is what is required.</P>
    <P>The Government will encourage organic farming in the future, but for the moment they will not be in a position to provide the employment required in the processing sector.  The added-value, and the additional jobs created in the industrial sector as a result of the production of primary produce will, of course, be of benefit to all Members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including electricity generated by nuclear energy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to address a provision in the Directive about which I am extremely disturbed.  Here I will be joining the Minister of State if he wishes to visit criticism on a previous Minister responsible for negotiating, finalising and drawing up the Directive.</P>
      <P>Article 14 of the Directive says:</P>
      <P>This Directive shall not apply to injury or damage arising from nuclear accidents and covered by international conventions ratified by the Member States.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why damage arising from nuclear accidents was included in this Directive at all.  It may well be that the drafters of the day felt that the EURATOM Treaty, as drafted then and as it obtains, constituted an adequate and comprehensive programme of international convention at European level to deal with all matters relating to the nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> We in this House and country are very conscious of the inadequacies of that Convention, as a device, or as a means to be employed by Government, to avoid taking any action against Britain with regard to Sellafield and the other nuclear related installations that present a daily threat to our citizens and environment.</P>
    <P>On reading through the Bill and the definition of &ldquo;product&rdquo; I see that it is said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;product&rdquo; means all movables with the exception of primary agricultural products which have not undergone initial processing, and includes&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  movables even though incorporated into another product or into an immovable, whether by virtue of being a component part or raw material or otherwise,</P>
    <P>(b)  electricity where damage is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us should have any particular difficulty about definitions. Nonetheless, I was alerted that electricity was specifically included in the definition of a &ldquo;product&rdquo;.  Why that should be I am not too sure.  If one then associates that with the body of the Directive which says that injury or damage caused by nuclear accidents are not covered by the Directive, one begins to worry even more about what was meant by subparagraph (b)  of the definitions section where it is said:</P>
    <P>(b)  electricity where damage is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to further clarify that definition, to be certain that it includes electricity where it is generated by nuclear process as well.  That is what I am suggesting by the insertion of the words &ldquo;including electricity generated by nuclear energy&rdquo;.  The plant at Sellafield includes, probably as a minor component, an electricity generating facility.  Nonetheless the second stage of <Col N="1572" /> utilisation of that plant &mdash; the reprocessing of nuclear waste &mdash; is an integral part of the overall nuclear energy facilities in Great Britain.  Without Sellafield Britain would not have any nuclear energy output producing electricity.  For that reason I consider it to be an integral part of the electricity generating process in Great Britain.  It constitutes a very serious threat, a very real, potential source of danger, of accident and damage to our citizens and environment.</P>
    <P>In the future should any accident take place, or should the damage being done to our environment by the processing procedures being carried on at Sellafield continue I do not want any Minister or Government telling me that in litigation, we cannot have recourse to this Directive at a private, public or international level on the basis that Article 14 says that accident or damage caused by nuclear accidents are excluded.  I want it specifically included in our legislation that a person who suffers damage from a defective product, including electricity generated by a nuclear installation, will reap the full benefits of the provisions of this Bill and be entitled to take action on the basis of strict liability standards.</P>
    <P>It may well be the Minister will reply that that is covered already, that there is not need for me to press my amendment. If he can give me that assurance I shall be more than happy to withdraw it.  But I want to avail of this opportunity to highlight how inadequate international conventions, particularly the EURATOM Treaty, appear in the hands of this Government who have failed singularly to initiate any legal action against Britain for the continued damage that Sellafield presents to our citizens and environment.  I want to ensure that, when this Bill will have been enacted, our citizens will reap the full benefit of its provisions, being enabled to take action for damage caused by anything relating to Sellafield or the generation of electricity by nuclear energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular objection to this amendment.  I can see the <Col N="1573" /> reason the term electricity was specifically included in the definitions section. The Bill deals with liability for defective products.  To the mind of the ordinary layman, a product is something which has a tangible quality to it.  When one looks at the first part of the definition of &ldquo;product&rdquo; one sees it refers to movables.  It is not immediately apparent that electricity would be included as a &ldquo;movable&rdquo; because it is not immediately apparent that electricity is a tangible, movable product.  Therefore, I compliment the Minister on specifically including electricity; it is necessary that it be included.</P>
      <P>I contend that Deputy McCartan's fears and misgivings are somewhat misplaced because electricity is covered.  It seems to me that if electricity is a product which can give rise to strict liability under the provisions of this Bill, it does not matter how it is generated, that electricity, however generated is covered.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that I have no great objection to the amendment.  Its acceptance might give a signal of our attitude to the nuclear industry but, apart from that, I do not see any tangible benefit to be gained therefrom.  In the definitions section we do not go into the manner in which electricity is generated.  I presume that what the definition means is that electricity, however generated, is covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference to electricity in section 1 is intended to refer to electricity in general, no matter how it is generated.  Therefore it is felt that the inclusion of Deputy McCartan's amendment would be unnecessary.</P>
      <P>However, I was impressed by Deputy McCartan's argument and what Deputy O'Dea said in relation to sending out a clearer signal about out attitude to the nuclear energy industry.  It is more than likely that we will never have a nuclear energy plant in Ireland.  Certainly it is not the intention of the Government to get involved in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> Article 14 of the Directive states that the Directive shall not apply to injury or damage arising from nuclear accidents which are covered by international conventions ratified by member states. Ireland has no nuclear installation and its not a party to such conventions.  Therefore, it was not considered appropriate to include this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the definition in section 1(1), a &ldquo;product&rdquo; includes all movables, with the exception of unprocessed primary agricultural products. Therefore, a nuclear installation cannot be classified as a product.  However, movable components installed in a nuclear plant are classified as products to which the provisions of the Bill apply and, if it can be proved that a nuclear accident was caused by a defect in such a component, an injured person would have a case against the manufacturer, or the importer into the EC, of the component.  Nevertheless, it would be worthwhile considering Deputy McCartan's amendment further.  We have a very strong view in relation to Sellafield.  Certainly it will not affect the Bill in any way and will not take from it.  I do not want to get into the area of specifying all the different methods of producing electricity &mdash; natural gas, oil, peat and coal.  I will come back on Report Stage with a considered view on this matter and I will take account of the views put forward by Deputy McCartan. If the Deputy will withdraw his amendment and resubmit it on Report Stage, we can have a further discussion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) a service.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This further clarifies the definition of &ldquo;product&rdquo; to include a service.  The links <Col N="1575" /> between goods and services are very close and always have been so in our law.  This is typified in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, where these two concepts are joined and dealt with in like manner.  The debate on the previous amendment is also relevant to what I have to say here.</P>
    <P>In this instance we have again not followed the wording of the Directive. Article 2 of the Directive states that &ldquo;product includes electricity.&rdquo;  That is clear enough, but the Government and the Minister have not accepted it.  They have sought to cut back and reduce that definition by confining it to a failure in the process of generating electricity.  The Minister has departed from the Directive to the detriment of the consumer.  He has cut back on the broad, all-inclusive definition of &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; in Article 2 of the Directive.  He has particularised it, whereas the definition in the Directive is all-embracing and covers all aspects of electricity.  If something goes wrong with the supply of electricity rather than the process of generation, then the consumer affected would be deprived of a remedy under the Bill.  He or she should have a remedy under the terms of the Directive. To give full effect to the intent of the Directive it would be necessary to clarify the definition of &ldquo;product&rdquo; to include a service, as is done in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  It is not acceptable to cut back on the definition in the Directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council Directive 85/374/EEC does not concern liability in respect of services.  The European Commission circulated to member states in January 1919 a proposal on the liability of suppliers of services which envisages the application of rules, parallel to the provisions of this Bill, to the services area.  It is at an early stage of discussion in the EC.  On this basis I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>One of the definitions of &ldquo;product&rdquo; under section 1 (1) (b) of the Bill relates to damage caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> Failure in the process of generation of electricity is intended to refer to defects such as surges in current which could occur during the production process, but not power cuts.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) of the UK Act refers to the relevant time, in so far as it refers to electricity, as being the time at which it was generated, being the time before it was transmitted or distributed.  This type of wording in its entirety may not be relevant to Irish conditions as it is understood that three different types of company are involved in networking electricity in the UK, i.e. a generating company, a transmission company and a distribution company.  In Ireland all these functions are carried out by the ESB.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Deputy Taylor are adequately covered in this clarification. Surges of power occurred in my own village some time ago and the ESB accepted full liability.  Deputy Taylor has made a very clear point about electricity down the line and I have clarified that.  Power cuts are another problem.  I have clarified the position regarding services.  A Bill dealing with that matter will come before the House at a later stage.  It is being discussed by the EC at present.  The provisions will be parallel to those contained in this Bill but will relate to the services area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the advantage in that he can talk about parallel Bills which may come before us in the future.  I only know about the Bill before the House and about the Directive which it is supposed to put into force. The Minister has told us many times that he must follow the Directive slavishly. When putting in the reference to electricity in the definition section, why does he not follow the Directive by simply stating that &ldquo;product&rdquo; includes electricity? Why does he cut back the service element by qualifying it very substantially? There could be a serious defect, not in the process of generation but in sending the supply of electricity downstream.  For example, the generation process may be working perfectly <Col N="1577" /> with no problems at all and a person may be operating a very expensive piece of equipment that relies on the range of 220 to 240 volts, or whatever the acceptable range is.  However, because of some defect in the system downstream &mdash; not at the generation end where the turbines are turning &mdash; there is a drop to 100 volts momentarily and as a result a valuable piece of equipment is damaged or blows or even injures somebody, if the Minister followed the Directive which says that the &ldquo;product&rdquo; includes electricity, that person would be covered and is entitled to be covered under the terms of the Directive.</P>
      <P>I ask no more on this issue than that the Minister follow the wording of the Directive, something which he says he has to do.  In the type of case I have outlined the person would be deprived of a claim because the definition of electricity is limited to damage caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation and that damage may not be caused by anything in the process of generation but in the service element in the process of delivery downstream.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister, therefore, reconsider the matter and agree to let us get back to the directive and define electricity simply as is given there or, alternatively, allow this amendment by including the service element?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is making a separate point in relation to an amendment which would have been dealt with earlier.  Nevertheless he has made a point and I have clarified it.  Under the clarification I would be prepared to look at that.  I have made it clear all along that I am anxious to ensure that the wording of the Bill is as close as possible to the Directive.  I am more than anxious to <Col N="1578" /> ensure that there is no deviation whatsoever from the Directive.  I am prepared to look at it before Report Stage but I am not giving any commitment that I will bring forward an amendment.  I am prepared to assess the point of view the Deputy has put forward.  That is the advantage of having a Report Stage separate from the Committee Stage; it gives me and my officials an opportunity to look at these areas.</P>
      <P>I have first hand experience of this problem of a surge of electricity, where two lines connect up into one in my area, where a television might explode and products, apparatus and appliances totally destroyed.  It was quite clear who was responsible.  The Electricity Supply Board accepted full liability for damage to products in my area and I made it quite clear that we would hold them liable because there was a danger not only to apparatus but to life and limb as a result of the power surge which brought it up to about 400 volts instead of 230 volts.</P>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy Taylor are covered under the product liability legislation but, nevertheless, to ensure that this Bill complies strictly with the Directive and will be of benefit to consumers, I am prepared to come back on Report Stage with my views and if it requires amendment I will put that amendment down.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (3), lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;,where the producer of <Col N="1579" /> the product cannot by taking reasonable steps be identified,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the charging clause of the Bill. What I am seeking to do is put in simpler terms what the position will be when there has been a defective product and an injury has been caused.  In a Bill of this nature we should be very careful to have the matters as clear as possible to avoid all unnecessary court disputes and appeals on technical points.  It seems that the section as it stands now is wide open in a number of respects.  Subsection (3) at present reads:</P>
    <P>... where damage is caused wholly or partly by a defect in a product, any person who supplied the product (whether to the person who suffered the damage, ...) shall, where the producer of the product cannot by taking reasonable steps be identified, be liable, as the producer,...</P>
    <P>That will be a fertile source of argument. What would &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; be that an injured party is supposed to take to try to ascertain the identity of the producer? How far does he have to go?  How far can the injured party go?  There is no limit to it.  One could start retaining researchers to try to ascertain when the product came, who produced it, who manufactured it.  Many of these products do not have the information on them that they ought to have.  It is never that simple even now.  When one tries to find out who is the producer one finds trade names and &ldquo;care of&rdquo; addresses, to say nothing of offshore companies and hidden situations which are used all the time.  Why insist then that the unfortunate injured party &mdash; who may very likely be a person of no means and not in a position to undertake the expense of research and detailed inquiries, goodness knows to what extent &mdash; should have to do so?</P>
    <P>If they receive an injury they should be in the position, subject to the further requirements later in the section, to be able to proceed against the supplier.  I am providing that they can ask the supplier to tell them who the producer is and <Col N="1580" /> that we get away from this expression &ldquo;a reasonable time&rdquo; and fix the time.  I have suggested 21 days but that may be too long or too short.  I do not know. However, this should be well defined otherwise the whole thrust of this important Bill will be negatived to some extent by having an unfortunate claimant trying to satisfy a court that he took reasonable steps to try to identify the producer.</P>
    <P>We could have him being asked what he did, where he went, if he made inquiries at the Companies Office, if he phoned the newspapers, if he went around the area to see where they were, etc.  There might be no end to it.  Why should all that be necessary?  Should it not be sufficient if the injured party simply sends the supplier a letter asking who is the manufacturer, who is the producer and giving the supplier 21 days to tell him.  If he is told, well and good; if not, the preliminary point is set up.  Why put in &ldquo;where the producer cannot, by taking reasonable steps be identified&rdquo;?  There is an obligation on the injured person there &ldquo;to take reasonable steps&rdquo; whatever they might be, and whatever they might cost. He could spend quite a bit of money making inquiries.  How much is one supposed to spend?  How much can the unfortunate person who has been hit by a defective product spend?  That is my concern and I think it would be better if that proviso was left out altogether.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (3) (b) states that the person who supplied the product shall be liable for the damage if &ldquo;that request is made within a reasonable time after the damage occurs and at a time when it is not reasonably practicable for the injured person to identify all those persons.&rdquo;  Would it not be sufficient to provide that the request for the information as to who is the producer should be made within a reasonable time after the damage occurs?  That would be sufficient.  Why qualify that provision further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> A person who is supplied with a defective product and injured by it should have a right of claim under this Bill against the manufacturer or producer.  If he wants to avail of that right why should he be asked to do more than this?  He should be able to go to the supplier and say, &ldquo;I hereby require you to furnish me within 21 days with the name and address of the producer&rdquo;. I do not mind whether it is 21 days or 28 days but I do not like the term &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; which is open to argument and dispute.  If he gets an answer to his 21-day notice, he will have the information he wants and if he does not get an answer he should be able to proceed against the supplier as producer. We should keep the procedure simple, seek to avoid unnecessary argument in court as to what is a reasonable time and not place unnecessary burdens on people.  The supplier is the person who got the goods and he knows from whom he got them.  He should come up with the information from his invoices within 21 or 28 days and discharge his responsibility rather than putting the unfortunate injured party into a legal tangle in trying to justify that the steps he took were reasonable and were taken within a reasonable time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these two reasoned and well considered amendments which would improve the legislation. They are in keeping with the strictness and tenor, so to speak, of the code of law we are now working on, that of strict liability, getting out of the area of the test of the reasonable man and saying when one is at fault one is strictly at fault and there should be no other play acting around on what is reasonable. That is the whole purpose and direction of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Taylor was collecting his thoughts in relation to amendment No. 11 I made the point that this was not an area where the Minister could pick up the Directive and say: &ldquo;I have said I am sticking strictly to what is in the Directive, and this is not covered&rdquo;.  I suspect that what has happened is that the producers' association and lobby said: &ldquo;As <Col N="1582" /> this is an area we will be able to get our feet into we should try to minimise our liability, particularly for those involved in the supply side of the retail trade; let us try to work this out by putting some of the work and responsibility onto the shoulders of the consumer&rdquo;.  I do not think this should be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 proposes the deletion of the words, &ldquo;where the producer of the product cannot by taking reasonable steps be identified,&rdquo; from subsection (3).  The deletion of those words would put the onus solidly on the shoulders of the supplier because it would be in his or her interest to say to the consumer who bought a defective product, &ldquo;I only supplied you with the goods, here is the name of the producer of the goods&rdquo;.  If a supplier of goods does not keep that information then the responsibility should immediately fall on his or her shoulders.  That would be an eminently fair regime in this instance.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the opportunity to look at a paper on this Bill delivered at a conference in Dublin by a lecturer in law at one of the universities.  One of the strongest points he made throughout his dissertation was to warn suppliers and retailers to keep comprehensive and strict records of every article supplied to them from whatever source and to maintain them on a current basis so that whenever an inquiry is made they can immediately deflect responsibility from themselves and say, &ldquo;I supplied you with the item but I was not the producer; this is the name of the producer of the goods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think the proposal in Deputy Taylor's amendment No. 10 would harm the legislation.  Rather it would improve it and help things to move along at a faster pace so that when a consumer visits a retailer in the high street to complain about bum goods the retailer will be able to immediately go to his records and give the name of the producer.  That would be a clean way of dealing with such issues. My worry &mdash; I think Deputy Taylor and others share this worry &mdash; is that there could be links either through company codes, personal association or financial <Col N="1583" /> incentives, for example, commissions, between the producer and the retailer-supplier. In such instances it might seem to be in the better interests of the supplier to try to protect a producer's identity in the hope &mdash; as often happens in the consumer area &mdash; that the customer will get fed up trying to pursue his or her legal remedy.  Decisions in this area will vary from judge to judge, from court to court and from day to day and it would be better to take out the reference to &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; in section 2 (3). Section 2 (3) (b) should merely provide that a request be made within a reasonable time after the damage occurs and the words, &ldquo;and at a time when it was not reasonably practicable for the injured person to identify all those persons&rdquo;, be deleted.  This would help to tighten the legislation and would be in keeping with its overall tenor, which is strictness of liability and answerability.  I hope the Minister can see his way to accepting these amendments.</P>

      <P>Before I comment on the detailed contributions by Deputies McCartan and Taylor I should like to elaborate on the reasoning behind the section.  I will then comment on the proposals put forward in the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (2) defines the term &ldquo;producer&rdquo; as any one of the following: (a) the producer of a finished product; (b) the producer of any raw material or of a component part of a product &mdash; raw material, in this instance, is taken to mean any substance used in the manufacture or assembly of a product or component part of a product, i.e. wood used in furniture manufacturing or metal used in the manufacture of a circuit board intended for incorporation into a finished product; (c) in the case of primary agricultural products which have undergone initial processing, the person who carried out such processing; (d) any person who, by putting his name, trade mark or other distinguishing feature on the product, has held himself out to be the producer of the product &mdash; under this provision companies selling &ldquo;own brand&rdquo; products will <Col N="1584" /> be liable as producers, even if the product was manufactured and packed by another company; and (e) any person who has imported the product into a member state from a place outside the European Communities in order, in the course of any business of his, to supply it to another.</P>
    <P>As the terms of the Directive apply only within the EC, the Community importers must be ultimately responsible for any defect in an imported product. An important aspect of this provision is the purpose for which the product was imported.  Article 3.2 of the Directive states:</P>
    <P>.... any person who imports into the Community a product for sale, hire, leasing or any other form of distribution in the course of his business shall be deemed to be a producer...;</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (f) states:</P>
    <P>any person who is liable as the producer of the product pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.</P>
    <P>As a result of amendments Nos. 10 and 11, in the spirit of the discussions which have taken place, I am prepared to look at this matter on Report Stage.  Because of Deputy Taylor's submission, followed by Deputy McCartan's comments I would not regard it as being as fundamental as the primary producer, which we discussed earlier.  A good point is being made by both Deputies who have experience in this field.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Taylor would resubmit his amendments on Report Stage, and, in the meantime, we will have a further look at them after consulting further with the Attorney General, to see if we can improve the legislation, which is the objective of all of us.  I have no hangup about any particular wording provided the legislation can be improved.  In this case there is good reason to consider the wording carefully. I am not saying that in order to have this stage passed before 7 o'clock, but there <Col N="1585" /> are important issues in this very important Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3) (c), line 20, to delete &ldquo;a reasonable time&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;twenty-one days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is even clearer.  Subsection (3) (c) in relation to the question of liability, states:</P>
      <P>the supplier fails, within a reasonable time after receiving the request....</P>
      <P>I am very anxious that we get away from this description of &ldquo;a reasonable time&rdquo;. It is too uncertain and is capable of a whole legal argument in itself as to what was reasonable and what was not.  I do not mind what the time is so long as it is definite.  In my amendment I suggested 21 days but if other people suggest 14 days or 28 days I do not mind so long as it is fixed, otherwise nobody knows where they are.</P>
      <P>When the supplier gets a notice he can put off making a decision and saying a couple of months would be reasonable. The unfortunate injured party who wants to get on with his claim does not know how long he is expected to wait.  A definition in this regard would be most important. If anybody has any comment on my suggestion of 21 days, I would like to hear it because my main object is that the time should be definite.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  The reason it was put forward attracts me, particularly when it is taken in conjunction with the previous <Col N="1586" /> amendments.  I understand the supplier will have to be informed and will get an opportunity to come back after a reasonable time &mdash; as stated in the Bill but that wording is too loose.  I hope the Minister will take on board Deputy Taylor's amendment to ensure that the supplier reacts within a certain time and that at least he communicates with the authorities on receipt of the request for information. Only in that way could he ensure that the statutory authorities are treated fairly, are not being ignored and that the supplier is being given a reasonable amount of time.  The time suggested in which to make the initial contact to the authorities in relation to the complaint received is not unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of what Deputy Taylor is attempting to achieve but I would prefer if the amendment said 21 hours.  I do not understand why we should give three weeks to anyone to say where he or she got a particular defective item.</P>
      <P>Professor Schuster &mdash; to whom I referred earlier &mdash; in a paper discoursing on the Bill had the following to say:</P>
      <P>This extension of the parameters of liability carries important implications for all the major players in the distributive process.  It will encourage the keeping of comprehensive records to enable both the wholesale and retail industry to pass the burden of liability to the manufacturers of dangerously defective products.</P>
      <P>He makes the point correctly in advice to the retail and distributive industries, that the onus is now on them to keep records so that when somebody asks where this defective product originated, they can immediately pass the liability by identifying the producer and imparting that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of consumer defects is that every small claimant who comes into the shops to complain is told to come back next week, the manager is not here, the man dealing with that is not available or the accountants are checking the records.  Any number of different excuses <Col N="1587" /> are used.  For the reasons I have already advanced in relation to the other amendments, I am not happy with the concept of &ldquo;a reasonable time&rdquo; because the bigger the concern, the bigger the consortium, the bigger the shop, the bigger the retail outlet the longer the &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; element can be played around with as to what is a reasonable time in which to respond to a particular request.</P>
    <P>Given modern day communications, and the capacity to keep records on computer or in proper filing systems where a person presents himself at a counter in a retail outlet or at a distributive outlet and asks where an item originated, I cannot understand why, within 24 hours, the person should not have a response orally over the counter, the post or by telephone. I am not arguing for 21 hours, but I suggest that something nearer to 24 hours or thereabouts, would be far more reasonable than allowing people to lay around for three weeks before they make up their minds.  I support what Deputy Taylor is seeking to achieve but I suggest on reflection that a much shorter period can often be more effective in seeing a speedy resolution to these matters.</P>

      <P>The section complies with Article 3.3 of the Directive.  Having looked at the situation earlier today and the amendment by Deputy Taylor, and having the benefit of the views of Deputies Hogan and McCartan, the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; could be abused.  What is reasonable to me may not be reasonable to Members opposite.  In any consumer legislation we are leaving too much flexibility to producers and manufacturers in a situation where &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is not defined clearly enough. Having looked at it I was hoping to hear the views I have heard from the Deputies opposite.  Whether it is 21 days or 31 days is a matter of numbers.  I, too, want to be reasonable so far as the information is concerned and I want to give the producer an opportunity to provide the information.  The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; could lead to a very long convoluted series of inquiries before there would be <Col N="1588" /> finality.  In the circumstances I am agreeable to defining the number of days but I would like further clarification from my Department to see if we can agree to 21 days.  Certainly four weeks or there abouts would be enough.  We will see what is the general line in legislation with regard to what would be a reasonable time to respond.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I could agree to the amendment but I would like to have another look at it between now and Report Stage.  At this stage I would be agreeable to including a date, unless a very good argument to the contrary is put forward.  Certainly the views put forward by Deputy McCartan and the amendment by Deputy Taylor will add to the effectiveness of his Bill when passed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 23, to delete &ldquo;£350&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£50&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> I note Deputy Taylor's intention to oppose the section.  I sympathise with that position.  I am advancing the amendment simply because I anticipate the Minister's line of argument &mdash; that this is a provision in the Directive which must be included in the Bill.  Under the Directive the Minister is entitled to introduce regulations in the domestic scene to vary the amount.  While the Directive indicates an amount of £350 or 500 ECU it clearly states that it is a matter for individual states to fix the amounts.  It can be argued that the Directive is primarily designed to keep in line with inflation and the cost of living in different states. The figures laid down in the Directive are not written in stone.</P>
    <P>If this provision is to impact on the poorer consumer this figure of £350 must be brought down to a more realistic level. To help those who must use credit resources or finance companies to equip their homes with basic items, such as washing machines, cookers, fridges and so on, this figure must be reduced.  If the Minister allows the figure in the legislation to stand, such consumers will be virtually excluded.  It is not a coincidence that the figure £350 is approximately what it costs to buy the average domestic appliance.  The standard fridge or cooker would cost about £350 or less.  All those things will be excluded under this Bill. The electrical appliances market is one of the most contentious in the consumer market.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is wrong and the House should take the opportunity to outline the proper threshold upon which the section should come into play and for which there should be a saving threshold for compensation.  What the Minister is saying in the legislation is that any damage amounting to £350 or under will not be covered and if the damage costs more than £350, only the excess will be allowed.  That is much too high considering what I have said.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Taylor feels as strongly as he indicates &mdash; that he is not prepared to get into the area of thresholds and the section must be opposed &mdash; I have no difficulty supporting him.  However, <Col N="1590" /> given the strictures in the Directive, I would like to hear from the Minister, and I hope he will see that what I am arguing for is equity for the small man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the approach adopted by Deputies Taylor and McCartan on this section.  I do not know whether the Minister is obliged to leave the figure at £350 in view of the terms of the Directive and I do not see any power of derogation in relation to that figure.  I do not know if the Minister could get around the situation by giving a commitment to the House that he will immediately introduce regulations which will reduce the amount.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to various household appliances but he seemed to overlook the fact that the Bill deals with liability for damage caused by those products and not with liability in relation to the products themselves.  However, I take the point, for instance, that if a faulty television set sets a house on fire somebody will have a claim under this legislation.  A faulty washing machine could damage a carpet for which an individual could not claim if the carpet was worth only £350 or less.  Even though we are only talking about consequential damage, £350 is a little high in view of our commitment and our intention to introduce a small claims court.  If we are proceeding in that direction, due regard will have to be taken of that in this legislation. The Minister might clarify that point.  I do not know if the Minister is caught by the terms of the Directive in relation to the threshold figure here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most appalling sections in the Bill.  It is utterly repugnant.  I do not go along with any figure, be it £350 or £50.  If we are establishing a principle of liability, to say that the unfortunate person who is caught for a sum up to £300 gets nothing is quite outrageous and utterly unacceptable.  It is completely reprehensible.  The Minister <Col N="1591" /> does not have to put in that figure unless he wants to.  He is not obliged to do it.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether my interpretation of this section is correct and I would be interested to hear comments from other Deputies on it, but the way the section is worded, it talks about the £350 as the minimum figure for damage to other property.  Where only £300 damage to other property was sustained, but a person sustained a serious injury, on my reading of the way the section is worded, it looks as though there must be more than £350 damage to other property before one can bring a claim for anything.</P>
      <P>The section states: &ldquo;Where, but for this section, damages not exceeding £350 in respect of loss of or damage to ... would fall to be awarded by virtue of this Act, no damages shall be awarded...&rdquo;. It does not state that no damages shall be awarded &ldquo;under this heading&rdquo; or in respect of the heading of &ldquo;other property&rdquo;, it just states that no damages shall be awarded.  I can well imagine some judge saying that there is a qualification, that unless damages to other property hit the figure of £350 or more he must not award any damages.</P>
      <P>Article 9 of the Directive which covers this matter distinguishes between the two categories when dealing with the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo;.  It refers in paragraph (a) to damage caused by death or by personal injuries and in paragraph (b) to damage to other property.  At that point it brings in the threshold of 500 ECU in respect of that category of damage.  I am fearful, given the way the section is worded at present, that it would even cut out a personal injuries award.  I am sure that is not what is intended but it seems there is a serious danger that this could happen because it states unless one hits that qualification no damages shall be awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well see a judge saying because damages do not exceed £350 no damages can be awarded.  It does not state that no damages shall be awarded under the heading of &ldquo;other property&rdquo; but they can be awarded in respect of the other category of personal injuries.  This is in stark <Col N="1592" /> contrast with the two separate categories in Article 9 of the Directive.  I am concerned about that.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, on broad general principles, this Bill will be emasculated completely if we allow the proviso that unless damages exceed £350 one can forget about their claim or their rights under this Bill.  They are not capable of enforcement and that remains.  Even if the figure is £400 one will only get £50.  Those who will seek to rely on this will be people with little or no money.  The overwhelming bulk of claims will not be for enormous amounts.  They will not be for thousands of pounds or even hundreds of pounds.  As Deputy McCartan said, quite rightly, they will be for £100, £200 or £250 but this represents a major investment for a person who goes out to buy a washing machine, a fridge or a television.  We are taking away from them the right to claim in respect of that item.  They will only be able to claim in respect of damage to something else.  How much can we hedge this?  One will not be able to claim for the television as one will only be allowed to claim for something other than the television which has been damaged.  This is becoming laughable; we should cop ourselves on.  If we want to make a major breakthrough on a principle of law we should either do it properly or scrap the whole operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is the stated intention of the Minister for Justice to introduce a small claims court which will be in conflict with what we are trying to achieve here, the right of a consumer to seek redress, if claims are to be restricted to a figure of £350 or more.  In view of the expense of going to court from the point of view of the consumer, the need to ensure access to justice in respect of all matters, irrespective of means, and the fact that a small claims court is to be established by the end of this year, the Minister should accept this amendment or reduce the figure.  Otherwise he will rule out a considerable number of small claims by consumers who do not have the means to replace the product damaged or rectify <Col N="1593" /> the damage caused.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this argument very carefully and to see to it, in the light of the fact that a Government decision is pending in relation to a small claims court, that greater access is given to consumers with small claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to the points put forward in support of the amendments by Deputy McCartan.  The Deputy's amendments conflict with the provisions of Article 9 of the Directive which sets the lowest threshold in respect of damage to or destruction of property in any amount approximately equivalent to £350. Member states have no option but to apply this lower threshold.  Article 18 (2) states that every five years the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall examine the situation and may revise the amounts but I think they will revise them upwards as opposed to lowering them.  I would like to point out to Deputy Hogan that this Directive was agreed to by his present Leader in 1985. Three hundred and fifty pounds was far more valuable then than it is now.</P>
      <P>Let me give the House the philosophy behind the idea of having the lower limit. In order to discourage litigation in an excessive number of cases this section provides that individual items of property worth less than £350 are excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  Where damage exceeds this amount only the amount in excess of £350 shall be awarded.  There is no upper limit on the amount of damages which may be awarded arising from a claim under the Bill.  Article 16 of the Directive allows member states to provide for a limit on the total liability of a producer resulting from a death or injury caused by identical items with the same defect.  If any member state decides to set such a limit the amount cannot be less than 70 ECU million which is approximately £53 million.  This Bill does not include such a limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of debate took place at EC level as to whether a financial limit should be set.  Most member states considered the idea of a ceiling on liability <Col N="1594" /> as unjust as it could lead to situations whereby early claimants could achieve full compensation for their injuries with later claimants unable to claim adequate compensation.  It could also lead to lengthy delays in reaching settlements where there is a possibility of further claims against the same product.  There would also be the possibility that the inclusion of the limit set down in the Council Directive might act as an inducement to put forward grossly inflated claims for compensation. Some member states favoured the imposition of a limit as either their existing national laws on product liability provided for such a limit or they felt it would be an advantage for industry to know the upper limit on any claims which would reflect itself in lower insurance costs.</P>
    <P>The majority view, including Ireland's, however was that the financial limits were at such a high level there would be no material difference from an unlimited liability system.  There would therefore be no significant difference in the level of insurance premiums and consequently little, if any, difference in the competition position of industry.  Accordingly, while there would be no disadvantages there was no discernible benefit to anyone, including industry, in setting a limit.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation in their observations on the matter have stated that relatively few companies hold product liability cover with a limit of indemnity higher than £5 million to £10 million with the great majority of policies having an upper limit of £1 million or less. In these circumstances the imposition of an upper limit of not less than £53 million would be of little relevance to the insurance market and unlimited liability for defective products will not materially affect the availability of cover.</P>
    <P>I accept that the amendment relates to the lower limit and what I have said is not that relevant given that the Deputies are quite happy with the position in relation to an upper limit.  The points put forward by the Deputies are excellent but I have no discretion in this matter.  If I had I would be more flexible because I accept £350 is a considerable amount of <Col N="1595" /> money for a person who might be affected.  Nevertheless in view of the lack of a small claims court, if this amendment was accepted it would would lead to the system being clogged up.  The legislation is worthwhile. Deputy Taylor expressed his reservations about this being one of the basic principles of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Personal injuries would not be affected by the lower limit but I am not in a position to vary the amount.  It was an agreed decision taken at EC level among the 12 member states and I must comply with the Directive in this regard.  Otherwise, I would not be complying with its spirit.  It is a provision of the legislation that £350 is the lower limit and I must adhere to that.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment tabled by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor would like to see the section deleted.  I should like to be more flexible in this area but I am unable to be.  I do not want to keep reminding Deputy Hogan that his leader, Deputy John Bruton, was involved in negotiating this Directive and that Deputy Taylor's party were also in Government at the time.  I appreciate that he was not at the EC meetings at which the Directive was agreed and I doubt if it was put forward at any parliamentary party meeting.  As Deputies will appreciate, a consensus had to be reached at EC level and the Directive was the result.  I cannot, in any circumstances, accept the amendment nor can I put forward any variation of this amount on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I lament this incredible capitulation of national sovereignty, that we cannot, even in our own Parliament, discuss figures as minuscule as the difference between £50 and £350.  How does the Minister propose to operate section 2(2) if his hands are so tied as he says in terms of the initial figure?  Subsection (2), as the Minister of State is aware, allows the Minister, by regulation, to vary the figure.  By implication, the Minister of State is saying that if ever the Minister exercises his power in this regard, the <Col N="1596" /> sum will never be below the figure of £350 which was originally negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has interpreted my remarks correctly in regard to increasing the lower limit as there is no discretion in this regard.  The idea was that he might increase it allowing for changes in income and the economy but that it would not be decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Government contemplate introducing a small claims court one would have thought that the scenario would have been changed as a court of that kind is an inexpensive procedure.  I am glad the Minister of State spoke glowingly about Deputy John Bruton who was Minister for Industry and Commerce when the Directive was agreed.  However, I cannot understand why it took so long to introduce this legislation in the House, I am not surprised that the Minister was convinced in July because of its non-implementation. In the light of the Government decision to introduce a small claims court I hope that, under subsection (2), the Minister will be able to vary the amount downwards to incorporate the spirit of the Deputies' remarks.  I do not have evidence of a lower limit being agreed by all member states and I do not know if any member state has deviated from the lower limit. If that is the case we could do the same and we should research that area before Report Stage to see whether it is possible to reduce it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the small claims court, I know the Minister is trying to eliminate frivolous claims by keeping the lower limit at £350 and I can understand the administrative reasons for that.  Nevertheless, it will deprive an enormous number of consumers of their basic right to seek redress if they feel they have been wronged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We must bear in mind that the injured consumer will still have the usual common law right to proceed if he can establish negligence.  We are trying to establish a system of strict liability in <Col N="1597" /> this instance.  What exactly is the authority for the proposition that the Minister cannot reduce the amount?  The subsection says that the Minister may, by order, vary the amount.  If the amount can be varied upwards, why can it not be varied downwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This Directive was negotiated at EC level and took about ten years to become a reality.  Even though it would have been discussed and debated with officials of all the member states for a period of time, it ultimately came to the Council of Ministers where it was minutely examined; the consensus was that £350 or 500 ECU was the minimum amount applicable under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea is correct in relation to the other legal resources available to anyone to take a case.  The small claims court, mentioned by Deputy Hogan, is a different, separate issue which will be dealt with in due course.  However, we are dealing with this Bill and the variation of the amount is not at the discretion of the Minister.  I have no intention of varying the subsection to specify that the Minister can vary it downwards.  After carefully considering the matter, that is the position, it can be reviewed in the future but I am sure it will be reviewed upwards.  If I had been negotiating this matter in Brussels I might have held a different view regarding the amount of £350 because I accept that Deputy Taylor made a relevant point.  Deputy McCartan's amendment that the amount should be completely dispensed with is also relevant. There is unlimited liability at the upper limit but, of course, in many insurance company claims the first £500 is excluded to avoid frivolous claims.</P>

      <P>As I said last night, I compliment the Fine Gael Party on bringing this Bill before the House as it gives us the opportunity of debating some of the major issues in education.  I have difficulty with some areas in the Bill.  In terms of the general debate one point in particular was brought home to me during the debate last night, that is the inappropriateness of dealing with the Education Bill in a piecemeal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke last night about the need for a wide-ranging debate in relation to the Education Bill.  We must deal with the education system in its totality.  The Fine Gael Bill we are discussing tonight deals with first and second level only, and seeks <Col N="1599" /> to do so in a comprehensive way.  When the Minister contributed to the debate last night she indicated that she will be strongly opposing the Bill and she outlined many reasons for this.  She further indicated that she will be publishing a Green Paper on Education before the end of the year, but then stated that she does not mind how long the consultation process takes.  I repeat again what I said in the House last night, that I find that statement rather alarming.  The question must be asked: whether we are ever going to see an Education Act.  A long drawn out consultation period would not be conducive to the early production of a White Paper and, consequently, to the legislation being put through both Houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister, during the summer, published two Bills: the Regional Colleges Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill.  We have been told that those Bills will be dealt with in the very near future.  At the same time the Minister is publishing a Green Paper dealing with the whole education system.  I expressed in the House last night my basic concern about the two Bills, that they are primarily aimed at bringing control back to the centre, to the Department of Education. This is not alone bad in the education sense; it is also bad in the general economic sense because the colleges &mdash; I state this again &mdash; have been the success story of Irish education in the past two decades.  They have provided, from their basic mandate, a wide range of technical qualifications which have been of great assistance to the technological growth of industry and services in this country. They have also provided many valuable qualifications in the general business and secretarial area, as well as providing degrees.  The two Bills are structured in such a way as to prevent the colleges from expanding and developing, particularly in the degree area.  The Bill seeks to give control to the Department to regulate the colleges and to allow for all degree development to take place in the university sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> We speak a lot in this House in terms of equality of access to education.  There are socio-economic factors in this area which militate and discriminate against income groups in society, but there are also geographical reasons for inequality of access.  The development of the regional colleges, in terms of providing more degree courses, would play a major role in eliminating inequality as regards the geographical disadvantage to pupils. The policy of the Department of Education &mdash; it will be the continuing policy regardless of which Minister is in office &mdash; is in line with demographic trends. Clearly in years to come there will be a reduction in the numbers seeking places at third level.  Students seeking degrees will be directed towards the existing universities, particularly in Dublin, which will have a lop-sided effect in terms of national development.  Already too many of the country's resources, particularly in the services sector, are in Dublin.  Those resources need to be decentralised. Therefore, in a very fundamental way I am opposed to what the colleges Bill is seeking to put in place.</P>
    <P>I spoke last night about the major problem I see at present in our schools, that is discipline.  In the debate which will ensue from the publication of the Green Paper we must produce a philosophy of education, restating values.  This is something that must be done, and if we miss our opportunity to do so we will be doing a great disservice to the country and to our young people for many years to come.  We should also study the education systems in other countries.  If we want to see profound and fundamental reform, the policies adopted in other systems could be incorporated here but, at the end of the day, what we must look to is our uniqueness, our Irishness and the demands that a growing economy makes upon us.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to deal briefly with the role of teachers in primary schools.  I taught in primary schools for 20 years.  One thought that has been in my mind a lot since I came into this House is that the national teacher is confined to the same classroom each day <Col N="1601" /> throughout the school year.  I favour a system that would give more flexibility and release from this type of position. I have put it to the Minister in the House previously, and I do so again tonight, that teachers should be encouraged to take leave of absence from school and get a job outside, whether in the commercial or industrial sector.  They should also be allowed, while on leave of absence, to contribute to their pension fund so that there would be no reduction in their pension entitlement as a result of taking work outside the school.  If somebody is at the coal-face all the time he does not see the profession in perspective. When someone is released from the day-to-day discipline of the classroom and sees profound changes in areas that have been expanding over the years, I believe that experience would be very valuable and the teacher would return refreshed but, more importantly, would have increased his enthusiasm for the job and have gained additional knowledge.</P>
    <P>I believe second level education is being neglected.  The Barber report demonstrates conclusively that each town will probably have one second level institution by the year 2006.  We are going to see a great many amalgamations over the next 12 to 15 years.  I am afraid, however, that the Department are allowing things to happen in a piecemeal and <i>ad hoc</i> way. This is a misuse of resources.  Planned amalgamation and development bring the most effective results at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The third level sector should be looked at closely in terms of a cost benefit analysis.  I believe that the RTC-DIT sector will come out very well in any comparisons made.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I once again compliment the Fine Gael Party on giving us this opportunity to discuss major education issues in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First, what strikes me is the lack of consultation evident in the Bill. It is not just I who have made this observation because, as pointed out by the Minister, a representative of the TUI pointed this out and said they regretted that no consultation was held with the teachers' union before its publication.  I have been following the progress of educational matters since my election to this House and the cornerstone of progress and development in this area has been the process of consultation.  Regardless of what Deputy Higgins might have to say and the ideas he may have, it has to be acknowledged that the process of consultation, which came to a conclusion with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> has been the cornerstone of the educational debate over the past few years.</P>
      <P>The Bill has no clear philosophy; it is very impersonal.  If one compares it with the developments under the Minister's regime one finds in some respect that it is simply trying to take some of the issues from the Government's proposals and incorporate them into a Fine Gael Bill. For that reason I am very disappointed with the approach in the Bill.  The Minister has reached a stage at which an Education Bill will be introduced in the very near future.  The first step in producing an Education Bill is to issue a Green Paper, which is a discussion document.  I look forward to its publication when all of us interested in education will have something to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins' Bill appears to suggest that progress must be achieved in dealing with the problem of education within the large institutional approach which looks at the issues from the top <Col N="1603" /> downwards.  As one who has been involved in education I can align myself with the Minister's approach which states that the men and women at the coal-face of education, the teachers of Ireland must be closely involved in the process of consultation. This has been part of the Government's approach since the 1987 <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Deputies speaking here tonight welcome the fact that education has been and is centre stage in these programmes.  If the system closes the opening for consultation, as has been suggested here by Deputy Higgins, it will fail.  We must allow for change because from my experience as a teacher, even in my short number of years teaching, there was a natural evolution from the bottom up which is the approach the Minister has accepted.  In primary education the child must be allowed to grow, develop and learn within certain parameters. We must allow the educational system to evolve and meet the needs of the child, the parents, the community and the nation.  That is the approach adopted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister involved herself in the process of consultation from day one. One of the first debates in the Parliamentary Party I remember was on the pupil-teacher ratio.  It was a rough period but let me say that backbenchers like myself and my colleagues were consulted and had an input into how these issues should be addressed.  The problems were tackled gradually within the consultative process with the social partners and the teachers' union.  Some of the results of that process of consultation are now evident.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Did the Deputy's party not increase the pupil-teacher ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address the issue of the pupil-teacher ratio.  In the present year 325 teaching posts have been authorised to reduce the class size in primary <Col N="1604" /> schools, in post-primary schools 250 teaching posts have been sanctioned and 120 schools in disadvantaged areas have been provided with extra teachers.  Even though the country has gone through some very difficult times financially, when every sector and Department was asked to cut back on public spending programmes, the Minister for Education has managed to keep education centre stage.</P>
      <P>There is a primary review body and a primary curriculum review body in place which involves all those interested and expert in primary and post-primary education. Reports have been published and we are now entering a period within which a wide ranging debate is allowed. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment propose changes in the syllabuses at the junior level of secondary education and these changes have been introduced in an ordered, systematic way with the least amount of disruption.  I detect from this Bill that it seems to come down with an axe, I suppose Deputy Higgins would say, in a radical way to try to change the whole system.  This goes completely against the approach of the Government who want to deal with the development of education in an ordered way.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will continue their work at the junior certificate level and will then go on in an ordered way to the senior cycle.  For that reason I am amazed that the Fine Gael Bill refers to the establishment of a curriculum review board.  What was the reason for that? Such a proposal is ill-conceived and does not allow for any recognition of the work of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that additional funding was provided for schools in disadvantaged areas.  Tha funding was increased by 300 per cent since 1987. Initiatives to develop the home/school links scheme at primary and post-primary levels have been put in place.  That is one aspect in which I have a particular interest.  I spoke before on the need to maintain support structures between the home and the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> Very much related to that requirement is the issue of the school attendance service in the Dublin region.  I would remind my colleagues that a school attendance service exists within Dublin city but in the county that matter is dealt with by the Garda Síochana.  I hope my proposal to have one school attendance service is included in the Education Bill.  Perhaps its name might be changed from a school attendance service to a support type structure for the city and county of Dublin.  I do not consider it appropriate to have a garda calling to a person's home about this matter.  I do not wish to take away from the work of the gardaí but it would be more appropriate that such work be given to people involved in education and the social services.</P>
    <P>I mentioned one glaring anomaly in relation to the Ballymun area.  Part of the flat complex in Ballymun is in the city area and the other part is in the county. The school attendance service operates in one region while, within the same flat complex, the gardaí deal with the issue. Surveys have shown that the problem of non-attendance at school results from many serious social problems such as drink problems in the home, drugs and violence, and, obviously, it is a matter that has to be dealt with by those with skill and expertise.  The Minister, in the Education Bill, should tie into the excellent progress that has been made in the home links service the problem of school attendance and, perhaps, amalgamate those involved in the school attendance service with those operating in that area. I gather, from speaking to some of my teaching colleagues, that the home links service, which is now operating in 80 schools, is working well in disadvantaged areas.  I hope that the Education Bill will co-ordinate some of those excellent activities.</P>
    <P>I have much respect for Deputy Higgins, having listened to his many contributions on education in the House, but I find his Bill to be clinical in its approach to a subject which of its nature is subjective &mdash; it is child-centred, student centred. Deputy Higgins put forward a Big Brother centralised system &mdash; he may <Col N="1606" /> wish to correct me when he replies next week &mdash; that would involve continuous monitoring, preparation of reports and regulations.  The Bill lacks a humane approach.  In many respects it is quite insulting to the teaching profession and to the quality, style and substance of the education system, which is child oriented and personality centred.  In fact, it scarcely refers to the pupil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is attempting to steal much of the Minister's educational work in that he refers to the provision of a school psychological service.  Deputy Higgins knows that a pilot psychological service for primary schools was established in the Tallaght-Clondalkin area and in south Tipperary, involving about 28,000 pupils.  I supported and lobbied for that system and have no doubt, when evaluated, it will be expanded.</P>
    <P>Other issues in which he appears to have taken the lead from recent developments are the special emphasis on disadvantaged areas, to which I have already referred, and the parental involvement in management.  The Minister asked school management boards to ensure that parents' associations are formed.  Deputy Higgins also knows that, following the local elections vocational education committees were asked to ensure that parents and teachers were appointed to new vocational education committees.  I understand that there has been a good response to that request.</P>
    <P>The Minister places emphasis on the individual school and its significance within the educational process.  Management authorities must be given more autonomy to make decisions within certain parameters.  That trend is taking place worldwide.  I cannot understand why the Fine Gael Bill does not follow worldwide trends.</P>
    <P>Many of our schools are creative centres of activity but the Bill fails to recognise the creativity of teachers and their initiative.  If accepted, the provisions of the Bill would stifle initiatives being taken locally.  The Government's view is to unlock the energies within what is a bureaucratic centralised education system.  They are doing that, and I agree <Col N="1607" /> with that approach.  Unfortunately, the Bill adopts the opposite approach.  It adopts a very negative approach towards teachers; does not seem to appreciate the total commitment given by the vast majority of teachers; seems to distrust the profession; seems to consider that there is a need for constant surveillance and monitoring from Marlborough Street.  Such a policy would, I believe, have a serious effect on the morale of the profession, which has attracted high-quality people.  Irish teachers are held in high regard internationally.  I have found that to be so from any contact I had with people outside Ireland who are interested in education and observing our educational system.  Indeed, they have observed at first hand the ability of young Irish people working abroad who have come through the Irish education system. I have no doubt that that is accepted across party lines.</P>
    <P>Among other things, education is about building the confidence of young people.  That has been happening in Ireland and is evident abroad when one witnesses the confidence of many of our young people working away from home.  There is no doubt that they hold their own with people from around the world.  The system we have is evolving from the bottom upwards.  Fine Gael would seriously damage and reverse the process if they got their hands on the system operating from Marlborough Street and had the opportunity to put the Bill in place.</P>
    <P>Certain obvious needs have arisen within the system.  Deputy Higgins referred to that in his speech.  There is all-party agreement on the need for in-service training, although I consider the word &ldquo;retraining&rdquo; to be more appropriate. Any system needs constant renewal and to be refreshed.  Teachers, because of the nature of their profession, must be provided with such retraining.  I am very pleased that the Minister has made that commitment, which I hope will be part of the Education Bill.</P>
    <P>When talking about the process of rejuvenation and refreshing, I should like <Col N="1608" /> to mention the career break scheme, which has been referred to by Deputy O'Shea.  It has to be repeated that the career break option, which is, in effect, the process of giving teachers the option to leave the profession temporarily from one to five years, has been one of the most useful mechanisms for renewal and revitalisation.  It has been shown by surveys &mdash; and it is a well established fact &mdash; that stress and fatigue are very common complaints among the teaching profession. Indeed, many of my colleagues in the profession took career breaks and benefited in a very positive way in that it allowed them to &ldquo;recharge their batteries&rdquo;. Those who are critical of the length of teachers holidays should bear that in mind before criticising the teaching profession.  They should put themselves into the role of the teacher and consider how they would cope.  They should even drop down to their local school to see at first hand how concentrated is the role of the teacher and how skilful and prepared teachers have to be to carry out their responsibilities to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>There is no other job I know of that calls for more concentration or effort on the part of the mind and body than does teaching.  The career break option, allowing this chance of renewal, has given some teachers an opportunity to branch out into other careers.  That is something I welcome also because there were many teachers who had much to offer the teaching profession but who discovered that they needed some other outlet.  Let us face it, by their leaving the teaching profession they have created employment opportunities for others badly in need of jobs.</P>
    <P>There has been reference in the debate, and in this Bill, to the provision of support for interdenominational education. That is something I would support provided it comes from the bottom up and the demand exists within the community. It has been suggested in certain debates in Northern Ireland that if groups of Catholics and Protestants were integrated in the one school, taught within an interdenominational system, all of their <Col N="1609" /> problems would be eliminated.  I am convinced that that would not constitute a panacea for the ills of Northern Ireland. If such demand evolves locally it should be encouraged but we must remind ourselves that merely because a school may be Catholic or Protestant does not mean that it promotes hatred or division; on the contrary.</P>
    <P>Let us look at our national school curriculum, in particular at our religious course, which is one geared primarily at educating children on how to be good Christians, how to respect one's neighbour, one's environment and surroundings generally.  I am aware that a similar regime applies in Protestant schools in my constituency.  School systems evolve, expand and grow from a natural tradition and culture.  The Minister and Government provide grant aid to the local community who, in many ways, match that contribution resulting in a system that works.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate in some ways that one is seen to be conservative if one supports the existing educational system of Catholic, Protestant or other religious schools but progressive if one supports nondenominational or interdenominational schools because there is room for both.</P>
    <P>I might revert to the point I made earlier that such systems must evolve rather than be imposed.  If there is demand within a local community for non-denominational or interdenominational schools, then let us support their establishment just as successive Governments have supported the establishment of all-Irish schools following on community initiatives.  Any discussion on Northern Ireland suggesting that the imposition of a new, mixed educational system there would wipe out the hatred and bitterness is somewhat simplistic. That would be an unnatural way of stretching the limitations of the educational system in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must remember it is a political system that runs Northern Ireland, an administrative system which rules young people after they leave school and endeavour to get a job.  It is that system that must be overhauled.  If that political <Col N="1610" /> system was overhauled &mdash; and God knows we anxiously await some radical breakthrough in that connection &mdash; peace and stability would prevail in that troubled region.  Let us think of the potential for future generations if such were to happen.  I repeat that it is too simplistic to suggest that a mixed educational system would solve the ongoing problems and strife within Northern Ireland.  Rather it is the politicians who must take responsibility squarely on their shoulders.  Unless they act very soon they will not be thanked.  Indeed, rather will they be condemned by future generations for the intransigence and stagnation they have allowed to prevail.</P>
    <P>I must pay special tribute to RTE on the transmission of three recent educational programmes.  It was an excellent series which was a revelation, demonstrating clearly the priority afforded education in this country.  That message came across loud and clear, first, through the fact that the significant contributions of all those who participated in the programmes were of such a high standard and, second, the fact that the programmes attracted an audience of approximately half a million people.  That does not surprise me because Irish people are enormously interested in education and want to participate in its development and future.  They can be reassured from those programmes that our educational system is in safe hands.  It was evident that there was a consensus across the board on the part of the Minister, teachers, parents and experts that progress has been made over the years and that there were sound policies in place to deal with the challenges lying ahead. That series of programmes demonstrated clearly the value of public sector broadcasting. I would urge the Minister to ensure that the provision of a properly structured educational broadcasting service be included in the Education Act because the public have spoken on this matter.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Jim Higgins for allowing me, as somebody interested in education, to participate in this debate.  I have spelled out my reservations about <Col N="1611" /> the Bill but at least Deputy Higgins has afforded us this opportunity.  I would ask him to have a rethink on his approach.  I might suggest that the message from the Minister and this side of the House is that we want power given back to the people involved in education, which is the course we will pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. Like previous speakers I am somewhat disappointed at the Bill before us this evening because it constitutes queue-jumping. I know the commitment and interest of Deputy Jim Higgins, a Member of this House, for whom I have great regard.  Nevertheless it was well known that a Green Paper would be forthcoming very soon which would afford all of us an opportunity to participate in a positive manner in regard to the future of education in this country.</P>
      <P>The impact our educational system has on our young people is well known worldwide, its impact on each and every one of us, as is the contribution of Irish people worldwide arising directly from the educational system that has obtained here over many years.  On a recent visit to the United States I discussed this subject with many people, when the advantage Irish students and Irish people generally in America have in relation to employment opportunities was discussed, again occasioned by their participation in our system of education.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that all of us could not have got together and discussed this most important subject in a mature, positive way, involving all interests, particularly teachers, parents and the many other people within industry, commerce and so on, who play a most important part in relation to any educational changes contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute this evening to the job done by the Minister for Education and her Minister of State over the past four years in a very difficult climate, with scarce resources when they targeted areas most in need within our education system.  I want to refer particularly to <Col N="1612" /> funding for the special assistance schemes for schools in disadvantaged areas where there have been increases of 300 per cent granted since 1987 which, this year, are to be expanded to the home/school links programme, bringing that facility to a total of 80 schools.  I am aware also that arrangements are in train to extend the same facility to second level schools.  I represent an area where that assistance and those posts have played a major part in the improvement in the home/school links which have taken much pressure off teachers and staff generally in those schools.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy O'Shea refer last evening to discipline in schools, a major problem which warrants investigation. Again, the Minister, recognising the pressures on staff, has responded in a very positive manner.  Within the past three years some 325 additional teacher posts have been authorised for primary schools in disadvantaged areas and for remedial education.  These appointments arose through the Minister recognising the greatest need in the most sensitive areas of our community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pilot scheme of psychological services for primary schools I am delighted to note that there is such scheme in operation in west Tallaght and South Tipperary.  But I can assure the House I have already approached the Minister demanding that there be a third such pilot scheme initiated in my area, in Cork, which is much in need of that service.</P>
    <P>This year 325 teaching posts were authorised in order to reduce class sizes in primary schools.  From time to time we hear criticism of the Minister but the evidence is there now to show that she is concerned.  Many Opposition Deputies recognise this and have paid tribute to the Minister privately, sometimes, publicly, for the contribution she and the Minister of State have made in this area.</P>
    <P>Education is not to be played around with.  The Opposition are not being very positive in putting forward this Bill. There is an obligation and a responsibility on all of us to come together, employers, industry, teachers and parents.  More <Col N="1613" /> than ever, the community needs a united front in dealing with our many problems. Education is the central point of our future.  It is incumbent on us in this House to ensure that we play our part in relation to any changes that are necessary.  I have no doubt that if we co-operate we will play a major part in the development of our education system.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Higgins put forward this Bill.  I have some reservations but they are mainly concerned with what has been left out of the Bill.  I have practically no cribs about its contents.  It is an excellent guideline for establishing educational structures and deals with the functions of the Department managers, principals, teachers, parents, etc.  I support it for that reason.</P>
      <P>I also support the Bill because it may give a spur to the Minister for Education to make up her mind about the Green Paper which has been imminent for such a long time.  It was promised for the spring, for the summer and for the autumn.  It is now almost winter and the Green Paper has not been published.  It is to be followed by a White Paper and then an Education Bill.  All this could take four or five years.  The Minister is already in breach of the <i>Programme</i> for <i>Economic and Social Progress</i> which stated that the Green Paper would be issued by summer 1991.  We now believe it will not issue until Christmas or later. In reply to a question from me in February last the Minister stated that we would have the Green Paper by early summer and a White Paper by spring 1992.  I do not see that target being reached.  Deputy Higgins is quite right to force the pace and start the debate which the public obviously want.  It is already taking place throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main quibble relates to what is missing from the Bill.  It is a pity it is <Col N="1614" /> confined to primary and second level education and does not deal with third level or adult education.  The main factor missing is a philosophy of education.  A forthcoming Education Bill needs that more than anything else and it is a pity Deputy Higgins did not develop something of that nature.  In particular, I should like to have seen something about equality of opportunity and equality of schools.  I mention this because the Minister for Education has allowed a two-tier system of education to develop which is very similar to the two-tier system of health care and which, if not tackled now, will grow and become a permanent and acceptable feature of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked at length about her concern for the disadvantaged.  She mentions this in almost everything she says.  Throughout her four years in office the disadvantaged have become more disadvantaged.  Where did this word come from?  Who disadvantaged these people in the first place?  One would think it was due to an accident of birth that they are disadvantaged or handicapped in some way.  The disadvantage has been created by her Government in destroying jobs, not providing local community facilities and not building homes for people.  All these factors create deprivation which the Minister calls disadvantage. These areas of disadvantage must be addressed by a Government before we can have equality of education.</P>
    <P>Children in my constituency are going to school hungry and the teachers spend the first two hours warming them up and giving them something to eat before they can talk of educating them.  That is the real disadvantage which needs to be addressed by the Minister and her colleagues in Cabinet.  Saying what will be done for areas of disadvantage is not doing any good whatever.  The disadvantage is becoming worse and worse.</P>
    <P>Schools are not equal.  They have not the same environment, similar equipment or the same methods of dealing with children.  We have not a free primary education system, despite the fact that our Constitution lays down that primary education should be free.  The Minister <Col N="1615" /> does not adhere to that.  Every school has to provide for the maintenance of the school building.  Deputy Higgins's Bill refers to part or whole maintenance by the State.  The Bill should go for the complete maintenance of schools by the State.  Affluent areas can produce the money for all kinds of equipment needed in schools, whereas disadvantaged areas cannot.  In the latter areas one would be lucky to get £5 a year from the parents, while one can get £120 or more from parents in more affluent areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has practically stopped all school building.  In my constituency 1,200 children in the Cherry Orchard area have to wander over a two and a half mile radius through traffic-jammed streets to six different schools in order to get an education.  Like many thousands of children, they are going into classes of up to 40 children where there is no remedial teaching or psychological service and no guidance counsellors.</P>
    <P>Despite her great public performances the Minister is in fact the worst Minister for Education this country has had.  Certainly, many hundreds of thousands of children, and their parents, consider this to be the case.  She has ensured a worse educational opportunity for more children than any other Minister and that is what it comes down to at the end of the line.</P>
    <P>A public debate has commenced on the issue of private fee paying schools.  It has not commenced in this House as yet. Whether the State should give a grant sufficient to pay all the teachers in the private fee paying schools is a question that must be addressed.  That is what happens at present.  The grant for teachers is approximately 80 per cent of the total costs of running those schools so the taxpayer is funding them to the tune of 80 per cent of their costs.  As private fee paying schools they are restrictive.  There is no logic whatever in this because that does not happen in the primary area. Private fee paying primary schools get no grant for teachers or anything else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> In the debate I heard people say they sent their children to private fee paying schools because the schools are better, they give better education in some way, have a wider range of subjects and more extra-curricular activities.  If the money that is given to the private fee paying schools for teachers was given to the schools in the free education system, those schools would be able to have better educational services, would be able to have a wider range of subjects and more teachers.  Parents would not have to send their children to private fee paying schools.  We are depriving our schools in the free education system of proper facilities in order to provide money for the teachers in the private fee paying schools.  This has to be debated publicly and a decision taken on whether it is appropriate.  I hope the Minister will address it in her Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to demand that the Minister for Finance keep his hands off the educational section of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>. I would like the Minister to assure us now that the six year cycle promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will not be interfered with.  That will cost money.  Will the Minister for Finance say we have to put that off because we cannot afford it?  I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that the six year cycle at second level, as promised in the programme, will be delivered.  I ask the Minister also to assure us that the grants for caretakers in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will not be interfered with by the Minister for Finance and will go ahead.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with some of the issues which need to be addressed in an education Bill.  I am anxious to know what will happen to the 1930 Act which is the only education Act we have.  Does the Minister intend to introduce an education Bill which will wipe out the 1930 Act or will she include the 1930 Act, or sections of it, in her Bill?  The 1930 Act is one of the most enlightened Acts we have had.  It gave us an outstanding VEC <Col N="1617" /> service and the only area of democratisation and secularisation in the education system.  I hope that will be retained.  I am not too happy with the Minister's attitude in regard to the EC as illustrated in the colleges Bills she has produced for us.  That was dealt with by Deputy O'Shea and I do not intend to go into it.  However, we have had assurance that we will retain the best features of the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>The area of regionalisation of education, the local education authorities, needs to be dealt with.  What will their powers be?  One hopes that the local education authorities can be developed without destroying the authority of the vocational education committees.  They can fit very well togther.  There is a need for local education authorities, but not if they are to destroy the VECs.</P>
    <P>I dealt with equality of schools in free primary education.  If there is full maintenance of schools by the Department of Education there will be equality.  All schools will have the same equipment, environment and so on and, therefore, the teachers will have the same facilities in each school.  That is vital.  We have the best teachers.  If they have not got the equipment and have difficult children but do not have remedial teachers or a school psychological service, they cannot educate the children.  They are distracted at the moment trying to deal with such children. That needs to be dealt with in an education Bill.  Our philisophy is supposed to be cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  It is not in the Constitution but it is accepted by the people; everyone believes it is in the Constitution. The people accept it as one of the basic tenets of our society.  That must be shown in an education Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Higgins introduced this Bill.  I am not objecting to all the points in it apart from the provision in regard to conduct of pupils and discipline and where it refers to boards of management having the power to expel pupils.  That is fine but we must put in place some system to deal with pupils who are disruptive in school but who must <Col N="1618" /> be educated.  Many pupils are being expelled from schools and left wandering the streets with no place to go.  It is an issue that must be dealt with in an education Bill.  I will be bringing in a suitable amendment on Committee Stage of this Bill and I hope the issue will be dealt with in the famous Green Paper, if it is ever issued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to congratulate and compliment Deputy Higgins on bringing forward this historic legislation.  It is the first education Bill every introduced.</P>
      <P>However, I was very disappointed with the Minister's reaction to it last night.  It was as if somebody had stolen her thunder for once.  She had not the generosity or the grace to accept that.  The Minister should recognise the effort and time Deputy Higgins put into producing this historical Bill.  Whether the Fianna Fáil Members agree with it or not they must accept that it is of the highest quality.</P>
      <P>The Minister and two Deputies pointed out that no consultation took place when drawing up this Bill.  I should like to point out to both the Minister and those Deputies that there was widespread consultation with the people who matter most, the people who are working at the coal-face, the teachers.  Before the Bill was framed hundreds of teachers, experts in their fields, were consulted.  That should put to rest that argument about the quality and substance of the Bill. I found the Minister's comments both erroneous and insulting to Deputy Higgins. This was most untypical of her general conduct in this House.  I regret that she resorted to such tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask ourselves why we need an education Act at this time.  An education Act is required at this stage for a number of reasons.  It is necessary to determine the role and rights of the various participants in education, parents, pupils, teachers, the Department of Education, the Minister for Education, the boards of management, etc.  An education Act would clarify many or all the issues about which doubts have been expressed, for example, the concern that Ministers and <Col N="1619" /> the Department may have been acting <i>ultra vires</i>.  This concern has also given rise to questions about Carysfort College. No Minister ever had the power to introduce corporal punishment in our schools.  We need to clear up these doubts in the debate on this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is also important that changes proposed by the Department and the Minister are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Accountability is a basic democratic principle.  The question I want to ask is: are the Minister, the Department and the education service in general accountable under existing arrangements?  Under section 19 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, the Minister was required by law to present an annual report to the Oireachtas.  This continued according to correct procedure until 1963-64 when the last annual report on primary education was laid before the Oireachtas.  Primary education is a human right and should be protected by legislation.  It should not depend on the whim of the Minister or Government of the day.  The Bill proposed by Fine Gael and Deputy Higgins has taken these principles on board.</P>
    <P>Various arguments have been put forward against the adoption of an education Act.  Some commentators say that such an Act is not necessary because the system works well in the absence of legislation and has demonstrated its capacity to evolve in the absence of a legislative framework.  Fine Gael are not convinced by these arguments for maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  This is why we put forward this Bill.  Other arguments have been put forward in favour of an education Act.  All our EC partners and most developed countries have such an Act.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House because it does two things: it embodies constitutional principles in positive law, tidies up previous legislation and establishes clearly the roles and functions of the various participants in the education process.  Articles 42.2, 42.4 and 44.6 are the main Articles of our Constitution dealing with education.  These Articles identify the family as the primary <Col N="1620" /> educators.  They state that parents may provide education in their own homes, that the State shall not oblige parents to send their children to schools established by the State or any particular type of school and that the State guarantees that each individual will receive a certain minimum education.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Bill addresses the issue of minimum standards explicitly as provided for in section 5 (2) (a) of this Bill. Article 42.4 states: &ldquo;The State shall provide for free primary education and shall endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative ...&rdquo;.  This constitutional provision is very important and should be considered in the context of the current debate on funding private schools.  The Constitution also provides for the funding of private schools.  Article 44.2.4º provides that &ldquo;Legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate between schools under the management of different religious denominations...&rdquo;.  The Fine Gael Bill recognises the denominational nature of Irish education.  Article 44.2.6º provides that: &ldquo;The property of any religious denomination ... shall not be diverted ...&rdquo;.  This is an important issue in terms of rationalisation and in the context of the Ministers vision of new secondary schools.  Several schools run by religious orders may be reluctant to come into any system.  Our Constitution protects those people.  This Bill recognises the constitutional imperatives and endeavours to translate them, where appropriate, into a sound, rational, legislative and operational framework.</P>
    <P>There has never been an education Act placed before the Oireachtas or its predecessor and, to that extent, this is an historic occasion.  Of course, there are many Acts pertaining to the education system in existence.  We should note these because they are important and were seminal in the evolution and development of the Irish education service. In terms of the debate here tonight, the most important legislation in this area would be the Intermediate Education Act, 1878, which was amended in 1914 <Col N="1621" /> and amended further in 1924; the School Attendance Act, 1926, amended in 1972, the Teachers' Registration Council for Secondary Schools, 1918, the Vocational Education Act, 1930, and the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  It is important to point out that most of these Acts were introduced by the Cumann na nGael Government of the thirties.  Fianna Fáil have a very poor record in bringing forward legislation in the education area.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises the important contribution these various Acts have made in the evolution of the Irish education system.  It does not attempt to undermine those aspects which are valuable and have an ongoing contribution to make. Rather, it takes on board those aspects which are abiding and updates those which require updating.  It also provides a legislative umbrella for those activities and functions which had not received previous legislative imprimatur.</P>
    <P>When we analyse this Bill we can look at it from the perspective of the contents of education Acts in other jurisdictions, particularly those of EC countries. The Bill takes on board all that is most valuable, all that has a proven track record, while at the same time it is sensitive to cultural and constitutional issues pertinent to the Irish situation.  On the other hand, it avoids the heavy handed legislative approach adopted by our near neighbours which effectively emasculated and destroyed morale in the teaching profession.  The Minister referred to the British Education Act last night.  I agree with what she said in relation to that Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill confronts and deals in an even handed and responsible manner with the issue of teacher accountability and performance. I should like to analyse it in the somewhat wider context of social policy generally.  In doing this I am reminded of the important contribution Professor Whitmore made in 1984 in establishing a framework for the development and implementation of social policy.  In his work he identified six major planks of social legislation, six criteria of effective policy development and implementation. If we apply these six criteria to this Bill <Col N="1622" /> how does it measure up?  He identifies the following: first, the core dimension, that is, the issue of education in a democracy. The Bill addresses this issue clearly and effectively; second, the policy paradigm, that is, the way the problem and solutions to the problem are defined and, the problems and solutions to the various problems are addressed in a balanced, mature fashion in this Bill; third, the monitoring framework, that is, the policy in the sense of Acts of Parliament, statutory instruments, regulations, circulars, etc.  This issue is confronted and built into the Fine Gael Bill; fourth, the inter-organisation resource dependencies &mdash; basically this is the relationship between central and local government or local management of schools.  This issue is recognised and addressed; fifth, the administration structures and processes &mdash; this is the channel through which policies are formulated and carried out. These are clearly specified and provided for in the Fine Gael Bill; sixth, Whitmore refers to the professional interface with the consumer.  This is how policy is carried out at field-worker and client level. This issue is confronted honestly and properly in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill meets these criteria.  It stands not merely as an historic document but a document that has the potential to revitalise the education service.  I strongly recommend the Bill to the House and hope the Government will change their attitude towards it.</P>

      <P>It has been established in the relations between human beings that there is only one thing worse than under-regulation and that is over-regulation. That is the fundamental fault with Deputy Higgins's Bill.  The provisions of the Bill would mean far too great an intrusion into the school system, the manner in which teachers behave in their professional capacity, the manner <Col N="1623" /> in which principals run their schools and the manner in which the general atmosphere is created in the classroom.  The Minister for Education has established &mdash; if it required to be established &mdash; that the way forward is by way of consultation, not by centralisation and of collaboration, not confrontation.  There are several examples of how the Minister has sought to achieve these aspirations over the past number of years.  As has already been stated, she set up the Primary Review Body, the Primary Curriculum Review Body and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. In addition, there have been informal meetings and arrangements with school managements, teachers, principals, etc., and with people in charge of universities over the last number of years.  To be fair to the Minister, she has succeeded in her objectives in this regard.</P>
      <P>If this Bill were to become law it would mean that there would be a curriculum review every ten years.  It would not matter if during those ten years the situation changed because of world or European events, and there might be a need to change the curriculum.  The regulation would be rigid and would state that the curriculum would be reviewed every ten years.  However, it would not be possible to adapt the curriculum to changing circumstances and demands and this would lead to a very rigid curriculum. This could not be countenanced in a very fast changing world.</P>
      <P>A teacher's licence is referred to in the Bill.  A teacher would be obliged to have a licence to teach.  This almost smacks of somebody requiring a driver's licence. One almost wonders if the next subsection will state that for a given offence, the licence will be endorsed; it does not go that far but states that the licence may be terminated.  That is an example of the rigidity of the provisions of the Bill: the over-intrusion into the classroom and into the education atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill goes further, becomes pontifical and states that the code of conduct for children will be (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).  The human spirit for the most part <Col N="1624" /> would normally be well aware of what kind of conduct would and would not be appropriate.  Any teacher worth his or her salt would be in a position to identify whether a code of conduct was proper or improper.  If it were otherwise then the natural law would be turned on its head and mankind would be without a free will, which seems to be a suggestion when one sets out that the code of conduct in a classroom will be regulated by statute. I do not think, and do not think anybody else honestly believes, that is the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>In section 14 the principal of the schools is told &mdash; as if he or she had never been a teacher or had arrived from Mars &mdash; what they will do in relation to their position and they will behave in the manner of X, Y and Z.  It ignores completely the certainty that we are in a position to depend on our school principals to recognise human values, to enforce them, to be flexible and to understand that one has to be human in one's dealings with children.  The Bill ignores the fact that one should be human in one's dealings with children.</P>
    <P>In short, the Bill would bring into the education arena a policing system built on a distrust of principals and teachers and of the ordinary behaviour of the children in our schools Deputy Deenihan said the Bill was historic, that it was the first time an Education Bill had been introduced in the House.  Deputy Deenihan knows very well &mdash; and it has been well publicised &mdash; that the Minister for Education was to publish a Green Paper on education which, following consultation and collaboration with all involved, would ultimatley end in an education Bill.  Far from being an historic occasion, it is a prehistoric occasion.  It pre-empts the Green Paper to a large extent and does so in a way that one should not proceed in educational matters.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised that in a very important Bill dealing with the education sector there does not appear to be a reference &mdash; unless I have misread it &mdash; to the present higher education grants system.  That is rather surprising.  The proposals in the review of Government will bring about welcome changes in this area.  The question of grants for mature students will be addressed. It is understood that regard will not be had to whether such students had the academic qualification following their leaving certificate to get into university, and their financial situation will be looked at in the sense of that being to their benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must address the situation where a family has one or more children to go into the third level system.  The vast majority of people with one child in third level education and who are denied a higher education grant often find it crippling or impossible to send a second or a third child to university.  However able <Col N="1626" /> the younger members of the family may be, they are disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> the first or second child of the family.  This is fundamentally wrong and puts pressure on family life.  If we are to cherish families each child in each family must have an equal opportunity.</P>
    <P>Income limits should be changed and incomes assessed on the basis of the year of entry into third level education. We should have complete equity and transparency in the system of higher education grants.  I strongly advocate the removal of the gross income requirement and its replacement with a net income requirement.  Under the present system people are denied higher education grants although it is quite clear that their parents are not in a position to pay for their third level education.</P>
    <P>Equality of access to education for disadvantaged children will have to be addressed in the White Paper.  The situation of people who, through no fault of theirs are disadvantaged in learning, will have to be looked at.  The position of severely mentally handicapped children and mildly handicapped children should be looked at.  For too long we have failed to provide adequate accommodation for adult mentally handicapped people.  Bad as we have been in providing accommodation for adult mentally handicapped people, our record in relation to educating handicapped children has been appalling.  I hope that, in the context of the White Paper, the Green Paper and the coming education Bill, account will be taken of this section of our society. Any person whether mentally handicapped or not gains from being educated. I hope mentally handicapped people will be treated in the coming Green Paper with the dignity and respect they deserve as human beings.</P>
    <P>We must seriously look at the price of school books.  The Minister has increased the amount available for this purpose to £4 million, a welcome initiative.  However, books continue to become more expensive.  The changing curriculum places greater strain on families in relation to buying more books.  The Green Paper will have to address how we <Col N="1627" /> can come to terms with the escalating cost of school books and how we can draft the curriculum to ensure that there will not be unnecessary changes resulting in the unnecessary purchase of books.</P>
    <P>The points race is perhaps the greatest cause of strain on students, bringing much distress to many young people.  It is difficult to formulate a system of entry into third level education without having regard to academic achievement but a more rounded syllabus would result in the influence of the points system being somewhat lessened.  We will have to take a fundamental look at this.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be extremely proud of her contribution to adult education. She has been responsible for Youthreach and for many schemes in vocational schools throughout the country to give opportunities to both adults and young people who left school prematurely. The Minister can also be extremely proud of her performance in the area of third level education.  The university expansion scheme will ensure 3,600 additional places.  Today we collaborate with industry in research and development and 40 per cent of the relevant age group are now entering third level education compared with 25 per cent in 1986.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla in a remarkable contribution suggested that we had a two tier education system and that the Minister was the worst Minister for Education we had ever had.  The most significant thing about Deputy Mac Giolla's remarks is that nobody agrees with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The findings of the Court of Inquiry regarding the sinking of the trawler off the Isle of Arran have serious implications for the Irish fishing fleet operating out of Irish ports and working fishing grounds in the Irish Sea. There is now an urgent need for the <Col N="1629" /> Government, in particular the Ministers for the Marine and Foreign Affairs, to demand that all underwater exercises in the Irish Sea by whatever navy, be it the United States, Britain or the Soviet Union, cease forthwith.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sea has been a victim of the nuclear arms race at sea and the Labour Party hope that with the nuclear disarmament proposals now on the international agenda nuclear submarines in our seas will be a thing of the past.  There have been too many indicents, too many near misses and too many lives have been lost.  Irish fishermen going about their lawful pursuits of making a living are in serious danger due to the cavalier attitude of naval forces using these busy fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>There is no reason these exercises by nuclear submarines should not take place in the Atlantic where there is no congestion of fishing boats or busy cross channel traffic.  The Labour Party believe that all nuclear submarines should not be allowed access to the Irish Sea.  However, the use of the Irish Sea has been well chronicled in other places.  As a safeguard, the Labour Party propose that the Minister for the Marine, through the International Maritime Organisation, should demand that all submarines travelling in the Irish Sea must travel on the surface.  Second, all submarine movements should be notified to all other vessels operating on this stretch of sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are only a few precautions and must not be seen as solutions but a streamlining of the notification procedures which could save lives, Irish, English, Scottish and Welsh lives.  The Labour Party demand that the Irish Sea be given back to civilians and closed to war games.  The fishing community in carrying out their daily task already face insurmountable difficulties.  Why should they be subjected to this further danger and fear of being snagged by underwater craft?  It would appear that the incident which cost the lives of four fishermen was treated with contempt at the time by those in command of the nuclear submarine, <i>HMS Trenchant</i> and the findings by the sheriff in the inquiry are a damning <Col N="1630" /> indictment of the naval command structure at present operated by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Protests have been made before, obviously without success.  The findings of the court of inquiry proved this.  There is now an urgent need for stronger action and this matter must be discussed and acted on at European and United Nations level.  Irish people must be protected when going about their lawful duties in Irish and international waters.  It would appear that naval forces using the Irish Sea are a law unto themselves and the reluctance of the British Navy in this instance to come to the aid of the fishermen must be condemned.  The fact that these unfortunate fishermen were not Irish nationals is of no consequence in the circumstances.  I ask the Minister to indicate the steps he proposes to take to see that the incidents once and for all come to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised this very important matter.  Deputies will recall that I expressed my concern over the dangers posed by submarines to fishing vessels on many occasions not least when I was Minister for Transport and when the <i>Sheralga</i> was sunk.  As Minister with responsibility for safety of life at sea as well as for the development of the fishing industry I am especially concerned at anything which endangers the lives of fishermen at sea.  During the past ten years there have been a number of suspected incidents involving contact between fishing vessels and submarines. In two cases it has been established that submarines were involved in incidents with Irish registered vessels.  Fishermen in the Irish Sea and elsewhere are entitled to the highest safety standards.  To this end the Government and my Department are doing everything possible to focus attention on the problem so as to ensure that the risk of such accidents is minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are seriously concerned about the dangers submarines pose to shipping.  We avail of every <Col N="1631" /> opportunity to raise this topic in international fora, the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation, for example.  In 1985, the Government requested the Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO to use their expertise to review the matter and to see if there might be some practical means of dealing with the problem.  An examination by the committee resulted in the unanimous adoption on 17 November 1987 by the General Assembly of the IMO of a resolution entitled, &ldquo;Avoidance by Submerged Submarines of Fishing Vessels and their Fishing Gear&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This resolution focused much attention on the problem and has made some contribution to the avoidance of incidents involving surface vessels and submerged submarines at sea.  Nevertheless disturbing incidents continue to arise and cause the gravest concern for the safety of life at sea in areas around our coasts. With this in mind the matter was raised by Ireland at the Fifty-Ninth Session of the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee held earlier this year in London &mdash; it will be raised again at the IMO General Assembly next week.  At that meeting my Department's chief surveyer will raise again the Government's continuing concern at this problem and will invite the General Assembly, the highest level of the IMO, to ask their Governments to make safety the priority in this area so as to avoid a major tragedy.</P>
    <P>The General Assembly will also be invited by Ireland to adopt a new resolution on the matter.  The purpose of the resolution will be two-fold, first, to ensure that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its fishing gear is available, will avoid that fishing vessel and any fishing gear connected to it and, second, to ensure the information on submarines exercising in an area where vessels are known to fish is brought to the attention of the fishing vessels concerned.</P>
    <P>On another front the Secretary of my Department has at my discretion been in contact with the fisheries administrations of the various powers which are believed <Col N="1632" /> may navigate in submarines in Irish fishing waters asking that their administrations be alerted to the risks to fishery and other vessels and that close consultation be maintained between administrations regarding information and practice in those countries.  The countries concerned are the United Kingdom, France, the United States of America and the USSR.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, due to the changing political scene there seems to be a strong reason that submarines should not ply in those waters in the future.  These steps and concern for their own and other fishermen should persuade those countries to take measures to improve the situation.  My Department are maintaining contact with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the United Kingdom to give effect to our objectives.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed my concern at the tragic incident involving a Scottish fishing vessel, <i>Antares,</i> in the Firth of Clyde on 22 November last in which four fishermen lost their lives.  Following the incident the UK authorities instituted a number of inquiries into the casualty to the <i>Antares</i>.  One of these was a fatal accident inquiry undertaken under Scottish law and its report was published yesterday. This report which is, as I understand it, the broad equivalent of the verdict of a Coroner's Court will be studied by officials of my Department and its recommendations will be followed up, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The other investigation which is underway is an inspector's inquiry undertaken by the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch.  The report of the MAIB inspector has not yet been finalised and when this has been done it will be submitted to the Secretary of State for Transport in the United Kingdom and will be published. This report would be expected in a number of months time and its findings will be carefully examined by my Department and myself to see if its recommendations would have any application here.</P>
    <P>Following the <i>Antares</i> casualty the United Kingdom authorities began to broadcast information regarding dived <Col N="1633" /> submarine activity in the Firth of Clyde area &mdash; as the House is aware, the <i>Antares</i> was off the Isle of Arran &mdash; and more recently in the wider Clyde exercise areas.  This information is available on VHF radio to all Irish seafarers using a VHF receiver.</P>
    <P>My Department are taking action on all fronts available to them to do everything possible to minimise the danger posed by submarine traffic to the Irish fishing fleet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue I raise this evening arises from national publicity, particularly the leading front page article in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of last Sunday, detailing the existence in private hands of a collection of archaeological artefacts and finds, all it seems gleaned by illegal digs assisted by metal detectors on various sites, many of them listed as protected archaeological sites located all over the country.</P>
      <P>The story published at the weekend, while it reveals the most undesirable practice, might have a positive effect in that it may get the Government to act in an area scandalously overlooked and neglected for many years &mdash; the protection of our national archaeological sites and historic heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear stories almost every week of metal detecting and the removal of artefacts from field monuments and sites but this piece of investigative journalism is one of the first instances where hard evidence and proof have been brought forward to show how widespread and extensive is the practice as it has exposed a private collection of national treasures which were found all over the country. The seeking and hoarding of these items is totally against the law and this law has been confirmed and upheld by the Supreme Court.  Many Members of this House &mdash; including myself if I may be so indulgent in saying so &mdash; have been raising these issues here for years but we have always had the same answers from <Col N="1634" /> various Ministers, denying that the practice is widespread or simply denying that the practice exists.</P>
    <P>The reports suggest that the hoard contains at least 12 items of major significance. I will mention only a few because of the time constraint: the Lough Kinale Chalice and Paten is a unique 8th or 9th century travelling chalice and was found by treasure hunters operating illegally at Lough Kinale, County Longford, in 1983.  This item was later sold to the Price Collection.  It contains the Clooneenbane Bucket which is an early Christian, possibly 7th century, monastic vessel in bronze.  This was found on a site at Clooneenbane about five miles from Roscommon town in my constituency.  This item found its way into the collection but, amazingly, it appears it was accepted on loan by the National Museum from the collection and, as far as I know, remains on loan to the National Museum.  Will the Minister explain how this happened and give reasons for the Government not declaring the item State property?</P>
    <P>Another item in the Price Collection is the Meath Crucifixion Plaque which is a priceless 8th century bronze artefact from a monastic site in County Meath.  I gather it is the only piece of its kind in private hands in this country, indeed in the world.  I will mention one other item reputedly in the hoard, a 7th century bronze decorated cross.  Its centre is jewel-mounted with what looks like lapis lazuli.  If the mounting is lapis lazuli &mdash; and we cannot know this unless the item is surrendered for proper examination &mdash; it is a unique and priceless piece since this kind of decoration has been up to now completely unknown in early Irish Christian art.</P>
    <P>Everybody condemns this kind of illegal treasure troving and the putting together in these collections of what amounts to the priceless inheritance which belongs to all of us.  The people who do it defend themselves by saying there are loopholes in the law which, while they do not make their activities right, nevertheless are not illegal and they might have a point.  However, I <Col N="1635" /> believe that our national monuments legislation is, on balance, strong and comprehensive enough to protect our national sites and heritage.  However, the enforcement of the law is a laugh primarily because there is nobody to enforce it.  That is where the Minister stands condemned.</P>
    <P>The enforcements are so primitive that they remind me of the African state of Benin, a small country, which had in the 11th century a magnificent mediaeval civilisation, albeit a small confined one. The civilisation manifested itself in magnificent bronze articles and jewelled art work.  It was plundered and taken all over the world.  It is now in private collections and hardly a single item of it exists in Benin today.  There was a law to stop that from happening but it happened because there was no enforcement of the law.  Our country, sadly, has a close analogy to that situation which took place 140 years ago in what we might be inclined to call a primitive and small African country.</P>
    <P>I want to give one more instance of a processional cross which was found in County Roscommon about four years ago.  It was taken out of the country and offered to the Getty Museum in California. I understand at that stage the National Museum were informed about it but, to this day, they have not found a trace of this priceless object.  I urge the Minister to act.</P>

      <P>I note from the article in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 20 October 1991 that it is alleged that archaeological objects have been removed from archaeological sites in contravention of the National Monuments Acts.  Following consultation with my officials in the National Parks and Historic Properties Division of the Office of Public Works, who in turn consulted the National Museum, I asked the Garda Commissioner to investigate this allegation and, until I have received his report, I do not propose to make any comment on the specific matters mentioned in the <Col N="1636" /> newspaper article.  The ownership of items will form part of the investigation. I would like to put on record, however, that in any case of illegal exploitation of our archaeological heritage, which is brought to my attention, I will insist that the laws be enforced with full vigour.  Our National Monuments Acts of 1930, as amended in 1954 and 1987, are among the most enlightened legislation in Europe. The 1930 Act explicitly prohibited digging &ldquo;for the purpose of searching generally for archaeological objects&rdquo; while the 1987 Act, in particular, strengthened the State's position regarding the protection of our heritage by providing for penalties of up to £50,000 and/or 12 months' imprisonment.  Another important provision was the prohibition of the use of metal detectors to search for archaeological objects anywhere in the State or even to be in possession of such a device at the site of a registered national monument.  Successful prosecutions have been brought under these Acts for the illicit removal of artefacts or interference with sites.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House of my determination to protect our archaeological heritage by the use of every means available.</P>
      <P>I hope that the investigation which we initiated will be concluded as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Curragh Camp (Kildare) Abattoir.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this issue.</P>
      <P>It is reported that two potential operators have expressed an interest in securing a lease on the abattoir in the Curragh Camp in order to restart slaughtering operations there.  The proposed scale of operation is said to be some 40 cattle per day, or 200 per week.</P>
      <P>This abattoir was constructed in the last century for military needs only. When last in use, it supplied meat to the Curragh Camp and to the installations in Kildare town.  The kill level was very low &mdash; only a tiny fraction of what is now proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> It is totally unsuitable on physical, health, environmental and amenity grounds for the proposed use, it is too small.  It has not got an effluent disposal system to cope with the proposed kill level.</P>
    <P>It is located in close proximity to residential areas in the Curragh Camp.  It is close to the schools in the camp, to St. Anne's special school, to the Drogheda Memorial Hospital and to Athgarvan national school.  The public health implications of the proposed operation are appalling.</P>
    <P>The installation is right beside the golf course and a stone's throw from Donnelly's Hollow, one of the most famous spots on the Curragh.  It is right in the heart of an unspoiled amenity area, which is the resort of thousands, not only from the county of Kildare but from further afield.  The whole area should be preserved and developed as an amenity rather than have unwanted commercial operations imposed on it.</P>
    <P>There is no need for an abattoir in the area.  There is more than adequate slaughtering capacity within easy reach of the area to cater for the domestic meat trade.  In any case there can be no question of that abattoir being used for the export meat trade.</P>
    <P>The installation in question is the property of the Minister for Defence and no operations can take place in it without his consent.  Nobody in the area wants or supports the proposed development.  On the contrary, local residents and all other local interests are unanimously opposed to the idea.  I, therefore, call on the Minister for Defence to state unambiguously and unequivocally that no development or operations of the kind proposed will be sanctioned in that place on the Curragh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Daly) Minister for Defence (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Dukes has afforded me the opportunity of replying to this question on the Adjournment.  As he has rightly said, the abattoir in the Curragh had been used for many years to slaughter cattle for the provision of beef to the Curragh Command &mdash; this included areas in <Col N="1638" /> Kilkenny and Naas in Kildare.  In 1988 following a review of the operation of the abattoir it was considered to be more cost effective to arrange for the supply of beef on contract to the Command.  Accordingly it was decided to close the abattoir for slaughtering purposes.  At that time roughly seven or eight animals were slaughtered per week.  As I have said, because it was found to be more cost effective to contract the beef supply, the whole system was changed in 1988-89. Slaughtering there ceased from 31 May 1989.  Since then, as the beef was supplied on contract, the premises was used only for storage, for cutting up beef sides and for distribution of the beef within the Curragh Command generally.</P>
      <P>Proposals have been received in my Department relating to leasing the facilities at the Curragh for commercial purposes. I might add that we did not seek these proposals.  The first proposal was subsequently withdrawn and quite recently we received another inquiry.  At this stage I could not say that they are firm proposals; they are mainly inquiries from people who would be interested in using the facility if it were made available for commercial purposes.  The Department have had a number of discussions on the proposals but no decisions have been taken.  The suitability of the premises for slaughtering on a commercial scale is just one aspect of the matter.  Of major importance would be the environmental impact generally of such an operation in the Curragh area and this would have to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I received representations this afternoon from my two colleagues, Deputy Charlie McCreevy and Deputy Seán Power.  I understand that a meeting took place last night at which all the Deputies were represented and at which local opposition was expressed to any proposal to undertake commercial operations in this premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware that this is a high amenity area.  I am also aware of its proximity, as Deputy Dukes has said, to schools, housing and hospitals.  I am aware that when the premises was used prior to its closure, there were effluent <Col N="1639" /> problems there.  All these matters, including the scale of use and the operation that might be undertaken there, would have to be taken into account and fully considered before any decisions could be made in that regard.  Finally, I am aware of the concern of the interests in the area.  I assure the Deputies that the Department will give the most careful consideration to the views put forward here tonight and that no decision will be taken on this matter without the fullest evaluation of any proposals and objections thereto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the budget speech in January 1991 it was announced that a plan for social housing would be later put forward by the Minister for the Environment.  Subsequent to that the Government Information Service issued a statement entitled <i>Flynn's Plan for Social Housing</i> which set out the apparatus within which it was proposed to provide 1,500 housing units nationwide through a social housing plan, part of which incorporated what has become known as a share ownership scheme.  This <Col N="1640" /> scheme has operated very effectively in several other European countries and in the UK and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following repeated questions and promptings to the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment before the summer recess, the Minister for the Environment gave an undertaking that a pilot scheme would be put into operation which would enable applicants throughout the country to apply for loans under this scheme, that the local authority would be empowered to process and approve those loans and that everything necessary would be done to ensure that that would happen.  Since then nothing has happened.  Numerous local authorities have had applications on hands for months and, except in very limited circumstances, have not been able to give approval.  In Kildare County Council out of 50 applications we have managed to approve only eight and none has been paid so far.  Again despite numerous promptings, questions and pleadings to the Minister from several local authorities, including Kildare County Council, nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>We were promised earlier in the summer that following the recess the legislation would be put in place which would allow the scheme to be put into operation immediately.  My grievance at this stage is that too much of the year has now elapsed for any worthwhile impact to be made under the social housing programme. <i>Flynn's plan for Social Housing</i> is not a plan any longer.  It has failed miserably.  It has misled local authorities, estate agents and those involved in selling houses.  It has misled local authorities to the extent that nothing will happen in the current year.  It is a total farce.</P>

      <P>The plan for social housing made it clear that some of the new schemes would require legislation but it promised that, where possible, they would be implemented on an interim basis.  The shared ownership system has attracted a high level of interest.  Local authorities are free to <Col N="1641" /> operate the system on this basis and there is provision for dealing with 1,000 houses under the pilot programme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Waterford Regional Airport has been developed over the past ten years at considerable cost to the taxpayer and has also been heavily subsidised by contributions from the local business community.  The total investment runs into several million pounds.  The development has, however, been quite unbalanced because the road leading from the airport to the city is little more than a cart track and, despite repeated requests no moneys have been forthcoming from the Government to ensure that a reasonably good road is provided.</P>
      <P>People's first impressions of any town or city are often formed by the surroundings they first view.  Travelling along what is little more than a boreen with a corkscrew profile does not enhance the impression of any visiting dignitary or tourist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> The distance involved is merely three kilometers of very inferior roads, of which two kilometers are located in the county council area and one is in the city area.  A year ago Waterford County Council and Waterford Corporation made a joint submission which was examined by an inspector from the Department of the Environment who carried out a CPO inquiry.  No findings have been issued as a result of that inquiry and no progress can be made with the upgrading of that road until the findings of the inquiry are published.  I ask the Minister here tonight to see to it that the findings of the inquiry are made public and that moneys are made available to the city and county to ensure that a proper roadway is constructed between the airport and the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the road in question from Waterford city to the airport is not a national road responsibility for its maintenance and improvement rests with Waterford Corporation and Waterford County Council.  The cost of any works on non-national roads falls to be financed from the local authority's own resources, supplemented by the discretionaary grants provided annually by my Department.  These discretionary grants give local authorities a greater say in the works they wish to carry out.</P>
      <P>The county council's discretionary grant has risen from £607,000 in 1986 to £1,733,000 in 1991.  The corporation's block grant has increased from £149,000 in 1986 to £193,000 in 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister for Health to make a statement as soon as possible on the drug, Halcion, which in recent weeks has given rise to great concern among the medical profession.  Halcion, which contains benzodiazepine, is a hypnotic compound which can be administered for short term and intermittent use to patients with recurring insomnia and poor sleeping patterns.  It is available in Ireland on prescription.  The UK have withdrawn the drug already and will have a full hearing on its use in December.  In Germany, although it is still available in pharmacies, the licence to manufacture has been suspended pending investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many worrying side effects such as hallucinations, personality changes and depression are being reported and doubts have been cast on the authenticity of clinical trials of this drug by the firm <Col N="1644" /> Upjohn in a recent &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board are currently examining recent documentation on the product and hope to have a result on their deliberations by 7 November 1991.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister should recommend to hospitals and GPs to use extreme caution before prescribing this drug as there are many other suitable similar products available on the market until such time as all current investigations are completed and the drug has been declared safe for use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns being expressed recently with regard to the drug Halcion and I have been in close contact with the National Drugs Advisory Board which maintain on-going monitoring of the drug and, indeed, of all benzodiazepine drugs of this class which are available on the Irish market.  The board, in fact, reviewed this drug in the week preceding the announcement of its suspension in the United Kingdom on 2 October.  It did not conclude that the product should be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>This drug has been available in Ireland since 1979.  It is a prescription only medicine and its use is, therefore, subject to medical supervision.  It is recommended for short term use only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the decision of the United Kingdom licensing authorities, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products of the European Communities, which include representatives from the National Drugs Advisory Board, met to consider the position on 16 October.  A position statement was issued which indicated, <i>inter alia,</i> that upon preliminary consideration of the available data, evidence of new risks at recommended doses did not seem to be available.  However, given the large volume of information produced to the committee, it was decided that a full review of all the available data and information from pharmacovigilance should be undertaken. The committee will formulate their <Col N="1645" /> opinion in December 1991, taking into account this full review.</P>
    <P>At this point I should say that the drug has not been withdrawn by the Food and Drugs Administration in the United States, as may have been suggested by Deputy Owen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

Pending the receipt of the opinion of the CPMP and subject to any advice in the meantime from the National Drugs Advisory Board, I do not propose to take any action modifying the current authorisation of this product.</P>
      <P>However, I would re-emphasise that this drug is intended for short term use only.  In accordance with the most recent advice of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, it should not be used for more than two to three weeks and treatment thereafter requires a complete re-evaluation of the therapy.  Patients in any doubt should consult their medical practitioners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Much ado has been made by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition with regard to their new agreement for Government.  However, the decision to postpone the construction of the new hospital in Tallaght is a disgrace considering the urgent need for an actute facility for the people of that area. Not one mention was made of the construction of the Tallaght Hospital in that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site development was initiated in the mid-eighties to provide essential hospital services for the 150,000 Dublin citizens in Tallaght and surrounding districts.  In the 1991 health capital programme there was no provision for the Tallaght Hospital.  However, since 1982, when the project was originally <Col N="1646" /> approved, £8.7 million has been spent on the development of the hospital.  The board responsible for the project has met on 104 occasions.</P>
    <P>Despite that, it is now clear that the Government may have no intention of proceeding with the project, which leaves the people of Dublin South West and the west side of Dublin city and county entirely without basic health care facilities. Cork, an area of comparable population, has many hospitals, but Tallaght has an £8 million hole in the ground.</P>
    <P>The ultimate irony is that Dublin South West has been given a junior Minister and a &ldquo;Minister for Clean Air,&rdquo; both of whom have failed absolutely to secure any priority for the project.  In fact, it seems as if the more political perks are applied to Dublin South West the fewer essential basic facilities are available for the people who live there.</P>
    <P>Everyone in Tallaght &mdash; but especially the women of the community &mdash; have suffered in the light of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government decision not to proceed with the Tallaght Hospital now.</P>
    <P>In our society it is the women who are the carers of the elderly and the handicapped; it is women who look after their children when they are ill.  The women of Tallaght are burdened by the lack of an acute hospital service.  In order to receive hospital treatment they are forced to take two bus journeys into the city.  Why should women in the nineties be expected to put up with such an atrocious situation? Why should they be expected to travel ten miles in order to receive what is a basic human right?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats who boast of their progressive input into the Cabinet, must learn that the women of Tallaght are not prepared to accept that form of discrimination.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, it is a matter of priorities in the Department of Health, and it must be shown that the priority now is to build a hospital for the people of Tallaght and Dublin South West.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Deputy has on this occasion afforded me <Col N="1647" /> an opportunity once again to explain the position in relation to the construction of the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Tallaght Hospital project will cost an estimated £118 million and will be the biggest health project ever undertaken here.  I have previously informed the House that the construction period involved is about four years, following which a further period of 18 months would be required for commissioning.</P>
      <P>In relation to the commencement of work on this project, as has been stated before, the position is that the capital allocation available to my Department for 1991 does not allow for the commencement of the Tallaght project in 1991.  However, as I have indicated on several occasions, together with the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, I will be considering the development of the Tallaght Hospital project in the context of the capital resources available to my Department in 1992 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputy Taylor that he did have an opportunity when in Government for four-and-a-half years to make considerable progress on this project he speaks so highly of tonight.</P>

      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton will now make his two minute statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to speak tonight.</P>
      <P>I am very disturbed at the agreement of the Association of Irish Hospital Consultants at the weekend on a new recommended fee structure.  It seeks to set a minimum fee and indicates a range above that.  Even the minimum fee will be 40 per cent above the 1990-91 fees charged. The top rate will be a massive 100 per cent above those fees.</P>
      <P>When one considers the top 30 surgical procedures it is recognised that the proposed minimum fee is 80 per cent higher than the VHI schedule.  If the proposed fees are charged, in a typical case, a VHI member would have to pay out of his or her pocket half the cost of his or her consultant's fees.</P>
      <P>In addition, the schedule proposes an extra 50 per cent loading on top of those fees if surgery is done outside of office hours.  The Minister of State is aware that in the majority of cases private treatment is carried out outside of office hours, because of consultants' commitments to their public patients, who occupy the majority of consultants' working days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe for one minute that they are reasonable charges.  They are being proposed against a background in which consultants' fees have increased by more than 35 per cent since 1987, which is more than double the increase <Col N="1649" /> granted to other people under national pay agreements under which the Government have recently agreed to a revised schedule of public recompense to consultants for their public patients. That contract now yields an income of up to £60,000 to consultants.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out, and I hope the Minister of State takes note, that this attempt to fix a recommended set of fees flies in the face of section 4 of the Competition Act, recently passed in the House, which bans an attempt to directly or indirectly fix prices.  The schedule of fees interferes with competition.  I can see no purpose in such an agreed schedule other than an attempt to interfere with competition which is banned by the Competition Act.</P>
    <P>The consultants argue that their fees are a private matter between them and their patients.  That is not so.  First, the Minister for Health must intervene to protect patients, because they are desperate in their need for care and, hence, are in no position to argue about fees.  Secondly, it must be remembered that the taxpayer permits tax relief on these charges, so that effectively it will be the taxpayer who will pick up half of the proposed increases.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take urgent action in concert with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, if necessary, the Revenue Commissioners to protect patients.  In conclusion, I have to say that the Minister of State, and the Minister, are not guiltless in this matter because they have created the intense pressure on public care that has left patients desperate and willing to pay virtually anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Bruton's comments on this issue.  While the new scale of fees for medical consultants has been put forward by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association as a guideline, it does nonetheless mark a new worrying departure from previous practice in this regard.  The primary concern of the Minister for Health is the possible effect on public health and <Col N="1650" /> the anxiety which such a significant increase will cause individual patients.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, one of the good and admirable aspects of our health services is the existing balance between public and private health care, something which has evolved over the years.  The Minister and I are anxious to preserve this mix in the interests of patients and believe there would be considerable support for this view from the medical profession.</P>
      <P>The availability of effective and affordable private health insurance cover to the maximum numbers in the population is crucial to the maintenance of this balance. The Voluntary Health Insurance Board, on which the great majority of the privately insured depend for their cover, can hardly be expected to meet in full whatever rates of charges medical consultants decide to impose.  One of the greatest threats to VHI membership and the source of most complaints about the VHI over the years has been the inability of the board to provide benefits to meet the full costs of consultants' fees. However, recently the VHI have successfully concluded full cover agreements with a number of specialities.</P>
      <P>Fees of the order now proposed by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association would result in a very wide disparity between the maximum benefits recoupable by the VHI and the level of fees charged by medical consultants.  This could well prompt many individuals to question the value of VHI membership.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government recognise the crucial role played by voluntary health insurance and is sensitive to the need to ensure that this important role and contribution to the health care system is not diminished in any way.  It is misleading, therefore, to suggest that the advent of competition in the private health insurance field will dispense with the need for close co-operation between the insurers and the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to inform Deputy Bruton that my colleague, the Minister for Health, is discussing this <Col N="1651" /> matter with his colleagues in Government. It would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage, but I am sure the Minister, who is <Col N="1652" /> concerned about this matter, will return to it again publicly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 October 1991.</P>

      <P>A high level of interest has been shown in this innovative form of tenure which will help persons on lower incomes achieve home ownership in stages.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has paticipated fully in the UNCED preparatory process both directly and under EC co-ordination. Our national report on sustainable development will be submitted to the UNCED secretariat shortly.  In addition, Ireland will be making a special contribution to UNCED by hosting a major United Nations Conference on Water and the Environment in Dublin in January, 1992.  This conference has been mandated by UNCED to develop a strategy for sustainable management of freshwater resources, which will be integrated <Col N="1484" /> into the overall UNCED action programme, Agenda 21, for sustainable development.</P>
    <P>While the UNCED agenda is extremely wide and ambitious, and progress in a number of areas has been slow, Ireland hopes for a valuable outcome under all of the main agenda headings &mdash; particularly on Agenda 21, the practical action programme for sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The EC has played a major and constructive role so far in the UNCED negotiations. It is now intensifying its co-ordination on UNCED through a high level <i>ad hoc group</i> which has recently been set up.  Community preparations for UNCED were discussed in a preliminary way at an Informal Environment Council of 12 October which I attended and the matter will feature substantially on the Environment Council agenda between now and June 1992.</P>

      <P>I refer to Chapter IV of <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> which deals extensively with the problem of homelessness. Since the plan was published revised guidelines have issued to housing authorities in regard to the accommodation needs of homeless persons.  The authorities have been requested to utilise fully their powers to secure accommodation for any homeless person in their area and to give effect to the measures specifically identified in the plan.  A copy of the revised guidelines has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

It is now a matter for the county council to prepare contract documents and submit them to my Department for approval, prior to proceeding to the tendering stage.</P>
      <P>A capital grant will be made available to meet 80 per cent of the cost of providing a pool to the standards set out in my Department's guideline specification for swimming pool construction.  The balance of the costs must be financed by way of local contribution.  Work carried out to a standard higher than provided for in my Department's specification, including the provision of additional facilities such as those proposed for the Cavan pool, a kiddies' pool, a coffee dock, a gym and fitness room, a solarium and steam room and a creche are not eligible for grant.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the limited funds available for the swimming pool programme generally and the competing demands from other local authorities for those funds, the commitment of funds as outlined above is the maximum which can be made for this project.

      <P>In January 1991 I asked county councils to submit reports on the damage caused, and the estimated cost of <Col N="1489" /> remedial works, to public roads and bridges as a result of the severe weather conditions in the early part of the month. Following technical examination of the reports received, I allocated grants totalling £2.48 million to 18 county councils for the areas most affected.  The estimate of the damage in respect of Meath County Council was £92,270, an amount which could not be considered abnormal in the context of weather conditions during Irish winters, and consequently, no allocation was made to the council. An estimate of the cost of repairing damage to roads caused by snowfalls was not received from the council until 14 March 1991, by which time the funds available to me for road grants has been fully allocated.</P>
      <P>Meath County Council have been treated fairly in the overall allocation of road grants in 1991.  The discretionary road grant allocations which I notified to the council amounts to £2.375 million, compared with grant payments of £2.363 million in 1990 and £1.44 million in 1989. The 1991 grants include a supplementary grant of £300,000 in recognition of the special needs of the county in relation to regional and county roads.  The 1991 national road grant allocations for the county amount to £7.450 million, the fifth highest allocation to any county council in the country.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the environment action programme, local authorities were directed last year to prepare recycling schemes for their areas, identifying recycling possibilities and setting out how to promote and assist such activity.  All but a small number of local authorities have prepared such schemes and their progress is being followed.</P>
      <P>The recycling grants scheme operated by my Department applies to private/ voluntary and to local authority activity. Grants have been allocated for the first time this year to a number of local authority projects.  These include a grant of £100,000 towards the capital cost of the Kerbside project in Dublin; this initiative is being co-ordinated by the Dublin local authorities and Dublin Chamber of Commerce and will involve the collection of recyclable waste on a segregated basis.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced my intention to commission a study to assess the overall potential for recycling in Ireland, and, <i>inter alia,</i> to consider current waste collection and disposal arrangements with a view to recommending improvements or new systems designed to optimise recycling performance.</P>

Its preparation involved consultation with the other Departments concerned &mdash; Industry and Commerce, Social Welfare and Energy &mdash; as well as with the Dublin local authorities, EOLAS and fuel trade interests.</P>
      <P>The review found that the ban on coal had generally been a major success and had brought Dublin's air quality into compliance with national and EC standards relating to smoke.  Some improved arrangements for implementing the ban were identified and have been put into effect.  These include arrangements for the speedier preparation of prosecutions and action in regard to safety of fuels. Other possible responses were identified with the recommendation that they be held in reserve pending further experience of the coal ban.</P>

      <P>The present grave economic situation in the Soviet Union has resulted in a need for several forms of assistance, dealing with emergency needs on the one hand and with the short and medium term transformation of the economy on the other.  Overall production has fallen by 25 per cent in the Soviet Union in the past year.  The decline in production in the food sector has been particularly acute.  Bad harvests, lower food production, distribution and market failures have all contributed to shortages which are likely to become more serious in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> The European Community is already disbursing aid agreed by the European Council in Rome in December 1990.  A 250 million ECU programme of food aid in the form of grants is now under way, directed towards particularly needy groups in given locations.  The Community is also providing credit guarantees of 500 million ECU for the import of food by the Soviet Union.  Part of this credit may be used for the purchase of food products in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe including the Baltic States and part of the purchase of food directly from Community stocks.</P>
    <P>In early September, the Soviet authorities sought food aid totalling $14.7 billion, subsequently reduced to $10.2 billion, from the European Community and the G7 countries.  The Community has been asked to provide about half of this, equivalent to six billion ECU, in a mixture of grants, credit guarantees and loans for imports of cereals, meat, sugar, vegetable-oil, butter and flour.  The Commission and G7 representatives are currently analysing the Soviet Union's real food needs as well as their absorptive capacity and food distributing networks. A commitment to the effective distribution and allocation of food and medical supplies throughout the Soviet Union is a precondition for large scale aid.</P>
    <P>In response to the most recent Soviet requests EC Finance Ministers already agreed in principle on 7 October to grant a further 1.25 billion ECU in credits to assist the Soviet Union with imports of food and pharmaceutical supplies.  This Community aid will be split 50/50 as between products sourced in the EC and in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe including the Baltic States.</P>
    <P>I believe that a positive response by the Community at this time is essential to help ensure the development of democracy and stability in the Soviet Union.  In that spirit Ireland has participated actively and constructively in the community's consideration of the type and amount of aid required.  We have supported the use of EC financial <Col N="1504" /> assistance to the Soviet Union to purchase product from Central and Eastern Europe countries as a means of addressing both the Soviet food problem and the East European search for markets, while at the same time emphasising the importance of making maximum use of EC intervention stocks.  We look forward to receiving detailed proposals from the Commission as soon as its study of real needs in regard to food aid is completed.</P>

      <P>The Commission proposal has not yet been considered in detail by the member states but indications are that while a majority of delegations, including Ireland, would be sympathetic to the Commission's proposal, many foresee substantial constitutional, legal and political problems if the Community was to accede to the Convention.</P>
      <P>The question is also indirectly related to the negotiations on political union in which it is proposed to insert in the Preamble of the Treaty a reference to the obligation of the union to respect the rights and freedoms as recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights. A number of delegations believe that with the inclusion of such a reference the question of Community accession may not be necessary.</P>
      <P>Ireland favours the inclusion of such a reference in the Preamble of the Treaty. We will continue to examine the complex legal implications of accession to the Convention which we understand would give it direct applicability in Irish domestic law &mdash; a status that it does not presently enjoy.</P>

      <P>On 3 October Ireland joined partners in the European Community in a statement which unreservedly condemned the military coup in Haiti on 30 September against the country's first democratically elected President.  The Community and its member states expressed their strong support for the legitimate authorities as well as for the democratic forces in the country and called for an immediate return to the rule of law and the reinstatement of those legitimate authorities.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ireland together with the Twelve member states of the European Community, co-sponsored a resolution which was adopted by consensus at the United Nations General Assembly on 11 October 1991.  This resolution <i>inter alia</i>&ldquo;strongly condemns both the attempted illegal replacement of the constitutional President of Haiti and the use of violence, military coercion and the violation of human rights in that country&rdquo;.  It &ldquo;affirms as unacceptable any entity resulting from that illegal situation and demands the immediate restoration of the legitimate Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, together with the full application of the National Constitution and hence the full observance of human rights in Haiti&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland welcomes the award of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the opposition National League for Democracy party in Burma.  We hope that the award will lead the Burmese military finally to recognise the isolation they have brought upon their country and the aversion felt by the international community at her continued house arrest.</P>
      <P>The situation in Burma, both in relation to human rights abuses and the failure of the military junta to respect the results of the May 1990 elections, continues to be a matter of the gravest concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>Together with our partners in the Community, and on a number of occasions over the past year, we have expressed our deep concern at the continuing failure of the Burmese military authorities to respect the democratically expressed will of the Burmese people.  In addition, the situation in Burma has led the Community and its member states to suspend non-humanitarian development aid programmes and reduce economic and trade relations to a minimum.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 27 February, the Twelve expressed their grave concern at the deterioration in the human rights situation in Burma and noted the inclusion of Burma in a report on torture compiled by the Commission's Special Rapporteur.  At the same time, an urgent appeal was made by the Twelve to the Burmese rulers to transfer power without delay to the victors in the 1990 elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Twelve's continuing concern has been reflected in statements issued on 27 May, on 29 July and, most recently, in the statement delivered by the Presidency <Col N="1507" /> on behalf of the Twelve at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 24 September.</P>
    <P>On 27 May the Community and its member states condemned the numerous shortcomings in respect of internationally accepted rules of conduct and of human rights, the continuing harassment, detention and house arrest of opposition leaders, prominent among whom is Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, and the refusal to free policial prisoners.</P>
    <P>Appalled that the Burmese authorities continue to spend large amounts of their country's meagre resources on arms, the Twelve announced on 29 July their decision to refuse the sale of any military equipment from Community countries to Burma.  They called on the rest of the international community to show similar restraint and desist from all such sales. In their statement to the United Nations General Assembly, the Community and its member states once again called on the Burmese Government to respect the mandate laid down by the Burmese people in May 1990 and to introduce a democratic multi-party system.  The Community indicated its willingness to re-establish constructive relations with Burma, including a resumption of development assistance programmes, once Burma fulfils its obligations in the field of human rights and democracy.</P>

      <P>Retention tax applies to deposit interest generally, and I have no plans to change that position.  However, section 5 of the Finance Act, 1990 exempts investment income from income <Col N="1508" /> tax where the income arises from compensation paid following a civil action for damages for personal injury.  For the exemption to apply the income must represent the sole or main income of an individual who, as a result of an injury, is permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself.</P>
      <P>More generally, where a person who is totally incapacitated receives interest on a deposit which is liable to deposit interest retention tax &mdash; whether that deposit consists of compensation in respect of a traffic accident or otherwise &mdash; the DIRT deducted may be reclaimed.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that there are a number of investment options which are not subject to retention tax, including Government securities and certain savings schemes operated by An Post.</P>

      <P>The information requested concerning amounts of VAT paid by local authorities is not available as these bodies are not registered for VAT and therefore <Col N="1509" /> are not required to submit VAT returns. Like unregistered persons generally, they bear VAT on the cost of taxable goods and services purchased by them but it is not possible to ascertain the amount involved from the VAT returns of their suppliers.</P>
      <P>Under EC VAT law, the State and its constituent parts, such as local authorities, are generally exempt from VAT. This means that, like other exempt entities, they cannot reclaim the VAT paid on purchases, because they do not charge VAT on any services they provide.  I do not expect there to be any significant change in this regime in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>I would point out, of course, that tax levels are taken into account in settling annual allocations for all State bodies including local authorities.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance in August 1988 and again in February 1990.  These claims were disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that he had failed to disclose full details of his means, especially in relation to redundancy payments which he had received and in relation to the income of the farm on which he resides with his brother.  He appealed against the disallowance in 1988 and the appeals officer upheld the deciding officers decision.</P>
      <P>He claimed unemployment assistance again in February 1991 and following investigation by the social welfare officer, his claim was again disallowed by an appeals officer on 10 June 1991.  This decision was based on the grounds that he had failed to show that his yearly means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certification. Under social welfare legislation, claimants for unemployment assistance are assessed with the value of any benefit or privilege.  In this case the person concerned is residing on a farm and is believed to be receiving support from his brother.  In these circumstances, an assessment of the annual value of the farm is required before the means of the person concerned can be determined.</P>
      <P>Decisions by appeals officers are final and conclusive.  If the person concerned is now willing to disclose his means he should contact his local office with a view to having his case reviewed.</P>

      <Quest>if he has any proposals to change the eligibility criteria whereby those in receipt of lone parent's allowance as well as those in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit may benefit from the VTO scheme operated at vocational schools in view of the potential for self-development that this provides for such participants; and if he will review the case of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS), which was launched in 1989, allowed the long term unemployed, i.e. those unemployed for 15 months or more, who were aged 21 years or over to attend a leaving certificate type course and still receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>I have improved and expanded the scheme since 1989 and, from September this year, persons who have been &ldquo;signing on&rdquo; for at least 12 months or who are on the live register but not in receipt of a payment, are eligible to apply.  These improvements mean that for the first time recipients of unemployment benefit may participate in the VTOS as well as those who are signing for credits only, mainly married women.  The VTOS now operates in up to 53 centres which can accommodate 1,060 participants.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for improvements in the range of options, opportunities and incentives to the unemployed, lone parents and other social welfare categories aimed at their return, where appropriate, to the work-force. The question of the further extension of the education schemes to include categories such as lone parents will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its <Col N="1516" /> inception and apply generally between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9.45 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday inclusive.  These restrictions were imposed because the services concerned are under severe pressure from work or muters travelling to or from work or school at that time of the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply. However, the restrictions do not apply in the case of mentally-handicapped persons, persons attending long term rehabilitation courses or certain other disabled or blind persons.</P>
      <P>Any easing of the current time restrictions would have significant cost implications for the two national carriers involved who, in turn, would be seeking compensation from my Department. Expenditure on the free travel scheme this year will be of the order of £28 million.</P>
      <P>With regard to pensioners attending hospital, the position is that for some time past hospital authorities have agreed, in the context of improved outpatient arrangements, to schedule appointments so as to facilitate people availing of the free travel scheme.  Any particular problems arising in individual cases should be taken up with the relevant hospital authorities.</P>

      <P>The maximum admissible concentration for aluminium specified in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, is 0.2 mg/1. Reports on the Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland (1989), compiled by the Environmental Research Unit and published by me on 17 October 1991, identified aluminium in excess of this concentration as a significant problem in drinking water.  Counter-measures to deal with this problem are a priority in the programme of capital works for water supply.  Extension or replacement of treatment works and distribution systems, where necessary, is being supported by the investment commitment of <Col N="1523" /> £300 million in the environment action programme.</P>
      <P>I have also asked sanitary authorities to review all aspects of the management and operation of water supplies.  The indications are that, in many cases, better treatment works practice and more active supervision would bring the drinking water quality into conformity with the regulations.</P>

      <P>Persons occupying a private or semi-private bed in a public hospital do not also pay for a bed in a public ward as part of the bill.  However, they may, in addition to the appropriate maintenance charge for private or semi-private accommodation, be liable for a charge of £12.50 per day or part of a day for the first ten days in any 12 months, which applies to patients in both public beds and private/semi-private beds.</P>
      <P>This charge is identified separately, rather than included in the overall maintenance charge for private and semi-private accommodation, because certain categories of patients are exempted &mdash; e.g. medical card holders, women receiving services in respect of motherhood and children suffering from prescribed diseases and disabilities.  Where such patients avail of private and semi-private accommodation, they remain liable for the maintenance charge but do not have to pay the £12.50 charge.</P>

      <P>A draft professional code of conduct has recently been drawn up by chief executive officers of health boards.  This draft document has formed the basis of a discussion between the health boards, the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the unions concerned.  The unions are expected to give their response to this document shortly.</P>
      <P>When this document has been agreed and implemented in the health board area, its extension to other boards under the aegis of my Department will be considered. In addition I have written to the chairman of all statutory bodies requesting them to review existing procedures and systems so that the highest standards of personal integrity obtain both at board and management level.</P>

    <P>* Data refer to the 1990-91 school year and are provisional.  Statistical data in respect of the 1991-92 school year are only in the process of collection and preliminary analysis by my Department at present and, consequently, corresponding data are not yet available in respect of the current school year.  Data refer to ordinary national classes only and exclude special classes for handicapped pupils.</P>
    <P>The above data indicate the gradual improvement which is taking place in the areas of pupil/teacher ratio and class size. <Col N="1529" /> This is due to the general decline in pupil numbers in national schools and the fact that the overall number of national school teachers is remaining roughly constant from one year to the next, e.g. 20,321 in 1989-90 and 20,393 in 1990-91. The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from 27.2 in 1989-90 to 26.7 in 1990-91.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and INTO.  As this school had an enrolment of 108 pupils on 30 September 1990, the authorised staffing of the school for the 1991-92 school year is principal and three assistants.</P>
      <P>My Department have received an application from the board of management of the school for the appointment of a fourth assistant and have informed by Department that enrolments have increased substantially.  Because of this I have requested an inspector from my Department to furnish a report on the school.  On receipt of this report my Department will be in touch with the school authorities regarding this matter.</P>
