      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilities of the Government Press Centre are available only to Government Ministers and Departments through the Government Information Services.  I am aware, however, that Leinster House is lacking in adequate press facilities for Members of the Oireachtas and I will ask the Office of Public Works to examine the possibilities of providing these in Leinster House or adjacent to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach acknowledges the lack of adequate press facilities within the House.  I am sure he is also aware of the great public interest, particularly on the part of constituents of mine, in the contents and design of the new Government Buildings.  I am concerned that we should get value for money in respect of the facilities that <Col N="2170" /> have been installed there.  Rather than duplicating a facility already provided, it would be more appropriate and would give better value for money if that facility could be made more widely available. There would be a cost factor involved in duplicating a service, the demand for usage of which by Government Ministers would not preclude access by other interested bodies within the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be most undesirable to have Deputies dependent on Government facilities.  It is much better to keep the two separate.  The Government as the Executive have one function; the Oireachtas has another.  It is much better &mdash; in fact, almost essential &mdash; to provide separate facilities for this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach is ruling out access by other Members to the Government Press Centre, within what time span does he envisage the Office of Public Works being in a position to provide similar facilities here?  There is an appalling lack of the necessary facilities for briefings with the social partners and other interest groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two such task forces were established in my Department: (1) Tourism Task Force, established in November 1987, and (2) Roots, Genealogy and Tourism Task Force, established in May 1988.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report the details of these task forces as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE</P>
      <P>
        <i>Roots, Genealogy and Tourism Task Force, Established in May 1988</i>
      </P>
      <P>The work of the task force is now bearing fruit in the Irish Genealogical Project. This project draws together all those with a legitimate interest in genealogy in Ireland and in particular the work of some 35 local centres operating on an allisland basis across the Thirty-two Counties. In these centres, genealogical records of all kinds will be put on modern computers.  On the basis of this comprehensive set of records there will be an international marketing campaign to attract people of Irish descent around the world to come back to Ireland to find out about their families.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tourism Task Force, Established in November 1987</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the task force was to make recommendations to Government for the expenditure of a special additional allocation of £4 million public, supplemented by £2 million private funding for tourism promotion in the 1988 <Col N="2172" /> budget.  The task force reported in March 1988 with a programme of special promotional and marketing initiatives including proposed reduction in access fares, with the overall objective of boosting tourism traffic in 1988.  Bord Fáilte were asked by Government to implement the measures immediately.  The task force initiative did, therefore, play a major part in increasing visitor numbers by over 15 per cent and foreign tourism revenue by 16 per cent in 1988 over 1987 and in the substantial reduction, of up to 28 per cent, in access promotional fares into Ireland in 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>To what Minister in the Department will these reports go and who will have responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That question does not really arise.  The recommendations of both task forces are already in the course of being implemented fully.  The Tourism Task Force which was established in November 1987 has been responsible for bringing about a complete revival and expansion of our tourism industry.</P>

      <Qid>3</Qid>
      <asker>Mr. Bell</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>when the practice of appointing an aide-decamp to the Taoiseach commenced; the rank at which this appointment has been held since 1980; the nature of the duties involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first <i>aide-de-camp</i> to the Taoiseach was appointed on 20 March 1936 and the practice has continued since that date.  Since 1980, the appointment has been held by an officer of the rank of Commandant (the present ADC is a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy which is the equivalent to Commandant).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duties of the <i>aide-de-camp</i> to the Taoiseach by long practice and precedent are to attend with him, when required, at certain formal functions and to represent <Col N="2173" /> him on ceremonial and other occasions when it is not possible for the Taoiseach to be present personally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach two questions arising from his reply?  First, would he consider appointing an FCA officer as <i>aide-de-camp</i> to any of the existing posts?  Second, has the post that was formerly held by his present <i>aide-decamp</i> been filled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, it would not be, I think, altogether appropriate that the office of Taoiseach would be held by an FCA officer and that of <i>aide-de-camp</i> be held by an FCA officer as well but perhaps on some future occasion it could be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had in mind a serving officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Naval Service, I am sure, have made their own arrangements with regard to the situation created by the appointment of a Navy Lieutenant Commander to be <i>aide-de-camp.</i></P>

      <P>In my reply to Private Notice Questions in the House on 6 February last, I set out the Government's position in relation to the initiative of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I have nothing further to add at this time by way of White Paper or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>From statements made by the Taoiseach over the years in relation to Northern Ireland it would appear that the Government's policy on Northern Ireland has two prongs: first, that the Government wish to be generous towards the Unionists; and second that a unitary State is the Fianna Fáil aspiration.  Could I ask the Taoiseach if there has been <Col N="2174" /> any updating of Fianna Fáil policy on Northern Ireland in the course of the exchanges that have taken place between the Government and the Secretary of State over the past number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil policy in its basic principles is the same as it always has been, that is to seek the unity of the people of Ireland, but as to the situation with regard to the implementation of that policy &mdash; I am sorry that the Deputy will not be able to attend the Fianna Fáil ArdFheis but if he listens to my broadcast on Saturday night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not particularly want to take any bit of thunder the Taoiseach has left for Saturday evening but may I ask him &mdash; in a serious vein &mdash; if the Government have discussed with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the question of devolution?  I would say to the Taoiseach that it is not enough to say that the Government are open to suggestions in relation to changes in Northern Ireland.  Have the Government expressed a view on devolution as a possible interim settlement in Northern Ireland or as a possible means of making progress to end the nightmare in Northern Ireland, which, unfortunately we have been reminded of over the week-end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="2175" /> I think this is broadening the parameters of the question a bit.  But the Deputy, I am sure, has on several occasions heard me outline here the Government's position with regard to devolution.  With regard to all other aspects of the situation, the whole purpose of the present process is to set up dialogue and conversations with a view to bringing forward some new possible arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Brooke talks, could the Taoiseach say in what significant respects the paper tabled by the Secretary of State Mr. Brooke last November differs from that which was tabled by the Government of Ireland last month?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the points of division between the two approaches are very minor indeed and would surely not justify a situation in which the substantive talks between the parties would not commence in Northern Ireland?  Would the Taoiseach further agree that there is a safeguard already agreed by all parties that nothing can be agreed finally in any one strand of the talks unless there is agreement in all three strands and that therefore, even if something transpired in the internal talks which the Irish Government do not like, they can prevent that coming into effect by failing to agree in the east-west, British-Irish strand of the discussion.  Would the Taoiseach agree that there is more than sufficient safeguard for the interests of the Irish Government and the Nationalist interest in the current proposals as tabled by Secretary of State, Mr. Brooke, and that therefore the Irish Government should take steps to ensure that the talks actually commence now and as the carnage continues in Northern Ireland we cannot afford further delay in a matter of this importance?</P>

I have, at every stage given the House the fullest possible outline and detail of these discussions and exactly the position and I want at this stage to do no more than reject totally what is implicit in Deputy Bruton's question. The position is that no partner in these whole discussions has been more forthcoming in endeavouring to find formulae which would enable the process to proceed than the Irish Government and the fault certainly does not lie with the Irish Government.</P>

May I ask the Taoiseach why he takes this defensive view that I am blaming the Government when, in fact, all I asked was whether there was not very little between the two positions and that an initiative should be taken <Col N="2177" /> to bring the two positions together?

      <P>I am aware the Deputy would like to do that, but on this occasion the overwhelming evidence is totally against him.  As I have said, this Government &mdash; and most commentators who understand anything about it agree &mdash; have been forthcoming and have put forward compromise after compromise, formula after formula to endeavour to bring these talks to a successful conclusion, and it is unworthy of Deputy Bruton to try to place the blame for the failure of this initiative, if it happens, on his own Government, that is disloyal on Deputy Bruton's part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical referees give an independent medical assessment which assists the Department's deciding officers in determining entitlement to disability benefit.  When conducting an examination the medical referee is not making an initial diagnosis.  He is providing a second opinion on the diagnosis of the person's own general practitioner and giving an independent assessment of the person's capacity for work.</P>
      <P>All reports of examinations carried out by medical referees are submitted to the Department's chief medical adviser for approval.  Detailed guidelines are issued by the Department to all doctors who participate in the medical certification scheme.  The guidelines include full information for assessing and deciding incapacity for work as well as details of the medical referral system.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons referred for medical referee examinations are fully safeguarded. Their own medical certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report including references to any recent consultant examinations.  In addition it is open to a medical certifier to attend an examination if he or she so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the medical referee system is operating in a fair and reasonable manner and that the relevant guidelines are being fully complied with. Persons whose benefit has been terminated following assessment by a medical referee have a right of appeal.  If they avail of this option, they are submitted for a second assessment by another medical referee.  The number of cases going on appeal is an indicator of the way the system is perceived by the public.  Following various changes that I made, the <Col N="2182" /> number of cases going to appeal dropped to 5,702 last year out of a total of over 55,000 examinations made by medical referees during the same year.  This compares with a total of 8,169 appeal cases requiring a second medical examination in 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my concern about the treatment of some applicants for disability benefit at the heads of medical referees?  It has happened that some referees differ in their interpretation from others and as a result recipients are deemed ineligible.  In some cases doctors, consultants, etc., who have the same access to the applicant for disability benefit all agree that he is unable to work but for some strange reason the medical referees in the Department say that that person is able to work.  Can the Minister give me some indication how than can happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is why we provide a tripartite system.  If a person is dissatisfied with the first medical referee we provide a second separate medical referee to give a separate opinion and that has been very beneficial.  If a person then ends up in conflict with both of these medical referees there is an appeal system whereby a person can appeal to an administrative appeals officer.  Broadly speaking, the system works very well.  I <Col N="2184" /> accept what the Deputy says, that from time to time there are cases which to a Deputy in the field look a bit extraordinary when somebody is turned down. Normally in such cases a second medical referee will sort things out.  Sometimes when a person is turned down it may be because he is nervous and does not explain the situation.  As I explained, the doctor who is the certifier will communicate both verbally and in writing.  The system is very fair but, as with any system, from time to time one will find cases where there can be difficulties but provision is made for that in the double appeal.</P>

      <P>We have said it fairly often.  I presume that most of the time the medical certifier may not want to go, but if he does, then he is completely free to do so.  As I think I said in the reply, notification of this is sent out and the person is informed that it is possible to bring along the medical certifier.  This would only arise in rare cases.  Also, there may be a problem where the medical certifier feels it is time the person went back to work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who becomes unemployed in one member state should first claim unemployment benefit under the legislation of that State.  If, after a minimum of four weeks, he is still unemployed and decides to seek employment in another member state he may, under the EC regulations, transfer his unemployment benefit to that State.  He will then be able to claim benefit immediately on arrival in the State and may continue to receive it for up to 13 weeks, while he or she is seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is not receiving unemployment benefit before coming to Ireland, the EC Regulations provide that contributions paid in another member state can be taken into account for entitlement to unemployment benefit under Irish legislation.  Before these contributions can be counted, however, the person must first become insured under Irish legislation by becoming employed here.  It is because of this requirement <Col N="2186" /> that the person cannot be paid unemployment benefit on the basis of foreign insurance if the person concerned does not have at least one social insurance contribution in the country which is responsible for the payment of the unemployment benefit.  This requirement is legislated for within the EC Regulations on social security and applies equally in every member state.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit is the only benefit which has such a requirement.  Sickness benefit under EC Regulations is paid by the country of last employment while pensions are paid by each State concerned.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which this requirement can give rise to particularly in the case of persons who are returning to a member state from which they have emigrated and with which they have close family ties have been acknowledged in the Community.</P>
    <P>I placed this specific issue on the agenda of the meeting of Social Affairs Ministers which I hosted during the Irish Presidency.  The Ministers agreed that the Commission should give priority to bringing forward proposals for decision by the Council to meet this and other related problems.</P>
    <P>The Commission services have indicated that they will bring forward proposals for consideration shortly.</P>
    <P>Social assistance payments are not covered by the EC Regulations.  Any person claiming these payments in any member state is subject to the national conditions which cover eligibility for such payments in the State concerned.  A person who comes to Ireland and is not entitled to payment of unemployment benefit is entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  To qualify for payment such person will have to satisfy the conditions for eligibility in the same way as all claimants and there are no special requirements in the scheme related to the person's nationality.</P>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is also available to any person resident in Ireland regardless of nationality, whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled my question because of the very large number of people who returned from England at Christmas because of the recession in Britain.  Would the Minister agree that there is an anomaly in a situation where people are required to be seeking and available for work but cannot obtain benefit unless they get one week's work?  Is it not possible for the Minister to act independently of the other EC member states in this matter and simply allow eligibility if people have the required contributions and credits on British cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two important matters arise in relation to this question.  First, emigrants who are planning to return to Ireland would be wise, if possible, to claim their unemployment benefit, if that is due, in Britain for four weeks before coming back in which case they would then become entitled to the 13 weeks' unemployment benefit.  That would then give them an opportunity to find employment when they return here.  That is EC law.  The social security arrangements are made under the provisions of EC law.</P>
      <P>The anomaly to which the Deputy refers is one that we in the EC do not particularly like and for this reason it has been debated a great deal over the years. It is known as the one stamp rule, that is persons must get one stamp when they come back.  If returning emigrants have the opportunity to draw the four weeks unemployment benefit there they should do so and they will then be eligible for the 13 weeks unemployment benefit here. Subsequently we recoup that money from Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one stamp rule has been debated over the years but we could never reach agreement on it at EC level.  I brought it forward again during the Irish Presidency. I was advised that it was probable that we would not get acceptance but we brought it forward on the basis of countries with which people have close family ties, for example, a person from Ireland, who works in England, who comes back to Ireland where he has <Col N="2188" /> family ties, in that case it should be possible to transfer his unemployment benefit. The EC does not want people going around the EC, moving from country to country, unless they have at least looked for work for four weeks after they became redundant in a particular country.  If they look for work for the four weeks, then the EC accepts that they can move and take their unemployment benefit with them.  The indications from the work which is taking place at EC level at present are good.  I could not be too optimistic about it but the Commission is preparing proposals.  Once they come back to the Council of Ministers, which I hope will be in the reasonably near future we will press as hard as possible. That is the position in relation to the one stop rule; it is covered in the EC legislation on social security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognising that the Minister has brought forward many progressive proposals and removed many anomalies from the social welfare code during his term of office, would he not agree that people working in England are simply not aware of the four week rule? Does he know of any way in which that could be reformed in the short term? Would it be possible to seek a derogation from the EC regulation?  Can he explain to the House the reason for this rule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had explained it to some extent.  The position is that a person is in the social security system of another EC country and, as I have said, it does not apply to pensions, disability benefit or other areas.  The reason is the fear that large numbers of people would move from country to country, or to one country in particular, and draw unemployment payments in that country without genuinely seeking work.  We have argued against this position for a resolution of the problem.  During the Irish Presidency we got what the experts regarded as surprisingly favourable views on the question of countries with close ties, as a practical way of dealing with the problem.  That is the line we are pursuing, and we will do so as vigorously as we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to ensure that entitlement to the pension is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This condition applies to self-employed persons, including farmers, in the same way as it applies to all other insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed persons who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over will not qualify for the old age contributory pension. However, self-employed persons in that <Col N="2190" /> age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension.  Such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that these social insurance contributions payable by self-employed also give cover for widow's contributory pension to which entitlement can arise after three years insurance.  The self-employed will have been paying contributions for three years by end of March of this year.  We are coming to a significant point in March in so far as the self-employed are concerned in relation to the widow's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  A number of options were considered and an initial actuarial assessment of the costs involved was carried out.  On the basis of the rates of pension payable in 1989, when the costings were made, it was estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to &mdash; I am talking about the net cost &mdash; £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would have to be paid by self-employed contributors to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.</P>
    <P>Refunds of the old age pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  This includes provision for the payment of interest on such refunds due after 1 November 1990.  The rate of interest is equal to the increase in the consumer price index for each full calendar year after the date the contributions have been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> The Government have also given a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to examine the possibility, in the context of structural reform in agriculture, of an arrangement whereby farmers in the older age groups selling, leasing or transferring their farms will be provided with a retirement incentive related to means.  In this same context of structural reform, the interaction with the position of farmers aged 56 and over who pay PRSI contributions but who will not qualify for a contributory pension will be considered.  Discussions on this matter have already commenced between the officials of my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that over 14,000 farmers will be deemed ineligible for an old age contributory pension because they have not paid their contributions for the ten year period?  How hopeful is he that these farmers, and other self-employed people, will get benefit?  Is it not possible to allow them to continue to pay their contributions for a few years above the age of 66 so that they will be eligible for a contributory old age pension?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious to find a solution to the problem but there are major costs involved.  The cost of giving a pension for life from the age of 45 upwards would be very substantial.  This was the case when we brought in the self-employed on a once off basis.  So far as the farmers are concerned, there are two <Col N="2192" /> things I would say.  First, from the end of March farmers, and the self-employed, who have been paying contributions for three years will have cover for widows pension.</P>

      <P>This is very important. Sadly, I know of cases where people have died two or three months ago and are not covered.  Those who have been paying contributions for three years will be covered from the end of March, which is very important.

      <asker>Mr. Connaughton</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will allow retrospective payments of PRSI for the self-employed in the case of applications by widows for contributory widow's pension where their late spouses have not paid or may not have been asked to pay the PRSI contributions for the self-employed since the inception of the scheme.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a clear liability <Col N="2193" /> to pay PRSI contributions as a self-employed contributor the contributions due may be paid retrospectively.  If the self-employed contributor has died the contributions due may be paid from the estate, or if he or she was married, by the surviving spouse.  The contributions are collected by the Revenue Commissioners in the majority of cases.  In the case of those who are not liable for income tax, the contributions are collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>It may be difficult to establish conclusively after a person has died that there was a liability to contribute in the period before death.  Accordingly, in order to ensure that cover for the widows contributory pension is acquired it is important for self-employed persons who are not contributing to establish whether they are liable to contribute and, if so, to pay the contributions as soon as possible after they become due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will acknowledge that this aspect of PRSI for the self-employed is good in so far as widows become eligible after three years. I have acknowledged this on several occasions.  However, the reason I put down this question was because of a case where the third contribution was paid last October, but unfortunately, the spouse died a few weeks later.  His widow has been told that because her husband died three or four months too soon, even though the contributions were paid, she is not deemed to be eligible for a contributory widows's pension.  Is there anything the Minister, or his Department, can do about this case?  Technically the contributions were paid when demanded and on time.  It can be proven that the contributions were paid prior to this man's death.  Surely something can be done in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, this would apply to anybody in that situation in the period up to the three years, as it would apply to any ordinary class A insured contributor or other insured contributors who are insured for widow's pension purposes. It is not just a question of a few <Col N="2194" /> cases which might arise in the last three to four months, three to four weeks or whatever.  That is an unfortunate aspect of the new scheme and it applies to anybody coming into the scheme now.  If the Deputy gives me the details of the particular case I will certainly look at it. There is, of course, the possibility that the person paid contributions at some time previously during his working life and that would bring him into the scheme.  It is tied at present by the legislation and by cost.  If you open it up for a particular case you will have to take in all cases.  I accept the point the Deputy is making, that having paid the contributions for the year ending this March there is some slight difference.  It would presumably also apply to all other situations where a person is paying for the whole year in question.  I will have to look at the case for the Deputy.</P>

We undertook a massive advertising campaign around the country to try to get people to register so that they would be included in the scheme.  One question arises in relation to widow's pension.  There is a determination as to whether it would be reckonable because, for instance, a person may purposely avoid paying it for a period on the chance that he might not die during that period.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22, 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The new back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance which I introduced in 1990 was designed to assist recipients of social welfare and health board payments in meeting the cost of school uniforms and footwear.  The scheme provided for two rates of allowance, £40 for children attending secondary school and £25 for children attending primary school.  Some 180,000 children benefited under the scheme at a cost of approximately £5.4 million.</P>
      <P>The allowance is normally paid in respect of dependent children whose parents or guardians are recipients of: (a) supplementary welfare allowance; (b) social welfare benefits or allowances; (c) disabled person maintenance allowance; (e) infectious diseases (maintenance) allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each application is assessed having regard to the applicant's complete income position and in conformity with the general guidelines on the scheme. The maximum rates of the allowance apply where the family is solely dependent on the basic rate of the relevant <Col N="2197" /> social welfare health board payment. However, where the family had additional income from any source, including employment, account is taken of such income in assessing the level of allowance which is warranted in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Gregory's question, I am conscious of the effect of the income limit on those applicants whose income is marginally in excess of the limit.  This is one of the issues which is being examined within my Department at present in the context of an overall review of the operation of the scheme in 1990.</P>
    <P>Applicants in full time employment are not eligible for this allowance.  This is because the clothing and footwear allowance as part of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme does not extend to assisting those in full time employment.</P>
    <P>The newspaper article to which Deputy Mac Giolla refers examined the cost of providing a complete specialised school uniform, including gaberdine and blazer as well as footwear and sports uniforms, all purchased from specialist stores.  The wider costs associated with equipping a child for school, including the cost of text books and other miscellaneous expenses such as stationery and art materials were also examined.</P>
    <P>The rates of allowance under the clothing and footwear scheme were set having regard to the average cost of footwear and a basic school uniform, excluding gaberdine and blazer.  There are separate provisions operated by the Department of Education for assisting with the cost of school books.  Allowances paid by the health boards under the back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme therefore do not cover such costs.</P>
    <P>Details of the total number of beneficiaries under the scheme are currently being finalised by the health boards, which administered the scheme on behalf of my Department.  Final statistics on the number of families who applied for the allowance, the number of successful and unsuccessful applications and the average amount paid per child are not yet available. It is estimated, however, that the <Col N="2198" /> number of children who benefited under the scheme was in the region of 180,000.</P>
    <P>The scheme is structured to target the available resources to those recipients who are in greatest need.  I am satisfied that these measures are a major improvement on previous arrangements and substantially ease the annual burden of back-to-school clothing costs faced by social welfare and health board recipients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the scheme turned out to be very divisive last year?  In particular, people on very small incomes were excluded from the scheme.  The Minister will be aware that many of those people are worse off than people on social welfare.  Will his review of the scheme take that fact into account and will he broaden the scheme to include people in low paid employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Any time you bring in a good scheme for those on unemployment and supplementary welfare allowance, naturally people who are not within these groups feel it is something from which they, too, should benefit.  We need to consider particularly people who are near the margin, and this includes people on family income supplement.  They can be included in certain circumstances, for instance, if they have no other income.  In that way some of the known and defined people on lower incomes can be included. Last year was the first year of this scheme. It worked very efficiently given the introduction of a new scheme throughout the whole country, and I thank the health boards for administering it.  We are assessing as well as we can the outcome of that scheme in 1990 before dealing with this year.  As the Deputy may know, I have the money again to repeat the scheme this year, but the question of including much wider categories would, of course, require budgetary consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if there were definitive regulations available to the community welfare officers responsible for administering that scheme?  My information is that some of <Col N="2199" /> the officers took a very hardline approach and there was very little flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>General guidelines were laid down.  Previously there was wide variation in the very limited arrangements that existed.  I accept there was some variation in the scheme last year, and that is one of the aspects of the review.  Different health boards operated on different bases previously, and we will certainly be trying to get them to work as closely as possible.  General guidelines were agreed with the health boards beforehand and were issued.  Many of the decisions made by the community welfare officers are very straightforward and standard.  It is with the marginal decisions that differences may occur between health boards, and these will be looked at before next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the tragedy of poverty in Ireland is to be seen on the faces of young children at the beginning of the school term and the stresses and strains on families on low income or those dependent on social welfare payments is extreme at that time of the year?  Would he agree that an allowance of £25 for primary school children is insufficient?  The newspaper report referred to in Deputy Mac Giolla's question highlights that for primary school books alone it costs £50.  Therefore, the allowance of £25 goes no way towards serving the needs of these unfortunate families whose incomes are so stretched at that time of year, particularly in the month of September with the start of the new school term.</P>

      <P>Well, the figure in the article was £530 although I know that Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned the sum of £350. The Department of Social Welfare did a survey which showed that the average cost for the basic uniform &mdash; shirt, tie, shoes, socks, underwear, trousers, pinafore &mdash; was £40 for a primary school and £60 for a secondary school.  I was very interested in the results of the survey because I am familiar with my local schools and I know that their costings are very similar to those of the Department of Social Welfare.  These were independent surveys in relation to basic costs. I know that the cost does not include the heavy overcoat which is something a person is allowed to buy from a suitable store in whatever colour is appropriate. The management and the parents say what they want as a uniform and outline a reasonable cost.  That is the basic approach as distinct from the more exclusive schools which, traditionally, have a different approach.  These schools have the same kind of arrangement, in consultation with the parents.  As I said, Deputy Mac Giolla is out of touch and Deputy Byrne should not make the same mistake.</P>

We estimate that most eligible people came forward as it was well advertised and discussed at the time.  It was recognised as a good scheme because it applied to each child each year.  The Deputy should not forget that.  A person would not necessarily be buying everything each year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Work on the construction of our new social welfare services office at Dominick Street, Limerick, is now almost complete.  The new building will replace the existing employment exchanges at Cecil Street and Mungret Street and will also include accommodation for the Department's social welfare officers and medical referee who are located elsewhere in Limerick city. As a result, a wide range of social welfare services will be available under one roof, providing a co-ordinated service on one-stop shop lines, to our clients in the Limerick area.

      <P>The Deputy will be invited, I am sure there is an overlap between his question and the invitation arriving.  I like to get questions like this, a Cheann Comhairle.  I extend an invitation to the press to come because it is very hard to get them when we are opening fine new facilities.  The staff will transfer to the new office on a phased basis, commencing on the 9 March 1991.

    <P>When the existing offices are vacated by my Department the premises will be surrendered to the Commissioners of Public Works who are responsible for the management of State property.

      <P>When I came into the House today I did not think I would be acting as the Minister's PR man during Question Time.  As the Minister pointed out, there was an overlap between putting down my question and getting an official invitation from him to attend the opening next Thursday of the new exchange in Limerick.  I had not then got the invitation and an official date had not been announced.  Perhaps my question inspired the Minister to formally open the exchange.</P>
      <P>The old building was a Victorian, Dickensian building and I am glad now people using the exchange in Limerick will treat it with the dignity it deserves when they go to that office.  As the Minister knows, we are in the middle of an urban renewal programme in Limerick and I hope he will use his good offices to ensure that the development on the site of the old building will be suitable and will harmonise with existing buildings in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>People who are in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board are entitled to free travel.  I am extending the scope of the free travel scheme as from April next to include people formerly in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance who lost their entitlement to the allowance upon entering health board residential care.</P>
      <P>On the basis of information from the health board, the person concerned is not, and has never been, in receipt of the allowance and he is not therefore entitled to free travel.  The question of extending the scheme to cover persons in residential care who did not previously have free travel would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow Kilkenny):</i> Will the Minister agree that at this stage the Department of Social Welfare should be called the Department of anomalies and oxymorons?  This person is so severely handicapped that he is in residential care as a Down's Syndrome patient.  If he was not as severely handicapped he would be at home and would have free travel.  Is it not time that all these contradictions were taken on board by an enlightened Minister like himself?  The Minister said he did not get an allowance before.  The patient is mentally handicapped.  He is released every second Thursday of the month and brought back on the following Monday.  His widowed mother either has to drive him there or pay for his transport. Would the Minister not agree that in those circumstances he should see the <Col N="2206" /> person gets free travel and do justice to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, every time you take a further step you find anomalies arising like the one the Deputy has discovered in this case where a person was never a recipient of DPMA, therefore he never came into the free travel scheme and has not to date been in the free travel scheme.  We have extended free travel to cover such people even when they have lost DPMA by going into residence.  We have also provided for companion travel, for a companion to travel with the person free, so I think the Deputy will agree that we have been making very considerable improvement in the scheme.  I will look at the situation which has arisen which the Deputy mentions because it may be the person was never assessed for DPMA.  However, the Deputy must remember that we depend on the health boards for that purpose.  I will raise the case with them and see what can be done in that regard.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> He is severely handicapped.  If someone with a lesser handicap gets an allowance, surely it should follow logically that someone with a severe handicap should automatically get it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The logic of the situation is the legislation says people with DPMA get it.  That is the yardstick that is used. The simplest way to get around that could be that in particular cases if the persons would otherwise qualify for DPMA the health board would bring them into that qualification and we could cover them. We have no problem with that side of it. If that cannot be done we will have to look further to the future at how such people can be catered for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, having had it at any time.  The scheme is based on the DPMA. The simplest thing is if the person can be brought into the DPMA we can bring that person into free travel straight away. If that does no work in that case we can look at how else it can be dealt with.  The simplest situation is for the health board to recognise the person as a DPMA person; then the person will automatically come under our schemes, for their companion in that case as well as for himself or herself.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan will appreciate that there is a specific Standing Order 99, which wisely indicates that all amendments must be in accordance with what is provided in the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my wish to challenge your ruling in this matter but I seek your guidance as this is going to present us with some difficulty as to how we are going to proceed.  There are three dimensions to the Bill &mdash; the abolition of the rod licence, the establishment of co-operatives and further sections dealing with salmon licences.  It is the clear intention of the Opposition parties that the Bill should provide for the abolition of rod licences but not necessarily substitute them with co-operatives or with the charges which the co-operatives, in turn, would make on persons engaging in fishing. It is very difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have already discussed and disposed of the Second Stage of this legislation which means that what is now before the House is the <i>raison d'être</i> of the legislation which is to substitute co-operatives for fishing licences.  How could we now at this stage presume to alter what the House has already agreed?  Apart from presentation of the amendments, I understand that the Deputy and those Deputies in whose names the amendments appear have already been advised of Standing Order <Col N="2337" /> 99 (1) which provides for precisely what I am now saying to the House.</P>

All the while the House is governed by Standing Orders.  I do not want to be guilty of what I would not allow somebody else, repetition, but the Standing Order provides for what I have already indicated to the House.  I suggest to the House that we should proceed now and discuss the section, vote against it if we are so disposed and indicate our displeasure with it.</P>

      <P>We all agree that this is very tricky legislation and that we better get it right now.  Second Stage was discussed before the Christmas recess. The intention at that time was to take Committee Stage also before Christmas but the Minister, on the recommendation of the House, agreed to leave it until after Christmas.  I assumed this recommendation was made to give the Minister, who was not happy with the Bill, an opportunity to enter into negotiations. The House was not happy with the new Bill, as presented, and did not want amending legislation introduced as we could end up far worse off.  Given that we have waited patiently until the first week of March to take Committee Stage of the Bill, would the Minister give us an assurance that he has had discussions in the meantime with interested parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The purpose of the Bill to provide for the establishment of fisheries co-operative societies to raise and disburse for the public benefit funds for the development of trout or coarse fishing in fisheries.  Many of us in this House have very clearly indicated that we are not in favour of the type of co-operative outlined in the Bill.

      <P>I am somewhat amazed by your ruling in this matter. My colleague Deputy Barnes and I, have received a letter which states that the amendment seeks <i>inter alia</i> to delete from the Bill the provision which gives effect to the principle assented to on the Second Reading, namely, the establishment of a system of fishery co-operative societies. I find it rather strange that this matter is ruled out of order.  There is no ruling regarding the amendments to section 4, the fundamental section of the Bill which provides for the establishment of co-operatives.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;angling club&rsquo; is an organised association of persons engaged in the pastime of angling for salmon, trout and coarse fish with rod and line.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that the whole debate on Second Stage was an effort to enable us to produce a more constructive, simple and comprehensive way of dealing with this issue which will satisfy us as legislators and the fishermen who will be subject to its provisions.  I hope the Minister will accept the commitment which lies behind these amendments.  Of all the legislation which has gone through this House during the years I have been here, I do not think there has been a Bill which has called out to a greater extend for co-operation, understanding and support from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that this Bill when enacted will not fall at any hurdle and will not raise fears or suspicions which might lead to its rejection.  The legislators and the fishermen and the regional boards have the same objective, which is to enrich and enhance our fisheries and to make them as productive as possible, not just for Irish people but for our tourists as well.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the contentious and very divisive history of the Act which this legislation is designed to replace, we must satisfy ourselves that this Bill will be acceptable to the people who objected so strenuously for such a long time in a way which was so divisive and damaging for the country.  We must hope that there will be agreement on the part of people who will be abiding by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again and again during the course of the Second Stage debate, Members on this side of the House pointed that out not by way of sterile opposition or a wish to delay a Bill which is long overdue but in an attempt to ensure that the Bill we would produce would be acceptable.  This consensus has to be taken seriously because speakers on this side of the <Col N="2342" /> House were not reflecting what they believed anglers, fishermen and fisherwomen wanted but what they had been told by them in countless discussions and consultations.  We were trying to put forward a structure which would be simple and agreeable to all and which would be implementable when the legislation was enacted.  I believe that is the basis of all amendments from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5, which I moved on behalf of the Fine Gael party defines &ldquo;angling club&rdquo;, which is the foundation of the structure for registration by fishermen for inland fishing.  The arguments we on this side of the House are putting forward is that if the structures are defined in as simple and as traditional a way as possible, the chances of this Bill being implemented are far greater.  Our amendments are directed towards that aim.  We believe that the structure put forward in this amendment should replace the concept of a co-operative which the Minister suggested on Second Stage.  Not alone was the concept of the co-operative as defined by the Minister not the answer but it became clear that it would create tremendous bureaucracy and needlessly crossed lines.  We decided there was a simpler way of bringing forward legislation which would have the support of those who are involved outside this House.  Our amendment recognises that angling clubs are organised all over Ireland and that we should build on this but that we should deal with the definition of such angling clubs in one of the early sections of the Bill.  With this in mind, our amendment suggests a form of words to define an angling club be inserted:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;angling club&rdquo; is an organised association of persons engaged in the pastime of angling for salmon, trout and coarse fish with rod and line.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister, a classic scholar will recognise &mdash; I regret I did not have a classical education but from my sparse memory of Latin I know &mdash; that the basic foundation of the classics is simplicity and clarity which leads to the least misunderstanding <Col N="2343" /> and misinterpretation.  We bore this in mind in formulating our amendments.</P>
    <P>I wish to seek your guidance a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Having spoken on amendment No. 5 may I also comment on the other amendments that relate to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, the only limitation on the Deputy is that her contribution would refer to what is in all the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point made in amendment No. 5, if that were accepted, amendments Nos. 7, 13, 23 and 26 evolve. The huge bureaucracy and the input, in fact almost interference, that the Minister would be required to make as the Bill now stands would be eliminated to a great degree by our amendment No. 7. The angling clubs, as we have defined them in amendment No. 5, would be the foundation on which we would build the national structure.  The angling club would register with the regional board in whose area the club is active.  To effect its registration the club would provide the regional board with &ldquo;the names of its elected officers and its annual and expenditure accounts for the previous two years.&rdquo;  The regional board would maintain a register of all such angling clubs registered within its functional area.  This would be an evolution of what is in place already and would not involve extra bureaucracy.  It would also mean that angling clubs would continue to operate within their functional area and within their traditional regional boards. Once again this amendment is directed at making the legislation as efficient and effective as possible.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 to section 5 relates to the regional boards.  The regional board has carried out a tremendous amount of this work down through the years and would be in a position to do this work.  Subsection (3) is of particular interest.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any dispute arising as to the amount <Col N="2344" /> apportioned to an angling club under subsection (2) shall be referred jointly by the angling club and the regional board concerned to the Minister whose decision shall be final.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to carry out the business of the Inland Fisheries in an independent and autonomous way in the region where the parties are known to one another and where the debate and discussions can be carried out with this knowledge and without attempting to entangle the Minister at too early a stage. I cannot believe that the present Minister or any Minister of such a demanding and complex Department as the Department of the Marine would want to spend so much of his time and energy, valuable as both of them are, in taking over the type of power envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>First it would seem to be far too rigorous an interference and, second, anything that can be worked out between the parties themselves always leads to far greater consensus.  The rod anglers here have shown that they have an incredible sense of pride and independence and a very large say in what the development of their inland fisheries should be.  I and all my colleagues on this side of the House worry about bringing in a bureaucratic, top heavy ministerially dominated Bill to a group of people who, by their very tradition and, according to very recent history, have shown themselves not alone to be insulted but outraged that certain conditions and restraints are imposed on them.</P>
    <P>In bringing in a Bill we want to end a history of divisiveness which nobody welcomed and which did a lot of damage to the country, even to people outside the inland fisheries.  The last thing we want to do is introduce a second Bill that would raise all the same objections, the same sense of outrage, the same sense of their being overridden by central decisions that were not taking their rights and their concerns into consideration.  Of all the points I will be making, this is the most fundamental.  We must try to retain as much autonomy and independence as possible and encourage the members of <Col N="2345" /> the angling clubs and the clubs themselves. I hope the amendments will be accepted so that the development and expansion of this pastime of so many people here and of tourists and visitors to this country can be carried out by the very people involved in it, not just in a passive but in a personal and active way. Inland fisheries is of importance not just to us here as legislators but to the members of the angling clubs.  They are the first people who would worry about the lack of expansion in inland fisheries because they are the people deriving the greatest pleasure and the greatest productivity from it.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that we should have confidence and trust in the people at the receiving end of legislation &mdash; and this should apply to all legislation going through this House.  We must acknowledge their intelligence and their goodwill. We must realise that Ministers and Departments do not need to be in at every level and at every section and subsection of the Bills we are bringing through this House.  It is time we all grew up.  It is time we allowed groups to make their own decisions.  Certainly we can give them guidelines and structures through the legislation to enable them to carry out what we all want.  We must not, however, constrain people to the point of their being outraged when they perceive the implications of the legislation, when they realise they are not being trusted.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through this with a finecomb but one of the things this Committee Stage would attempt to change is the question of there being ministerial decisions with regard to trustees, with regard to some of the members who would be part of these structures, ministerial decisions operating at every layer of activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could stick with the Chair's metaphor, surely we are all striving for clean waters in which people, and <Col N="2346" /> fish, can swim clearly and independently without having to worry about piranha fish or whales overtaking them and be able to come up for air, to make their own decisions.  We would all acknowledged that for the future there is a real responsibility on everybody involved in inland fisheries to ensure that not alone does the fishing activity continue but that it continues at a much cleaner, healthier and more resourced level.  All the people involved will be called on to invest financially in it.  What we are saying is that the pastime is there, the pleasure is there, but we are encouraging anglers to pay for their pleasure.  We must give these people every encouragement and every sense of space for themselves.</P>
      <P>Sections 23 and 26 continue the type of autonomy and simplicity of structure that all our sections are directed towards. Only at the last moment when regional boards and angling clubs have ceased to be able to arrive at an agreement and cooperate between themselves would ministerial decisions be called in.  Registrations would be recorded by the angling clubs and where any surplus arose within an angling club that would be offset against the club's liability for development contributions in the following and successive years.  We are aware of the problems that can arise when one group perceive themselves to be contributing more than others.  There must be a system of fair play to deal with situations where there is a surplus of contributions.  In such circumstances excess contributions should be acknowledged and rewarded. That is the type of amendment we need to display so that regional boards and clubs would be aware of where they stood and the kind of action that needed to be taken without having to have recourse to the Minister.  We do say in section 4 that where a dispute arose that could not be agreeably worked out between the clubs and the regional boards it would be referred jointly by both to the Minister for his decision.  The Bill represents an interference with such structures and developments in a way that will offend and may once again lead us into a divisive and quarrelsome situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2347" /> The objective of the Bill is to repeal legislation that is widely ignored at present.  As legislators we must be concerned that that obtains at present. Above all, this Bill must ensure that the people who live within its confines are encouraged to operate it.  Its simplicity, directness, and acknowledgment of the structures will ensure that all clubs will contribute equally on a national level not only for the good of the country but for the good of the many tourists and local people who derive real pleasure from what is still considered one of our great advantages, clear water.  That is something we can offer at a time when other countries, regretfully, have allowed their waterways to die in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>The future pleasure of fishermen and fisherwomen depend on the Bill.  The image of this country as a clean, laid back, enjoyable, pleasurable country in which activities such as fishing can take place and generate revenue in many regions where incomes must be expanded in a productive way depends also on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>This group of amendments cover a number of sections and, therefore, are wideranging.  We have to look at what we are doing here.  The Bill arises out of previous legislation which simply was not acceptable to the public and, in particular, was not acceptable to inland fishermen and fisherwomen.  The rod licence was not accepted.  The Bill does not abolish the rod licence; it renames it: it is now called a share certificate to be issued by a co-operative. The formula devised by the Minister to get over the embarrassment of having to nakedly abolish the rod licence is the establishment of co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the amendment proposed by Deputy Barnes, as I understand it, is to short circuit the relationship which would exist between the regional fishery boards and the co-operatives.  It would give rise to a situation where the regional fishery boards would have a direct relationship with the angling clubs rather <Col N="2348" /> than through this cumbersome arrangement of the co-operatives.  In principle, that is something I would favour.  The angling clubs have contributed enormously to fishing.  There is no doubt they have contributed to the development of fishing and that they give much of their time and resources to it.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of merit in the idea that instead of having a very cumbersome arrangement whereby we would be expecting what are essentially voluntary organisations to combine in a way as if they were business in these co-operatives, that they would have a direct relationship with the regional fishery boards.  In principle that is a very good idea.  However, I do have one major reservation and, perhaps, Deputy Barnes, in the course of the discussion, would be able to address it.  Where does that arrangement leave the individual who is fishing and is not a member of an angling club?  The issue that the rod licence row gave rise to was that people saw the rod licence as a challenge to a freedom they had had down through generations to go out and fish.  This freedom was going to be interfered with by somebody coming along and challenging them on the river bank to produce a rod licence.  Presumably, under the new arrangement they will be challenged for a share certificate and they might even be challenged for a birth certificate since some of the exemptions relate to the ages of the people concerned.  It was the challenge to the freedom that was at issue.</P>
    <P>I would be very concerned if, in addressing that problem it were to be replaced by a formula which would give angling clubs, perhaps, over a period, or, perhaps by default, an influence and a control which is out of proportion and which would act to the detriment of the individual going out to fish.  That is my principle reservation with the amendment put down by Deputy Barnes.  If angling clubs are contributing to the development of fishing the relationship should be directly with the angling clubs rather than necessarily through a more cumbersome and more bureaucratic arrangement through the co-operatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Gilmore said, we are going through the motions of amending the second fisheries Bill within three years.  Since the first fisheries Bill was introduced on 16 December 1987 I have spent much of my time trying to find a solution to that unworkable and unworked legislation.  Since the present Minister for the Marine came to office he has spent much of his time trying to find a solution to the unworkable 1987 legislation which was introduced in a hurry before the Christmas recess in that year. We are going through the motions again to save the face of the Government in not accepting that that Bill was unworkable, scrapping it altogether and starting at the beginning again if necessary.  As amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 57 have been ruled out of order we have to deal with the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
      <P>The purpose of our amendments Nos. 5, 7, 13, 23 and 26 is to give recognition to the angling clubs.  They must be recognised because, according to this Bill &mdash; which is an attempt to amend the unworkable legislation of 1987 &mdash; there would be no place for the angling club in the co-operative set up.  Angling clubs must be recognised as being essential if we are to get the goodwill of the local people.  Angling clubs and associations have carried out much good work in cleaning rivers and inland waters, restocking them, building jetties and roads and developing and promoting angling both from the point of tourism and the clubs.  That is the purpose of our amendments.  As we said on Second Stage, we believe it would be completely unnecessary for the Minister to have to look into every detail of what is done by the co-operatives.  I do not know the purpose of this provision in this amending legislation but it is certainly causing concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have great respect for the Minister for the Marine who has endeavoured to solve the problems caused by the previous legislation.  I am surprised that we now find ourselves debating a Bill which will not abolish that unworkable legislation which was introduced so hurriedly <Col N="2350" /> into this House.  I had anticipated that the Minister would, in view of the discussions he has had, even since this Bill was introduced, with angling clubs and people who genuinely want to see the present problems resolved that he would have brought forward a better Bill or put forward amendments to this Bill.  I do not know what the Minister's attitude is but I anticipate that he will agree to many of the amendments we have put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I never realised that the simple pastime of fishing could be so complicated that it would involve us in a morass of bureaucratic red tape.</P>
      <P>The amendments put forward by Deputy Barnes would greatly improve the Bill.  However, the concept of this Bill was wrong from the start.  I firmly believe that it would be far more appropriate, much easier and much more effective if the legislation was repealed and a new Bill introduced which would be agreeable to everyone.  This Bill has met with opposition from a number of people. Not alone have the angling clubs and the federation asked questions about the Bill but the fishery boards do not appear to know where they are going at all.  I am sure that like me the Minister has received reams of submissions from various groups asking what is going to happen.  Yet these simple questions are still unanswered, and this Bill certainly does not answer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage the concept of co-ops met with stern opposition from Deputies on this side of the House.  I thought the Minister would have brought forward amendments in this respect.  However, it would appear at this stage that the legislation is as complicated as ever. There is a lot of goodwill among angling groups.  Much damage was done but thankfully the Minister helped in no small way in redressing the problems.  We should tap into that goodwill and try to bring the people directly involved, the anglers, clubs, federation, and regional boards, with us.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the Bill does not address the problems of individuals who wish to fish on Sunday afternoons without restriction.  This is the <Col N="2351" /> kernel of the problem and this is where the Fisheries Act collapsed in 1987&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the point Deputy Barnes was making in her amendment.  Even though I have reservations about Deputy Barnes's amendments, they are a definite improvement on the Minister's proposal.  That is what I was trying to say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if you had allowed me to do so.</P>
      <P>As I was saying before you stopped me in mid stride there must be proper consultation with the people in the angling sector. I do not believe there is consultation at present.  The angling clubs and the federation should be consulted. I gather that the Minister met with some groups during the week-end.  Even though this Bill was introduced into the House before Christmas we still do not know where we are going at this stage.  I want to say before you shoot me down that this is why I put down my amendments. The Minister should have thrown out the concept and started again.  If necessary, he should have repealed the legislation, and I have not changed my mind on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I made it clear that the Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, are totally opposed to this Bill.  Hence I have great sympathy with Deputy O'Sullivan who has put down amendments opposing virtually every section.  Indeed I felt very much that way <Col N="2353" /> inclined myself but I suppose one has to be realistic and look at the Bill to see if it can be improved, however difficult and distasteful a task this may be.  Without any doubt the Bill can be improved somewhat but it will still be a very flawed Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards the definition section, first there is no definition of angling in the Bill, nor is there any amendment down to that effect.  Angling should be defined in the Bill.  I would define it as fishing for any species of fish using a pole or rod to which is attached a fishing line and terminal tackle.  As there are disputes from time to time as to what is an illicit form of angling it is important to define it.  It is also necessary to define an angling club.  Deputy Barnes has attempted to make such a definition, which is certainly better than nothing, but it could be improved.  She makes no mention of numbers.  For example, could an angling club consist of two or three people?  Such an angling club would not be a bona fide club.  Therefore it is necessary to talk in terms of numbers.  I would suggest to the House that 20 is a good number.  If an angling club has fewer than 20 people it should not be deemed to be an angling club within the meaning of the Bill.  The entitlement of the angler to fish in the particular waters in which he or she wishes should be clearly stated.  Therefore as part of the definition we should add the words: &ldquo;and having title to or use of a fresh water fishery.&rdquo;  These are important changes which should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 sets out basically that angling clubs should replace co-operatives, and I go along with that with a heavy heart, not having great confidence in the Bill.  However it appears to be an improvement to operate through angling clubs rather than through co-operatives. Amendment No. 13 in the name of Deputy Barnes deals with financing of angling clubs and so on.  Amendment No. 23 is a very good amendment, particularly subsection (2), and I support it.  However I have grave doubts about amendment No. 26.  I wonder whether it is feasible to cancel the registration of a club.  This seems to be a draconian <Col N="2354" /> measure and I wonder how enforceable it is.  Before deciding on that amendment I am sure Deputy Barnes will speak further on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last number of years rarely has legislation been enacted which has had such devastating results as the original Fisheries (Amendment) Bill.  It was pushed through the House without a great deal of understanding of the implications and the raw passion it engendered in a great number of people.  I assume there will be more contributors to this legislation than there were to the previous Bill.  I have no doubt but that the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, an articulate and intelligent Minister, would have wished that a very simple solution could be found to what seemed to be a simple problem.  If one were to take all the various solutions that have been put forward since 1988 it would be extremely difficult to find that much sought after simple solution.</P>
      <P>The Department and the Minister should ensure first that there is a method by which people can pursue the leisure activity commonly known as angling, through the organisations which heretofore have been known as angling clubs. That practice should be conducted in such a way as to give people full satisfaction in the pursuit of their past time and at the same time ensure that it will be enabled to be carried on by future generations.  I assume that is what is at stake here in terms of the overall development of our fisheries by the Department and the Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>It seems as if this measure is a short term solution to a problem which will be with us for quite a long time.  The law was enacted; the law was set aside.  There are not many Deputies in this House who had to face the wrath of the people affected by the road licence.  One person in the west said that to solve the problem the Minister, Deputy Wilson, would have to have a neck like a swan, a hide like a water dog and the conscience of a free-thinking theologian.  I wish the Minister well and look forward to his clarification of the various complexities involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2355" /> I would have assumed that the setting up of co-operatives together with the constitutions, regulations and rule books that govern them would not be simple solution to this problem.  Deputy Barnes' amendment No. 7 refers to the names of the elected officers and the annual income and expenditure accounts for the previous two years.  It is a nonsense for people who are sent in here as legislators to attempt to implement such a section. When all parties submit their regulations and the names of the elected officers, 95 per cent of them will make no mention of the actual balance at the end of the year in terms of expenditure.  You can rest assured that that will apply in relation to angling clubs, co-operatives or whatever conglomerate is set up in this regard. I look forward to the Minister's clarification of the various amendments as we proceed with the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments before us are extremely important, particularly in view of the amendments introduced by the Minister, I had hoped the Minister would introduce amendments which would change fundamentally the context of the original Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990, but unfortunately what we see are very minor technical changes and the Bill <i>per se</i> stands.  For that reason the amendments tabled in the name of Deputy Monica Barnes in relation to the establishment of angling clubs and the recognition of existing clubs are more important than one would have originally assumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the House seriously considers the detail of the amendments before us because they were not tabled by chance; they were as a result of long discussion and negotiation by the Fine Gael Party with the various interested parties involved in angling.  This has gone on for quite a number of years and the result is that we concluded certain agreements with the rod licence group at the time &mdash; the 12 apostles as they were known &mdash; the executive which represented the angling interests from the <Col N="2356" /> various angling associations and federations across the country.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Barnes reflects the agreement, wishes and aspirations of those interests.  The Minister's amendments to subsequent sections of the Bill do not in any way reflect the wishes of the angling interests. I know there were meetings over the weekend between the Minister and the various representative groups but they were conducted in an extremely restricted environment.  While it may be said that some of the amendments tabled by the Minister were practically written by the angling interests, they do not represent the angling interests across the board, not do they reflect the interests of the executive or the representatives who were negotiating with the Minister, because of the limits imposed on them by the Minister and his Department in the course of the negotiations.  As a result, the amendments tabled by Deputy Barnes are extremely important and I appeal to all Members to seriously consider them.  The Minister should take some of them on board because they are fundamental to the issue.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 specifically refers to the definition of an angling club.  There may be weakness in the definition &mdash; and a number of Deputies made suggestions in relation to a broader definition with which Deputy Barnes and I would agree &mdash; but the Minister's Bill is weak because an angling club is not defined in any section. The Minister elaborates on co-operatives without defining what they are supposed to involve.  If the Minister does not define an angling club he cannot proceed any further.  However, it is not in the interests of angling for the Minister to proceed in this vein because, on Second Stage, we outlined the serious dangers which would arise in relation to the formation of co-operatives.  To date we have not had a clear view or direction in regard to the number of co-operatives which would be set up or who would control setting them up.  Of course, according to the Bill, the Minister has control over everything but there is a fear that there might be only one co-operative in every <Col N="2357" /> fishery board area, two at the most.  The Minister will decide, with the result that the ordinary rank and file anglers will have very little input.</P>
    <P>The very pleasant pastime of angling is now loaded with bureaucracy; the essence of the sport is being withdrawn from the fundamental activity and layers of bureaucracy are being imposed on what has been, traditionally, a very pleasant pastime.  The Minister's amendments do nothing to fundamentally change that fact.  In contrast, the amendments tabled by Deputy Barnes, while attempting to bring some order to angling, do not impose the same restrictions or bureaucratic diktat on the activity.</P>
    <P>We propose that angling clubs will be registered with the regional board in the area where the club operate.  The board would provide the names of the elected officers and the income and expenditure accounts for the previous year.  I appreciate Deputy Kenny's reservations in relation to that section but there is a need to bring coherence and order to the whole matter.  Indeed, back in 1988, various angling interests agreed that something along these lines should be presented to, and agreed with, the board.  I know there might be difficulties in relation to enacting it but when you go through a process a system evolves and everything will fall into place, although we appreciate it will not happen overnight.  The anglers from the salmon and trout federation and the angling associations agreed with that proposition.</P>
    <P>It is very important to note the contribution made by anglers to angling. Coming from County Cavan the Minister is very familiar with the level of contributions anglers make.  I am talking in particular about the preparatory work which must be done in relation to the preparation of spawning beds, the purpose of fry, access to the lakes and the provision of fishing stands on lakes and rivers.  All this work costs quite a lot of money and anglers make this voluntary contribution; they have never asked for a refund from the fishery boards and indeed have never got it.  In addition, <Col N="2358" /> there are further contributions and restocking by the fishery boards.  As a result, the two bodies have worked reasonably well over the years &mdash; this is more obvious in some areas than others &mdash; but there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal in relation to the development contribution, we are talking about the angling clubs making such a contribution to the fishery boards in the areas in which they operate.  That contribution could take the form of cash or a contribution in kind.  In most instances the angling clubs are making a contribution in kind far in excess of what a cash contribution could be.  That will have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The pollution which occured during the dispute was very obvious.  Indeed, there was extensive pollution of lakes and rivers when the fishing stopped.  It should be remembered that genuine anglers have an interest in having clear waters in our lakes and rivers.  They closely monitor lakes and rivers and, if something is amiss, they are in a position to report on it quickly and to minimise the problems which arise.  During the dispute the problems maximised rather than minimised; that is why we must take into account the contribution which anglers make in relation to the control of pollution on our rivers and lakes.  It is a policing of sorts which must be recognised by the fishery boards and the Minister. We are making a specific proposal in relation to the development contribution by anglers, that it shall not, at any time, exceed one-eighth of the overall expenditure in the lake, river or angling club area.</P>
    <P>It is important for the Minister to recognise this and to appreciate the work done by the anglers.  Work has not been appreciated and cash is not everything. Work of the nature the anglers are doing in relation to what I have said must be accepted and value placed on it.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at this amendment and if he cannot accept it at this stage of the debate perhaps he will consider bringing in on Report Stage something along that line.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barnes said, unless you <Col N="2359" /> have the full co-operation of the people on the ground and unless you repose some trust and confidence in them you are not going to get the best out of the people concerned.  People who have an interest in fishing have a very high sense of responsibility towards society and the areas they live in and they recognise the value of the rivers and lakes for their community.  Therefore, the Minister should not treat them almost as school children with everything being done at the order or dictation of the Minister. Things should be done in co-operation with the Department and the fishery board rather than by dictation from any layer of bureaucracy because people will not respond to that and it will not be in the best interests of developing the full potential of fishing.  This Bill is doing everything in the long term to damage angling right across the country.</P>
    <P>Co-operatives are grand if based on the principles expounded by Sir Horace Plunkett when he instituted them at the turn of the century.  If these principles were still in place that would be very good for the country but recent developments have highlighted only too clearly how open co-operatives are to abuse, to purchase by interested parties and to take over.  We have seen that in relation to the milk and beef industries.  Do we now want to set up co-operatives in the fishing industry so that 20 years from now we can have a repetition of what has occurred in the beef and the dairy industries, with the private sector making a take over bid for a fishing co-operative?  That is our fear on this side of the House.  We believe that working through the angling clubs that are in existence at the moment is the best way possible for the securing of the existing fishing rights.  We do not believe co-operatives will secure and protect the long term interests of fishing rights across the length and breadth of the country. While I appreciate the Minister's good intentions in the matter and the time and commitment he has given in attempting to resolve it since he took over as Minister for the Marine, we are concerned about the basic proposal of co-operatives <Col N="2360" /> because of the inherent danger of take-over in the long term and the resulting extinction of all fishing rights.  No longer would we have the freedom to fish.  The situation would be similar to that in Scotland and parts of England at the moment and fishing would become the pastime of the multi-millionaire class paying £3,000 a week to do so.  We do not want fishing on the lakes and rivers here to involve colossal sums of money for people coming on holidays to fish or for the ordinary citizens of this country.  There is an inherent danger in the Minister's proposal that this will happen.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look seriously at the amendments tabled by Deputy Barnes.  They are sensible and community-oriented. They aspire to the co-operation and goodwill the Minister seeks through co-operatives without the dangers that co-operatives will pose in the long term.  If he cannot accept the amendments now I hope he will bring in an amendment along these lines on Report Stage and accept the basic ethos behind what we are proposing.</P>

      <P>This is accepted by fishermen who know, so Deputies who never fished do not know that.  Fishermen are simple people who simply want to fish in peace and here the Minister has produced most complex legislation in order that they may do that.  We all know the purpose of this legislation.  It is in order that the Minister can retreat from an entrapped situation with some of his armoury. Fair enough, I know he generated this idea of co-operatives himself and he is very keen on it, but I know also that in this respect he has an open mind and if something better comes along he is willing to look at it and I am sure he will tell us so.</P>
      <P>The various amendments put down by Deputy Barnes point the way and are very worthy of consideration.  The angling clubs have done an enormous amount of work on Lough Arrow and all the lakes in the west and the lakes of Cavan and they deserve recognition for what has happened there.  Any threat to their continued existence is a very serious matter for the whole fishing industry.  The Minister should be very cautious about proceeding along the line he is following now.  It is possible to meet at least some of the amendments put down here with advantage to the fishermen, which is a primary consideration of everyone here, and thus get us a better Bill.  I think the Minister is trying to sort out the problem. In years to come the result may be that he has created a monster in the course of doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>As legislators here in Dáil Éireann we would do well to remember the old adage that no law is better than bad law.  I think it is accepted that the 1987 Fisheries Act was bad law, but I fear that what we propose to replace it with is equally bad and unworkable.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at it.  If we are to assume that the <i>raison d'être</i> for the original legislation was to safeguard the quality and quantity of angling opportunity, then if we were to go back to pre-1987 and concentrate our minds on introducing legislation for that purpose, would we embark on this bureaucracy of the co-operative movement being imposed on very strong and independent angling clubs who I think are being ignored, wrongly, by the Minister in his legislation?  There is obviously an effort to save political face and back out with some degree of dignity from the farce of the 1987 legislation.  We are seriously in danger of replacing that legislation with layers of bureaucracy which will entrap the spirit and the will of the anglers throughout Ireland and will eventually turn out to be as unworkable as the 1987 legislation.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the whole question of the co-operative concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson:</NameTxt>
      <P>The opinion of some of the contributors was ill-founded.  I will proceed to explain why I think that is so.  Section 1 defines terms which are of general application throughout the Bill. Particular attention in this regard should be paid to the definition of &ldquo;share certificate&rdquo; because a number of comments made by Members of the House so far would not have arisen if that definition had been attended to and absorbed.  The definition was inserted on the advice of the Attorney General with a view to clarifying that possession of a share certicate did not confer any rights of ownership. Deputy Taylor-Quinn talked about the danger of people taking over the co-operatives. What are they taking over?  They are taking over a co-operative which was set up to get funds to develop and protect our fisheries, so there is no question of big bad wolves of capitalists descending <Col N="2363" /> on us to purchase them.  They will not purchase anything from which there is nothing to be got.  Therefore, that particular canard can be shot down.</P>
      <P>I will do a little tour through the contributions that were made on amendments Nos. 5, 7, 13, 23 and 26.  The Attorney General's Office, which advises me with regard to legislation indicated that it was not necessary for the purpose of the Bill to have this definition.  As well as that, in the context of the co-ops as laid down in the Bill my proposals refer to coarse and trout fisheries, not to salmon fisheries.  Admittedly at the end of the Bill there are some liberal extensions of the salmon licensing system.  Deputy Barnes in her amendment refers to salmon.  It is inappropriate at the place and in that context.  I cannot understand the references to bureaucracy in the case of co-operatives.  The spirit of the co-operatives system &mdash; and my friends on the left should absorb this, if they know their left economic history &mdash; is such that in this country rural co-operatives have been far more important than town and city ones whereas in Britain the co-operatives in the towns and cities were more important.  There is nothing as simple as the co-operatives' structure.  I am afraid the word &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo; was imported by speakers here from other people who commented on the co-operative idea and who were opposed to the whole idea of it.  In rural areas simply structured co-ops have been very effective and very successful in my part of the country for up to 100 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson:</NameTxt>
      <P>Lakeland is not in my area but they are at the moment doing exceptionally well and are paying very good prices.  The people are delighted with what is happening there as with what is happening with Killeshandra and Lough Egish.  What I am saying is that co-ops are the essence of simplicity.  Anybody who looks fairly and squarely at the co-operative system will have to agree with that. <Col N="2364" /> Various speakers referred to discussions. I had discussions with fishermen fisher women right across the line.  I did not write the agenda.  They wrote it and I followed it.  I reject the suggestion that I made any attempt to inhibit discussion or to set an agenda or to confine discussion in my meetings with fishermen right up to and including last Friday.  In fact, I used the agenda of the various fishery representatives and when the agenda had been dealt with I allowed any other points to be raised.</P>
      <P>Great play was made about the interference by the Minister on the Second Stage debate.  The same kind of tune was being played here.  I thought I took on board a great deal of what was said on Second Stage.  I was wondering whether I was living in the same world at all.  I will just give the House an idea of some of the amendments I brought in rejecting powers that I was taking to myself on Second Stage.  Amendments Nos. 11, 24, 34, 40 and 46 were introduced by me. Incidentally, somebody also said that angling should be defined.  It is defined in the principal Act as amended by the Act of 1987.  I also introduced amendments Nos. 29, 38 and 53 and various others. That is not an exhaustive list.  I thought that somebody in the House might be fair minded enough to say that I had listened carefully to what was said and to accept that I had brought in amendments substantially changing the ministerial role in order to meet the wishes of the House. That did not happen, but one never despairs.</P>
      <P>I reject the idea that Deputy Gilmore had that this was a substitute for the licence.  It surprises me, coming from that source, that Deputy Gilmore did not have a deeper grasp of the whole idea of the co-operative system.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amazes me.  I met fishermen who said that they were anxious to contribute to the development and the protection of our fishery resource.  Our fishery resource is, as <Col N="2365" /> Deputy Barnes said, a very significant one in our economy.  This was an opportunity for people who said that they would not pay a licence fee but who did not object to making contributions.  This was a vehicle which would provide them with an opportunity to make contributions for the purpose of preservation and development of fisheries and to have complete control themselves in these co-operatives.</P>
      <P>The question of the role of the regional boards was raised.  Their role is defined in the Bill.  I think a very superficial reading of the Bill was evident from some of the contributions made.</P>
      <P>The next point made was that it was a challenge to the freedom of people who want to fish.  In fact, it provides them with an opportunity to develop the fisheries themselves and to make very important decisions about how the money would be spent and what developments would be made in consultation with the regional boards as defined in the Bill.  Deputy McCormack in particular failed to grasp the essence of co-operation, and I am sorry to say that.  He also got it wrong when he said angling clubs were not recognised, and some other Members said the same thing.  Of course, the clubs are recognised; a reading of section 8 is a clear indication that they are recognised and that, through the arrangements in section 8, their contributions will be recognised.</P>
      <P>I express the same surprise with regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's lack of understanding of what we are up to.  It is not a bureaucracy; it is a vehicle to help people who are anxious to contribute.  That is what they told me, and I believe them. They have been contributing in may ways to developments in their own areas and there is a framework there to enable them do that.  I ask Deputies to please read carefully the amendments I put down because it is as plain as a pikestaff that I have taken on board the suggestions made on Second Stage and embodied them in those amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consulted and listened to views, which sometimes were at variance and have had to make decisions between <Col N="2366" /> them but nobody can come into this House and say that the fishermen's various organisations were ignored because they were not.  Careful note was taken of their contributions in putting this legislation together.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan made the point that the individual was not catered for.  Let us take Seán de Brun from Cork who wants to fish, as an example.  If the local co-operative decide by a 60 per cent majority that the share certificate is necessary before one can fish in that area, then Sean dé Brun will have to get a certificate, his teastas.  However, if the local co-operative have decided it is not necessary then Sean dé Brun can fish.  It is very simple. Therefore it is not true to say that the individual is not catered for.</P>

I hope to bring most of those to bear, except that I cannot aim at the gracefulness of the swan's neck.  Deputy Kenny is anxious to ensure that funding will be available.  I am convinced, having listened to fishermen since late 1989, of their <i>bona fides</i> that they are anxious to contribute.  They have agreed with me the basic things in the Bill.  I have consulted right across the board and taken hints and suggestions from people who, in many cases, were opposed to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Taylor-Quinn, I have already mentioned that the amendments I have put down are very substantial. Almost every one of them &mdash; and I did not list them all &mdash; are in the realm of reducing ministerial powers.  I am asking for an open-minded assessment of the amendments by Members to reduce ministerial powers and interference. The Deputy referred to the 12 Apostles &mdash; I will come back to this matter again &mdash; but, if I took her up right, she indicated, that they had agreed to the Fine Gael amendment.  I am amazed by that.  I think the 12 Apostles is a suitable enough name as a good few of them were good fishermen; but I am amazed at <Col N="2368" /> Deputy Taylor-Quinn's suggestion that one of the amendments with which I will deal in a moment was agreed with the people she called the 12 Apostles.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with her suggestion that I put any limit on discussions.  That is not so.  We followed the agenda provided by the various fishermen's groups and there was an open &ldquo;any other business section&rdquo; at the end of each discussion.  I want to put that on the record of the House.  She also mentioned the number of co-operatives.  This question was also discussed with the fishermen's representatives. She said that the contributions of the clubs were being ignored, that is not so.  Even a superficial reading of section 8 would indicate that.  There is no way they are being told what to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds outlined what is being done by the clubs, which I accept. As he said, I had the privilege of opening one of their prime achievements in the Garadice area of County Leitrim, shortly to be linked by the canal with Ballyconnell and Enniskillen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon averred that fishermen were simple people and that, somehow or other, we were frustrating their simplicity. I know Deputy Nealon is a communicator. There is nothing complex about a co-operative society.  It is a vehicle through which the fishermen can do what they told me they wanted to do &mdash; make contributions to the development of fisheries.  I do not think Deputy Nealon read the Bill.  If he had done so he would not have made the statement that the clubs were being ignored.  The word &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo; was trotted out, a word which I cannot associate with the scheme I have outlined to the House and incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are discussing together amendments Nos. 7, 13, 23 and 26.  Amendment No. 7, taken with amendments Nos. 13, 25 and 26, seeks to require all angling clubs to register on an annual basis with the regional fisheries board and to pay a development contribution to the board. This principle is the direct opposite of the one on which I have been working.  It is entirely foreign to the ideas underlying my proposals and consequently I cannot <Col N="2369" /> accept it.  I gathered from Deputy Taylor-Quinn that she was indicating that fishermen's representatives had accepted the idea that the clubs should be registered on an annual basis with the regional fisheries board and that they should pay a development contribution to the board.  They never told me that, hinted at it or implied it.  This comes as a complete surprise to me.</P>

      <P>It is a surprise to me to hear from Deputy Taylor-Quinn that this principle was accepted by the 12 apostles representing some of the fishermen.  They never once hinted to me that they would accept that principle.  The principle which I was advancing was totally different and based on co-operation, people working together for a common cause.  All involved in fisheries have a common cause, namely the development and protection of fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the strength of his response.  I have noted that in certain parts of the Bill the Minister has gone some way towards removing some of the intervention or has provided that intervention may take place with the agreement of the societies. I still hold with the traditional co-operation and interdependence of fishermen and women <i>vis-á-vis</i> the regional boards. I take the point that the regional boards and the angling clubs are already defined in the Bill.  The core of my argument is that they are set up already and have been working.  The impetus given by this legislation will enable them to continue to work together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to highlight some of the thinking underlying the amendments which we have tabled.  We already have an existing co-operative structure which could be worked upon rather than creating a whole new structure.  It could integrate all the members and carry on development work on the expansion and protection of fisheries. Another structure is not needed.  I note that the Minister has tempered some <Col N="2370" /> of the sections which provide that the societies shall make their decisions in co-operation with him.  There are still unnecessary requirements imposed by the Minister with regard to the running of the co-operatives.  For instance, the Minister may appoint persons to fill vacancies among the trustees and may remove any trustee from office.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with regard to the casual fisherman or woman who is not a year-round angler but likes to spend the odd afternoon fishing.  We believe that year-round anglers who are truly committed will be members of an existing angling club.  A society when it is set up within a region could decide by 40 per cent of the vote whether Séan de Brún can or cannot go fishing.  A more acceptable arrangement would be to accept that the categories already specified in the Bill would be free to fish anyway.  I refer to those under the age of 18, the disabled and the unemployed.  It is hoped that tourists will pay part of the development fee through Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I hope angling clubs will be well enough acquainted with their area to know who is or is not a casual fisher and whether he or she can afford to become a member of the club.  I am worried that the shareholders in the society may have a certain level of income and may seek to make impositions on a person who would not share the same income level.  A type of discrimination could develop if societies imposed strict entry requirements.  Many clubs have the right to decide who can or cannot become a member and they can actually exclude more than they include. I know the Minister, being a democratic Cavan man, would not like to believe that these voting powers could be used against the casual fisher, man or woman. We will have to look at this much more closely.  My argument is that angling clubs as they are presently organised operate on a local level and know their own area and they would know on whom the demand that they become members of the angling club should be made and on the other hand they could always use their discretion where they felt that it <Col N="2371" /> should not be imposed.  What we are trying to do &mdash; and I know the Minister is trying to do the same too &mdash; is to leave the rivers and lakes as open as possible for the leisure and pleasure of people while at the same time making a rightful demand on the people who use them widely or those who can afford to contribute to their development, and I include visitors and tourists in that.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for taking some of our points on board.  He has now diluted some of his powers, or in fact shared them with the co-operative societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that traditionally a co-operative society was able to operate on its own and within its own shareholdings.  Everybody in this House knows that when a co-operative is working to the ideal on which it was based, it is a tremendous concept but we are all well aware that when something of value has been developed by the shared co-operation of members of a co-operative over the years bids can be made for it.  The Minister may suggest, and I can understand why, that we are not dealing with ownership, as for instance in the case of co-operatives we are most familiar with such as dairy co-operatives. However, I still believe that the structure we proposed of angling clubs under the direction of regional boards and under national boards do not provide the same opportunities for people to make bids or to use block voting to manipulate the situation.  Membership may or may not be voted upon, indeed the running of clubs may be voted on.  Having a vote confers power as well as tremendous responsibility.  We know that when people enter into voting blocks, they can manipulate the situation and they could discriminate or exclude persons, in a way that the Minister would not wish, nor indeed would any of us in this House. That is the reason I still ask why we <Col N="2372" /> cannot operate and build on the structures that are already in place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly his assertion that in this corner of the House at any rate there seemed to be some lack of understanding of the nature of co-operatives. I do not think it is sufficient for the Minister to call down the spirit of the co-operative movement and to appeal to the memory of its founders to justify what is in the Bill.  A co-operative is not a co-operative simply because you call it a co-operative.  The institutions that are being established under this Bill are far from co-operatives.  As I understand the nature of a co-operative, first it has to be voluntary and these are not voluntary bodies.</P>

      <P>I do not see agreed.  Co-operatives, as I understand them, appoint their own boards of management or their own committees but in this particular case the Minister lands into the middle of the board of the co-operative his own appointees.  Whatever these bodies are, they certainly are not co-operatives. They are in my opinion extensions of the arm of the Minister in order to collect funds at local level and in order to make charges at local level which the direct rod licence approach was not successful in doing.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what it comes down to.  I can understand only too well the difficulties the Minister found himself in when he inherited legislation which had become unworkable and where he had to negotiate his way out of it and establish a formula in order to save face while at the same time putting in place a mechanism for collecting moneys, because that is what the rod licence was in the first place.  It was a mechanism for collecting money because the Government were, at the same time, cutting back on the level of contribution that they were making to the regional fisheries boards.  The Minister in his introductory speech on Second Stage made it very clear that the dual purpose of this legislation was to replace the rod licence while at the same time providing a mechanism for the collection of money and the mechanism for doing this is these bodies which the Minister now calls co-operatives.  The amendments he referred to make some marginal changes in the degree of influence that he has over these bodies but in many respects the changes are for the worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned earlier the right of a co-operative to decide by a 60 per cent vote to prevent anybody who does not hold a share certificate from <Col N="2374" /> fishing or to require people, if they want to fish to hold a share certificate.  One of the amendments he is proposing and to which he referred is an amendment which would take out of the Bill the right of the society to rescind that 60 per cent vote so that once the 60 per cent vote is taken, up comes the ladder and it cannot be rescinded.  I do not regard that as improving the situation at all.  Deputy Barnes's amendment, as I understand it, is an attempt to put the angling clubs in the driving seat that would otherwise be occupied by the co-operatives.  I can see that that is an improvement on what the Minister is seeking.  I can understand that an arrangement whereby the angling clubs have a direct relationship with the regional boards and work out arrangements for development contributions and so on is preferable to an arrangement whereby that would be done through the co-operatives.</P>
    <P>However, I am still concerned about where that leaves the individual, the notorious Seán de Brun, who might want to spend his Sunday afternoon on the riverbank.  Seán de Brun has a long history. Seán de Brun very strongly resisted, down through the years.  He could not fish in certain rivers and lakes because the fishing rights were owned by absentee landlords and he resisted the rod licence when it was imposed.  I believe that Seán de Brun will resist a demand that he have a share certificate in his hand or pocket in order to go for his Sunday afternoon's fishing.  Equally I believe &mdash; and this is my principal reservation with regard to Deputy Barnes' amendment &mdash; he would resist a situation where, over the course of time, an angling club which would establish rights to the fishing in a particular river or lake or wherever would make rules or require that Seán de Brun, in order to fish, would have to be a member of an angling club.  I do not believe we can allow ourselves to get into that situation.  This row about the rod licence arose primarily because it was seen as an assault on a traditional freedom. We have to be very sensitive and very careful about the traditional freedom of <Col N="2375" /> the individual in this area.  It would be wrong to restrict that unnecessarily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I would take issue with his definition of co-operative.  I spent all my working life in co-operatives and I know a fair bit about the co-operative movement. The Minister is saying that a co-operative would be set up solely to get funds to develop the fisheries.  The same thing could be achieved through the fishing clubs.  They are in place and can get funds to develop a resource.  The Minister says a co-operative is a structure set up to get money to develop a resource.  Of course that is what a co-operative is, but a co-operative, according to the Minister's Bill, is a different thing altogether.  In this Bill the question of the Minister's controlling interest is mentioned 16 times.  I appreciate the Minister's concessionary amendments but I would like to know in how many of these amendments it is proposed to reduce the control of the Minister.  I will leave that to the Minister to answer.</P>
      <P>Co-operatives are usually registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, Hume Street, under the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Where will this new co-operative be registered?  Will there be a new centre set up for registering co-operatives?  How is a fisheries matter to be brought into the Department of Industry and Commerce?  Will we set up two different societies for the registering of co-operatives if we proceed with the idea of establishing a co-operative in the fisheries area?  This would have repercussions outside this Bill for the future of co-operatives.  We would have two separate Departments dealing with co-operatives.  How would we avoid the complication of co-operatives with similar names being registered with different societies?  I would like the Minister to address those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been an extraordinary amount of effort on the part of all concerned to get us back to the pre-1987 situation where we had free fishing on the lakes with clubs <Col N="2376" /> contributing to the development of the lakes which they were quite willing to do? Is this not an extraordinary way to try to amend the legislation that was so hurriedly introduced in 1987?  The more this goes on the more merit there must be in the idea of scrapping the whole thing.</P>
    <P>I said a few words in response to the Minister's challenge on Second Stage when he asked for a reply to his poem. I remember at the time saying to the Minister something that is more true now than it was then.  I said:</P>
    <P>There was a Minister for the Marine</P>
    <P>Who got caught in a net unforeseen.</P>
    <P>The net spread so wide,</P>
    <P>He could not avoid</P>
    <P>Amending the rod licence scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I can, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because the net has now spread so wide that the Minister cannot avoid amending the rod licence scheme.  However, I submit that he is not going the right way about it.  That is how I can relate my limerick to the debate and the amendment that we are now pursuing. I would suggest that the repercussions of setting up a co-operative as a solution to their licence problem would go far beyond what the Minister says.  In regard to getting people back out to fish on the lakes with as little restriction as possible, while at the same time taking up the offer of the angling clubs to contribute to the development and running of the lakes, this is an extraordinary way to go about that.  An extraordinary amount of effort is being put in by the <Col N="2377" /> Minister, and I acknowledge that.  He is not getting very much help from his colleagues.  The Progressive Democrats have not appeared in the Chamber since the debate on Committee Stage began.  I find that a little disturbing.  One of their Members in my constituency took a great interest in going out on the lake when we thought we had a settlement to the dispute.  I would like him to come in and give the Minister a hand now in what he is trying to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I reject completely what the Minister said about the co-operative movement and that our people here do not know how it operates.  I should like to point out very clearly to the Minister that we know quite an amount about the co-operative movement, credit unions and many other things of that nature. Some of us have been involved with them all our lives.  I am not the person who is talking about the bureaucracy, the confusion, the doubts or the fears which people have expressed.  The Minister himself has received the submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 4, the submission states with regard to the appointment of trustees, the societies must have an input into this area.  this requires clarification. On section 5 the submissions states that it is essential that there should be an input and further consultation with anglers before formalising these rules.  Also in relation to section 5, it is stated that this section has to be further clarified and enlarged upon.  This shows that the co-operative rules are a fundamental part of the scheme and must be drawn up.  These people have made umpteen submissions to the Minister, which they have given to me and to every other person in the House who would listen to them.  For my part I am not confused about it.  I can see the enormous dangers.  At this stage I hope the Minister recognises the genuine fears and in the Sean de Brún case he has clearly put my point into perspective.  A man who goes out on a Sunday afternoon on the River Lee or the Blackwater with his young son for an afternoon's pastime could be prevented from fishing under <Col N="2378" /> the provisions of the legislation before us today.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the debate and having studied the Bill and the amendments I am still not convinced that the Minister has got it right.  The Fine Gael amendment is a major improvement on what the Minister has said but I am still not satisfied with it.  The thrust of my argument was to take this Bill out of circulation, repeal the law, cut our losses and let us go back to prior 1987 when the Labour Party at that time saw the dangers and voted against the Bill.  At this stage it is essential that that message should go out from this House because under the provisions of the amendments problems will arise.  If the Minister pushes his Bill through the House there will be further confusion and there will be a backlash from the people who will be denied the right to fish in the manner in which they have fished for many generations.  I must put it on the record of the House that we are going down a very dangerous road because I foresee dangers from both sides &mdash; the club preventing the individual and the Minister's co-operatives which are not the issue.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to go back and look at the submissions given to him, to me, to Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Barnes regarding the confusion as regards the co-operatives.  The rules and regulations governing the co-operatives are stringent, and the Minister's heavy hand is in each one of them.  I have never seen a co-operative movement where a Minister came along and made certain rules and regulations governing the whole lot.  That is not how a co-operative operates and I am sure the Minister knows that.  Unfortunately, I cannot support the amendment in the name of Deputy Barnes.</P>

It is a non starter <Col N="2379" /> and, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, let us cut our losses and start again.</P>

      <P>I want to deal first and foremost with the fact that the Minister had never heard of a development contribution in the course of discussions and negotiations.  I admit to being amazed that he did not have a discussion in relation to a development contribution by the angling clubs to the fishery boards. If the Minister looked at the file on the entire rod licence dispute he would find that matter was dealt with extensively by his predecessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Had he copied <Col N="2380" /> them totally he might come up with an effective solution.  He has proposed the setting up of co-operatives which is not an effective solution.  In the course of his response he referred to the fact that he had not heard of a development contribution and that in fact, the idea of angling clubs paying a development contribution to the boards was the opposite to what he endeavoured to achieve.  He suggested he endeavoured to achieve goodwill, co-operation, comhar na gcomharsan.  As other speakers have said there is nothing in the Bill to suggest co-operation. To suggest that there is co-operation at this point, or indeed at any point, is misleading because the Bill specifically dictates and orders saying that the Minister by direction shall do this, that and the other.  I have studied the amendments to see where the powers of the Minister are diminished or deleted but in no section in relation to the co-operatives have I seen deletion of the powers of the Minister.  The only move that has been made is in relation to section 4 &mdash; which we are not dealing with at present &mdash; where the Minister proposes the deletion of subsection (2).  In relation to subsection (3), the Minister's proposed amendment is only a minor detail where he suggests that the words &ldquo;after such investigation or inquiry as he thinks fit,&rdquo; be inserted after &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Everything is to be done by order and there is no such thing as co-operation as suggested, it is all ministerial diktat.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister should say he had not heard of the development contribution or anything down that line and that the development contribution was a complete antithesis to what has been proposed in the Bill.  That is misleading. Not only is the Minister not proposing an angling club development contribution but he has specifically directed in the Bill that a share certificate shall be purchased and he has put prices on the various share certificates which shall be purchased by the various people who want to be shareholders in a co-operative. Where is the co-operation? There is no co-operation, it is dictation all the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2381" /> In relation to the Sean de Brún case about which Deputy Gilmore and Deputy G. O'Sullivan are concerned we, too, on this side of the House are extremely concerned about that case. That is why we have brought forward amendments which would try to accommodate as far as possible the wishes of the angling clubs and also the individual. At present angling clubs and fishery boards exist but that does not prevent Sean de Brún from going out fishing. Under these amendments we propose, if a similar situation were to exist, where there are angling boards, angling clubs and fishery boards that Sean de Brún would still be able to go out and do his fishing.  Most of the people who go fishing and are not involved in angling clubs are young people.  I have never heard of members of angling clubs interfering with young people who want to fish.  The other people who fish are anglers who come to the country on angling holidays.  When booking their holiday the various angling interests would be prepared to make a contribution through Bord Fáilte, towards angling in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2382" /> Most people are involved in angling clubs of some shape or form.  Even in areas where there are no angling clubs people fish in the local rivers.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity here to ensure that goodwill and reason supersede bureaucracy.  I hope the Minister appreicates that the amendments from this side of the House have not happened by chance.  As I have stated, these amendments were put down after discussions, negotiations and regular contact with the various interest groups.  This formula was regarded as the best suited to resolving the overall problems.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the sincerity of the contributions of Deputies on this side of the House.  The genuine concerns referred to by us reflect the concerns felt by many people throughout the country.  We had a serious shemozzle three years ago and we do not need a repeat of that.  I appeal to the Minister to take on board the sincere views expressed by Members on this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 29 and 30, to delete &ldquo;on such day as the Minister by order appoints&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not later than the 30th of April, 1991.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this House, and outside, who has ever fished, and even those who live with people who indulge in, particularly mayfly fishing, knows the first days of May are most important.  People living in areas where the mayfly rises send messages to anglers to come and fish.  I know the Minister, and everybody, will appreciate why it is of the utmost importance that the Bill is passed quickly.  I hope it will be a constructive Bill that takes into account the concerns of everybody, particularly Deputy O'Sullivan.  Fishers, men and women, realise the mayfly rises only for a limited period and at no definite time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that this legislation is passed and that fishermen are satisfied with it as they embark on one of the most important fishing seasons of the year.  Apart from mayfly fishing, <Col N="2385" /> which is one of the great celebrations for all fishing people, we are also aware that, in those early months, a tremendous number of tourists come to this country. I hope they will be able to participate in fishing and that our tourist season will begin in early May.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister and the House that the date for the Bill to be enacted should not be later than 30 April 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barnes because it is very important for the Bill to be enacted by 30 April.  In relation to the last Bill, unfortunately Bord Fáilte produced brochures saying that there was free fishing in Ireland. Indeed, a number of people in the tourist industry went to the Continent and to England trying to attract tourists here. Although a licence was required to fish, the Board Fáilte brochures said that fishing was free.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that free fishing is one of our major tourist benefits.  It is very important for people in the tourist industry to know where they stand because, with the shortfall in tourists from America, it is vitally important to have an increase in tourists from continental Europe and Britain.  If there is active and aggressive promotion by people interested in coarse fishing it will pay dividends because it is the one area in which we can dramatically increase the number of tourists.  That is why this legislation should be enacted before 30 April.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the point Deputy Barnes made in relation to mayfly fishing. There is great interest in mayfly fishing in parts of my constituency and, as Deputy Nealon said, Lough Arrow is one of the best &mdash; if not the best &mdash; trout fishing lakes in the country.  Many people are waiting, with bated breath, to see whether this legislation will be in place before the season opens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments behind this amendment as it is desirable that the legal position regarding fishing should be regularised as quickly as possible.  It should, ideally, be put in <Col N="2386" /> place in time for the mayfly season. However, I am not optimistic.  If this were simply legislation repealing the 1987 and simply abolishing the rod licence, it could get quick passage through the House &mdash; and the Seanad &mdash; and could be in place by the end of April.  Unfortunately, that is not the case; parts of this legislation are quite complex, others controversial. At the rate of progress today, it will take some time for the legislation to be teased out on Committee Stage and Report Stage and then sent to the Seanad.  The House will rise on 22 March, I understand, there are the Easter holidays and, in between, we will have to debate the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill. In addition, the whole system of local government must be reorganised in time for the local elections to go ahead in June. Quite honestly, I cannot see this Bill being enacted by the end of April. Regrettably, we will be going into another tourist season with a highly ambiguous situation in regard to fishing, where legislation is in place, and the best that can be done is for the enforcers of the legislation to turn a blind eye to it. While I agree, as I said, with the sentiments I am not optimistic that the target can be met.</P>

      <P>Normally I would not oppose the Minister's right to bring in legislation as he sees fit because, taking everything into consideration, it is something we would allow him to do. However, there is urgency attached to this legislation as many people have the threat of court proceedings and imprisonment hanging over their heads.  There is confusion in other countries regarding whether people can fish here and that is why putting a time constraint on the Minister to bring in legislation is so urgent.  Prior to Christmas, we got the <Col N="2387" /> impression that the legislation would be introduced early in the year and that we would probably be well on the way to having it finalised before the Easter recess.  However, it appears as if it will be a long time before the Bill is finalised. That is why there is a degree of urgency attached to putting a date for having the Bill finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barnes's amendment for reasons which have been clearly outlined to the House. The most compelling one is that the mayfly season starts on 1 May, the beginning of serious angling right across the country.  There are difficulties so far as anglers and tourists are concerned. There are also difficulties for business people whose livelihoods are involved and, for that reason, there is a need to regularise the matter.  In addition, there is the extraordinary situation where there is legislation in existence which is the law of the land and which has never been repealed by this House although suggestions were made over a year ago that this should be done.  However, technically speaking, it is still on the Statute Book and is the law of the land.  Quite a number of people across the country &mdash; particularly in the west &mdash; have summonses hanging over their heads, I understand that many chief superintendents in the Garda have summonses ready to be issued but are not sure whether they should do so.  They are in a dilemma as they want to ensure that law and order are observed but they do not know their position.  The poor unfortunates who are supposed to have broken the law, which is now on the shelf, do not know whether they will be before the courts for breach of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter will not be sorted out until proper legislation is put through this House to resolve it.  I compliment Deputy Barnes on tabling this amendment which is wise and appropriate.  If the Minister and his Department recognised the seriousness with which this side of the House view the matter he would take <Col N="2388" /> on board some of our suggestions and amendments.  The matter could be very quickly and readily resolved and peace and normality could be restored by 30 April &mdash; before 1 May and the mayfly. Maybe the Minister cannot accept the amendments now because he wants to be in a position to consider very seriously Report Stage amendments being tabled by this side of the House, and he will have to consult seriously with this Department. If he cannot accept the amendments it would be good to think that that might be one of his reasons.</P>

      <P>In introducing this Bill for Second Reading on behalf of the Labour Party, I have very mixed feelings. While I sincerely hold the belief that Irish citizens living abroad have the undeniable right to vote in their native country, there is also the disgrace that so many thousands of our people have been forced to go abroad to seek a living.  For nearly 150 years the accepted practice has been that emigration is inevitable and a complacency has been allowed to set in where in modern Ireland the free movement of labour has now become the trendy phrase for forcing people to seek a living abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2389" /> The horrific figures which have recently been disclosed regarding emigration from this country do not spell out the heart-break, hopelessness, frustration and anger which so many of our people feel and endure.  The statistics hide the human problem which successive Governments have failed to remedy, a human problem which successive Governments never had the will to tackle.  The safety value of emigration has been and is being used by past and present Governments as a means of containing our critical unemployment problem.  It is the classic case of &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen on our television screens trainloads of refugees leaving Eastern Europe because they have been denied their democratic rights. For many years we have witnessed the exodus of thousands of our people by plane and boat because they have been denied their moral rights, that is, the right to live, work, rear their children and grow old in their native land.  We must never forget this problem did not start this year or last year but has existed for nearly 150 years.  Forced emigration was a tactic used by a ruthless and uncaring British colonial administration which used emigration both as a means of weakening the Irish nation and building up their colonial empire.  It was a choice given to a proud people &mdash; starve or emigrate.  It is to the eternal shame of our native Governments that, for nearly 70 years, they have continued the same tendency to do nothing to address this shameful haemorrhage of our people.</P>
    <P>From my native port of Cork, thousands of people, men, women and children, were battened down into the holds of filthy ships with their only hope the promise of a new life in a new land, but often destined only to be consigned to the cruel depths of the North Atlantic having died of consumption, pestilence and malnutrition.  These coffin ships were the only escape route to America and very often emigrants spent their life savings on the fare and borrowed from their neighbours to pay for their passage to America.  In many cases their only belongings were a pitiful bundle of <Col N="2390" /> clothes, with just enough food to last the journey.  All they had to offer a new employer was their strength and willingness to work.</P>
    <P>These savage acts were carried out by a brutal alien government, and what is incomprehensible is that emigration with all its tragic side affects has been allowed to continue by subsequent Irish Governments with no real effort being made to find a real solution or to utilise fully the resources of this country to provide worthwhile jobs for all our people, control of which has been in our hands for three generations.</P>
    <P>Emigration, especially the forced emigration I have mentioned, has been a feature of Irish economic and social life for the last number of years and is an uprooting, alienating process.  Unfortunately, some of our emigrants end up as virtually stateless, unable to vote in the country of which they are citizens and unable to vote in the country in which they are resident.  They see no reason Irish citizens should be deprived of one of the most basic rights of any citizen simply because they have been forced to live and work abroad.  Ironically, all the emigrants who have left Ireland in the years since 1986 are still included in the 1986 census figures on which the recent Dáil constituency revision was based.  If the revision had taken account of the scale of emigration at that time there would be six fewer seats in this House as a result, and still emigrants are unable to vote.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have heard the Minister for Finance and Government spokespersons outlining policies for an upswing in the economy and figures have been presented which show an increase in investment.  I suggest this is a repetition of the performance of past Governments and past Ministers and will do nothing to lighten the burden, dispel the disillusionment or restore the faith of our young people who are forced to seek a living in New York, Boston, Birmingham, Kilburn and Camden Town, for what we are experiencing is an <Col N="2391" /> upsurge in the economy which is benefiting principally a select few.  The benefits from that economic upsurge have not trickled down to the people who are desperately searching for a job, who have never known what it is to work and whose only prospect is to seek a living abroad or a life on the dole.  The rising tide has lifted not all the boats.</P>
    <P>We have failed our unemployed people before now and unless there is a complete change in strategy and a new approach we will fail them again and again and those young people now attending schools and colleges throughout the country will have no alternative but to follow the emigrant trail to Britain, Europe and the US and hope that whatever education they have will enable them to survive and perhaps prosper in a foreign land.  Under the present electoral system they will do so disenfranchised, deprived of the right to vote in their own country, truly the sign of ultimate betrayal by their native Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, while conditions of transport and communications have improved and have been modernised, the basic rights of Irish people to participate actively and fully in their national affairs have not changed.  Many of our exiles who have been forced to seek work abroad have not reneged on their responsibilities at home.  Many a hard earned pound has found its way back home to help educate the young brothers and sisters and to keep the old in relative comfort. These emigrants have contributed quietly and at great cost and personal sacrifice in a very big way to the economy of this country.  We hear much about investment going out of Ireland but we hear very little about the inflow of emigrants' earnings.  Money earned on the building sites, in the bars and offices in Boston and Birmingham has filtered back to Ballinrobe, Ballyhaunis and Ballydehob to help those in need, the unemployed, the old and the young.</P>
    <P>Many of our exiles, particularly in Britain, have experienced hostility due to the despicable actions of subversive organisations in their indiscriminate <Col N="2392" /> attacks on public and civilian targets.  We saw the reaction of the British public and the police force to the now infamous Birmingham Six.  While the Six were from Northern Ireland, nevertheless the fact that they were Irish was enough to condemn them to 16 years of wrongful imprisonment.  Many of our people suffered in the vicious backlash felt throughout mainland Britain during that time. The Irish once again suffered in a foreign land.</P>
    <P>Our emigrants suffered in the early part of this century in the US and in Britain when satirical magazines depicted the Irish as being uncouth, loutish and ignorant.  Signs appeared banning black people and Irish people from lodging houses, bars and hotels.  In the fifties and seventies in Britain our people also suffered due to the irresponsible and futile campaign of the IRA.  Surely in the nineties it is time our Government responded to the plight of our emigrants by allowing them to vote in their homeland.  Many innocent Irish people have borne the brunt of this hostility.  Yet while they are identified as being Irish they are not treated as equals in the Irish electoral system.  They are left in limbo.</P>
    <P>While the majority of our European partners enjoy the right to vote in their country of origin in most elections, there is not any such right for the Irish.  We are constantly told to act as Europeans. Ireland is one of the few remaining countries in the European Community which disenfranchises its emigrants, contributing futher to the alienation of the emigrant community.  Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Holland, Spain and Portugal have provided voting rights for their emigrants in some or all elections. The publication of this Bill by the Labour Party now offers a unique opportunity for all the political parties who accept in principle the right of Irish citizens living abroad to vote in Irish elections, to do something concrete and bring Ireland into line with the rest of Europe, by supporting this Bill.</P>
    <P>My constitutency of Cork North Central has not escaped the devastation of emigration.  I, like many other Deputies, <Col N="2393" /> have visited the emigrants abroad.  The forceful message I have taken home from them is &ldquo;for God's sake stop playing political football with our lives&rdquo;.  It is for this reason that the Labour Party are supporting the principle of providing our emigrants abroad with the right to vote, a right that was won at a terrible cost, a right that was paid for with the lives of our forefathers.  We have not any authority to deny any of our citizens that right, whether they work in Tuam or Timbucktoo. I would be less than honest if I did not put on the record of this House the fact that many of our people abroad showed little interest in participating in Irish elections.  The feeling they expressed was that they could not care less about a country that had failed them so badly.  For many, the emigrant trail was the only pathway to a future which had independence and dignity.</P>
    <P>Financial help to the emigrant groups looking after the welfare of our people abroad, while welcome, is pitifully inadequate. Equally important as financial support is the fact that our people abroad have a meaningful role to play in affairs at home.</P>
    <P>What is incredible is that in 1989 the week before our general election, 35,000 expatriate Poles in New York were able to vote, despite the reputation of the totalitarian regime in Poland, a regime which we in the Republic of Ireland have often criticised as one denying basic human rights.  Yet on production of a passport or driving licence, Polish emigrants were allowed to exercise their franchise and vote in a vital election.</P>
    <P>An estimated 6.9 million illegal Mexican citizens in the United States will be able to vote in their next presidential election, yet the Republic of Ireland will only allow embassy staff and UN representatives &mdash; a mere 100 people in the US &mdash; the right to vote.  Ireland denies over 200,000 Irish people in the United States alone the basic human right of voting in Irish elections if they so wish.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if accepted, would put Irish people abroad into the mainstream of potential life in this country here, and would be an important factor in reaching <Col N="2394" /> out a hand to those who, through no fault of their own, had no option but to leave their native land.  Extending this hand would strengthen the links between our people at home and abroad, and prove that although they are living in a foreign country, their opinions and voice are still heard, and, more important, still matter. Surely, if we cannot give our people employment in their own country, we have a moral obligation to give them a vote.</P>
    <P>As we approach St. Patrick's Day, our day of national celebration, our thoughts naturally turn to out people overseas. Many thousands of Irish emigrants have done well in the countries of their adoption. They have played major roles in their chosen professions, in business, religion and politics.  They have been instrumental in organising the great trade unions of Britain and the United States. They have made an enormous contribution to the legal and administrative needs of their adopted countries.  In many cases they reached the very pinnacle of success.  Two Presidents of Irish extraction stood in this Chamber and addressed Dáil Éireann.  Irish emigrants, when given the opportunities, proved that they could reach the top of their professions. They have made an indelible mark in the history of the world.</P>
    <P>As Government Ministers prepare to travel abroad to celebrate our national day, is it too much to ask &mdash; too much to hope &mdash; that this year they will take to our emigrants the news that the Irish Government have accepted in principle the granting of the right to vote to our emigrants with whom they will celebrate our national day?  Such an acceptance would be positive proof that the elected representatives of this country really care for those who have been forced to go abroad to find work.  Is it not hypocritical of us on the one hand to deem those resident abroad to be one of us &mdash; one of our own &mdash; and at the same time to deny them the right to vote?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that this is one of the easier problems to solve &mdash; all it takes is political will.  By publishing this Bill, we have initiated the process.  The <Col N="2395" /> principal features of the Bill are: people who have emigrated within the last 15 years can apply for a postal vote in certain elections if they are 18 years of age or when they reach the age of 18; emigrants will retain the entitlement to vote in those elections for up to 15 years after emigration; the elections in which they will be entitled to exercise their postal vote include all elections and referenda with the exception of of local elections, and their vote will normally be exercised in the constituency where they were last resident;</P>
    <P>The Bill confers the necessary powers on the Minister for the Environment to ensure that there would be no abuse of the system, by introducing regulations and safeguards with the consent of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in its objectives, sets out to rectify a situation which has been allowed to continue for far too long and to provide for a choice of systems of voting &mdash; postal, embassy or consular &mdash; for those properly registered in their home constituencies. It would also give the Minister certain powers to introduce regulations to curb any abuse as he sees fit.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have been to the forefront in supporting the essential value behind the campaign to give voting rights to emigrants.  In publishing the Bill we have made a positive and concrete contribution to that debate.  There is no impediment in the Constitution to extending voting rights to emigrants.  As outlined in the Bill, it is relatively straightforward to establish such rights. The Bill outlines the method of registration but most important it would establish for the first time in our history the principle of votes for our people abroad and by so doing it would strengthen the ties and links which bind our nation to other continents throughout the world.</P>
    <P>This year we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Rising.  I can think of no better way or no more appropriate gesture than to reach out to our people across the Atlantic, the Irish Sea and in the southern hemisphere and grant them, <Col N="2396" /> our emigrants, the recognition which is rightfully theirs.  We have failed them once, let us not fail them a second time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, has made a very fine case to the Minister on why he should accept the principle of the Bill at least and establish voting rights for our emigrants.  We, in the Labour Party, are well aware that we do not have available to us the wise heads and the knowledge that is available to him within the Department and, consequently, the Bill may not be as watertight as we would like for our emigrants.  I hope that when the Minister responds tonight he will accept the principle of the Bill and indicate not only to the people in this country but to the many thousands who have emigrated during the past decade that they will be entitled to have their say in determining the Members of this House and of the European Assembly.</P>
      <P>As politicians, we are all aware that such a radical proposal, as is being put forward here, presents dangers for Governments and for political parties but as my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, said, if we do not have an out of sight, out of mind attitude to our emigrants the Minister will adopt the Bill.  Our emigrants have been written off all too easily as we are aware that they are most likely to oppose us if the Government fail to produce in this House radical proposals and policies to create employment at home.  They will be the people most aggrieved and, unfortunately, they do not have a say in this country.  They cannot make a decision on politicians of all parties whose policies had the effect of sending them abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister introduced a Bill relating to the revision of Dáil constituencies. That revision was based on the 1986 census and, although constitutionally correct, was flawed in the sense that it was not based on the actual population of the country at that time.  I am of the view that the Minister should have delayed the revision and had a census carried out which would have <Col N="2397" /> allowed him to gauge the extent of emigration since 1986.  It has been said that as many as 200,000 people have left this country since then.  Nobody can say for certain whether this is the true figure but we can arrive at a consensus on the actual figure by a number of ways.</P>
    <P>For example, and this is perhaps the most valid figure and one of which we are all aware, we could examine the figures for the two general elections which have taken place since the 1986 census.  The total electorate for the general election held on 17 February 1987, in the middle of winter, was 2,445,000 of which 1,793,406 voted.  The next general election took place two years and three months later in June 1989 and strange as it may seem the register of electors indicated that the figure for the number of people entitled to vote was 3,300 greater than the figure for 1987, yet on that day, in perfect weather, 1,677,592 voted, 115,000 fewer than voted in the previous election.  I should remind the Minister that the European elections were held on the same day so the amount of publicity which normally goes with a general election was almost doubled.  We cannot say people were put off or that there was some reason people failed to turn out other than that the vast majority of that 115,800 had left the country.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the figures for some countries for those two general elections.  Let me take my home country first in case the Minister gets the idea that emigration affects everywhere except Wicklow.  I can tell him that 3,500 people fewer voted in Wicklow in 1989.  As we are all aware, when we wondered after the election why the percentage was down to the low sixties as against the middle seventies two and a half years earlier, it was quite clear in every case, as my colleague has said, that the vast majority of those 3,500 people were in such places as Birmingham, London, Melbourne and Boston.  This figure includes many young people with families who had left the country with them and so had no vote.  In two and a quarter years my constituency lost over 4,000 people through emigration.  In case the Minister <Col N="2398" /> feels aggrieved because I have not mentioned his area, 4,500 fewer people voted in the two constituencies in Mayo.  In Meath it was almost the same figure &mdash; around 4,500.  The effect was uniform across all counties.  In Dublin Central 6,000 fewer people voted that day and in Limerick 5,500 fewer people.  In Cavan-Monaghan 4,392 people fewer voted in the 1987 elections.  It was a perfect summer day with two important elections taking place.</P>
    <P>We have some statistics to quantify the effect emigration has had over the whole of Ireland and I suggest to the Minister that they are the figures on which he should have based his revision.  We would have had fewer Deputies in the Dáil if we had had an up-to-date census.  That was not the case.  There might have been changes in some counties that some of us might not have liked, but we have an opportunity to fight our cause in Ireland whereas the people who emigrated had not the opportunity to voice their opinion on the people who went forward in 1987.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this measure is a benefit to this party or to the Opposition in general or to any particular political party.  We are putting forward this Bill because it is the right thing to do by our emigrants, people who have had to leave us.  Recently an economist suggested that the economic miracle that we have seen is being threatened because due to the downturn in the economies of the United States and Great Britain some emigrants are returning and this will threaten the macro-economics of the budget because the figures for social welfare do not accurately reflect returning emigrants and there are no houses in the country for people joining the long queues for local authority houses.  He said that in various ways the returning emigrants would pose a problem.  These are young Irish men and women who, frustrated at the fact that they could not be employed here, left the country and finding the same situation now occurring, particularly in the south of England and in various parts of the United States, and frustrated by the fact that green cards are not available to them in the States, feel <Col N="2399" /> that they should be able to return home and expect a living here.  That unfortunately is not the case and will not be the case for some years to come.  The least we can do is say to them that if we cannot give them a job we can give them a vote if they cannot come home, which will allow them to pass judgment on the administration who may be the cause of their being emigrants.</P>
    <P>This is a bold suggestion being made by the Labour Party and we hope the Minister will accept it.  He should not feel that people may be annoyed at having to leave the country.  They will surely feel that this country has some regard for them and that they too can have a say in how it is being run.  It would certainly have the immediate effect of all of us becoming aware of the cause of emigration, and being more urgent in our approach to the difficulties of people who have to leave this country through no fault of their own.  A lot of nonsense is talked about our being Europeans and it being good for us to go abroad to educate ourselves in the languages, customs and traditions of other countries.  It is said this is one of the reasons so many people have left.  We all know that the basic reason for the high level of emigration is the failure of successive administrations to keep to the forefront the problem of unemployment which results in emigration. That should always be the most urgent priority in our approach to the economy.  For too long we have had the balancing of the books which depends on sending young people abroad.  Young people come second and emigration has been the safety valve of this nation for too long.</P>
    <P>Our party in putting forward a radical proposal of this type deserve the support of all sides of the House.  The Minister will receive the congratulations of people around the world if he takes a bold step in this direction.  If emigrants from other countries in the EC can vote at European elections &mdash; Italians in Brussels or Greeks in Germany &mdash; then the mechanics of operating the election cannot be beyond the wit of those ladies and gentlement in <Col N="2400" /> the Department of the Environment.  It may present some small challenge where the electorate is further afield but it is a proposal which can be put into effect. My colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan suggested methods by which the vast majority of our emigrants could have the opportunity to cast a vote in a general or European election.  The Minister may raise problems in this regard but that will not be the real reason for refusing to accept this Labour Party Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will agree to adopt this proposal and will not say that the Government are considering similar legislation.  That would mean forgetting about it for years.  I hope the Minister will give this top priority in his Department and arrange some sort of timetable so that this can be in place by the next general election, be it sooner or later.  I strongly urge the Minister to attempt to meet the bold policy the Labour Party are putting forward in regard to votes for emigrants.  He would be respected not just by people here but all over the world for doing something for our emigrants in 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming back to office in 1987 the major objective of the Government has been to restore the economic strength of the country.  We embarked on this policy with a determination and a degree of success which, without exaggeration, has won admiration at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>We made economic recovery our primary objective because we recognised that economic malaise lay at the root of a great many of the country's ills.  We recognised, in particular, that the only solution to involuntary emigration lay in the pursuit of vigorous policies which would turn the economy around and thus remove the root cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can claim substantial success in our efforts.  The improvement in the quality of life and, consequently, in national confidence is evident all around us.  The rate of emigration has fallen substantially and there is strong evidence <Col N="2401" /> that emigrants are, in fact, returning in quite substantial numbers.</P>
    <P>In addressing the causes of emigration at home, the Government have been mindful of their responsibilities to those who have already left.  Through our diplomatic and consular missions, we adopted specific measures to meet the range of difficulties that face some of our emigrants. The Government committed themselves to the continued provision of all possible assistance and appropriate back-up services to emigrants to ensure that their welfare needs are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>This determined approach in dealing with the welfare problems of emigrants is clearly demonstrated in the excellent work being achieved by the DÍON Committee in Britain.  With the majority of our emigrants still going to Britain, the committee under the aegis of the embassy in London, are charged with monitoring the situation facing emigrants in Britain, liaising with the various welfare and advise centres there and providing financial support for the work being carried out for the benefits of these immigrants.</P>
    <P>The Government also attach the gratest importance to the need of our emigrants to the United States &mdash; the other great traditional destination for Irish migration.  Some recent US immigration legislation had placed Irish immigrants at a disadvantage.  The Government pulled out all the stops to encourage our friends in Congress to promote reform measures to address this anomaly and they did so with great success.</P>
    <P>In addition to their efforts to achieve legislative changes, the Government have sought to improve the welfare and advice services that are available to the newly arrived Irish emigrants in the United States.  Immigration working committees under the aegis of our consulates have been established to co-ordinate the activities of the main organisations in the immigration area with a view to tackling the most pressing welfare issues.</P>
    <P>The fact that Government spending on information and welfare services for emigrants has increased by a factor of up to five in a very short time provides solid <Col N="2402" /> evidence of the Government's concern and the practical steps they have taken for the benefit of emigrants.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters in order to set the scene, to put it on the record that the Government's concern for emigrants has two major elements: first, to remove as far as possible the root causes of involuntary emigration and second, to provide emigrants with the practical support and back-up facilities that they need.</P>
    <P>The Government's position is one of solid practical down-to-earth concern and support, not a matter of sentiment, public relations gestures, slogans or catch-cries.</P>
    <P>Let me now come directly to this Private Members' Bill which proposes to extend voting rights to certain emigrants. This is an important question demanding an open, honest and constructive debate on all its aspects.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is that emigrants of up to 15 years standing would have the right to be registered as electors and to vote at elections other than local government elections.  It is proposed that voting should be by post but that the Minister for the Environment should have power to modify the legislation relevant to postal voting in any way he considers necessary in order to bring the scheme into operation or to safeguard the integrity of elections.</P>
    <P>This would be done by regulations which would require approval in draft form by both Houses.  In other words, this Bill, at best, purports to deal only with the issue of principle.  All the essential implementation arrangements are ignored and left to be dealt with in a separate measure or measures to be brought before both Houses later.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government indicated that the feasibility of granting voting rights to recent emigrants would be examined and this has been done.  A great deal of thought has, in fact, been given to the issues of principle involved and to all the potential implications.  The matter is a complex one, demanding very serious and objective consideration and it should not be decided on the basis of <Col N="2403" /> emotion or through gamesmanship on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>I might mention in passing that there is obviously a very wide divergence of view on the Opposition side about how the matter should be addressed.  This is evident from the fact that the preferred solution of the main Opposition party, whatever view they may take tonight, is to give emigrants the right to elect an additional three Members to the Seanad, and they have brought forward their own Private Members' Bill to provide for this.</P>
    <P>There is, an extensive range of issues which must be addressed in considering any proposal to extend voting rights to persons resident outside the State.  I propose to devote my contribution in large measure to identifying these issues.  I know the House will wish to consider them in a responsible and constructive way.  On an issue such as this, it is easy to score cheap points, but let us face reality, let us look at the facts fairly and squarely and then take our decision in the best interests of all the people involved whether at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>Let us first take the numbers involved, if this Bill were passed, because numbers are of the essence so far as any electoral question is concerned.  At this stage, figures can only be approximate.  The numbers involved would eventually be determined by the pattern of future emigration, any cut-off point decided on &mdash; if a cut-off were acceptable at all &mdash; the actual registration and voting arrangements put in place and the level of takeup by eligible persons.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to arrive at a realistic and authoritative figure based on emigration statistics and virtually impossible to project such a figure into the future. Emigration is influenced by many factors, not just the economic, social and political circumstances at home and abroad.  Emigration can be subject to sudden and dramatic fluctuation.  For example, we had a migratory inflow in the seventies and we had high emigration in the eighties. The current level is substantially lower and there is reason to believe that significant changes in the pattern may now <Col N="2404" /> be taking place.  The emigration figures available are net, that is outward less inward migration.  There is no age break-down but we can accept that the typical emigrant is a young adult and, hence, that a very high proportion of emigrants would be of voting age.</P>
    <P>The CSO estimate that net emigration between 1981 and 1990 was in excess of 166,000.  In the <i>Population and Labour Force Projections</i> publshed by the CSO, net annual average emigration up to 1996 is assumed to be somewhere between 15,000 and 30,000.  If we take the most optimistic figure and if we assume a cut-off point of 15 years as proposed in this Bill we could, at a very conservative estimate, expect a potential increase of about 250,000, or an increase of some 10 per cent in the total electorate spread over the 41 Dáil constituencies; this would average out at about 7,000 per constituency which in some cases would exceed the quota for a Dáil seat.</P>
    <P>In this respect alone, the Irish situation is very different from that of some other countries which allow their citizens abroad to vote.  For example, in the US which has an open-ended voting arrangement for citizens abroad, the number of electors outside the country is about 1 per cent &mdash; and this covers all citizens, not just those born in the USA.  If one were to apply that yardstick to the Irish situation, the number of non-resident electors could exceed those at home.</P>
    <P>I am sure people will come up with other figures but, in my considered view, the ball-park figure cannot be less than 250,000.  In support of this I would cite the British census of 1981 which showed that persons born in the State and resident in Great Britain at that time totalled 611,941.</P>
    <P>I should point out at this stage that bearing in mind the provisions of this Bill, I am confining my analysis to the question of conferring voting rights on emigrants who were on the electoral register here or would have been entitled to be on the register had they remained here.  But there are much larger issues to be considered if we take account of the very wide definition of Irish citizenship <Col N="2405" /> and the large numbers of Irish citizens living abroad who never resided here. These issues would obviously need to be addressed by constitutional lawyers in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The constitutional implications of this Bill have several aspects but I will deal with just one.  Article 40.1 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  The principal objective of this provision is to secure that legislation will not discriminate invidiously as between citizens or categories of citizens.  It follows that where a distinction is drawn between different categories of citizens, the categorisation must be justifiable objectively by reference to real differences in situation.  The question could be asked &ldquo;is it reasonable to give the vote to a person who is absent for 15 years and deny it to a person absent for 15 years and one day?&rdquo;  This seems to me to be an arbitrary cut-off point, and very difficult to justify objectively on any grounds.  So, too, would any other cut-off point.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to develop this point in great detail or detain the House by extensive quotations.  I simply say that the question of equality before the law is discussed in some detail in the late Professor John Kelly's work on the Irish Constitution.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Constitution might demand a more substantive criterion. We might be expected to use a more sophisticated yardstick which would measure genuine differences in the situations of the persons involved.  It might be necessary to have regard not just to the length of absence but also to matters such as the nature and purpose of the absence, the nature and extent of any continuing links with this country and the emigrant's status in the country of residence including, in particular, the position in relation to civic and voting rights in that country.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the principle of &rdquo;one man one vote&rdquo;.  Citizens of Ireland resident in the UK have full voting rights at UK elections.  I might say in parenthesis that, of course, certain institutions there are not elected, including the Head of <Col N="2406" /> State and the Upper House.  Is it appropriate that emigrants should have voting rights in two states, in particular that they should be able to vote for two separate sovereign parliaments?  In this regard, Irish emigrants in the UK are in an entirely different situation from those resident in any other country.  It would seem reasonable that any new voting regime should take account of this factor in one way or another.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to point to a specific constitutional provision, nor, so far as I am aware, to any international instrument which would actually prohibit voting for more than one sovereign parliament but it would seem to be contrary to the norms of political philosophy and, indeed, almost a contradiction in terms.</P>
    <P>At European Parliament level the relevant EC statute prohibits plural voting. If this Bill were passed we would, in fact, be facilitating plural voting since our emigrants could also vote in the UK or in Belgium or in The Netherlands.  In my view, the European authorities would expect appropriate mechanisms to be put in place where such a possibility would exist on a widespread basis.  To assure the member states concerned that our electors are above reproach in this regard would not suffice.  The present Bill does not advert to these questions.</P>
    <P>Do emigrants as a body really wish to be accorded voting rights at Irish elections? I know we have all received representations from individuals and organisations and that organisations have been established specifically to campaign for this purpose but emigrants do not necessarily speak with one voice.  At their annual meeting in 1989 the Federation of Irish Societies, which is the premier body representing Irish organisations in the UK, rejected a proposal calling for votes at Dáil elections.  I understand they did so on two principal grounds &mdash; first, that emigrants do not wish to be in the privileged position of having votes in two countries, the very point that I have just been making and, secondly, an apprehension that an extension to emigrants of the Irish vote could at some stage call <Col N="2407" /> into question their right to vote in UK elections.</P>
    <P>This touches on a central point: from the practical viewpoint an emigrant's living standards are determined by conditions in the host country, employment, wages, taxation, housing, health and welfare services, the environment and so on. The decisions that affect him on a day-to-day basis are those taken by the administration of the host country, not his country of origin.  It is, therefore, vitally important that emigrants should have an input into the administration of the country which many of them now see as their home.  In recognition of this, proposals are being pursued by both the EC and the Council of Europe to extend the local government vote to all residents regardless of citizenship.  Granted this would be a small beginning and, small as it is, some countries have serious problems with it, including constitutional problems.  However, it is an indication of the direction in which European thinking is moving.</P>
    <P>In the past the right of Irish people to vote in the UK has been a matter of some controversy.  There were elements, in fact quite an influential lobby, who considered that the granting of such a right to any foreigners was inappropriate.  Fortunately, this viewpoint no longer attracts substantial support.  We trust this will continue to be the case and we should be slow to take any steps which might alter this position.</P>
    <P>I appreciate it is no longer popular to associate taxation with representation but it is a fact that every resident in this country in one way or another contributes to the Exchequer.  On the other hand, with very few exceptions, emigrants pay their taxes, local and national, in their country of residence and rarely contribute directly to the Exchequer of the home country.  This, again, is a factor which must be duly weighed.  We may take different views as to the weighting to be assigned but it is a fact and in our deliberations we must take account of it.</P>
    <P>We must also have regard to the nature of our electoral system.  It is notorious <Col N="2408" /> that seats are won and lost by a handful of votes.  I do not have to quote examples, we are all familiar with them, some of us, particularly on the Labour benches, uncomfortably so.  It is also a fact that relatively few seats in this House are decided by first preference votes; the majority of seats, particularly the vital marginals, are decided by the lower preferences of a relatively small number of votes.  A person living outside the country, even on a short term basis, cannot be as aware of current affairs in this country as a person living here.  The issues and the policies in a general election here will not be discussed, in any adequate way, in the papers he reads or on radio and television.</P>
    <P>A casual glance at the <i>Boston Globe,</i> the <i>Herald Tribune, Le Monde</i> or, indeed, <i>l'Osservatore Romano</i> would indicate that they do not deal in any significant way with the policy issues considered by the electorate here during election time.  The parties and candidates cannot mount the same campaign in relation to emigrants as they do at home. Thus, the voter abroad, no matter how close his ties, cannot be as well informed as the home voter.  His vote, particularly his lower preferences, are unlikely to be cast with the same care and consideration. Yet our system is such that the lower preference votes of a small number can have an entirely disproportionate effect on elections.  They can, in fact, determine who governs.</P>
    <P>In this regard we are in a different situation from virtually every other country.  In countries such as the United Kingdom and France which have non-proportional systems, winning margins tend to be substantial and the elector exercises one choice only.  Even in list systems of proportional representation, where the allocation of seats may be closely related to the number of votes cast, each elector can exercise essentially one choice.  Elections are decided by the first and only choice of the voters, not by a fifth or sixth preference.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the question of integrity of elections.  I do not think it would be <Col N="2409" /> possible to overemphasise the importance of this aspect, yet the Bill does not even attempt to deal with it in any way. It simply hands the problem over to the Minister.</P>
    <P>For my part, I make no judgment whatever in relation to the rectitude of electors at home or abroad.  I will put the matter as an entirely neutral and generalised statement &mdash; experience here and elsewhere has shown that while it remains a practical proposition to affect the outcome of an election by unorthodox methods, somebody somewhere will attempt such methods.  It follows that whatever voting arrangements may be put in place for emigrants they must include safeguards that, at the very minimum, are as effective as those applying at ordinary polling stations at home. There is a solemn obligation on the Oireachtas to provide this safeguard to protect the integrity of elections.  This is particularly the case when we consider that any electoral abuse which may take place outside the State would effectively be outside the reach of our courts.</P>
    <P>Whatever voting arrangement is put in place must be such as to make it reasonably certain that the vote is cast by the elector freely and in secret.  This is something which the sponsors of the Bill cannot ignore.  It is simply not good enough to say, &ldquo;We will leave that over to another day&rdquo;.  In a matter as serious as this, we cannot divorce the principle from the practicalities.</P>
    <P>In considering possible voting arrangements account must be taken of the time-scale at elections.  At a Dáil election the polling day can be as early as the eighth day after the latest time for receiving nominations.  This means that when account is taken of the 24 hours allowed for withdrawal of nominations, there may be just seven days for printing ballot papers, issuing them to the electors abroad and having them back in time for inclusion in the count.  This may possibly work for people resident in these islands but clearly will not serve those resident, say, in the United States, New Zealand or Australia.  Before somebody says, &ldquo;Allow more time&rdquo;, let me point out that <Col N="2410" /> the time allowed by the Constitution is strictly limited and, in any event, it is highly undesirable that the country should be without a parliament longer than strictly necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifies that voting would be by post, but the sponsors would, apparently, be prepared to consider other arrangements.  The choice is, in fact, severely limited.  The practical options are: postal voting with special safeguards; proxy voting; or special polling stations in embassies.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss these in detail.  We have had experience of postal voting at local elections and I think it is fair to say that there were serious reservations about it.  If this system were to be used again, significant additional safeguards would have to be provided. We would have to be quite sure that the ballot paper gets to the person for whom it is intended and that he has the opportunity to vote in secret, freely and secure from pressure or undue influence.  The security arrangements must be spelt out specifically in the law: it borders on the irresponsible to say, &ldquo;Let the Minister work out the details&rdquo;.  The Oireachtas must decide in a matter of this significance.</P>
    <P>Voting by proxy operates to a limited extent in certain EC countries.  It would, however, be a novel development in relation to public elections here.  The system would be particularly open to abuse even if the greatest care were to be exercised in vetting applications and if stringent rules applied in relation to the proxy.  The complexity of our election system must also be taken into account. In the British or German system, for example, the choice is simple &mdash; the elector votes for candidate or party A or B. In our case the elector must express a series of fairly complicated choices.  First he must decide which party to support. Then he must choose between the candidates of that party.  Next he must decide whether to continue his preferences for the candidates of other parties and in what order.  To a very large extent it is these secondary decisions that ultimately decide election results here.  Thus the <Col N="2411" /> elector would have to be in a position to give very specific instructions to his proxy.  It is not simply a case of, he always votes Labour, Conservative, Democratic or Republican.</P>
    <P>Providing a polling station at, for example, an embassy, would apart from any other consideration, be capable of serving only those who live reasonably convenient to that Embassy.  Providing a vote at Washington DC for a resident of say, Seattle, is not really helpful.  There would be the practical problems of providing ballot papers for all 41 constituencies in each location and making sure that the ballot papers are despatched to the relevant returning officers in time to be included in the count.</P>
    <P>None of the arrangements referred to is entirely satisfactory.  None of them measure up to the essential requirements and none is capable of operating effectively in the very limited time available, particularly in the case of Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>On a matter so fundamental as the election of members of the national parliament, it is vital that there should be broad, cross-party agreement.  It is clear that there is, at this stage, no consensus between the parties on the question of formal linkage between emigrants and the Oireachtas.  This is evidenced, as I mentioned earlier, by the fact that the present Bill proposes emigrant representation in the Dáil while a Bill presented by the main Opposition party proposes that the link should be by way of Seanad representation.</P>
    <P>Where a formal proposal for legislation is presented to this House it is incumbent on the promoters of the measure to ensure that the proposal is coherent and workable and addresses in a reasonable way the issues which it purports to deal with.  I regret to have to say that the Bill does not, in any meaningful way, address the issues I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The homework has not been done; the very serious and complex issues arising have not been taken on board; the measure is not workable in this present form or capable of being suitably amended.  I must oppose the Bill at this <Col N="2412" /> Stage, for reasons of principle, practicality and administrative reality.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael are firmly in favour of the principle of granting voting rights to our emigrants and having directly elected emigrant representation in the Oireachtas.  We have studied the measures proposed in the Bill before us tonight and while we are generally in agreement with the main thrust of its proposals we detect some difficulties that need further clarification and elaboration. While accepting the principle that our emigrants should never be written out of our domestic political agenda, Fine Gael have published and circulated their own Bill advocating emigrant participation in Seanad Éireann directly elected by the emigrants.  I intend to elaborate further on the Fine Gael Bill at a later stage in the debate.</P>
      <P>Very few countries and certainly no other European Community countries have suffered so much and lost so many of its citizens through emigration as we have.  During the eighties our national economy was subjected to two critically debilitating factors of monumental proportions &mdash; first, the interest repayments on our borrowings which were estimated to be in the region of £2 billion per annum; and, secondly, the continuous loss through involuntary emigration of hundreds of thousands of our young people, the fabric and seed of our nation-hood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians, Governments and economists created a political consensus to address and control our rate of borrowing. Through a concerted effort by all and political maturity, particularly by the Fine Gael Party, over the past few years the borrowing rate has been stabilised. Unfortunately there has been no such success in the area of unemployment and emigration, which are closely related. Unemployment continues on its upward <Col N="2413" /> curve and any stabilisation in the level of emigration lately has been entirely due to economic recessions in the host economies of the UK and the US rather than any improvement achieved at home.</P>
    <P>Many urban and rural communities throughout the Republic have been virtually decimated by emigration.  Towns and parishes have lost an entire generation between the vital ages of 18 to 30 years and there are very few families whose sons or daughters have not had to leave and seek employment from here to the ends of the earth.  It is conservatively estimated that during the eighties alone well in excess of 250,000 people had to leave.  Unfortunately many of these people are at present suffering from the pangs of economic recession in the United Kingdom and the US.  Here I must compliment the Churches for their continued efforts in highlighting the extent of the devastation of rural communities. Unfortunately at Government level there seems to be a resigned acceptance of emigration.  Indeed it is seen as a safety valve or a sort of economic regulator such as interest rates to absorb our surplus workforce.</P>
    <P>We are unique in Europe, if not in the world, in that such a high proportion of our citizens have had to forsake their native land to find a livelihood elsewhere. Many of us recall the harrowing television scenes at the beginning of the year when weeping emigrants were taking leave of their families and returning to their adopted homes.  Many of us hope it will only be a temporary adoption and that they can return home permanently.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us this evening advocates giving voting rights to our emigrants in Dáil elections, European Assembly elections, Presidential elections and referenda.  Fine Gael welcome the introduction of this Bill because we agree in principle that our emigrants should be granted voting rights and a strong voice and representation in the Oireachtas.  It is a particularly appropriate time for the introduction of such a Bill within the octave of our national holiday and feast day which Irish emigrants throughout the world celebrate.  It is right and proper <Col N="2414" /> that we should have them uppermost in our minds on occasions such as these. After all, they are our people, our kith and kin, who have been forced to leave their country not through any fault of their own but rather through our failure to provide them with a livelihood.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have always maintained a close and lively interest in the welfare of our emigrants.  Our deputy leader, Deputy Peter Barry, has been a constant champion of emigrants rights whether in Government or Opposition.  Over the past few years he has acted as chairman of Fine Gael's emigration committee and has together with other members of the committee, Deputy Connor, Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Bradford, visited Irish emigrant centres and organisations in the United Kingdom and as far away as the US.  Indeed, one of the priorities of that committee, on which I had the honour of serving, was the difficulties being experienced by our undocumented young Irish people in the United States. Thankfully with the passing of the 1990 Act there their situation should ease and improve over the next two to three years. Here I should like to pay tribute to the excellent and effective lobbying campaign mounted by the IIRM throughout the US which was so instrumental in having that Bill passed by Congress and signed by the President before the end of last year.</P>
    <P>While I agree in principle with the proposal in the Bill that emigrants should be granted voting rights, certain aspects of it present difficulties that require further examination and clarification.  My first reservation concerns section 1, which states that only citizens who have emigrated these last 15 years may apply for registration.  One can justifiably ask, if the principle of granting voting rights to emigrants is acceded to, why limit the right to those who have left the country these last 15 years?  This is somewhat contradictory or perhaps even discriminatory. It advocates voting rights for emigrants but not all emigrants &mdash; only <Col N="2415" /> those who have left these last 15 years. Why not afford the right to all Irish citizens who have had to emigrate or as the Minister said, to those who emigrated 15 years and one week ago?  We will need to look again at this section.</P>
    <P>I realise that this proposal may create problems.  It is conceivable that the potential external electorate of emigrants could almost match in numbers the internal or resident electorate.  We differ from other countries in that our potential emigrant electorate is so substantial in relation to the home electorate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes that a qualified person shall register in the constituency where he or she was ordinarly resident on the date when the most recent register in which his or her name was included or would, but for age, have been included, was drawn up.  In other words, each qualifying emigrant would be registered in his or her home constituency.</P>
    <P>This proposal requires careful examination as it could create an imbalance between the number of electors represented by each Teachta Dála.  Consitutionally, representation is based upon population rather than electors and the Constituency Commission base their decision on the census of population figures. However, if large numbers of emigrants register in some constituencies, say, the west of Ireland, where emigration has been heaviest and most pronounced, for example, Donegal, Kerry or Roscommon, it could very well result in the west of Ireland Deputies representing many more electors than Deputies from other parts of the country. Would it not be more practical to create overseas constituencies so that those elected would directly represent our emigrants? This area requires further examination and consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the operation of the postal vote, and here again I believe we are faced with tremendous difficulties when one considers that ballot <Col N="2416" /> papers have to be distributed and collected in the limited number of days between the close of nominations and polling days which on average is usually about ten or 12 days.  The Minister mentioned that it can be as little as eight days.</P>
    <P>One must agree that it would be a gigantic logistical achievement to have ballot papers distributed to perhaps 150 or 160 countries in the five Continents, have them legally marked and collected again to be posted back to Ireland and redistributed to 41 multi-seat constituencies all in less than two weeks. Added to this is the further complication of multi-seat constituencies.  One can envisage the result of the first count being delayed pending the arrival of the Solomon Island vote.</P>
    <P>Indeed there can be long delays.  It was only last Thursday that I received a letter posted by An Cumann Gaelach in Dubai &mdash; I did not know there was a Cumann Gaelach there &mdash; on 16 December.</P>

      <P>A vote in a general election to elect a government of a sovereign State is a valued and precious right not enjoyed throughout the world.  We can recall rebellions and revolutions throughout the ages demanding this right.  Many of our European neighbours have obtained this right, the right to vote for the candidate and party of one's choice.  Indeed, some of the Gulf States prominent in the news these last few months, particularly these last few weeks, have yet to win that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exercise of that right in this country is scrupulously supervised in every election.  The security apparatus of the <Col N="2417" /> State is fully employed and involved to ensure that every single vote cast is legal and valid.  Instances of personation or misconduct demand the severest of penalites and all this rigorous care is necessary if our citizens are to have trust, faith and confidence in the democratic institutions of our State.  If that trust and confidence is not forthcoming the entire system is undermined and this can lead to a situation where consent is withdrawn and you ultimately arrive at a point where at best chaos reigns or at worse civil war prevails.  Fortunately, since the establishment of this State that trust in and acceptance of the democratic decision is widely accepted because we know in our hearts that the system is fair, honourable and above reproach.</P>
    <P>Here I pose the question; if voting rights are to be extended to Irish citizens in every country, from Greenland to New Zealand and from the Faroe Islands to Honolulu, can we guarantee with confidence the same rigorous application and standard of supervision and efficiency? Not alone must the process be above suspicion but it must be seen and accepted to be so.  Our democratic institutions have been hard fought for.  We have together succeeded in building a stable system that has withstood the test of 70 years.  In introducing any new departure from well established practice our first priority must be the maintainace of and further strengthening of our institutions.</P>
    <P>Another weakness I perceive in this Bill if accepted and passed without amendment is that the voting power of our emigrants will be diffused and dispersed throughout the 41 constituencies which would leave their effectiveness as a body grossly diminished.  Bearing in mind the difficulties and weaknesses we see in the Bill but at the same time firmly committed to the principle of voting rights for our emigrants and their representation in the Oireachtas, the Fine Gael Party have devoted time and thought to the problem.  I have already <Col N="2418" /> published and circulated our own Bill entitled the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1991.  Our Bill advocates that the membership of Seanad Éireann be increased from 60 to 63 Members and those directly elected as distinct from being nominated by the Taoiseach of the day from 49 to 52.  The three extra Senators would be elected on a new emigrants panel.  Under our Bill emigrants could register on a voters panel which would entitle them to vote directly to have three of their own representatives in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>We believe the proposals in our Bill have many advantages.  First, a Seanad campaign is much longer than a Dáil election campaign and consequently there would be adequate time to have the ballot papers distributed and collected for the Senate count.  Secondly, due to the fact that there would be a separate and independent emigrant panel it would not disrupt the entire election count if emigrant ballot papers got delayed in the post, as I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The count could proceed as usual on the other panels pending the return of the emigrant votes.</P>
    <P>Having three Members elected directly to the Seanad would give the emigrants a stronger and more effective voice in the Oireachtas.  I believe it would be far more cohesive and responsive to their needs, wishes and aspirations than having their votes dispersed throughout 41 constituencies without having any single Member as one of their own.  Our proposals would also ensure that their three representatives would be most probably from the ranks of the emigrants themselves. Perhaps one from the US and Canada and two from the UK.  They could represent the emigrants, articulate their needs, desires and problems and ensure they have a platform in the House of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is, after all, a vocational based second Chamber.  One of its functions is to give a national platform to special interest groups as the present <Col N="2419" /> panels indicate.  The electorate of the Seanad is at present restricted to elected Members of both Houses and political parties, excluding, of course, the University panels, though many would maintain that University panels are also restricted and elitist.  An emigrants panel as proposed in the Fine Gael Bill would certainly bring an element of universal franchise and real democracy to the Seanad.  Indeed, in my opinion, it would give a special standing and status to those elected on such a basis.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Bill requires a constitutional amendment, and I believe there would be widespread support for such a proposal.  There are many families within the State who have close relations abroad who would qualify for the franchise. Whether tonight's Bill or our constitutional amendment Bill is successful remains to be seen.  We are ultimately dependent on the Government's attitude and response.  Indeed, they have been remarkably quiet and reticent on the subject so far.  Listening to the Minister's contribution I have very grave doubts as to the Government's intentions.  They do not seem to be in favour of any Bill, whether our Bill or that of the Labour Party, which says something for their concern for emigrants.</P>
    <P>I know that emigrant organisations and their people at home are keenly following this debate, and there will be great disappointment if we fail to deliver to our emigrants an opportunity of being represented and heard in the Oireachtas. Fine Gael will be supporting Second Stage Reading of this Bill.  However, if it goes to Committee Stage we will be tabling many amendments related to the difficulties which I expressed during my contribution.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Timeshare Developments Promotion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to a matter of serious concern to many people throughout the country, but particularly in the midlands area, in view of the practice of a company in County Kilkenny in the business of selling timeshare apartments in what was formerly an abbey.  The practice is quite simple, is within the law, is very sharp and warrants a change in our consumer protection legislation.</P>
      <P>Members of the public are invited through the post by means of a document compiled from the electoral register to attend at an abbey in County Kilkenny to collect one of a range of prizes ranging from a colour television to a £1,000 holiday. When one arrives at the abbey one is placed in comfortable surroundings and encouraged, in a very highly pressurised way, to sign for a timeshare holiday in the abbey at a cost of £5,000.  Quite a considerable array of documents are presented to the parties.  These highly technical documents are strictly above board but the parties should have independent advice prior to signing them.  I urge the Minister perhaps to direct the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to investigate the matter and to see if it is within his powers at least to warn unsuspecting members of the public about what is happening.  The absence of independent advice is crucial, given the highly technical nature of the jargon involved.  I will read a brief extract:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The purchaser hereby admits that he has been given a copy of the <Col N="2421" /> documents listed at paragraph (7) of the schedule hereto and that he has read and understood the same.  (See page 3 of the constitution.)</P>
    <P>I am talking about documentation and jargon of a highly technical and legal nature which the layman is not expected to understand.  Many &mdash; I daresay hundreds &mdash; of unsuspecting members of the public have signed for this arrangement, committed themselves to the tune of £5,000 and regretted their unfortunate &mdash; and perhaps foolish &mdash; signing as soon as they left the abbey.  When contacted the following day, the response of those involved is that they have signed a legally binding agreement and that there is very little they can do but to cough up the balance of the money forthwith.</P>
    <P>The law must be changed in two respects; it must allow for a cooling off period so that people will not be encouraged to sign an irrevocable contract without the benefit of such a period.  They should have a few days in which to discuss the matter with family, friends and other people.  In other jurisdictions this cooling off period is allowed and independent advice is crucial.  The Minister must give a commitment to stop this unfair and high pressure selling.</P>
    <P>People are informed that loans can be arranged.  If you do not bring your cheque book, a home-made cheque is manufactured on the premises and all you have to do is to slot in your bank account number.  They tell you that if you sign this home-made cheque the company will look after it.  They duly contact your bank manager and, because it is a cheque signed by the individual, he has an onus to pass it unless contacted by the person in the meantime.  People have remained on the premises without the benefit of independent advice and are in a position of great weakness.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the highly technical nature of the document and the fact that this whole arrangement is orchestrated by people who have the benefit of the best legal advice as to the formation of <Col N="2422" /> contracts which are fully binding within the terms and conditions of Irish law.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister have the matter investigated with a view to committing himself to greater consumer protection which was promised long ago and which would certainly give an element of protection to many members of the public who find themselves in an unfortunate position and down many thousands of pounds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden):</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the concerns expressed by Deputy Flanagan about some of the high pressure and misleading methods used in the promotion of timeshare developments. I would remind the House of the reply given by me on 13 November last (volume 402, column, 1184) in response to a question by Deputy Gay Mitchell. On that occasion I outlined the steps taken by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to curb the abuses associated with a specific timeshare scheme which had been the subject of widespread complaints.</P>
      <P>Having investigated these complaints the director, in exercise of his statutory powers under the European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations, 1988, requested the promoters to cease certain aspects of their advertising.  As a result, the promoters modified their advertising material.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the director has been keeping the matter under constant review.  In that regard he had further contact with the promoters following which they have ceased other aspects of their promotional activities which were deemed to be in breach of the regulations. The director continues to monitor the situation and I would suggest that the Deputy, or any member of the public, who has details of this type of activity should bring it to his notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also avail of the opportunity presented by this Adjournment debate to strongly advise members of the public to <Col N="2423" /> be wary of this type of activity.  Generally speaking, it involves the sending of promotional literature &ldquo;guaranteeing&rdquo; the recipient a prize but to collect the prize it is necessary to attend a sales promotion. Also, while all the prizes appear to be of subtantial value, closer examination of the small print will reveal that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>Although it may appear unnecessary to say it, I think that anyone should be cautious and sceptical of promises of expensive &ldquo;free&rdquo; gifts which they receive in the post.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate the need for vigilance. The director has the powers to stamp out these unworthy practices.  He has shown himself to be very effective when complaints are brought to his attention.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this matter in the Dáil because it gives the public an opportunity to be wary of the pitfalls as far as this matter is concerned. I would welcome any further information which Deputy Flanagan, or any other Deputy, may have to ensure that this kind of practice is stamped out.</P>

      <P>Voluntary and community groups who have been working in the area of homelessness have been calling for over 20 years for the provision of emergency and long term facilities for homeless children.  At this very moment an eviction notice is hanging over a voluntary hostel run by Fr. Peter McVerry in Ballymun.  This is a scandal which has been ignored for far too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Campaign for the Homeless estimate there are about 5,000 people homeless in the country and that does not take into account the 20,000 people on local authority housing waiting lists. Despite the passing of the 1988 Housing Act the problem of homelessness is growing all the time and getting worse.  It <Col N="2424" /> appals me to learn that, whereas the largest number of homeless people are in the Dublin area, none of the Dublin local authorities have applied for even a penny from the special fund established under the 1988 Act for emergency housing for the homeless.  I welcome the commitment given recently by the Minister for the Environment to work more closely with voluntary groups working in this area and acknowledging that they provide 93 per cent of all the hostel accommodation for homeless people in the country.  Continually one finds it is groups like Focus Point and people like Fr. McVerry who are providing essential and much needed services that should be part of the public responsibility, but because the State agencies have not done or may even have refused to do anything to tackle the glaring problems, voluntary groups emerge and form and take action.</P>
    <P>Again I find it amazing that no money from the health board or from the Department of the Environment is given to Fr. Peter McVerry in his struggle to deal with a very real problem in the Ballymun area.  It is the threat of the eviction from Thomas McDonagh Tower of the boys from the hostel there that has brought into focus the need for a purpose-built hostel in the Ballymun area.  The existing hostel is in a three bedroomed flat in a block of flats where all flats are tenanted.  It is completely full, and from everyone's point of view the current situation is totally unsatisfactory.  It is not surprising that with as many as 15 young people in the care of the hostel at times difficulties are created for the residents. The residents have made it clear that they do not want these boys evicted on to the street and fully agree with Fr. Peter McVerry's suggestion of a purpose-built hostel in the Ballymun area.  The young boys who are in Fr. McVerry's hostel cannot go home.  Some have left their family home because of violence and some because of abuse.  Some of the boys have gone through traumatic events in their very short lives and this hostel has <Col N="2425" /> been tireless in working over the years to provide a haven and a programme for rehabilitation of the children involved. They have had their successes in dealing with some of these boys, but trying to deal with a number of damaged and difficult youths in an overcrowded, three bedroomed flat does not allow for proper attention and care to be given and, indeed, makes their very stressful task more difficult.</P>
    <P>The corporation have said they are in favour of the idea of providing a site for a hostel in the Ballymun area, but there has been no official contact between the corporation and Fr. Peter McVerry in relation to possible sites.  It has to be said clearly tonight in this House that this problem cannot be allowed to fester for much longer.  The site needed for the hostel is little more than half an acre. Fr. McVerry and his group have already submitted plans to the corporation for a hostel which will be capable of catering for about 12 boys, and the cost of providing the hostel, £260,000, will be provided from private funding, so the only outlay which will be required for the provision of the hostel will be the provision of this half acre site from the corporation &mdash; or if the health board have land available perhaps that could be considered also.</P>
    <P>Virtually all the boys in Fr. McVerry's hostel are from the Ballymun area, so it is a Ballymun problem.  They range from as young as ten years to 18 years of age. It is a basic principle of child care that you do not uproot a child unnecessarily from his or her environment.  It is essential, therefore, that these children are cared for in their own area where they have friends, relatives and schools.  I urge that this matter of a plot of land for a hostel in the Ballymun area be looked at urgently by the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment and that action is taken on this issue before 5 April when Fr. McVerry has again to go into court to face the possibility of eviction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this issue because as Minister of State at the Department of Health I take a very serious view of the difficulties with regard to youth homelessness which are prevalent in some of our larger cities and towns.  I echo the sentiments of all concerned with this problem when I say we are anxious to bring to an end the difficulties for youth homelessness not only in the Ballymun area, to which Deputy De Rossa has referred, but wherever else it exists in our capital city and around the country.</P>
      <P>The problem of young homeless people and the difficulties they face is one which the Government are very conscious of and which is being tackled in a number of ways.  The Child Care Bill, which is currently being debated in the Seanad, contains important new provisions to assist young homeless people.  The Bill, when enacted, will impose a statutory duty on the health boards to promote the welfare of children up to the age of 18 who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  Of particular relevance is an entirely new section in the Bill requiring the health boards to investigate the circumstances of homeless children and, in appropriate cases, either to receive these children into care or to take steps to make accommodation available for them.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government are committed to providing the additional resources to bring the legislation to which I have referred into operation as soon as practicable after its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of service developments have already been initiated with particular emphasis being placed on the Eastern Health Board area.  Included in these initiatives are: The assignment of a special team of social workers to deal specifically with homeless young people. This is supported by a centralised crisis accommodation unit; the establishment <Col N="2427" /> of two new community residential projects, one for boys in Tallaght and the second for girls in Ballymun.  Both projects provide residential care for young people between 12 and 16 years of age; a new long term residential unit has been developed in the Clontarf area which caters for boys in the 11 to 14 age group; the setting up by the Eastern Health Board of a new project called &ldquo;Carers for Young People&rdquo; which will cater for adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings; the purchase of a premises near Blessington which will house a therapeutic unit for boys and girls with special difficulties.  This is due to come on stream in the first half of this year; and negotiations which are taking place between the Eastern Health Board and a number of organisations regarding the provision of additional emergency and long term accommodation for both boys and girls.</P>
    <P>Funding has also been made available by the Minister for the Environment for special projects for the young homeless. For example, &ldquo;Focus Point&rdquo; have received grants amounting to £2.4 million from the Department of the Environment's voluntary housing scheme towards the provision of a new flatlet project at Stanhope Street, Dublin, and the provision of a residential facility at Arran Quay, Dublin.  In addition to the facilities available in Ballymun, homeless children and young persons from the area are placed, as necessary, in various hostels and residential centres around the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated in the House, the Government are committed to doing all that we can to bring to an end the plight of young people sleeping rough on the streets of our cities and towns and the initiatives which I have just outlined give practical evidence of our resolve to tackle this problem.  I am anxious that everything possible will be done to bring to an end the plight of the young homeless including those in the Ballymun area.  I <Col N="2428" /> think it will be possible to deal with the case referred to by Deputy De Rossa in the Ballymun area.  I assure Deputy De Rossa that I will take a personal interest in trying to resolve that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of suitable residential care accommodation for female teenagers was brought to my attention a number of weeks ago in relation to one case but I have been aware of a number of such cases in my area. The case is causing grave concern to the various State agencies, particularly to the North Eastern Health Board.  The matter came to a head last week when a girl, the subject of a number of criminal proceedings, was brought before the district justice in Dundalk, and because of the difficulties experienced by the interested State agencies and the district justice in passing sentence and implementing that sentence.  It transpired that there was not suitable accommodation for this girl.  Last Wednesday, because of the difficulties, the district justice saw fit to adjourn the case to the next day to Ardee District Court.  In the meantime he ordered that the 15 year old girl be held in custody in Dundalk Garda station, a place which was not suitable for a young person, particularly a young girl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five urgent cases in the Louth area, two in Dundalk and three in Drogheda.  There are also two other cases equally serious in south Monaghan.  The health board are involved in each of those cases and are worried about the well being of each of the young girls.  The two girls from Dundalk are involved in crime. One is involved in quite serious crime in and around Dundalk.  She is involved with a bad crowd older than herself.  The health board, and people interested in her welfare, feel that if something is not done very quickly she could come to a very sorry end.  She is involved in glue sniffing, petrol sniffing and alcohol abuse. <Col N="2429" /> The two girls from Dundalk are living rough.  While initially their parents were not co-operative with the State agencies, they now fully appreciate the difficulties in which their respective daughters are involved and are now co-operating fully with everything the health board wish to do.</P>
    <P>The health board have great difficulty in securing accommodation.  In one case the health board thought they would be able to accommodate one of the girls in accommodation in another health board area.  However, at the last minute they found there were difficulties about transferring from one health board area to another.  The receiving health board were unable to take the girl because their facility was for people within their health board area.  I appreciate that this matter transcends a number of Departments, Education, Health and Justice.</P>
    <P>In the case that occurred last week the young girl was remanded over the weekend in Oberstown House.  I understand that Oberstown House was full at the weekend and that the officials were not inclined to take the girl but eventually because of the court order, they had to. I understand they are over crowded and are not willing to hold this girl for to long.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion has been made and I do not know whether or not it is feasible. This case will come up again at Dundalk District Court tomorrow.  I understand that if the various authorities are willing, this girl could be accommodated in a facility north of the Border.  There is a willingness there to take the girl in provided the State authorities agree.  I appreciate that the district justice may be in a difficult situation in that he will be then required to make an order transferring the girl out of the jurisdiction. However, there should be some co-operation between the State agencies here and across the Border.  This is a problem that occurs not just here but in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board have a proposal before the Department of <Col N="2430" /> Health to build a secure unit for eight teenage offenders.  I strongly urge the Departments of Justice, Education and Health to ensure that some facility is put in place in the near future for teenagers, particularly females who are most at risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The increasing frequency with which young offenders are appearing before our courts on serious charges and attracting custodial sentences is of course a matter of serious concern.  Indeed, it was in response to this development, and the resultant need to provide adequate and suitable places to accommodate such cases, that the Government decided to establish an inter-Departmental group to consider ways of addressing this problem.  I take the points Deputy Ahern made with regard to the specific cases in the Dundalk area.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations to come from that group was that additional accommodation be provided for both boys and girls to supplement existing facilities.  The Government have taken urgent action to follow-up on this recommendation and arrangements are currently being made to bring new facilities on stream for both boys and girls as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>A new residential school to house 20 young girl offenders is being planned for location adjacent to the existing Finglas children's centre.  This school will take up to eight girls on remand for assessment and provide long term accommodation for a further 12 girls.</P>
      <P>Consultants have already been appointed for this project and the preparation of detailed plans is proceeding as a matter of urgency.  It will be appreciated that the nature and purpose of this new school will be such as to require very careful planning at all stages to ensure that the best interests of the inhabitants are served while at the same time ensuring that the special nature of the school is not undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2431" /> Because the new purpose built school for girls will not be available for some time, I have instructed my Department to look urgently at the possibility of providing a temporary arrangement to cope with the current demand for places for girls.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are now being made to provide eight additional places at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin and this accommodation should be available in August next.  This accommodation is being provided by re-furbishing a portion of the former Ard Scoil Mhuire, Special School.  This will bring the total accommodation for girls at Lusk to 16 places, <Col N="2432" /> as the existing remand and assessment centre for girls on site has eight places.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures I have outlined and the urgency with which they are being pursued is a concrete illustration of my commitment to addressing these difficult issues.  I assure Deputy Ahern that we have taken up the case of the girl in Dundalk.  Our officials have visited Dundalk and assessed the situation. We are trying to respond to the requirements, that I accept are very urgent, in order to provide an adequate facility for the girl in question.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 March 1991.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, however, in assessing entitlement to a rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, account is taken of the household circumstances of the applicant.</P>
      <P>In cases such as that mentioned by the Deputy, the accommodation costs of the household are attributed equally between the tenants, and the applicant would be assessed on his portion of the rent.  In addition, the person's entitlement to unemployment assistance would normally fall to be reviewed to take account of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by him from residing with a family member.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy would provide details to enable the person in question to be identified, I will arrange to have the case examined to ensure that it has been fully assessed.</P>

    <P>As a general guideline, a person will not be left with an after-rent income below the basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance, less £3.50.  It should be noted that the personal rate of supplementary welfare allowance has been increased in the recent budget by 11 per cent to £50 per week.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The personal rate of old age contributory pension is the highest social welfare payment and is above the main basic rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The personal rate was increased in the 1991 budget by just over 4 per cent from £61.50 to £64 per week.  There are currently two adult dependant rates payable with old age contributory pension depending on whether the dependant is under or over 66 years of age.  These are currently £39.20 and £45.70 for under and over 66 respectively.  The adult dependant rates are currently some 64 per cent and 74 per cent of the personal rate, which is above the 60 per cent recommended by the commission. These are also now the only rates of adult dependant increases which are age differentiated.</P>
      <P>As a first step towards streamlining these rates the over 66 adult dependant rate was increased to £46, which still means that this rate is 72 per cent of the new increased personal rate.  The under 66 rate was increased to £40.80 and this still represents some 64 per cent of the new personal rate.</P>
      <P>A recipient of an old age contributory pension may have other income, for example, an occupational pension, which will not affect his/her social welfare entitlement.  In addition, an adult dependant over 66 years may qualify for an old age non-contributory pension in his/her own right, depending on the means of the couple.</P>
      <P>The person concerned will receive an increase in his old age contributory pension of £2.80 giving him a total payment of £110.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that I am very concerned about the position of the elderly, which is indicated, for example, by the Government's decision to award <i>pro rata</i> pensions to those who had no entitlement to pension because of their mixed insurance record.  This improvement will benefit up to 2,500 persons, and will cost some £3 million in a full year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional fuel allowance of £3 per week which I introduced at the start of the 1990-91 heating season is designed to help low income households in the built up areas of Dublin meet the additional costs arising from the ban on bituminous coal.  Some 74,000 households are in receipt of this allowance at present at an estimated cost of £5.8 million in 1991.  This is in addition to the provision of £29.1 million for the national fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>The new allowance is payable to all households in the designated areas qualifying for assistance under the national fuel scheme.  Such households now receive an allowance of £8 per week.  The new allowance is also payable to people on short-term unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability benefit for more than three months and to recipients of family income supplement, subject to the conditions applying in the national fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>Scientific studies suggest that the Deputy is incorrect in stating that the heat output from smokeless fuels is half that of conventional fuels and that the same amount of expenditure produced half the amount of heat.  Studies carried out by EOLAS on behalf of the Department of the Environment indicate that while some smokeless fuels do not produce the same heat output as conventional fuels, other smokeless fuels produce a higher heat output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2213" /> The EOLAS report highlights a number of factors which must be taken into account in comparing the heat output from conventional fuels with smokeless fuels.  For example, it is necessary to take account of the relative cost of fuels and the speed with which they burn.</P>
    <P>The fuel and light component of the consumer price index has not increased substantially in recent years.  For that reason I have concentrated on improving the national fuel scheme by extending its coverage.  The scheme was extended at the start of the present heating season to include smallholders receiving long term unemployment assistance and recipients of long term payments residing with a person receiving short term unemployment assistance.  An additional 9,000 people benefited from this extension.</P>
    <P>The amount of the smokeless fuel allowance, £3 per week, was set having regard to the increased costs to households arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in the greater Dublin area.  My main concern is to assist low income households meet these additional costs.  I am satisfied that the measures introduced at the start of the 1990-91 heating season achieve this aim.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I have recently made regulations extending social insurance cover to part time workers with effect from 6 April next.  In summary the changes proposed are that social insurance cover is being provided to all private sector employees earning £40 or more per week.  Such workers will have access to the full range of social insurance payments.  Short term benefits will be payable on a pro-rata basis to insured persons earning below £70 per week.  Pensions will be paid at the full rate.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements will mitigate to a large extent the problems identified by the Deputy.  The question of awarding credited contributions to unemployed persons who wish to take up part time employment for less than £40 weekly is at present being examined in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the provisions which are made for the direct payment of social welfare payments to adult dependants; his views on whether adult dependants should be paid directly as of right so as to provide them with an independent income; if he will make legislative provisions for the direct payment of social welfare payments to all adult dependants except where the dependant otherwise directs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare payments, in general, <Col N="2216" /> provide income maintenance support in respect of specified contingencies, for example, unemployment, sickness, old age.  Title to payment under the various social insurance and assistance schemes is vested in the person who meets the statutory conditions relating to such schemes.  While supplements in respect of a claimant's spouse and children are incorporated into the various schemes, they do not have direct title to these payments.</P>
      <P>Since as far back as 1952 there has been provision under social welfare legislation for making payment to people other than the claimants where they are unable to act or they make such a request.  Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1972, to enable the adult and child dependant increases payable under all schemes to be paid direct to the adult dependant where the circumstances so warrant.</P>
      <P>In recognition, however, of the fact that the sharing implicit in the calculation of the basic payment for a couple and increases for their child dependants may not actually take place, I provided enabling powers in the Social Welfare Act, 1989, to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Claims and Payments) (Amendment) Regulations, 1990, and the Social Welfare (Payments to Appointed Persons) Regulations, 1990, which I signed last October, enable a greater proportion of the overall payment to be made to a dependent spouse where the husband and wife are living together. Where the circumstances so warrant the spouse can now receive, on behalf of the claiming spouse, half the combined sum of the personal rate of payment and the adult dependant increase together with the full child dependant increases.  This has greatly improved the financial position of a dependent spouse in meeting the practical responsibility for children and housekeeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of whether adult dependants should receive payments directly in all cases is a much broader issue and is one which has been examined by the review group on the treatment of households <Col N="2217" /> whose report I expect to receive shortly. I will have the issue reviewed in the light of whatever the report may have to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>The abolition of the PRSI tax allowance would fund a reduction of 1 per cent &mdash; from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent &mdash; in the standard employee PRSI rate.  The abolition of the income ceiling for employee contributions would fund a reduction of 0.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Either measure would affect take home pay across the whole range of income levels.  Any such change would, therefore, need to be considered in the context of overall budgetary policy and, in particular, in the light of future developments in the tax and PRSI systems.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance payment week runs from a Wednesday to the following Tuesday and the unemployment benefit payment week runs <Col N="2218" /> from Thursday to the following Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Where a person exhausts unemployment benefit and continues to be unemployed, unemployment assistance is payable as from the following day and there is no question of a day's payment being lost.  Because, however, the unemployment assistance week ends a day earlier than the unemployment benefit week, the first payment which the claimant receives will be in respect of five days between benefit and assistance rather than six days as in the normal course.  I understand that this may be confusing for some people and I am making arrangements to ensure that it is explained to them more fully and in good time.</P>
      <P>These arrangements have been in force for many years and to change them would involve additional expenditure and have certain practical implications.  I do feel, however, that we need to look more closely at this issue, perhaps with a view to moving away from having a fixed specific week for unemployment payments, and I will have the matter examined by the Department.</P>

      <P>Arising from the introduction of the principle of equal treatment in matters of social security under EC Direction 79/7, the definition of dependency in the social welfare code had to be revised.  Under the revised arrangements a spouse is not regarded as an adult dependant where he or she is either in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right or has weekly earnings from employment or self-employment in excess of a specified limit.  This earnings limit was increased to £55 with effect from the beginning of June 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income from a spouse's self-employment is assessed by reference to the <Col N="2219" /> weekly amount of such income calculated or estimated by dividing the income in the period of the last complete income tax year by 52.  In assessing the income, allowance is made for any reasonable expenses actually and necessarily incurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 43 together.  Significant progress has been made in recent budgets to improve the position of families through increases in the basic rates of payments which include very substantial increases in child dependant payments together with increases in child benefit.  The recent budget was no exception in this regard with the main improvements in child related payments being an increase in the minimum child dependant rate to £12 representing an increase of 9 per cent, and streamlining to three rates; the payment of the higher child benefit of £22.90 in respect of the fourth child onwards, which represents an annual increase of over £85 for families of at least four children; and improvements in the family income supplement scheme including an increase in the income limits and the removal of the limitation on the level of <Col N="2220" /> payment.  This latter improvement will be of significant help to very low earners.</P>
      <P>In addition, child dependant allowances will be extended to age 21 in respect of the child dependants of long term recipients where the child remains in full time education.  To ease the financial burden when a child dies the child dependant allowance will continue to be paid for six weeks after death.</P>
      <P>A further important element in the Government's support for families with children is the child related tax exemption. This scheme will, from 6 April, provide for a child tax exemption of £300 for the first and second child in a family, and £500 for third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>The Government intend to build on the progress to date and, under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> will provide the level of resources necessary to implement the additional child income support measures recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; some £69 million in 1990 terms &mdash; over the ten year period of the programme.  The particular measures taken will be worked out in the light of up to date information on child and family circumstances and in the light of available resources.  In this context the structure of all child related payments, including child benefit, will be examined and this will include a detailed review of the various reports on family income support.</P>
      <P>The programme also gives a commitment to review and substantially improve the structure of the family income supplement scheme.  Changes will be designed so as to improve the level of payments to all beneficiaries, particularly those on the lowest income levels. As part of the restructuring, the role of the family income supplement and the link with the child benefit scheme will be examined, taking account of the type of issues raised by Deputy Pattison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1990, I hosted a major conference on the role of voluntary organisations in the delivery of social services and in tackling poverty and disadvantage. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the civil servants of my Department who organised this conference and conducted it in every respect to the highest standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This conference was held at the request of the European Commission during <Col N="2222" /> Ireland's Presidency of the European Community.  The conference held in Galway was part of the third EC Poverty Programme under which Ireland receives £2 million from EC funds.</P>
    <P>Among our EC partners, we in Ireland, are recognised as having an exceptionally high level of voluntary service. We are generally regarded by other member states as being unique in the extent, commitment and calibre of the organisations which work with the disadvantaged. It was for this reason that we were requested by the European Commission to host this conference of some 150 experts from all over Europe.</P>
    <P>The conference was attended by representatives of voluntary and statutory organisations from the various member states as well as representatives of the European Commission, the Council of Europe and a number of other organisations representing voluntary and State agencies.</P>
    <P>In the context of the conference, I announced plans to draw up a charter for voluntary and social service activity in Ireland.  This charter will set out a clear framework for partnership between Government and voluntary organisations. It will also identify how the State can encourage, foster and support voluntary organisations in the social services area.</P>
    <P>This issue has since been further progressed in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Government are committed to producing a White Paper outlining their proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>The costs of the conference met by my Department under the headings set out by the Deputy cannot be specified because the European Commission contributed about £77,000 towards the overall costs involved.  Over half of the cost involved, however, related to organising the conference itself, including printing costs and the provision of interpretation facilities.  In addition, the air and other travel costs of all delegates attending the conference were also met as is normal in such EC conferences.</P>

      <Quest>when he proposes to assess applicants for rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme on the basis of their actual income rather than the notional supplementary welfare allowance rate, given that the majority of recipients of rent supplements are single long term unemployed on £52 per week who are assessed on the basis of a notional income of £45.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The rent supplements in question are payable within the terms of the scheme of supplementary welfare allowance and the amounts of rent supplement payable in particular cases are calculated by reference to the current rates of supplementary welfare allowance under that scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides that a weekly rent supplement may be paid where a person's rent exceeds £3.50 a week and that, in general, when payable, it will leave the claimant with a disposable income, after payment of rent, which is equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to that person less £3.50.  Consequently income which the person may be receiving in excess of the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance is taken into account in determining the rent supplement.</P>
      <P>Single persons on the long-term rate of unemployment assistance receive a personal rate of £52, which is £7 a week in excess of the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance of £45 a week in relation to which the rent supplement is calculated.  This year's social welfare increase provides for a special increase in the basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance of over 11 per cent from £45 to £50, and this will reduce the differential.  The short term rate of unemployment assistance will now also be £50.</P>
      <P>The question of changing the method of calculating rent supplements would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The number of civilian dead and injured in Iraq and Kuwait can only be accurately established by the Governments of those two countries.  The extent of civilian injuries is also being examined by, among others, the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF and the World Health Organisation, as part of their assessment of humanitarian needs in the post-war situation.  The Government do not consider that they could usefully contribute to these efforts in current circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have outlined my concern in relation to the human rights situation in China on a number of occasions in the Dáil and in other fora.  Deputies will recall that on 14 February I confirmed that this concern had been conveyed to the Chinese authorities and that Ireland and its partners in the Twelve member states of the European Community would pursue their dialogue with the Chinese authorities, using all available channels, to urge them to promote and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there have been a number of recent trials in China of individuals who were involved in the prodemocracy movement.  I deeply reget the harsh sentences which were handed down to certain individuals, although I welcome the fact that a number were also released.  I also regret that international observers were not permitted to attend <Col N="2227" /> the trials to determine if the judicial process was free and fair.  The Chinese authorities are fully aware of the concerns of Ireland and its EC partners in relation to the trials and sentencing of the prodemocracy dissidents and I would take this opportunity to urge them again to promote and respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of their citizens.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the large number of Irish citizens who have spent a number of years in public service employment in Britain, professional and otherwise and who have transferred to similar employments under public authorities in the Republic, he will indicate the superannuation arrangements which exist between the two countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>There are no general arrangements in existence at present between Ireland and Britain for the transfer of public sector service for superannuation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, the public sector transfer scheme, which dates from 1979, and a corresponding local government transfer scheme provide for the transfer of service <Col N="2228" /> for superannuation purposes on a reciprocal basis among participating organisations, mainly in the Irish public sector.  While the transfer schemes do not at present cover transfers between the Irish and British public sectors, there are enabling provisions within the schemes under which such arrangements could be introduced.  If such arrangements were to be implemented, transfers of service could be effected if the former employer, i.e. the British organisation, was prepared to make a superannuation contribution to the final employing organisation in respect of the prior service of the employee concerned.  To date, however, there has been no indication of interest in such transfer arrangements on the part of organisations in the British public sector.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a reciprocal transfer agreement with the appropriate British authorities, it would not be appropriate to amend Irish public sector superannuation arrangements to allow credit for service in Britain on a one-way transfer basis.  Such an arrangement would entail substantial additional costs for the Exchequer which could not be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following, in tabular form, are the data for 1990-91 and 1991-92 requested by the Deputy.  They update Table A7.9 on page 235 of the NESC Report entitled <i>A Strategy for the Nine ties.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The updated table for 1991-92 shows <Col N="2229" /> that, compared to 1989-90, the net disposable income position at all of the gross pay ranges examined has increased, with particularly significant increases at the lower pay levels.  The principal reasons for the increases in net income relative to gross pay have been tax reductions and FIS improvements.</P>
    <P>The original table showed that for 1989-90 at gross pay levels between £6,000 and £9,000, net income declined as gross pay increased.  The updated table for 1991-92 shows that, while this effect still occurs between £8,000 and £10,000, <Col N="2230" /> the range of incomes over which it occurs has been narrowed and has also been moved away from the low pay levels at which it had operated previously.</P>
    <P>As regards the impact in practice, the Deputy should note, firstly, that the number of persons involved is small and, secondly, that administrative factors can operate to mitigate the effect.  An example of the latter is the fact that although a person's gross income may increase during the course of a year, his FIS entitlement is reviewed only annually.</P>

      <Col N="2234" /> With the exception of health contributions, the data on which the graphs are based reflect Exchequer receipts from the revenue heads listed in current year terms for each of the years in question. Employment and training levy was not payable in 1980 &mdash; its predecessor, the youth employment levy, was not introduced until 1981.</P>
    <P>The health contribution revenue included in graph number seven reflects the amount received by the Department of Health as an Appropriation-in-Aid in each year.</P>

    <P>The single and married allowances have been augmented by the addition of the PAYE allowance. From 1982-83 onwards account has been taken of the PRSI allowance.  Up to and including 1985-86, an income tax allowance was available in respect of dependent children and this is reflected in the table for the relevant years.  It was abolished in respect of the 1986-87 and subsequent tax years. Its abolition was accompanied by an increase in child benefit sufficient to compensate standard rate taxpayers &mdash; then paying tax at 35 per cent &mdash; for its loss.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Average male industrial earnings:</i></P>
    <P>The figures for average male industrial earnings are derived from the entries in the CSO series, &ldquo;Gross Earnings and hours worked for male and female Industrial Workers (Adult Rates) by Sector&rdquo; The CSO data for transportable goods industries were used.

      <P>Export sales relief (ESR) ceased to be available after 5 April 1990.</P>
      <P>The yield to the Exchequer from the replacement of the relief by a corporation tax rate of 10 per cent will depend upon a number of factors such as the extent to which ESR companies will continue to operate in Ireland after that relief has been terminated, and the extent to which ESR companies had accumulated unused capital allowances by 5 April, 1990 which can be set off against their taxable profits. Because of these factors it is not possible to say with precision what the ultimate yield to the Exchequer will be under the new arrangement.  However, it is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners that little or no yield arose in 1990 because of the normal seven month time lag between the dates on which company accounting periods end and the corresponding due dates for tax payment.</P>
      <P>A provision for an Exchequer yield of £45 million from companies which previously qualified for ESR has been included in the corporation tax estimate of £527 million for 1991.</P>

The following table sets out the net disposable income of these workers after deduction of income tax, PRSI and health levies.

      <P>The following table sets out tentative estimates of the revenue which would have accrued to the Exchequer if the 65 per cent rate had been applied as the top income tax rate for each year instead of the actual top rate in force for that year.  The figures in the table are compiled on the basis that application of a 65 per cent rate would not have altered the behaviour of taxpayers subject to it; this assumption is unlikely to be realistic.</P>

    <P>(1) and (2)  <i>Export sales relief and &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief</i></P>
    <P>The figures for each year include the tax relief relevant to accounting periods which ended in that year and to earlier accounting periods which ended in so far as such relief was allowed in that year.</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>Manufacturing profits</i></P>
    <P>These figures represents the estimated loss to the Exchequer arising from the charging of manufacturing and other qualifying profits at reduced rates of corporation tax instead of at normal rates.</P>
    <P>(4)  <i>&ldquo;Section 84&rdquo; loans</i></P>
    <P>These figures include preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.  The figures are gross figures, and do not take account of the yield from the levy on section 84 loan interest which was introduced in 1986.  This levy yielded £14.4 million in 1987, £18.5 million in 1988 and £24.9 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>(5)  <i>Capital allowances</i></P>
    <P>The cost figure included for each year is estimated by reference to accounting periods ending in the year to 5 April immediately preceding each of the years in question, e.g. year ended 5 April 1988 relates to the column headed 1988-89.</P>
    <P>(6)  <i>Reduced rate of corporation tax for small companies</i></P>
    <P>The reduced rate of tax was terminated as respects profits and interest arising after 1 April 1989.</P>
    <P>(7)  <i>Business Expansion Scheme</i></P>
    <P>The relief for investment in corporate trades, known as the business expansion scheme, is an income tax relief available to individuals on investments in qualifying companies.</P>
    <P>In regard to the estimates above relating to the cost to the Exchequer of export sales relief, Shannon relief and the reduced rate of tax for manufacturing profits, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises might not have been set up here.  To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of each cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.</P>
    <P>The cost estimates relating to export sales relief and Shannon relief are based on the assumption that the profits involved would have been charged at the standard rate of corporation tax &mdash; which was 50 per cent for almost all of the profits in question &mdash; were it not for the reliefs. When these reliefs ended on 5 April 1990, the profits became chargeable at the 10 per cent rate where they qualified under the appropriate provisions.</P>

      <Quest>(a) the amount of tax foregone by companies paying employees dividends on preference shares, which are paid out of reserves consisting of profits exempted from taxation because of export sales relief and (b) whether the Revenue Commissioners operate a rule that a maximum of 30 per cent of employee remunerations can be paid in such a way; and if he will outline the basis for this rule.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption from taxation referred to arises from the relief from corporation tax which applied up to 5 April 1990 and which was designed to encourage exports.  The benefit of the relief accrues to all shareholders in a qualifying company and not just to employees.  While the relief has been discontinued, shareholders may continue to benefit from tax-free dividends arising from the distribution from the pool of export profits existing as of 5 April 1990.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available in relation to the operation of the scheme in respect of particular categories of shareholders such as employees.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not operate any rule about maximum employee remunerations on the lines suggested by the Deputy.  There is no legislative basis for such a rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may have in mind the safeguards in section 54 of the 1974 Finance Act to ensure that companies do not attempt to minimise the tax liability of <Col N="2250" /> senior management or other employees by paying them in shares which would attract a tax-free dividend rather than a taxable salary.  The section provides that where a person receives no emoluments from a tax-relieved company for services rendered by him to that company, or receives emoluments in respect of such services which, in the opinion of the commissioners are not adequate as consideration for the services rendered, and that person receives tax-relieved dividends from that company, the commissioners may deem part of all of the dividends to be emoluments of that person, which are taxable in the ordinary way.  Decisions in relation to this section are made by the Revenue Commissioners based on the facts of each individual case; no &ldquo;rule of thumb&rdquo; of the kind described by the Deputy is operated.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not available.  I am, however, informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are approximately 46,000 <Col N="2253" />&ldquo;close companies&rdquo; on the records of the Revenue Commissioners for corporation tax purposes.  &ldquo;Close companies&rdquo; are companies where five or fewer individuals control more than 50 per cent of the shares.  These are, in the main, family owned companies.  The Deputy may also wish to note that there are some 170,000 self-employed cases on record who are assessed for income tax under Schedule D.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the certificate of tax free allowances which is about to be issued to the taxpayer will show a tax rate of 53 per cent.  This is <Col N="2254" /> because it is expected that the taxpayer's and her husband's joint income will not greatly exceed the exemption limit and she is being given the benefit of marginal relief.</P>
      <P>Marginal relief operates to ensure that the tax payable in respect of the taxpayer's total income is no more than 53 per cent of the excess of their total income over the exemption limit.  In every case in which it applies, it is more favourable to the taxpayer than taxation under the normal system of applying the standard rate to their taxable income, i.e. income less personal allowances and reliefs: this is because, although the rate of tax is higher, the amount of income to which it applies is considerably less.</P>
      <P>Any tax deducted since the commencement of her employment will be refunded by her employer on the operation of this certificate.</P>

    <P>This table takes account of the transfer of functions out of the Civil Service during the period 1981-1990 to An Post, Telecom Éireann and Coillte Teo.  It also takes account of internal changes within the Civil Service, mainly in the following functions: Tourism, Transport, Industry, Commerce, Communications, Marine, Forestry and Fisheries.  Figures are where possible kept consistent with current departmental responsibilities.  Thus, although there was no Department of the Marine until 1987, this table shows figures back to 1981, which represent a best estimate of the numbers engaged in that function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>First and foremost I would like to reiterate to the Deputy and to the House that the Government are fully committed to decentralisation to Dundalk.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to An Post is that the company have run into financial difficulty and has drawn up proposals to return the company to profitability. These proposals provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for a reduction of 1,500 or 19 per cent, in the company's workforce.  The company's recovery proposals will represent a major upheaval of work practices and organisational structure.  If successful it will be a major step forward for An Post but that success is dependent on the simultaneous advancement of a number of complex, and in an industrial relations context, sensitive projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances and having regard to the statutory commercial mandate of An Post, I understand that the company <Col N="2258" /> are not at this stage in a position to give a commitment to the transfer of any staff to Dundalk or to any other location for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Given the above I have recently requested the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to approach Bord Telecom Éireann with a view to that organisation transferring staff to Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The question of designating a Government Department to decentralise to Dundalk does not therefore arise at this point.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works in conjunction with Kerry County Council and Killarney UDC are preparing proposals on the jaunting car service in Killarney which will improve safety and will enhance visitors' enjoyment of this unique resource.  They hope to meet with representatives of the jarveys to outline their proposals once these are finalised.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether any relevant projects due to be carried out by the Office of Public Works, such as the interpretative centre proposed in County Wicklow, whilst not open to the normal planning process, should, at least, be subjected to an environmental impact assessment due to the sensitivity of the area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>The proposed visitor centre for the Wicklow Mountains national park was first announced when the park was launched in April 1990.  Since then the Office of Public Works in consultation with the planning authority selected a site for the centre which would convey a flavour of the Wicklow Mountains and provide for walks within the site without in any way damaging the mountains themselves.</P>
      <P>While the development is so far below the EIA thresholds that an assessment is not needed, nevertheless the Office of Public Works, in view of the concerns expressed, have decided to commission a study.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that the Office of Public Works are complying fully with their statutory functions in this matter.  In addition they have attended a public meeting, participated in debate on local radio and have had six meetings with different voluntary organisations in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be happy to circulate both Deputies with further information on the project outlining the minimal impact this worthwhile development, which will employ up to 24 people, will have.  In addition I invite Deputies to visit Glenveagh national park where a similar development has worked in harmony <Col N="2260" /> with conservation to the benefit of the local community there.</P>

      <P>The exact population of foxes throughout Ireland is unknown but it is believed that the population had increased in recent years due to a decline in hunting.  Foxes prey upon ground nesting birds and significantly reduce their numbers.</P>
      <P>The fox is not a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and may therefore be killed without a licence at any time.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office is the official source for the employment details requested.  The Central Statistics Office's latest statistical bulletin shows employment in the pharmaceutical industry, NACE Code 2570, at 6,200 as at June 1990, provisional. I understand that the Central Statistics Office do not provide any breakdown of employment in the pharmaceutical industry by category or location.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of planning conditions takes place primarily under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment. Responsibility for the enforcement of planning and environmental conditions is currently a matter for the appropriate local authority; the proposed Environmental Protection Agency will be responsible for environmental licensing and monitoring when it is established. The industrial development agencies, on foot of an instruction from me some time ago, support these authorities by withholding grants from companies in breach of planning and environmental requirements.</P>
      <P>The pharmaceutical industry has been one of the key contributors to job creation in recent years.  The agencies will be looking to the pharmaceutical industry to make significant contribution to the achievement of the 20,000 new jobs per annum from industry/international services over the period of the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>Regulations provide that the relevant income tax year in relation to pay-related benefit is the last complete income tax year before the beginning of the pay-related benefit year in which the first day of incapacity for work in a period of interruption of employment occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned had insufficient earnings in this country in the 1988-89 tax year to establish entitlement to pay-related benefit.  However, it is understood that he worked in Germany for part of 1988 and he can be credited with earnings for that year.  Details have been requested from the German authorities <Col N="2278" /> and on receipt of this information the question of entitlement to pay-related benefit will be further examined.</P>
    <P>For the vast majority of claimants the governing contribution year for disability benefit purposes coincides with the relevant income tax year for pay-related benefit purposes.  However, in a small number of instances where a person does not qualify for disability benefit initially but continues to claim into a new benefit year, it can happen that he will then satisfy the contribution conditions in the later contribution year and, therefore, be entitled to payment of flat-rate disability benefit.  However, the determination of pay-related benefit entitlement continues to be tied by regulations to the earlier income tax year because that was the tax year which governed the benefit year in which he first became incapacitated.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to have this provision examined further with a view to ensuring that a more satisfactory mechanism can be found for cases of this type.</P>

      <P>In general unemployed people are required to be available for and seeking full-time work to be entitled to unemployment benefit.  However, people in part-time employment can in certain circumstances qualify for unemployment benefit in respect of days when they cannot get work.  Benefit in these cases is payable at a daily <i>pro rata</i> rate being onesixth of the weekly rate of benefit.  Benefit can only be payable where there are three days of unemployment in any six days, excluding Sundays.  Such people are expected to be available for and seeking full-time work and must satisfy the normal contribution conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have decided to give social insurance cover to more part-time <Col N="2279" /> workers.  Last month I made regulations bringing part-time workers who earn £40 a week or more into the social insurance system, with effect from 6 April.</P>
    <P>I have been reviewing the benefit entitlements of these part-time workers and others on low earnings and I am currently finalising detailed arrangements for the application of benefit rates to them on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that in the case of a couple living together, where one spouse is in receipt of unemployment assistance and the other unemployment benefit, the total amount payable to the household cannot exceed the amount which would be payable if one spouse were claiming and the other were an adult dependant.  This provision was brought into operation in 1986 in the context of the legislation on equal treatment for men and women in the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>A review group on the treatment of households in the social welfare system was set up in May 1989 to examine the social welfare code in so far as it affects households with particular regard to the equal treatment provisions.  The issue raised by the Deputy is one of the issues which has been addressed by the review group.</P>
      <P>The group have completed their review of the present arrangements and I expect to receive their report shortly.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, weekly rent supplements may be paid by <Col N="2282" /> the health boards where the claimant's rent exceeds £3.50 per week.  In general, the practice is to pay a supplement which will leave the claimant with a disposable income, after payment of rent, which is equal to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate, less £3.50.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for making and amending rent schemes for local authority dwellings was devolved to local authorities in August 1986.  Local authorities were required by the Minister for the Environment to ensure that rent schemes adopted by them were based on certain broad principles.  One of these was that the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households.</P>
      <P>It is a further requirement that provision should be included for the acceptance of lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases, where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
      <P>The health boards do not normally pay rent supplements to persons paying differential rents as it is open to the local authorities to invoke hardship clauses under the differential rent schemes so as to reduce the rents charged.</P>

      <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul operate a programme of home management and personal development courses.  These courses are designed to help people on low incomes manage their budget and acquire basic domestic skills in low cost nutritional cooking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courses generally operate for a three week period and deal with such other matters as housekeeping, personal development, child care, health care and craftwork.  Crèche facilities are provided <Col N="2283" /> and each course is directed by a course leader of proven skill.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the value of courses of this nature and over the years I have provided very substantial grants to the society for this purpose.  In April 1988 I provided a grant of £100,000 for a nation-wide series of personal development and home management courses.  In May 1989, I provided a grant of £500,000 to the society, part of which was used for this purpose.  I provided a further £100,000 in December last to enable the society to continue and expand their activities in this area.</P>
    <P>Over 7,000 families already have benefited under the programme which is regarded by the society as their most effective strategy for helping families on low incomes.  Further families benefited from such courses under the scheme of grants for locally based women's groups which I introduced last year bringing the total to 10,000 families.</P>
    <P>I believe that through their nationwide locally based conferences, the society are ideally placed to operate these courses <Col N="2284" /> and it is my intention to continue to provide practical support for their work in this area.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>The introduction of household budget management facilities for social welfare recipients is being planned by my department in conjunction with An Post.</P>
      <P>The bulk of social welfare recipients are paid through the post office system and a budget management facility would give greater scope for people to plan and manage their financial affairs.</P>
      <P>This facility will be provided as part of the modernisation of post office counter services which will give social welfare recipients a greater choice in the method by which they can receive their social welfare entitlement.

      <P>It is expected that an electronic fund transfer facility will be introduced for child benefit recipients during the first half of 1992.  In time this facility will be extended to other groups of recipients.</P>
      <P>These developments will provide a choice in the method by which people can receive their social welfare payments and a degree of flexibility which is not possible using existing payment methods. This flexibility will enable those social welfare clients who may wish to do so make full use of existing banking facilities such as household budget planning and, for example, automatic transfer of payments to the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received numerous representations over the years seeking such facilities for social welfare clients.  I <Col N="2286" /> would like to stress that the arrangements will be voluntary and are intended to provide a convenient and a modern method of paying regular bills on the same basis as those in employment can arrange with their bank or credit card company.</P>
    <P>The bulk of social welfare recipients are paid at post offices and An Post plan to provide similar facilities as part of their automation and modernisation of post office counter services.  My Department are working closely with An Post on these developments.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings are matters for the local authority to be funded from their own resources.  Under the remedial works scheme, capital allocations are made to enable authorities to carry out major refurbishment projects to designated estates.  The corporation have sought approval under the scheme for eight of their estates and the four to which they have attached the highest priority have been designated for funding. Due to the high level of overall demands for funding and the relative priority accorded by the corporation to the estates referred to by the Deputy it has not, to date, been possible to designate them for funding under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn):</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility of local authorities for the maintenance of public roads includes the duty both to prevent danger to road users and to clear roads of obstructions.  Accordingly, local authorities are obliged to remove any fallen trees that is an obstruction to traffic using public road and also to ensure that trees growing on road margins or other land under their control are not a danger to road users.  It is a matter for each local authority to arrange inspections of such trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2299" /> Local authorities also have specific powers under section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925, to request a landowner or occupier to cut or trim trees which may cause obstruction to a road or cause danger by obstructing the view of persons using the road.  There is a right of appeal to the District Court for an order annulling such a request.  The section also includes a provision enabling a local authority to seek an order of the District Court empowering it to carry out such trimming or cutting of trees and to recover the cost where the landowner or occupier refuses to do such works despite a District Court order requiring him to do so.</P>
    <P>My Department recently re-issued comprehensive advice to local authorities on roadside trees.  This reminded them of their statutory powers and in particular asked them to bring to the notice of landowners any trees which they considered to be dangerous.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries of the Eastern <Col N="2301" /> Health Board concerning this matter and I understand that the board have written to the Deputy in relation to the issues raised.</P>
      <P>The board have indicated that, as far as they are aware, no long stay patients were transferred from the Eastern Health Board psychiatric services to Ballymun during the years to which the Deputy refers.  However, residents in Ballymun do have psychiatric in-patient care available to them for their psychiatric problems as appropriate.  The board are developing community based psychiatric services in this area and the services of a full-time consultant psychiatric and support staff are available at the Ballymun Health Centre.  The board are also in the process of upgrading a premises in the Ballymun Shopping Centre for use as a psychiatric day centre and this is due to open shortly.</P>
      <P>Assistance has been provided by the Eastern Health Board to some residents in the Ballymun area in the form of furniture and household effects, in addition to assistance through the supplementary welfare system.</P>
      <P>The board have very good liaison arrangements with voluntary organisations operating in the Ballymun area and the board have a special committee which keep all health and social related issues in their functional area under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174, 175 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a case which was the subject of a written judgment delivered by the President of the District Court on 8 February 1991.  I have received a copy of that judgment and a preliminary report from the Eastern Health Board in relation to its involvement in the case.  When I have studied these papers, I will consider whether there is a need to conduct further inquiries into the case or to introduce changes in practices and procedures in the handling of child sexual abuse investigations by health boards.</P>
      <P>I would, however, point out that the case in question had its origins in 1987. Since then there have been significant changes in the way in which allegations of child sexual abuse are investigated by health boards.  Revised guidelines on procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child sexual abuse were issued by my Department in July 1987.  The new guidelines included, for the first time, specific provisions in relation to the investigation of allegations of child sexual abuse.  Early in 1988 two new units for the investigation and management of child sexual abuse were established at Temple Street Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, to deal primarily with cases arising in the Eastern Health Board region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1988 a special allocation of £0.5 million from the national lottery was <Col N="2303" /> made to enable the other health boards to establish appropriate services in their areas.  Services are now in place in each health board area; some are based in hospitals while others are provided on a community basis.</P>
    <P>Following judgments of the Supreme Court in July and November 1989 in another case involving allegations of child sexual abuse &mdash; The State (D) <i>v.</i> G &mdash; all of the health boards have reviewed their procedures in this area, with particular reference to the furnishing of details of the evidence to parents and their legal advisers before cases come to court.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Bill, 1988, which is now being examined by the Seanad contains a number of provisions which are relevant to the problem of child sexual abuse. These facilitate intervention by health boards or the gardaí where children are in serious danger and clarify the circumstances in which children who have been ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused may be placed in care by the courts.</P>
    <P>With regard to Question No. 176, I would remind the Deputy that children who have been abused, whether sexually or otherwise, cannot be placed in care against the wishes of their parents unless this is ordered by the courts.  The person referred to by the Deputy was involved in the investigation of a number of cases of alleged child sexual abuse.  However, the evidence of that person was only part of the overall case presented by the health board to the court.  The decision as to whether to place children in care is for the courts to determine following a full hearing of all the evidence and in reaching its decision the court must act in accordance with the relevant legislative and constitutional provisions. Where children are placed in care by the courts, the question of whether to return them to the full time care of their parents is a matter for the courts.</P>

      <P>The necessary arrangements in relation to the commissioning of the acute psychiatric unit in Tralee General Hospital are progressing well and it is expected that the unit will open later this year.  The new unit will provide acute psychiatric admission facilities for Kerry.  This development will free up the existing acute unit at St. Finan's and will enable the Southern Health Board to transfer patients in the main hospital building at St. Finan's to improved accommodation in the vacated unit.  The operation of an acute psychiatric unit in a general hospital environment is in line with policy on the development of a modern psychiatric service as outlined in <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>

      <P>I <Col N="2305" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the recent national nutrition survey carried out by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute was sponsored by the company (details supplied). The institute is the professional body of the dietetic profession in this country and the proposals for, and the conducting and analysis of, the survey were carried out independently, professionally and objectively by the institute.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to comment on what effect, if any, this survey may have had on the company's advertising market.  No doubt, however, other food companies will pay close attention to the results of the survey towards meeting the nutritional requirements of the population.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that in general adequate research is available both on what we eat and how our eating patterns influence our long term health prospects.  In this context the results of the INDI survey were encouraging and showed that a varied and nutritious supply of food is available to the Irish population.</P>
      <P>My Department now intends to update its nutritional surveillance programmes and to arrange for the carrying out of micro-surveys, as necessary, to ensure that a comprehensive data base on the food supply, food consumption patterns and morbidity and mortality associated with nutrition is maintained as a basis for policy planning and service development. In this regard, at my request the Nutritional Sub-Committee of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion is also currently reviewing strategy in relation to food and good health and will make recommendations to me shortly.  Central to any strategy must be helping people to make informed choices about the food they eat and the provision of healthy food through catering and retail outlets, irrespective of the origin of the foodstuffs or the type of retail outlet in which they are sold.</P>

      <P>I have placed strong emphasis on tackling waiting lists in general and waiting lists for orthopaedic surgery in particular.  In this regard I made additional funds available to the Southern Health Board in 1989 which enabled them to increase the number of hip replacement operations by 100.  The increase in elective orthopaedic surgery is being maintained.</P>
      <P>The admission of an individual patient to hospital is a matter for the hospital authority and the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under regular review and priority is given to urgent cases.  If the patient's condition has deteriorated he should contact his general practitioner who will be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>
