      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 13, 14 and 15.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that (1) the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 13, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Health; (2) the Dáil, at its rising today shall adjourn until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 June 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Government's rejection of the idea of an all-party committee on employment and the fact that Mr. Billy Attley, one of Ireland's leading trade unionists, has accused the Government of sleep-walking on the jobs issue, have the Government any intention to make provision to allow Members of this House play a constructive role in making suggestions that would help <Col N="554" /> relieve the growing sense of crisis and hopelessness about the jobs issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that fully, Sir, but, unfortunately, the rules of this House are not providing an adequate means to raise the growing concern of people about jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many ways of dealing with that matter in the House such as by way of questions and motions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the Government have their jobs they are not particularly concerned about anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the unfortunate news that is emerging from Northern Ireland on the talks, will the Taoiseach not at this stage consider that the promised meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister should be held as quickly as possible to try to get these talks back on the rails?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is <Col N="555" /> not a matter appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach expressed concern on this matter in this House just two days ago and I am sure it is shared by all Members.  Will the Taoiseach give his view on what the Government's position is at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proceedings, as the Deputy can see, are exceedingly tortuous but we live in hope.  The Deputy can be assured that any action the Government can take either at a bilateral or east-west level will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that the Government are open to taking whatever steps are necessary to facilitate the talks getting under way.  I am sure he is aware, as is everybody, of the growing dismay at how difficult it appears to be to get these talks going.</P>
      <P>Yesterday when I asked the Taoiseach about the foreign affairs committee he indicated he was willing to consider consulting the leaders of the parties in Opposition on this matter to see if there is some way of expediting the establishment of this committee.  Will he indicate if he has considered this matter and if, as a matter of urgency, he will arrange such meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to add at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, or the Minister for Agriculture and Food, when it is proposed to make available to the Members of the House the document which shows the areas to be included in the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme and the reclassification of disadvantaged areas as more severely disadvantaged.  The document has been published.  Is it proposed to make it available to Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This question does not refer specifically to legislation <Col N="556" /> but, perhaps, we could have some indication about the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is anxious to have the fullest possible information made available on this major increase in the disadvantaged areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has made it available to the Deputies on his side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any area represented by Deputy Paddy Sheehan is by that fact disadvantaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At repeated elections the people of the area are concerned have indicated that they do not agree with the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, the Taoiseach's various visits to the area have not worked out particularly well for him; he has tended to go astray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taoiseach, you were lucky to survive in the extreme end of my constituency.  I am warning him not to go too near it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely not.  There are things the Deputy should stay out of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Taoiseach propose to do about the fact that of the 28 Bills on the Government's legislative programme for this session, 14 of them have not been introduced for debate in this House?  What does the Taoiseach propose to do about the legislation on product liability, the International Carriage by Rail Bill, the Patents Bill, the Payment of Wages Bill, <Col N="557" /> the Colleges Bill, the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, the University of Limerick (Dissolution of Thomond College) Bill, the Land Bill, the Family Planning Bill, the B &amp; I Bill, the Solicitors Bill and the Oireachtas Members' Allowance Bill?  None of these promised items on the Government programme has yet been introduced.  Will they be introduced before the end of the session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy examined the Order of Business for today he would find that two of the Bills he mentioned are included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I asked a question which was in order but the Taoiseach did not see fit to stand and reply to it.  He said something under his breath which I did not hear.  I would appreciate a reply to the question on the foreign affairs committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was not actually in order but out of courtesy to the Deputy I indicated that I have no further comment to make at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach has indicated that he will be introducing in this session a Bill dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor General and since there is promised legislation on allowances of Oireachtas Members and a foreign affairs committee, will the Taoiseach consider introducing comprehensive parliamentary reform, taking advantage of these Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should concentrate his fire on the legislation in which he is particularly interested.  It is <Col N="558" /> on target but I cannot give the Deputy a date for it.  We are as anxious as he is to have it brought into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the promised foreign affairs committee, would it not be appropriate to end this nonsense and take it from the Taoiseach that the promise to establish this committee has now been withdrawn and that a foreign affairs committee is not to be established?  Will the Taoiseach come clean and tell us that he does not have the guts to establish the committee?  Is that not the case?  Why do we have this daily farce?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to business today in respect of the Health (Amendment) Bill and to what Deputy Bruton said earlier about employment, does the Taoiseach intend to make a statement soon on whether we are to have a Tallaght regional hospital and if employment will be provided there?  It is a much needed facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Deputy Ferris and I am proposing that we discuss together amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, by agreement.  Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 are alternatives to amendment No. 1. Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 21 to 42. </P>
      <P>This amendment proposes the deletion of a section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is a replica of the amendment I moved yesterday just before the Committee Stage debate was guillotined.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 33 to 35 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Except in the case of an emergency, nothing in this Act shall permit the Minister, or Health Boards, or others to redesignate public beds in public hospitals as private beds.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>During his Second Stage speech the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill has been enacted I will immediately be making the regulations <Col N="561" /> in question and my intention is to provide for the designation of public beds as public and private and that public patients must be accommodated in public beds and private patients in private beds. </P>
    <P>He went on to say that in preparation for this new system his Department have been involved in detailed discussions with every health board and public voluntary hospital, who have been asked to draw up proposals for the designation of public and private beds for a three-year phased implementation of the modified system of access to these beds.  My concern is to protect the existing entitlements of public patients in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that the numbers of public beds will not be interfered with and they will not be redesignated as private beds with a view to overcoming the loss of income to the public hospital from the VHI, which is considerable, and to deal with some of the problems the consultants had in making the case for the increase in their remuneration recommended in the Gleeson report.  The Minister stated that he would ensure that the number of public beds available would remain the same.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible then to reconcile his statement on Second Stage with regard to the purpose of the Bill and his approach to my amendment unless, of course, the Minister wants to accept the amendment which would ensure that he and his successors or any health board or hospital agency could not then interfere with the existing list of public beds.  If the Minister gives that commitment he should accept the amendment, If he does not accept the amendment there will always be a question mark over his intention for public beds.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there are closed public beds in existence in public hospitals throughout the country&mdash;some 1,000 beds altogether.  Will the Minister admit that it is his intention to reopen those beds and redesignate them as private beds since there would be no additional cost to the Department?  I am <Col N="562" /> specifically concerned with the existing open public beds.  I do not want to see a diminution in them or to see them redesignated. If that happens this Bill will have been a shambles.  I want to protect the existing public beds of which there are not enough, as is obvious from the length of the waiting lists.  There seems to be disagreement as to whether the Minister knows how many public and private beds there are, as of today, in any hospital.  I have a list from the health board in my own area, which is compiled annually and submitted to the Minister, of the total number of beds available in each faculty in all the hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the Minister for Health, who has overall national responsibility to the Government and to this Parliament, says he does not have the information.  He must know, for example, that Waterford Regional Hospital has 64 medical beds.  Can he tell me how many of those are public and how many are private?  There are 67 surgical beds, five gynaecological beds, 50 paediatric beds and 15 ophthalmic beds, although under an asterisk which is at the bottom of the report they are called authorised.  I could give the figures for every hospital in the region.  I could even give the rate of occupancy of beds.  The health boards submit all this information to the Minister every year.  Surely if the Minister looks at all this information and at that supplied by the VHI he should be able to say how many private beds there are at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that he was satisfied that he would not lose any public beds in this process.  I would like the Minister to clarify this.  Deputy Bruton has a similar amendment which is not as specific as mine because it looks for equality between the two.  In a public hospital we must discriminate in favour of the public patient because it is a public hospital intended for public patients and in which the majority of beds are public beds.  I do not want to see equal access in a public hospital for public and private patients.  I want the present discrimination in favour of public beds to continue.  I take it that in private hospitals <Col N="563" /> all the beds are private beds and it is presumed that anybody who goes to them has to pay privately or through the VHI.</P>
    <P>I am speaking specifically about public hospitals.  I am aware that the number of private beds in public hospitals is small: I gave an example yesterday, maybe four or five beds.  The Minister is aware also that, since the implementation of the common contract which is at present in operation by the consultant surgeons, they renegotiated with the Minister for additional beds to be made available for consultants for private patients.  That could account for Deputy Allen's comment that up to 40 per cent of public beds were occupied by private patients.  This was an arrangement of bed days being made available to consultant surgeons in hospitals to enable them to continue to have some private practice in a public hospital.  Perhaps the numbers I gave the Minister yesterday were on the low side and the situation may have changed.  If so I would like to know today how many private beds are in all the public hospitals before this Bill passes through the House, by guillotine again, at 1 o'clock.  I want to know now and I think I am entitled to know.  I want to retain that number, and if there is a change in that number in the future we will have something to argue about because we will have the Minister's commitment on the record.  I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled this amendment overnight as a middle ground between the Minister's position and that of Deputy Ferris.  I understand that one of the difficulties the Minister has with Deputy Ferris's amendment is that as of now we do not have a precise indication of the number of public beds.  The Minister has instituted an inquiry with the health boards who will, in time, be coming back to him with what they regard as the necessary complement of public beds.  Whenever I have asked questions about the number of public beds I did not get a reply.  I presume the Minister does not have the information at his disposal <Col N="564" /> and in that situation it would be hard to make Deputy Ferris's amendment work.</P>
      <P>Instead of concentrating on the allocation of beds, which we do not have sufficient information at our disposal to do, I am proposing that where the Minister is taking responsibility to decide about access to private care and is in a position to decide between private and public beds in effect, the regulations should provide for sufficient public beds to provide care for all those who seek access as public patients in an equitable manner with those provided for those seeking private care.</P>
      <P>The Minister must recognise that any hospital which is, in the Gospel terms, a wise steward would write up its number of private beds to the highest possible level because it gives it an opportunity of some flexibility on funding.  That is a real danger we have to be alive to.  We have to build into the legislation protection for the public patient from the situation where a health board or a hospital finds itself under financial pressure, and, as a way out, designates extra private beds.</P>
      <P>Let me say that that would not necessarily be offensive in the same sense that they could still, under the Minister's regulations, put public patients into those private beds.  There would be nothing to stop the authority putting public patients into the private beds, so having them designated private is a win/win situation for health boards in that when they have private patients to put into them they can get revenue but when they have public patients they can put them in also.  What we need is not some sort of crude fossilisation of a ratio between public and private beds that would be there for all time, because that does not reflect the sort of changes that health boards and hospitals would have to deal with as the years go by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want an assurance that, first, in the earmarking of beds as public and private in any one year, there will be fair access for public patients; in other words equal waiting times for public and private patients.  That is the sense of subsection (1).  The sense of subsection (2) is that, recognising that we live in a changing <Col N="565" /> world, year on year, both the bed mix and the case mix should be reviewed to ensure equity between public and private patients and a reasonable equality in waiting times for surgical treatment.  That is the most sensible way I can see to put into the legislation what I think the Minister and all of us want to see copperfastened in legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a danger if we adopt the notion that you designate a certain number of private beds so that they are more or less fixed for all time, not subject to annual review.  Then consultants may see they have, so to speak, property rights in those private beds, that those are their beds, and no growth in public need, sudden emergency or increase in the number of people opting for public care can take those beds from them.  I think no consultant should be given that sort of property rights in beds in a public hospital. Under the present regulation it would be extremely difficult for a hospital to row back in the event that, say, they found suddenly that the services were not there for public patients or they could not give acceptable waiting times.  Where would they then turn if a sort of property right was given away in private beds?  There must be the flexibility to review on a year by year basis and to say, &ldquo;Okay, last year you had so many private beds but because of the pressures of public care and the needs of the public patients we cannot provide those&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A consultants' contract has recently been signed.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong in what I am about to say because he is much closer to it than we get from the odd newspaper clip.  I understand that under the new contract the hospital consultants have a commitment to certain hours at the hospital.  They do not have an explicit commitment of hours to public patients, they have an overall commitment to the hospital.  If there was a fixed property right in private beds and if the health boards over-designated the private beds, given clinical independence and so on which the Minister pointed out, it would be very difficult for the hospital authorities to prevent those private beds being used up to a level that might leave <Col N="566" /> the public service inferior.  The consultant would still be honouring his contract, coming in, working the 33 hours, but there would be a tendency to over use the private side of his practice.  I understand that the element in the Gleeson report that seemed to be trying to deal with that, namely that consultants' pay would be reduced in proportion to private practice, is not in the renegotiated contract. Under Gleeson's original proposals as I understood them, if 25 per cent of a consultant's workload was private there would be a comparable reduction in his public salary.  That element is gone in the consultant's contract.  There will be an incentive for the hospitals to play safe and designate a high number of beds as private so they will have the flexibility to earn revenue in years to come if certain things happen.</P>
    <P>To avoid all those risks we need an amendment such as I have put in here. We state clearly that the basis of allocation between public and private beds is to ensure fair waiting times between the two extremes.  Secondly, we insist there be an annual review and no property rights given to anyone as to the number of private beds.  If circumstances change and there is more need for public care the hospital has the ability to see to that. I feel my amendment fits in with the way the common contract seems to be negotiated and it gives the authorities, the Minister and the public patients a better chance of a fair shake out, which we are all trying to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to understand why these are being proposed.  In amendment No. 5 I propose that the regulations should be brought before the House.  We still have the question of private practice. Over the years and in the past decade particularly the bone of contention was the use of public beds for private patients in our public hospitals with no control over that.  I thought this amendment would eliminate that completely.  I am beginning to have doubts.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> indicates that the Government are committed to maintaining the position of <Col N="567" /> private practice both within and outside the public hospital system.  Why is it emphasised so much if the Government's intention was not to eliminate entirely but to reduce the level of private practice in public hospitals?  The abuse of that system over the years was horrendous. Consultants are paid their salaries to do the job but because no resources were provided by the health boards patients who had VHI cover were admitted as private patients, so the consultants were paid twice.</P>
      <P>At the last meeting of my health board I received a copy of a document issued to the boards which indicated that the designation of day beds between public and private is necessary as for other beds available to elective patients.  That is mentioned as is the issue of involvement of consultants.  On the one hand we are now giving consultants an increase.  Some of them got from £13,000 to £17,000 as well as salary increases of 30 per cent to 50 per cent and we are still giving the same consultants the right to a say on what private beds will be available.  It seems each hospital has been requested to ensure its consultants are fully involved in drawing up these proposals.  The proposals will have to be agreed by the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is there still such emphasis on private practice in our public hospitals if the whole purpose of this measure is to eliminate the problem that arose over the years?  I am beginning to wonder whether the points made yesterday evening have more validity than I attributed to them when I listened to the debate then.  Is there an intention to introduce a system whereby the resources being provided for health care are so restricted that the health boards will use the beds in our hospitals for private care and VHI cover will be availed of?  That is a real danger unless the Minister gives a categorical assurance that that is not the case and specified the ratio in hospitals.  In a 100-bed hospital what would he see as a fair ratio of private/public beds?  The Minister also needs to come clean on the number <Col N="568" /> of beds per thousand of the population in the State generally.  I think a figure of three beds per thousand of the population was given four or five years ago. However, I think that figure has gone out the window at this stage.  I should like the Minister to reply to these questions.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 proposes that:</P>
    <P>Where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act, a draft of each regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House. </P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Ferris proposes that:</P>
    <P>Except in the case of an emergency, nothing in this Act shall permit the Minister, or Health Boards, or others to redesignate public beds in public hospitals as private beds. </P>
    <P>This is a specific proposal.  Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 3 proposes that the regulations shall <i>inter alia</i>&ldquo;provide for the provision of sufficient public beds to provide care for all those who seek access as public patients...&rdquo;.  I also support this amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the situation where public-voluntary hospitals in Cork city receive more attention than the hospital in Mallow.  The hospitals in Cork city are given a subvention by the Department and as far as I am aware unlike other hospitals which receive subventions, they do not have to account for this money.  I should like to know if regulations will be introduced to rectify this anomaly.  Does the Minister have any power over such issues?  These are the main points I wanted to make and I hope the Minister will reply to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In his response yesterday the Minister attempted to attribute to me something I had not said.  I have never held consultants up to ridicule.  However, while the vast majority of consultants are conscientious and hard working, a number of them are abusing the system. As the Minister knows the common contract was so designed that it lent itself to <Col N="569" /> serious abuse.  He was wrong to stand up in this House and say that I was making wild allegations.  If the Minister knew his brief, he would know that three years ago the Southern Health Board, at my request, carried out a survey of the level of private practice in hospitals in their area.  That report clearly showed that there was widespread abuse in a number of specialities in hospitals in that area.  I do not think hospitals in the Southern Health Board area were unique in this respect.  By coming into this House and saying that there are no facts to substantiate my statements, the Minister has shown a lack of will to confront the abuse in some sections of the consultancy profession.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also aware of the merry-go-round syndrome which exists in hospitals where people are subjected to a battery of tests so that everyone gets a pluck at them.  I hope that the introduction of this legislation will eliminate such abuses.  I want to give two examples. If a person who is involved in an accident goes into hospital for an X-ray he is asked whether he is a member of the VHI or if he has a medical card or hospital services card.  The magic words are &ldquo;Voluntary Health Insurance.&rdquo;  If the person is a member of the VHI two or three weeks later he will get a bill from a radiologist or a group of radiologists he never saw. Eventually they will threaten legal action if he does not pay.  I hope that that type of activity will be eliminated under this legislation.  Analysts and pathologists can also get their pound of flesh for tests they have not carried out.  Technicians who are employed by the health board carry out the tests and the analysts and pathologists can also issue a bill for this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI have been bled almost dry by a small select number of consultants.  We have never tried to come to grips with this problem.  I believe there are still wide loopholes in the legislation.  I referred yesteday to the loophole in regard to bed complements.  The reply given by the Minister yesterday to this point was not satisfactory.  If, for example, I have a back problem, under the new legislation, <Col N="570" /> I will have to wait for up to nine months for an appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon in the Cork Regional Hospital or any public hospital.  However, if I go privately I will be guaranteed an appointment with him within two or three weeks and if I am diagnosed as having a serious medical problem I will be admitted to hospital immediately.  However, if I cannot afford to pay for a private examination I will have to wait a considerable period for my initial examination so that my complaint can be diagnosed.  Under this legislation the backdoor avenue into hospitals will continue to be open and people who visit consultants in their private rooms will be able to get into public beds.  The legislation will be meaningless unless the Minister plugs this loophole. If the backdoor avenue into hospitals continues to be open it will be academic whether we are talking about public or private beds and the quality of treatment one receives will depend on their resources.</P>
    <P>Hospitals do not have sufficient beds at present to deal with the demands on our health services.  This is a fact, and the waiting lists prove it.  The Minister may trot out impressive percentages here &mdash; 20 and 40 per cent decreases in waiting lists &mdash; but he should give us the true figures and indicate the number of people still waiting for public beds.  A five year old child who is waiting for a tonsillectomy whose hearing and performance at school are impaired will be condemned to wait for two years for this surgery if his parents cannot afford to pay for a bed in a hospital.  An elderly person in severe pain who is waiting for a hip replacement operation is condemned to wait for a considerable time for the necessary surgery &mdash; depending on the region it can take up to two or three years.  This proves that there are waiting lists and a shortage of beds at present. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is to have any meaning the loophole I have pinpointed has to be dealt with by the Minister, something he has not yet done.  The Minister should quantify for us the number of public beds in public hospitals as of 31 May 1991, <Col N="571" /> tomorrow.  He should tell us the number of public beds and private beds there will be so that we can decide whether there will be a change of use in regard to public beds.  I believe public beds will be used as private beds because the Minister is not giving any extra resources and he is not opening beds.  Therefore, if he is allocating private beds they will have to come off the public list.  The Minister should quantify the number of public beds in public hospitals so that we can be satisfied that the public will not be taken for a ride as regards this legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to set up immediately a national hospital bed register so that we can monitor the performance and effectiveness of the new legislation and regulations and keep an eye on what is happening.  The Minister is killing two birds with the one stone with this legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage he will bring in £90 million by the increased charges. There will be an extra cost to each person earning in excess of £16,500 and they will not receive a better service in fact, I contend they will get a worse service.  By redesignating public beds as private beds the Minister is effectively saying to the hospitals, you go away and generate your own revenue.  Will the Minister reduce the allocations to those hospitals eventually? Will the hospital replace the allocation they received from the Minister with revenue they are forced to raise by transferring the use of beds from public to private?  These questions are the nucleus of his legislation and are not being answered by the Minister.  I ask the Minister to give us the figures as we do not have them; we are depending on the Department to supply them.  When we table Dáil Questions we are told that figures are being compiled, are not readily available and will be supplied later but they do not arrive.  I urge the Minister to give us the facts and figures so that we can judge the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering these amendments we are getting to the nub of the Bill and, therefore, we are getting to <Col N="572" /> what the health services are supposed to be about.  In his lengthy speech the Minister has not stated clearly the basic principle on which we must operate, that everyone here from the most disadvantaged &mdash; the travellers or single parents &mdash; right up to Dr. Michael Smurfit and Dr. Tony O'Reilly is entitled to the same standard of medical and nursing skills.  I do not think that can be said often enough.  Of course, Dr. Michael Smurfit, Dr. Tony O'Reilly or anyone else is entitled to go into a private nursing home or a private bed in a public hospital and have a huge room with nice curtains, adequate visiting hours and have flowers put in the vase every day and pay dearly for it.  However, there should be no question of that person being able to jump the queue &mdash; as at present &mdash; or, having jumped the queue and being admitted to hospital having a higher standard of medical or nursing skills.  I do not think this problem is being addressed here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 3 refers to more flexibility.  In practice it is unlikely that there are too many public beds in hospitals.  Everyone knows that there are too few public beds in hospitals. I know a person who, since March, has been waiting for a public bed for major heart surgery.  About a week ago he had a severe cardiac arrest and I do not know if he will survive to avail of a public bed; he may even be dead by now.  This is appalling.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, tabled by Deputies R. Bruton and Sherlock, are similar.  In section 6(3) the Minister proposes to lay resolutions before the House and unless they are negatived by the House within 21 days they will come into effect.  That is a very bad way of doing business as there could be a U-turn; a regulation introduced by the Minister, or the health boards, may suddenly be reversed by the Dáil.  Surely the House should have responsibility for these matters. If the Minister were to put a reasonable resolution before the House the Dáil would deal with it expeditiously and in a reasonable manner.  The more we can do in the House and the less we leave to the Minister the better for democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the kernel of the Bill.  How one views it depends on the perspective one brings to the debate. From the point of view of the Department of Health that perspective is financial in the sense that it leaves a door open to health boards to use this section in determining the mix of public or private beds for revenue raising purposes to make up a shortfall.  The Minister has not given any assurance in this debate as to how that avenue will be blocked off from health boards and how the proper mix will be reached.</P>
      <P>A number of pertinent points must be made.  After three years we will have the solidification throughout the country of the number of beds, public or private. That is regrettable because we cannot say from one year to the next what will be the mix of public and private beds.  That will not work.  Age structures and demographic trends will have a critical impact on that equation.  The percentage of the population who have VHI cover is critical. In the post-1992 era if other health insurance companies are allowed into Ireland to compete with the VHI it is likely that the percentage of people with health insurance will increase.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the breakdown of beds should be based on the number of people who have health insurance.</P>
      <P>It should not be beyond the capacity of the Minister, and his officials, to arrive at a base line figure beyond which health boards cannot proceed.  There is evidence to suggest that the take-up of beds by people who are fortunate enough to be able to afford voluntary health insurance is not in the same proportion as the take-up of public beds by people who do not have that insurance.  In other words, the people who have VHI cover are healthier because of their status and their financial well-being in the community.  The perspective the Minister brings to the debate is not one of health care but rather one of financial considerations which will leave an avenue open to health boards to raise funds to make up a shortfall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A big question mark has been put by Deputies Allen and Bruton on a public <Col N="574" /> information campaign regarding eligibility. There is evidence to suggest that people who are entitled to free care are being charged for the services.  In the event of this legislation being passed there is a need for a public information campaign about people's entitlements.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not preparing any guidelines for health boards on the bed mix complement.  That is a deliberate ploy by the Department and is seen for what it is.  The revenue raising issue in the debate is misplaced in that any health legislation should be about improving health services and not motivated primarily by financial considerations.</P>

      <P>I have listened attentively to what the three spokespersons have said.  I do not intend to accept the amendments for a number of reasons.  The first point I would like to make is there is no mystery about what is happening in this legislation.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed by the Government and the social partners that we should bring forward this legislation. I want to assure the House that the legislation is in keeping with what the social partners wanted.  There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to introduce a change in the present arrangements for admission to public ward accommodation in public hospitals.  I propose to make regulations &mdash; I have a copy of the draft regulations in front of me &mdash; under the section Deputy Ferris's amendment proposes to delete, which would restrict the admission of elective private patients to public beds to emergency admissions.  This is the whole basis of the legislation, to restrict the admission of elective private patients to <Col N="575" /> public beds except for emergency admissions. This would free up public beds for public patients.  The deletion of this section as requested by Deputy Ferris would mean that the key element of the new arrangements could not be implemented.</P>
      <P>The designation of beds as private or public is essential to the new arrangements given the existing ambiguity which exists in a number of hospitals arising from the current practice where public patients may be accommodated in private beds and private patients accommodated in public beds.  The requirement to designate beds more clearly will also be included in the regulations as well as the requirement that I must approve all such designations.  I have already instructed health boards and hospitals that there is to be no reduction in the number of public beds when beds are being designated. Furthermore in cases where beds are regarded traditionally as private or semi-private but have a high occupancy of public patients, I will ensure that an appropriate proportion of these beds are designated as public beds.</P>
      <P>At present there are public patients in public beds, private patients in private beds and private patients in public beds. The difficulty arises with the private patients in public beds.  It is not possible to state how many private patients are in public beds for the simple reason that the patients change on a regular basis.  If you were to carry out a census on 31 May, as somebody requested, certainly we could provide the information for 31 May but it would not be the same as for 29 May, and that is understandable because of the present system.  One of the prime objectives of this legislation it to make sure that in future private patients will not take up public accommodation in public hospital and that those public beds will be freed up for public patients.</P>

I am sure the House will agree it would not be reasonable if a person who goes for a private consultation, finds he needs to go to hospital and opts to go as a public patient, has to go back on the waiting list to be examined by the consultant when his turn comes around.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give an example of what might happen in practice.  If on 1 June a patient goes to a consultant for a private consultation as an outpatient, the consultant decides that the patient should be in hospital and the patient opts to avail of his or her right to go as a public patient, then the hospital concerned will provide the patient with the next available public appointment, whether that appointment be in six weeks' time or, as is more usual, two or three weeks' time.  I accept that for certain disciplines the waiting lists are longer and patients might have to wait for three months.</P>
      <P>There is no mystery about what will happen.  I assure Deputies that there will be no unfair advantage given to patients who go to a consultant and then avail of their right to go public.  It is right in the interests of patient care that a patient should not be asked to go to a consultant and have a full physical examination and then be told that if he or she wants to take up the right to public accommodation he or she will have to go through exactly the same procedure again.  Nobody in the House would wish patients to be subjected to a second full physical examination unnecessarily.  I repeat my assurance that there will be no unfair advantage given to those who attend a private consultant.</P>
      <P>The review body on higher remuneration made recommendations in relation to consultants.  Their salaries and conditions of service were sent to the review body on higher remuneration, which is appropriate for highly paid senior public servants.  The negotiations that took place were based on that report and were in keeping with the recommendations in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment has been proposed in the name of Deputy Sherlock.  Deputy Garland also spoke to the amendment.  I shall first deal with the point made by <Col N="582" /> Deputy Garland that everybody is entitled to the same standard of medical skills.  I agree with the Deputy.  It would be fair to say that everybody receives the highest standard of medical and nursing skills in hospitals under the Irish health system.  The difference for private patients was referred to by Deputy Garland when he spoke of comfortable private wards and the provision of flowers in private accommodation.  It is very important to recognise that the standard and quality of medical and nursing care is of the very highest level and that all patients receive that when they go into hospital.  Everyone in the House would agree on that point.  The standard of care provided deserves the payment of great tribute to the health care staff who are responsible for it.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept either the amendment of Deputy Sherlock or Deputy Bruton's similar amendment that relate to regulations coming before the House and being passed by the House before coming into operation.  The course taken by the Government is the usual practice with such legislation.  It is not the practice and it would not be desirable that a debate in each House of the Oireachtas be required every time it was necessary to make variations, no matter how minor.  Under section 6 (3) the Oireachtas will be able to annul any regulations should it choose to do so and I do not consider it necessary to make provisions as proposed in the amendment.  Deputies would agree that for every piece of legislation coming before the House enabling regulations to be made the Opposition always put down an amendment to ensure that the regulations come in to be debated in the House.  Deputies opposite would also agree that were that practice accepted the Houses of the Oireachtas would do nothing other than debate all the regulations and all the changes in regulations going back over many years.  During the Order of Business this morning Opposition Deputies were very anxious that a long list of legislation be passed through the House.  In fairness to the House, it would be unreasonable to ask that every <Col N="583" /> minor detail and every change in regulations should be brought before the House.  Deputy Garland said that the House should have responsibility for change in the regulations.  The House will have responsibility for change in the regulations in that under section 6 (3) the regulations will be laid before the House and the House will have an opportunity to annul those regulations if Members so desire.  That position accords with standard practice and it is appropriate with this legislation.</P>
    <P>Again, I assure the House that beds designated private beds will be available for private patients and beds designated public beds will be available for public patients.  There will be no reduction in the number of public beds available.  No longer will private patients go into public beds, and that will free up public beds for public patients.  I assure the House that patients have the right to go to a consultant for a private consultation as outpatients, and I assure the House that that will not give advantage to such a patient ahead of a public patient who waits in turn to go to a public outpatient appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for at least putting on the record of the House responses that have removed some of my worries in this regard.  However, I would genuinely have preferred it if the matter had been legislated.  I wish to speak on three points made in the Minister's reply to my amendment and the other amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that public patients would have the oportunity to go to a private consultant in his private rooms for an opinion on the basis of the waiting lists &mdash; we already have more than 5,000 in our own health board area &mdash; of people waiting to see public consultants working for the State, consultants who also do some private work.  I have no problems with the consultants.  They are a very special group of people.  I admire the way that the Minister dealt with their <Col N="584" /> problem, which was examined by Gleeson and in negotiations with the Department. I said in my Second Stage speech that, although I was concerned that the new contract would not be accepted, I hoped it would be.  Consultants are very important people and they must be paid adequately, but I also have a responsibility as a public representative to ensure that public patients are protected in new legislation.  The Minister suggested &mdash; and, in fairness to him, I think it is his belief &mdash; that someone who goes to a private consultant in his private rooms for an opinion will not gain backdoor entry to hospital, that the patient will have to go back into the queue even if a decision is made to go into hospital as a public patient, which everybody is now entitled to do.  The Minister has missed the point of Opposition Deputies' arguments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody who pays for a private consultation, whether they pay £15, £40, or more, will at least get a medical, clinical opinion from the consultant on whether they need hospitalisation. If one is waiting on a public list to get an appointment with a consultant it surely affects the waiting time for hospitalisation, if needed.  One cannot get a hospital bed without having been seen by a consultant, either publicly or privately.  The only alternative to that is to allow the GP the decision as to whether or not one needs a bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave an example of a medical card holder, the wife of a pensioner, who had been waiting for two years to see an eye specialist.  She went to a private optician and an opinion was given that an operation was needed urgently.  She was admitted to hospital, practically blind, and was successfully operated on.  Had she continued to wait for the public service she would still be on the waiting list. That is my only argument in relation to people going privately for the initial consultation. The sooner the consultant's decision is given the sooner one can get into hospital, whether it be a public or a <Col N="585" /> private bed.  There might be people on the waiting lists who do not need hospitalisation, but how do we know?  All we know is that until they get a definitive decision after a clinical examination by the consultant a decision is not made. Unless the Minister allows the GP to make a decision there is not any way out of the problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has prepared regulations but I would like him to make those available to us as quickly as possible so that we can see if they address the problem about which we are talking. Time is of the essence.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech said that in preparation for the new system his Department had been involved in detailed discussions with every health board and public voluntary hospital.  He said they had been asked to draw up proposals for the designation of public and private beds and for a three-year phased implementation and that the proposals were being examined by the Department of Health, who are responsible for the overall coordination and monitoring of the new arrangements, as required under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>It is important to get the balance right in the designation of beds so as to reflect fairly patterns of public and private practice. There is nothing to stop health boards from redesignating existing public beds before the legislation is enacted and submitting a list of them to the Minister. On what basis does the Minister give his definitive response that there will not be a reduction in the number of public beds? Is the Minister basing his response on a redefined list submitted to him by chief executive officers in health boards?  At the moment people are going around hospitals with measuring tapes trying to work out which beds can be made private so as to submit this redesignated list to the Minister.  We are losing public beds while we are discussing the legislation. That is a big problem.  I accept the Minister's assurance that there will not be a loss of public beds but I would like the Minister to tell me from what date he is working.  I want to be assured that the <Col N="586" /> number of public beds will meet the demand.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not address the question of reopening closed public beds. They might be reopened as private beds. I would not have a problem with that because the more effective beds in the hospital the better.  Perhaps the Minister has already agreed with the consultants to do that.  Private beds are supposed to be self-funding through the VHI, but I would like to know if the staffing of these private beds would be self-funding.  To open more private beds in this way would increase availability of beds without disturbing the existing designation of public beds about which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>In emergencies public patients can avail of private beds.  If private beds were available in a non-emergency situation and if there was public demand for them, would they be available for public patients in the interests of improved health care?  The Minister has said that the beds cannot be mixed around.  I want to make sure that public patients will not be disadvantaged due to the lack of a bed.</P>
    <P>I have not deviated from the principle of the legislation throughout the debate here.  I will accept the Minister's reassurance that there will not be a reduction in public beds, but I would like to know from what date the Minister is talking.  I would also like to look at the regulations governing hospitals and health boards. The Minister said that regulations would be subject to amendment by the House. The Minister is incorrect in that regulations cannot be amended by the House. They can only be rejected or approved.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, Deputy Ferris has concluded.  There was an agreement before I arrived that amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 would be taken together. Therefore Deputy Ferris' conclusion represents the final comment.  I am saying this because I see later on that there is a suggestion that two amendments, Nos. 6 and 7, will be taken together.  I am advising Deputy Bruton, in whose name the second amendment appears, that if he <Col N="587" /> agrees to the request that amendments Nos. 6 and 7 be taken together for discussion, he is automatically accepting that he would not have the right to reply.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 43 to 45 and in page 4, to delete lines 1 to 9. </P>
      <P>The reason I should like to have this section removed from the legislation is because it states on page 4:</P>
      <P>Regulations under this section may also specify the circumstances in which a person's entitlement to out-patient services shall extend to services provided by a registered medical practitioner engaged in a consultant capacity in the provisions of hospital services and may provide that, where a person's entitlement does not so extend, the health board concerned may charge for the provisions of out-patient services such charges as may be approved of or directed by the Minister. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about that regulation because it complicates the GP's role in admitting patients.  The GP referred to here is a consultant GP and the phrase &ldquo;subject to regulations by the Minister&rdquo; is ambiguous in relation to when a decision will be made as to whether somebody pays for the services.  For that reason I <Col N="592" /> am unhappy with the section as worded. I previously suggested that I would oppose it but on Report Stage I am suggesting that we delete it, the only other option open to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 6, this element of the Bill is also flawed.  The Minister has refused to face up to the principle outlined in the report of the commission, even though he has cited it frequently.  The principle espoused by the commission was that people should have equal access to services. Each time they mentioned the need to extend full eligibility they also said there should be a common waiting list. They went on to state that &ldquo;any danger of preferential access for patients in private accommodation would be counteracted by a common admissions policy&rdquo;.  They alerted us to the problems which the Minister has refused to address in deciding how private services should be made available.  The regulations to which the Minister has referred, which we have not seen and are not allowed to debate, do not address the principle espoused by the commission that an objective system of assessment should be introduced covering access to publicly funded hospital services and that there should be universal criteria governing admission to these services regardless of the patients' status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister has proposed in these two sections, which deal with in-patient and out-patient services, flies in the face of what the commission put forward. The Minister has offered a smug, ambling and shambling defence.  Not once did he mention the threat to the community rating for the VHI which the commission put forward as a justification for extending eligibility or the question of balanced billing.  Neither did he properly defend his decision to abandon the idea of a common waiting list for hospital services. The Minister will not come clean. He keeps saying that this has been accepted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and by the Commission on Health Funding but a kindergarten child could read the report of the commission and see that the Minister's actions are not in <Col N="593" /> keeping with the spirit of that arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also described the alternatives put forward as vague aspirations, but he is distorting what we are trying to achieve.  We are trying to ensure that public and private patients will be treated fairly, but he has dismissed this as being vague.  He is going to rely instead on regulations which he will not allow us to debate.  The Minister is treating the House with disdain, which does him no credit.  We will learn in time to come that this Bill will cost the public patient dear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, with regard to the VHI, I have spoken at length about the Government's policy on the community rating but that matter does not arise under this section of the legislation.  I am not going to debate the matter for that reason.  That is the correct approach to adopt.  I do not want to be accused of running away from the issue simply because I will not debate it as it is outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of a common waiting list, I have already referred to the recommendation of the Commission on Health Funding and the reason we have not gone for a common waiting list, which is, as I made clear on both Second Stage and Committee Stage yesterday, that it could place the public patient at a disadvantage.  The commission's recommendation relied on admissions being monitored to ensure that private patients were not admitted to available beds ahead of public patients with greater medical need.  As Deputies will understand, this recommendation would present great difficulties in practice since the decision to admit a specific patient must always rest with the consultant concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already heard Deputies make reference this morning to the case of a patient visiting a consultant as an outpatient.  Deputies on the opposite side of the House have accepted <Col N="594" /> that it is possible to have a fair system under which the public patient is not placed at a disadvantage.  In this case the decision would rest with the consultant, who would have responsibility to draw up the common waiting list and decide where a patient should be placed on that list.  That is a very important point.  The Government and the social partners believe that the public patient would be best protected by ensuring that for non-emergency treatment public beds are available exclusively to public patients.</P>
      <P>It is also true that a patient on a common waiting list would have to take the next available bed, be it public or private.  That would defeat the main objective of this legislation, which is to ensure that public beds are only available to public patients.  As I said, it is in the interests of the public and private patient to maintain the mix of public and private care in our public hospitals.  Public patients benefit from the availability of the best and most skilled consultants who can be retained in the public hospitals because of the opportunities to continue a private practice there.  Under the new arrangements any increased demand for private care can be met by expanding the number of private and semi-private beds in the public hospitals without placing the public patient at a disadvantage.  Such an expansion will be possible because it will be self-financing.  Indeed, Deputy Ferris said earlier that he would have no objection to this provided it was self-financing.</P>
      <P>If there was a common waiting list such an expansion would not be possible and the likelihood is that the focus of private practice would begin to move away from the public hospital system and in the long term this would not be to the advantage of the public patient.  It is important, in my view, to ensure that the very best consultants are available to public patients in public hospitals and are on the campus for as long as possible during the day and not carrying on a private practice elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill deals with out-patient services and amends section 56 of <Col N="595" /> the Health Act, 1970, to enable regulations to be made specifying how consultant outpatient services are to be made available to eligible patients.  The amendment also provides for charges to be approved by me to be levied by public hospitals for services they provide to private patients of consultants.  I have in mind charges for the use of X-ray equipment and laboratory facilities which are very expensive services for which no specific charges are currently made.  I do not propose to introduce charges immediately but will continue to review the situation. I might point out to Deputy Bruton that there will be an ongoing review of the implementation of the changes.  It will not be a question of an annual review but an ongoing review of the mix of beds.  I want to assure the House that there will be no reduction in the number of public beds available to public patients.</P>
    <P>The first regulations that I intend to make under the new provisions dealing with outpatient services will cover the provision of consultant services.  It is my intention to confirm the existing practice in relation to public and private out-patient services where the tradition has been not to mix entitlements.  It is my intention that the regulations will provide that a person availing of outpatient consultant services as a public patient will be deemed to be the public patient of all consultants providing outpatient services in relation to that particular consultation. Similarly, a person availing of outpatient consultant services as a private patient shall be deemed to be the private patient of all consultants providing outpatient services in relation to that particular consultation. The approach set out in section 7 in relation to outpatient services, and which I propose to follow through with regulations, is consistent with the general principle that patients should not mix their entitlements.  This underlines the new arrangement for achieving greater equity, which is the main objective of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the argument that the regulations applying to inpatient <Col N="596" /> service should come before the House before they are implemented as it applies to inpatient services.  The same rationale stands.  I do not think it appropriate to make provision in this legislation that all regulations should come before the House.  I accept the point made by Deputy Ferris that the House does have an opportunity to annul the regulations, if Members so wish, under this legislation. However, I do not think it is appropriate that the regulations should be brought before the House, as is the case in other legislation, before being implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I have listened to this debate yesterday and again this morning.  Now I think life is getting curiouser and curiouser &mdash; the Minister says there will be no reduction in public beds, but will the number be increased?  In Kilkenny Hospital people are out on the corridors and it is an absolute shambles at present.</P>
      <P>On the question of appointments to see a consultant, there is at least a 12 month waiting list to see the ENT consultant in Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford.  I know of cases where a 20 year old patient and 70 year old patient have been waiting at least 12 months for an appointment.  Will the Minister say if things are going to improve because otherwise we will have no service. In Kilkenny hospital people are being left out on the corridor.  In fairness to the staff, it must be said that there is a great medical service, but the conditions are hopeless.  The Minister's assertion that the number of public beds will not be reduced is not worth a tuppenny curse to the people who are still waiting for a public bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Browne's comment because it is so valid. The legislation provides that everybody is entitled to a public bed and in the process of extending this to everybody we want to ensure that no existing public bed would be lost to private practice. Section 7 provides that section 56 of the 1970 Act is amended by the addition of a new paragraph after paragraph (c) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" />&ldquo;(d) Regulations under this section may also specify the circumstances in which a person's entitlement to out-patient services shall extend to services provided by a registered medical practitioner engaged in a consultant capacity in the provision of hospital services and may provide that, where a person's entitlement does not so extend, the health board concerned may charge for the provision of out-patient services such charges as may be approved of or directed by the Minister.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This means that if a person's entitlement does not extend to hospital services their entitlements to all services is gone and this can be covered by regulations made by the Minister.  We would want to be absolutely clear about what we are trying to do.  I would like the Minister to agree that the general practitioner working on the ground would have more right to admit patients to hospital services and would be in the first line of defence in the fight against disease.  Their word should decide when a person is seen at outpatients or admitted for hospitalisation where there is already a long waiting list. There is no need for a consultant's opinion in that process.  If this was taken on board I would not be unduly worried about the section, but as the section is presently worded there is a possibility that a person's entitlement to public services could be lost in the process of going from outpatients services to hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>It is essential &mdash; and the Minister is correct in stating this &mdash; in the interest of the public patients that consultants remain on the hospital campus and they should not be forced by this legislation to go elsewhere for their private practice.  I want to ensure that in the agreement between the Minister and the consultants the consultants will be available 100 per cent to public patients and that it is only when they have the time available that they will be free to see their private patients.  Many doctors believe in treating all their patients on the same site and in the same way and I welcome the ethos of <Col N="598" /> commitment that has been built up over the years.</P>
    <P>There is a risk that the regulations might offer consultants who now see their patients in public hospitals the incentive to do more and more of their work in private rooms or in private hospitals. That is a risk, unless the Minister can assure us that in the negotiations with the consultants the increase in salary offered will mean a total commitment to the public patient so that everybody is entitled to a free consultant service in a public ward in a public hospital.  If this is not so, there is a great risk that we will remove the expertise that has been built up over the years and that consultants will congregate in places such as the Blackrock Clinic or other private hospitals where the real money can be made, whether from health insurance or the private cheque book.  It is a fact of life that the consultants now require additional payments over and above the fee the VHI pays them.  We should remove that anomaly as well.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons I am concerned about this section and I am still not satisfied that it is worded in such a way that protects the principle that I have espoused over the past three days.  In order to register my concern I would like that my amendment be formally put.</P>
    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, copies of them shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not come into effect until a resolution approving of them has been passed by each such House.'.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> It is vital that we have the opportunity to see the regulations before they come into force.  The Minister has incorrectly suggested to the House, in reply to Deputy Ferris, that this Bill provides for a system of annulment, because it is quite clear from reading section 56, as amended in this Bill, that there is no such provision for laying these regulations before the House.  The regulations will be made by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under section 56 of the 1970 Act, as amended in the 1987 Health Act.  The Minister is not giving accurate information to the House about our rights to rescind this.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we do not only have the right to rescind but that we have the right to have a debate on the issues, as Deputy Sherlock suggested on an earlier section.  The importance of that is quite simply that the Minister is asking us to buy a pig in a poke in terms of the protection of public patients.  The Minister has admitted that he does not know the number of public beds in the system, but he is going to preserve their number even though he does not know that number. The Minister cannot put his hand on his heart and expect us to accept that he can preserve that number.  Indeed, the Minister recognised in the regulations to which he referred briefly, but did not have the courtesy to let us have, so that we might have had the opportunity to debate them that there were many beds designated as private where there was heavy usage by public patients.  This is a grey area where public patients would rightly have fears that their usage of those beds could be usurped.  The Minister said he was worried that this might happen and that he would seek to have a proportion of the beds redesignated into the public area.  We do not know the numbers of beds involved and whether public patients will be guaranteed right of access on an equitable basis with private patients.  It is the Minister's vagueness which makes it so important that the regulations should come back to the House for a proper debate.  The Minister said he will have an annual review.</P>

      <P>I suggested an annual review and the Minister said he will have a review from time to time.  If the Minister has given away as property rights a quota of private beds to consultants, he cannot withdraw them; yet if there is a growth in public patients he must recognise that he will have to use some of those beds which were wrongly designated as private and bring them back to the public sector.  The Minister is asking us to accept regulations, which he will not show to us today, without having the right to annul them if they are not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The regulations under section 56, as amended, will deal with the point raised by Deputy Allen concerning people seeing a consultant as an outpatient who will subsequently have the right to go as a public patient.  A person who opts to see a consultant as a public patient may wait perhaps six or nine months for an opportunity and only then would his name be included on the list for hospital admission.  If a person goes to see a consultant in his private rooms he can get on the waiting list straight away.  The Minister actually said that when a patient is approved for urgent medical care by the consultant he may wait only three weeks to get into public care.  The person who cannot afford to see the consultant on a private basis may have to wait six months to see him for the first time. There will be a huge inbuilt gap between the person who can go to the private consulting rooms for the initial assessment of his case and get on to the public waiting list for the earliest possible vacancy and the person who does not have the money to go to the private rooms who will be languishing without any consultant knowing the urgency of his case. That case could be a great deal more urgent than the case of the person admitted quickly.  This area is riddled with problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not being fair in looking for the power to make regulations.  He has the draft regulations in his hand but <Col N="601" /> he will not let us see them before the debate concludes.  We are expected to vote through sections enabling regulations &mdash; regulations which will be fundamental to equity of access of public and private patients &mdash; without a chance to see the regulations.  That is not fair play. The Minister cannot but expect a lot of cynicism about the effectiveness with which these regulations will deliver public care to public patients when he has not the grace to give the regulations to us. We could have seen the regulations last night so that we would know the Minister's intentions with regard to these sections.  That would have allowed a much more reasonable debate.  The Minister has stuck his head in the sand and he is insisting in driving ahead with his ideas. He is not willing to listen to amendments which could modify and improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to enshrine in this Bill the notion that there should be an equitable allocation of beds for public and private patients within a reasonable waiting period.  That principle should have been statutorily underpinned but it is not in the Bill.  The Minister is making a fundamental change in the way we run our services.  He dismissed my amendment as a vague aspiration.  This Bill is not a charter of equity.  There is no mention of equity.  The issue should be brought back to the House when the Minister has introduced the regulations to see they are meeting the standards we expect and catering adequately for public patients who cannot afford private care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a valid amendment. Any section of this Bill already agreed which involves regulations provides that such regulations made by the Minister under the section will be dealt with in a particular way.  The Minister will publish them and allow the House afterwards a chance to annul them within a certain number of sitting days.  No such provision is made in respect of these regulations. Since the House has agreed that there should be regulations, Deputy Bruton's amendment should be accepted.  The Minister has promised that the regulations are in hand and that he will give <Col N="602" /> us a copy.  All the regulations to be made under this Bill will be before this House except the regulations under section 6. This leaves us no opportunity ever to debate these regulations.</P>
      <P>Section 56 of the 1970 Act contains no mention of regulations.  Now we are adding regulations to the section with the provision that they need only be approved by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.  That is not a good way to legislate and this amendment is legitimate.  The Minister should accept the principle of this amendment and perhaps introduce an amendment along these lines in the Seanad which we could approve later.  Regulations made under any legislation should be subject to the overview of the House.</P>

      <P>Having enacted legislation to deal with public and private patients at the time of admission to hospital, it is also important to extend this to outpatient facilities.  Consultants with public appointments should see and treat all patients, public and private, in the same manner, in the same room or outpatients' department and under the same conditions and from the same waiting list.  GPs in the general medical service already have this contract and what is being requested in this amendment is that the regulations giving effect to that section would be brought before the House.  I would support that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I also want to support this because I am very much worried by the way the Minister is carrying on here today.  He is more or less telling us that if he says it is right, it is right.  He is giving himself the cover of bringing in regulations that will automatically be right if he brings them in and we can do nothing about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's argument, which has been going on here yesterday and today, about patients going privately and then coming back into the public service is so wrong that it defies any understanding. As Deputy Bruton has pointed out, if a person cannot get into a clinic to be <Col N="603" /> assessed &mdash; and I have given an example myself of two people waiting to get into Ardkeen with ear problems where the specialist's secretary told me that there was at least 12 months' delay &mdash; how can he get treatment?  I am quite sure, in the case of at least one of the people I am talking about, that if they could get into the clinic they would be taken in for treatment immediately.  On the other hand, somebody else can get in in a fortnight, as happened in my own case.  I rang up to find out what the position was in regard to an appointment I had for myself and the secretary told me I would have to wait until February.  I asked her if private medicine had gone as bad as that and she said that since I was going privately I could be called in on the Friday week.</P>
    <P>The same thing will happen with this system that the Minister is talking about at the moment.  People will be called in privately if the consultant sees them and decides they need emergency treatment. He will bring them in immediately.  The Minister's argument on that is so wrong that I am worried about all the rest of the legislation.  That is why regulations should be under some kind of control so that the Minister does not have <i>carte blanche</i> to bring in what he likes.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to know how to deal with the arguments that have been raised by Deputy Bruton.  I cannot understand why Deputy Bruton comes in here and totally distorts what I am saying. At no stage did I say that there would be an annual review.  I said that we would be continuously monitoring the situation. At no stage did I say that a patient who opted to go to a private consultant for an outpatient consultation would be in a position to jump the queue.  I said that they would take their position on the waiting list at the point where they would have taken it had they gone for a public outpatient appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not queue jumping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that if <Col N="604" /> the patient went on 1 June and had a private consultation with the consultant, the consultant having decided the patient needed hospital treatment and the patient having opted for public service, they will go on the place in the queue where they will get the next available appointment with the consultant at the public clinic whether that is three months down the road or three weeks down the road.  It is important to assure the House that the vast majority of appointments in our public hospitals for public patients come within two to three weeks.  When Deputies refer to longer waiting times they refer specifically to orthopaedics and to ophthalmology; and measures have been taken over the last 18 months to improve these services with quite substantial and spectacular results.  There are still waiting lists, but we are dealing with them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton accused me in regard to the regulations.  This is the first time I have spoken on Deputy Bruton's amendment in regard to the regulations.  What is happening here is that in-patient regulations will come before us here and the House will have an opportunity to annul them.  The outpatient regulations, in accordance with section 56 of the Health Act, as amended by the Health Act, 1987, provides that various regulations for outpatient services do not require to be laid before the Oireachtas, but I want to assure all the Deputies in the House that we will indeed lay the regulations before the House.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Ferris about the regulations that are in draft at the moment, I do not think that, in fairness, the Deputies can complain.  I insisted that I would have draft regulations here before me with this legislation so that I would be in a position to deal with points raised by the Deputies. When the regulations are completed the spokespersons for the Opposition parties will have a copy of them.  They should be available by Tuesday next, or Wednesday, if the Dáil is not sitting on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of access to hospital by patients it is important to point out, <Col N="605" /> because Deputy Ferris raised the point, that the first point of contact with the medical element of the health service is generally the general practitioner and that is as it should be.  I have expressed my concern in this House at the number of patients in the greater urban areas, particularly in Dublin, who bypass their general practitioner and go directly to the hospital.  That does not happen to any great extent outside the larger urban areas.  However, it is appropriate that the first point of contact with the medical end of the health services should be the general practitioner.  If patients are concerned, their general practitioner is in a position to advise them, and if it is an emergency the general practitioner is in a position to admit them directly to hospital.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Ferris' point about giving more authority to the general practitioner, all matters in regard to medical treatment are matters for clinical judgment on the part of the doctor.  As Deputies know, where there is an emergency a general practitioner can refer the patient direct to a hospital.  The classical example is the case of an acute appendicitis. The person is sent directly to the hospital and is admitted to a bed and has surgery.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about in the main in this legislation is elective procedures, non life threatening procedures, because emergencies will be admitted to whatever bed is available.  If all the beds in the hospital are full, arrangements are made to ensure that emergencies are admitted. For example, nobody with an acute appendicitis has ever been sent home from a hospital.  So what we are talking about here is elective procedures.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that this legislation was brought in on foot of recommendations by very prestigious bodies and it was sought by other bodies and organisations including the Commission on Health Funding, NESC and the Congress of Trade Unions.  It has probably the greatest consensus that one could expect from any legislation brought before the House, consensus between the Government and the social partners.  As <Col N="606" /> far as I am concerned, the legislation will be implemented in accordance with the law before us and in accordance with the spirit in which it was recommended and sought and the spirit in which the Government and the social partners agreed it.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that the main objective is the delivery of service and that public beds will in future be available for public patients.  That is in it. I have already referred to the fact that there are three groups of patients in hospital.  There are public patients in public beds, private patients in private beds and there are private patients in public beds.  After 1 June that will not be the case.  The private patients will no longer be entitled to avail of a public bed &mdash; in other words, to be a private patient of the consultant and a public patient in a bed.  When that change, which will be phased in, takes place that will ensure that beds that are occupied by private patients paying their consultant but being maintained as public patients by the State will be freed up for public patients.  It is quite simple.  There is no mystery about it.  We will be implementing it in accordance with the law and with the spirit in which it is agreed by the Government and the social partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister will not accept this amendment or undertake to offer a modified version in the sense Deputy Ferris suggested. I am disappointed because under section 56 heretofore the only issue was charges being made for services that were being provided.  Now we are into a very different area.  In this legislation the Minister is substituting what used to be the principle of common waiting times for services in public and in private, which we know did not work, by an alternative system which he is going to enforce by regulations.  The regulations are to bring about separation of public and private. What we want to achieve with that separation is equity in services to the public patient compared to the private patient. That is a fundamental break in what was in section 56 previously.  We are breaking new ground in section 56 and the House <Col N="607" /> deserves the courtesy of having the regulations laid before it and if necessary under the 21 day rule having the right to annul.  It is a major change in the way we run things.</P>
      <P>Referring back to the old drafting of this section when it did not carry this extra baggage the Minister is loading on it, the Minister said there were no regulations then because it was simply a matter of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health getting together to decide on a set of charges.  To date, the Minister has not given a fair response to this amendment.  Telling us the regulations will be with us next Tuesday is only rubbing salt into the wound.  We are asked to accept that we should vote the whole thing through now without seeing the regulations.  Admittedly, we will see the regulations in four days time but if they were available now they could be debated in conjunction with the Bill.  That would have shown respect for the House. To tell us he will post them out to us when the Bill is passed is not good enough.  We should get an opportunity to debate a fundamental change that not everyone agrees with.  We have the right to tease this out in detail.</P>
      <P>I must go back to the issue of a patient going to private consulting rooms in order to get access.  As I understand the Minister, when a patient on the public waiting list cannot go to the private rooms he will have to wait his turn to be assessed but when he goes to the private rooms and is assessed and is decreed to be in urgent need of hospital care, he will be told he has to wait until the public patient who applied at the same time for a public patient assessment has been assessed for public admission to a hospital.  In that case the consultant is not living up to the Hippocratic oath.  The Minister is saying the patient who went to see the consultant privately will not be admitted to hospital before the public patient who joined the queue the same day he saw the consultant as a private patient.</P>

    <P>I will have due regard to my colleague Deputy Sherlock who also wishes to speak on this.  I want to remove this section because I am not satisfied with it as worded, especially since the other amendments were ruled out of order. One of them related to the amount <Col N="609" /> allowed under health contributions at present.  The tax relief for PRSI contributions is a flat figure of £286.  With the limit removed, the people paying an additional £19 million to the Exchequer through PRSI and PAYE will get no recognition for that in the income tax code.  I know the figure cannot be put into this legislation, but I suggest that the Minister for Finance should take account of it.</P>
    <P>The other amendment dealt with changes in the 1987 regulations which penalised people paying PRSI and PAYE by bringing in charges of £12.50 a day.  That is double taxation.  For that reason I want this section removed from the legislation.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The income accruing as a result of subsection (1) shall be used <Col N="610" /> to fund the country's health services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept that introducing legislation without making the necessary financial provisions will not bring about the desired effect.  I understand £19 million will accrue to the Exchequer as a result of measures taken in this legislation.  The health board in my area face a shortfall in excess of £4 million.  An assessment of the amount required to keep an adequate and proper level of service has been made, and agreed, by the officers of the health board.  In 1989 the Southern Health Board recommended 20 additional beds at Mallow General Hospital to bring the number up to 84.  That is a double consultant hospital and to this day there has been no increase in that number of beds. Also a number of appointments are awaited.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Tá an-áthas orm an Bille seo a chur faoi bhráid na Dála.  In the course of the debate, while giving the facts of what we are about which is a simple measure which will be broadly welcomed by all sides, I would like to give in historical fashion some of the context into which the Bill will be set.  For that reason we refer back to 1966.</P>
      <P>In 1966, while reporting on the training of vocational teachers, the &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; survey team pointed to the inappropriateness of existing arrangements for the training of woodwork and metalwork teachers.  It argued that existing training accommodation was fragmented and overstretched and that the field of recruitment &mdash; suitably educated trades people &mdash; was nearly exhausted. Turning its attention to physical education teachers, the team noted the absence of any facility for the training of male physical education teachers and that a large proportion of the existing supply of female physical education teachers had not managed to satisfy registration requirements.  Despite its dissatisfaction with the existing arrangements it did not propose any alternatives; it did note, however, that the Department of Education was keeping the situation under review and that it would make any necessary modifications in the training programmes.</P>

    <P>The survey team's concern at the <i>ad hoc</i> character of the courses was echoed a year later by the Commission on Higher Education when it suggested that the training of woodwork, metalwork and rural science teachers was &ldquo;too diffuse&rdquo;. In its recommendations it argued for a new approach in the training of teachers involving: (1) specialised pedagogic training for all; (2) an extension of the range of content by the addition of academic, scientific and general studies; (3) the <Col N="614" /> development of the courses in a new type of institution and in association with existing or emerging institutions; (4) the extension of the period of study; and (5) the creation of a degree award for graduates of the recognised courses.</P>
    <P>All those in the House will recall reading the important report in 1966, Investment in Education.  I had just started back at teaching and I remember well the excitement which resulted on the publication of that report because it pointed the way forward.</P>
    <P>In 1969 the HEA report clearly identified in a modern sense the inappropriateness of having people trained just for one speciality, that teachers should have a broader range which would enable them to conduct their speciality and at the same time to have other link subjects which would give them a much broader educational remit and also increase their employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>In early 1969 the Higher Education Authority established a working party to report in general on teacher training.  In its findings, which were published in September 1970, the Authority endorsed the earlier opinions that provision for the training of metalwork and woodwork teachers was unnecessarily dispersed and it recommended that it be concentrated in one institution.  This was followed by a setback and Deputy Kemmy would have been aware of the ongoing agitation in Limerick for more and better educational establishments.</P>
    <P>Against the background of a campaign for the establishment of a university in Limerick the HEA recommended that city as the obvious centre for the training institute &mdash; to which I referred earlier &mdash; and that the new Institute of Higher Education and the Mary Immaculate Teacher Training College might together provide facilities for the relocated courses.  The report did not examine the arrangements for the training of home economics, music, physical education and rural science teachers, but it suggested that they be the subject of a further study.</P>
    <P>In the event, the metalwork and woodwork teachers' courses, along with the <Col N="615" /> course for general and rural science teachers, were not relocated at Limerick until nine years had passed &mdash; big bodies move slowly &mdash; and then they joined an institution which had opened its doors as the National College of Physical Education in January 1973.</P>
    <P>The notion of a State college for physical educationalists was not new.  A Department of Education committee had recommended such an establishment in a report which was completed in 1938.  I am being extraordinarily honest telling the House how long it took to bring all these events to fruition.  The recommendation was not acted upon and such physical educationalists as were employed in second level schools were either graduates of two colleges in Dublin for female physical educationalists, former military physical education instructors or graduates of one of the British colleges of education.  During the late sixties the supply of these teachers fell far short of demand and an attempt was made to meet the shortfall by sending groups of male students to England for training.</P>
    <P>At the same time the possibility was explored of extending the training provision available in Dublin so that both male and female teachers could be trained there.  However, the Government's acceptance of the Higher Education Authority recommendation to relocate woodwork and metalwork teacher training courses in Limerick and the emerging consensus that there were too many courses in too many locations, meant that Limerick would have to receive serious consideration as a possible site for any new facility.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed with the planning of a new college in Limerick was taken in the autumn of 1970 and a site adjoining the then National Institute for Higher Education was purchased in January 1971.  When the new National College of Physical Education opened on 22 January 1973 it had a ready-made student body consisting of a group of male students who had commenced a teacher education course at Twickenham and two <Col N="616" /> groups of female students who had commenced their courses at the two Dublin colleges, Ling and St. Raphael's.  It was interesting that these students had started their courses in other colleges and, in the case of the males, in another country, and yet the emerging institution was able to dovetail its new courses to the studies already undertaken by these young people.</P>
    <P>In 1979 courses for metalwork, woodwork and general and rural science teachers commenced in the college and the following year, with the passing of the Thomond College of Education Act, 1980, it commenced operating as an institution with statutorily defined powers and functions.</P>
    <P>During the eighties however Ireland began to experience a falling birth rate which has had a major effect on teacher training colleges.  This manifested itself in Thomond College in that an institution that was built to accommodate 1,100 students has a total enrolment in the current academic year of 392.  It was against this background, and given that the college and the university share a common campus, which was very sensible planning, that I met with the authorities of the two institutions with a view to commencing a dialogue on the linking of the institutions.  We found a common ground quite quickly.  Arising from these talks a working group was set up comprising representatives of the Higher Education Authority, Thomond College, the University of Limerick and the Department of Education to consider how the resources and expertise of the two institutions might best be mobilised in view of the outlook for the requirement of teachers in the years ahead and the demand for higher education places in general.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority met very soon afterwards and the committee issued their recommendations in October 1990.  The main recommendation was that the college should be integrated with the university.  Specifically they recommended that the Thomond College of Education Act, 1980 &mdash; the Act that is the subject of our debate today &mdash; should <Col N="617" /> be repealed and that the management and academic structures of the university should be reorganised to facilitate the integration.  The proposed integration is in line with the undertaking in paragraph 69 (j) of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to expand third level places by utilising spare capacity in the various colleges of education, including Thomond College, involving linkages within the university system.</P>
    <P>The Bill being introduced, therefore, will give effect to the integration as agreed by the two institutions involved and will be a step towards meeting the obligation in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to expand third level places.  The Bill will do more, however, than merely allow for a formal integration.  It will allow the expertise and experience of two institutions which have been built up over the years to be fused together to the mutual benefit of both staff and students.  Thomond College has developed an academic reputation in areas such as education, sports, science, leisure and recreation, biological sciences and metal and wood technology.  These areas have a particular potential to contribute to the excellence and relevance of the university.</P>
    <P>It is my wish, and I am sure the wish of this House and of all educationalists, that the expertise which has been very rigorously and painstakingly built up by Thomond College, expertise in the fields to which I referred and an overall pervasive expertise in the broad humanities area, would be retained and channelled most fruitfully within the new merged college.  The university has always seen its mission as the pursuit of excellence in teaching and research to the highest level, particularly in areas adjudged to be of strategic benefit to the economic and social development of Ireland.  Its success was acknowledged in 1989 when it was given full university status.  The integration will be another step in its development in that it will provide an extra 600 to 700 places and will allow expansion in the areas where the university has built up a particular expertise such as science, engineering and business studies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> What is proposed therefore is the necessary legislation to give effect to the integration of Thomond College with the University of Limerick.  The purpose of the Bill therefore is to dissolve Thomond College, transfer the teacher training functions from the college to the university and transfer the staff, property, rights and liabilities of the college to the university.  The word &ldquo;dissolve&rdquo; is a negative word and one I would not have used in the preparation of legislation.  I wanted to use the word &ldquo;merger&rdquo; or &ldquo;amalgamation&rdquo; because that is what is happening. The words &ldquo;merger&rdquo; and &ldquo;amalgamation&rdquo; are words which would correctly give amplification to what we are doing, but I was advised legally that &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo; is the proper word to use. I say this in case it comes up as a point in the debate.  That word is there because it is the correct legal term.</P>
    <P>While therefore, Thomond College will no longer exist as a separate entity, its functions and objectives will continue to be pursued within the wider remit of the University of Limerick.  The expertise and experience which the staff of the college have gained over the years will not be lost to us, it will still be available but in the context of an expanded University of Limerick.  The success of Thomond College can be seen on a daily basis in our second level schools in that graduates of the college are held in high regard as teachers.  That college has a very high professional standard.  It would be remiss of me therefore not to pay due tribute to its Director, Mr. Jim Christian, and other senior staff who have guided the college to its success.  Quite often too the contribution made by those men and women who act in an unpaid capacity as members of governing bodies of institutions in general is not appreciated.  Thomond College has been particularly fortunate in the calibre of the people who have served on its governing body over the years and I am pleased to acknowledge their contribution to the success and prestige of the college.</P>
    <P>One effect this legislation will have is that students who commenced their courses as students of Thomond College <Col N="619" /> will have their degrees awarded by the University of Limerick and not the National Council for Educational Awards as heretofore.</P>
    <P>It is right, therefore, that I pay due and proper tribute to the National Council for Educational Awards, under whose aegis the college has developed.  The acknowledgment of excellence which is the basis for this legislation is, at the same time, an endorsement of the quality and standing of the NCEA, its processes, its awards at all levels &mdash; certificate, diploma and degree &mdash; and also of the colleges and institutions which are designated institutions of the council.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased as Minister for Education to introduce a Bill in May, 1989 giving full university status to the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  Indeed, if I may diversify for a moment, the university legislation was passed on the very day the general election was called.  I remember being the last person to speak as the House fell. That is just by way of a footnote to history. Here we are exactly two years later again discussing a Limerick educational provision.  However, I must not take that analogy any further.  It is very gratifying, therefore, to introduce a Bill which represents another major development in the history of the university.  I am sure that the people of Limerick, who campaigned for a long time for a university for their city and have found their due reward, will welcome these proposals and the important development they represent for the third level education system.  I am sure, too, that the House will welcome this initiative in general.</P>
    <P>We will be dealing with the various provisions of the Bill later but I should like to record a couple of matters.  Naturally, reaction to the proposed merger has been relatively harmonious.  In the initial talks between the HEA and the two management bodies there are bound to be legitimate worries and trepidations expressed on behalf of all concerned and particularly on behalf of the staff of the two institutions.  Bearing that very much in mind I met recently with the MSF <Col N="620" /> union, which represents most of the members in Thomond College.  I had a very full meeting in my Department with what was a full delegation.  Many of their legitimate causes of concern were discussed. They were concerned about their future activities and their role after the merger.  In particular we discussed the need for ongoing and in depth consultation with members of the college as matters advanced.  I also met the General Secretary of the Teachers Union of Ireland, which union also have members in Thomond, and he freely expressed to me the same fears held by some of his members in the college.  Following that the consultative process which had been at senior management level was expanded.  Negotiations about those matters are continuing.  My wish is that there will be full consultation between the two institutions, particularly with regard to the needs of members of those institutions. I am hopeful that with such goodwill as exists these matters will be satisfactorily concluded and that the forum that has been set up will achieve the fastest and smoothest integration possible.  I am told that the forum is committed to a consultative process in both institutions, with the aim of its being advised on every aspect of the integration before final decisions are taken.  Several joint working groups feeding into the central forum, with membership from Thomond and the University of Limerick, have been put in place.  Timespans have been set down for them to carry out their work.  The forum and the consultative groups are sitting at present and will continue to do so in the next few weeks to ensure a proper and equitable working out of the various areas of concern of members of staff in each institution.</P>
    <P>When I met the unions earlier and again two weeks ago they forcibly expressed the need to have enshrined in the legislation the particular place of Irish language and culture.  Provision for that is included in section 10 and that can be talked about in general.  However, I did undertake to put on the record of the House the need to have such an item very clearly expressed under a specific section <Col N="621" /> of the Bill.  That deputation expressed their appreciation of that but wanted to re-emphasise it.  That will be one of the strengths of the University of Limerick, which has a very fine remit for the Irish language and culture.  Their remit will be strengthened greatly by the admission of Thomond College, its ethos and its fine educational record on matters relating to the Irish language and culture.  It is my wish that section 10 &mdash; and, indeed, all measures in the Bill if its gets through all Stages &mdash; be treated in the serious manner it deserves.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as it represents a rational approach to meeting the needs of third level education in the south-west region and because in the merging of two third level institutions movement is made towards a stronger, more vibrant, dynamic third level sector in Limerick.  There is an added dimension in that the new merged institution will make more third level places available. As the Minister has said, this is extremely welcome.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be critical at this stage because we are embarking on a new adventure and we are on the advent of another historic step in the development of third level education.  However, it is a pity that this rationalisation, which could have happened last year, did not happen last year and that Irish students were denied access to third level education because of the intransigent and myopic approach of some people involved at management level and because of the failure of the Minister for Education &mdash; this is the only critical note I shall issue of her &mdash; to prosecute her policy initiative in a more vigorous fashion.  It is, however, better late than never, and the vast majority of participants from both institutions enthusiastically welcome the reorganisation.  The merger provides opportunities for all in values to contribute more fully and more constructively towards the advancement of the University of Limerick and towards rectifying the shortage of third level places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> I understand that the student body have also welcomed this initiative, and they are, of course, a very important and vital component.  I welcome the very constructive, imaginative and positive role they have played in advancing this initiative and in bringing it to fruition today.  They are to be congratulated, as is everybody involved in the venture.  Both institutions &mdash; the University of Limerick, formerly known as the National Institute for Higher Education, and Thomond College of Education &mdash; were established by Acts of this House in 1980. Indeed, when putting the two Acts down side by side and examining them, one notes that they are parallel and very similar. Indeed, after looking at both the memoranda and the actual section by section detail of the legislation, I can find very little difference apart from the odd variation.  Both institutions deserve congratulations on the manner in which they have discharged their respective remits in the intervening 11 years.  Both establishments have proved their worth and significance in the development of third level education in the country generally, in the south-west in particular, and very especially in the city of Limerick. The city of Limerick is extremely fortunate to have such a good range of third level facilities.  While the Act gave a statutory base to Thomond College in 1980, the college itself had been established earlier and was functional from 1973.</P>
    <P>The college has developed a range of expertise and resources in the area of physical education, recreation and leisure, technology and physical sciences, agricultural, horticultural and biographical sciences, business education, the humanities and the arts.  The functions of Thomond College of Education were given legislative effect with the passing of the Thomond College of Education Act, 1980.  That Act allocated certain functions to the college.  Over the years Thomond College endeavoured to carry out its responsibilities and functions by providing under-graduate and post-graduate diploma and degree courses and research and consultancy work to the <Col N="623" /> highest standards.  Everyone agrees that the paramount function of Thomond College, and its area of greatest distinction, has been in the fulfilment of its role in providing teacher education, particularly in the area of practical teaching for post-primary level.  Since its inception, Thomond College has trained teachers to the highest standards in various disciplines.</P>
    <P>The college has developed in other ways.  There is optimum use of the knowledge basis required to service the teacher education function in a national and international context and the wider application of these knowledge bases increased as demands grew.  This has led to the development of courses outside the narrow regime of teacher education.  It is understandable that there should be anxiety that all existing aspects of the work carried out in Thomond College should now be transferred intact to the new development.  It is important that the new institutional arrangement should provide for the education and professional preparation of teachers, for in-service educational training, for research and consultancy in areas relating to the expertise of the college and the development of designated and emerging programmes and initiatives in areas related to the expertise that this college, and its staff, has.</P>
    <P>Due credit must go to the working party to which the Minister referred.  The working party comprised in the main of people from Thomond College of Education, from the University of Limerick and from the Higher Education Authority. This group did the research work and provided the legislative framework we are addressing in the House today.</P>
    <P>The working party first identified the legislative requirement of repealing the Thomond College of Education Act, 1980 and the various reorganisational, management and academic structures which will be necessary to enable the integration to go ahead.</P>
    <P>In identifying the university's mission which is the pursuit of excellence in teaching and research to the highest level, particularly in areas adjudged to be <Col N="624" /> of strategic benefit to the economic and social development of Ireland, the working group have also taken cognisance of the guiding inspiration of Thomond College. The college motto of Thomond &mdash;&ldquo;Ar fheabhas Tuamhan&rdquo; means &ldquo;The best in the world&rdquo;.  This motto was chosen by Thomond College at the time to signal its intention to strive for excellence in all its endeavours while linking inextricably the college with the success of the Thomond region.  As the statement of mission and function by Thomond College of Education stated in July 1990 &ldquo;Of course, the college has interpreted this ideal by implementing its functions in a way that has exploited the virutes of its size; flexibility, adaptability and openness to change&rdquo;.  Thomond College, therefore, looks forward to a development and expansion and further invigoration of its role within the new university structures.</P>
    <P>The arrival of Thomond College at the University of Limerick Plassey Campus is a logical development in that we will now have instead of three colleges in the University of Limerick, a fourth constituent college added to the university. As the Minister said this was a good indication of the positive, forward seeing good Limerick planning.  The working group recommended that the academic council of the university should be enlarged to allow the former Thomond College to have adequate and proportionate representation on the academic council of the university. Again, the working group lay emphasis on the need to ensure that the existing student body at Thomond College of Education should be guaranteed that when they have completed their course of studies they will receive the level of award to which their current recognised programme entitles them.</P>
    <P>Thomond College's outstanding feature is its excellence in the training of specialist post-primary teachers.  Its integration at this point into the new University of Limerick and its concurrent method of dealing with teacher training so as to focus the need for a major reexamination of post-primary teacher training is particularly apt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> The Minister will be aware that a recent OECD article entitled &ldquo;Ireland and its Teachers&rdquo; talks about the question of whether a short or a long term view of teacher supply should be taken at this time.  We should look at the whole area of primary teachers and post-primary teachers, consider what are the likely supply and demand needs of the future and whether rationalisation or innovation should be called upon.  The OECD recommended that these areas should be looked at very carefully as recruitment policy is vital for the vitality of our teacher training institutions.  The size of the teacher training institutions must be addressed in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that one of our teacher training colleges closed in 1976, and in view of the decline in population, the Minister is faced with a number of choices as to whether or not the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained.  Should the two large teacher training colleges continue in existence?  We should continue them.  The college in Limerick, and the college in Drumcondra, have been enormously successful as have been the two smaller institutions.  Carysfort Training College was also very successful in producing primary school teachers of outstanding quality with a level of academic ability and attainment on a par with that available throughout the world.  Major questions have to be asked as to whether it would be wise to close down more institutions or else to effect institutional mergers and consolidate teacher training and physical resources.  In other OECD countries they have gone for merger and consolidation.</P>
    <P>Teacher training courses here lead to the award of a degree validated by a university.  This may be used as an argument for consolidation and integration. However, I would prefer we retained and expanded the collaboration that exists between the teacher training colleges and universities.  The University of Limerick is a flagship university.  Everybody accepts that it has been one of the leaders in the development of a new concept of the university.  It is accepted that the man <Col N="626" /> who heads that university could be heralded as one of the extraordinary innovators of third level education.  He can be looked at as one of the new breed of educational entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>We must stand back and look at the mission and function of the university. In identifying the university's mission, which is the pursuit of excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas judged to be of strategic benefit to the economic and social development of the country, we have to take a long hard look at whether or not universities can sometimes go too far in taking on narrow specific economic roles.  The new body should look at what they now have in this marvellous new amalgamated resource, and decide their priorities, the ethos and what new theme, motto or philosophy should predominate in education.</P>
    <P>There is scope for further collaboration in Limerick.  We are particularly fortunate that Limerick has the Mary Immaculate College, one of the outstanding colleges in the country.  As I said, it, St. Patrick's, Drumcondra, Rathmines and the Froebel College have all played a very significant part in training teachers.  We should also look at the possibility of introducing specific teacher training modules at second level.  I know it will occupy the Minister's attention in the years ahead whether the type of concurrent training in primary level should now be adopted at second level and whether we should look at the possibility of turning out specifically trained second level teachers instead of the existing system of a primary degree augmented by a higher diploma in education.  Indeed, this gels very well with what is happening in Limerick at present where people are being advanced in their academic pursuits in relation to economic, technical and scientific training and at the same time given a very high level of &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; involvement in industry.</P>
    <P>I strongly argue that the new development in Limerick should be particularly sensitive to the aspirations and wishes of the people coming from Thomond College. Therefore, in relation to the period of transition, there should be the <Col N="627" /> maximum possible number of places given to the people from Thomond College on the new governing body, which would do a lot in the early stages to allay any residual unease by them.  There should be the greatest possible openness and receptivity by the people in the new University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Everything possible should be done to ensure that the long term structure also accommodates people from Thomond College.  Furthermore, the ethos of the college should, as the Minister said, pay particular reference to section 10 of the Bill.  In relation to this section the explanatory memorandum says that it does not require further elaboration, elucidation or explanation &mdash; in other words, it is self-explanatory.  However, I do not agree.  The wording of the Bill is ambiguous because of different punctuation. One can talk about Irish culture or Irish with a comma after it.  Several different interpretations can be made in relation to the wording.  Section 10 states:</P>
    <P>The University in relation to the performance of its functions shall have due regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and culture. </P>
    <P>If there was a comma after &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; it would mean the Irish language, but as it is it is ambiguous.  I know that we must preserve Irish language and culture and it is worthy of a specific reference in the Bill.  However, we should broaden the definition of culture.  The broadest possible interpretation should be put on the obligations involved in this section so that we are not just talking about Irish and Irish culture but about Irish, language and culture in the broadest possible sense of the word.  It is something that people coming from Thomond College would like to see enshrined in the Bill.  It conforms perfectly to the idea of a university, because there has been a tendency of late on the part of some of the more modern universities to go away from the initial concept of a university and shirk the humanities.  If you go back to the origins of universities, humanities are their single <Col N="628" /> and distinguishing feature, any university worthy of the name should have a high element of humanities contained in it.</P>
    <P>Like Members on all sides of the House, I welcome the Bill because it is a major step forward in relation to the development of third level education.  I said that the more modern third level institutions were somewhat narrow in relation to a particular course of study and were not cognisant of the humanities aspect.  I am not being overcritical.  I believe that the arrival of the new colleges on the educational scene&mdash;the nine RTCs, DIT colleges, the precursor of this, NIHE, Limerick and the NIHE, Glasnevin, which is now Dublin City University &mdash; have created a new element of competition within the third level sector which is extremely good in itself.  They have been the pioneers of innovation and have shown distinct imagination in relation to broadening the scope of the universities beyond the traditional.  Furthermore, above all else, these universities have brought about a huge and wide expansion of the curriculum available to people at third level.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance to collectively decide to make two things possible: (1) a far larger number of third level places; and (2) greater access by everyone to third level education.  There are 63,000 people attending third level colleges and 34,000 of them are in receipt of grants.  However, approximately 29,000 people do not qualify for ESF, VEC or higher education grants.  If you examine the social structure you will see that among the 29,000 people to whom I referred there is a huge section of the new poor, the PAYE middle income sector. There is a collective obligation, social, political and moral, on us to try to do something to open up greater accessibility for the people caught in the middle income poverty trap because they do not qualify for any grant and as a result do not have access to third level education to realise their talents and potential.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, the working group and everybody involved in this innovation.  We have made another signal step towards the development of third <Col N="629" /> level education.  The south-west is particularly lucky.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was quite right to jog our memory, because the last time she spoke on third level education in Limerick a general election followed almost immediately.  Indeed, she was the last speaker in the House on that day and, if I recall correctly, she gave me some of her time to make my contribution.</P>
      <P>I also remember that, while the debate was very stormy and acrimonious, the Bill was passed.  In spite of all the background noises and clamour the Bill got through the House and the people who had come from Limerick to listen to the debate were pleased.  I do not imagine that the fact the Minister is piloting this Bill through the House means that there will be a similar result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short, simple and functional Bill, but it is very important. The merger between the two colleges was natural and inevitable.  It is a milestone in the history of third level education in Limerick.  It is a positive and constructive milestone as far as education is concerned.  I know both colleges well from my experience in Limerick and they will benefit from integration.  I believe also that Limerick, the mid-west and the country as a whole will benefit from this integration.</P>
      <P>In the course of her contribution the Minister made a few important statements, including:</P>
      <P>The Bill will do more, however, than merely allow for a formal integration. It will allow the expertise and experience of two institutions which have been built up over the years to be fused together to the mutual benefit of both staff and students. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one could disagree with her on that point.  Indeed, I support those sentiments wholeheartedly.  With goodwill on all <Col N="630" /> sides of the House, there is no reason why this objective cannot be achieved. The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The integration will be another step in its development in that it will provide an extra 600 to 700 places and will allow expansion in the areas where the university has built up a particular expertise such as science, engineering and business studies. </P>
    <P>As I said, both institutions should benefit from this integration.  Thomond College has much to offer the university.  It should be stressed that even though it is much smaller it will be a willing partner and there is no opposition in the college to this move.  The college has a different ethos to that of the university and it embodies the right to free academic speech and freedom of expression and thought.  This is very important in any university where we sometimes go to speak to students or staff who may torment us at times, but that is life.  Democracy will not thrive unless alternative views are expressed.  I hope the principles to which I have referred will be accepted in the new institution.  Indeed, they should be respected, enhanced and forced on the institution, if necessary.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins said, in-service education is very important.  This forms part and parcel of Thomond College, which is recognised internationally. These functions must be preserved and enhanced in the new body with special reference to physical education, metal and engineering technologies, wood and building technologies, horticulture, general and rural science, business education and, above all, the Humanities, which is very important as the university has proved to be deficient in this area in the past.</P>
    <P>Even though the Bill is short, it will not be easy to join the two institutions together.  It will be a difficult and complex process; but, with goodwill, co-operation and benign benevolence on the part of the Minister, it can be achieved.  It is essential that consultations take place at all levels during the process, not just at <Col N="631" /> one level.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the working party will hold discussions at all levels in the two bodies. It is important that the rights of the staff of Thomond College be respected because, as I have pointed out, their careers are at stake.  They should have the right to be consulted in this matter.  I would like to see the joint committee holding discussions at all levels so as to ensure that any industrial relations problems are ironed out at this stage and not allowed to fester.  I hope the Minister will use her good offices in this matter for the benefit of both bodies.  I am also pleased that the Minister has held dicussions with the Teachers Union of Ireland and the MSF.  I wish those involved in the talks in Dublin today all the best, because unless there is a free exchange of views and goodwill on all sides the process of integration will not be a smooth one or bear fruit.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that places on the governing body of the university will be reserved for members of the staff of Thomond College.  Places are reserved in the existing structure; but, as the Minister is aware, the number of places on the governing body is to be reduced from 23 to 20.  In addition, places should be reserved for them on the executive committee of the university, who are responsible for the day-to-day running of the university.  This is a sub committee of the governing body.  It is important that they be involved in the decision-making process. I also hope that academics from Thomond College will have a role to play in that committee.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the university will have a responsibility to promote the Irish language and culture.  It is important that we do not gloss over that aspect in the House today. The university should have a wide appeal and should not confine itself to technical subjects.  It should have a broad Humanities Department encompassing the Irish language and culture.  I am also glad that she recognised the contribution Thomond College is making to the culture of the Plassey complex and Limerick city. <Col N="632" /> That contribution has not been acknowledged either in this House or in Limerick. I would like to say that the staff and students of Thomond College have made a big contribution to the culture of our city, which is very cosmopolitan.  This has led to interest in the Irish language, culture, poetry, literature and set dancing being revived.  They have been the driving force behind this move and that should be acknowledged.  The university should not be a cold place, rather it should be a bustling and lively place.  Let us hope that their contribution will not be stultified in the new institution, because it will be all the poorer if it is.  I cannot stress enough the importance of the Humanities in the new institution.  I will deal with this matter later.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to consider expanding the library facilities in the new university.  As the Minister is aware, the NIHE, now known as the University of Limerick, has a copyright library which has the right to ensure that books published by Irish publishers are deposited in the library.  Unfortunately, some Irish publishers are ignoring their duties, obligations and responsibilities and not depositing books in the university. It is important that this right be preserved in the Bill.  I could find no reference to the matter in the Bill, but if I am wrong I ask the Minister to correct me.  It is important that this right is not removed and if it is not included in the Bill it should be incorporated on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill incorporates those old words &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo;.  That language is outdated, archaic, outmoded, Victorian and Dickensian and has no place in modern terminology.  It should have gone out with the stage coach and the buggy.  Would the Minister explain the reason they have been included in the Bill?  Each person working at the university is contributing and fulfilling a function and, as far as I am concerned, those words have no place in modern terminology and should not be included in the Bill.  I would support an amendment to remove them.</P>
    <P>Graduates of the main universities are <Col N="633" /> allowed to vote in Seanad elections.  Will the graduates of the new university be given the right to take part in that election? They should be given this right but not as a token gesture or an act of charity.</P>
    <P>At present a one year equestrian course is provided by Thomond College. The students and teachers have for a long time being lobbying people like myself and the Minister to have a degree course of three years provided.  I would ask the Minister to consider taking that suggestion on board.</P>
    <P>Sadly, Thomond College has been overshadowed in the past by the University of Limerick, which is bigger, more grandiose and better designed.  Indeed, it is dwarfed by the university which has received far more money, has more prestige and has a higher profile.</P>
    <P>Because the university had far more money, more prestige and a higher profile, Thomond College suffered and staff and pupils are demoralised.  As the Minister knows from her frequent visits to the campus, the structure is of very bad design.  In my book the design of Thomond College is a disaster.  It looks like a modern bunker &mdash; some wits have described it as an upturned submarine. To me, as somebody who has been in the building industry for a very long time, it is badly designed and the choice of material used on the outside was bad. The college has suffered because of the bad design and the lack of outside maintenance in particular.  It is now a rather shabby run down building, and this has a demoralising effect on both the staff and students.  This is a pity because we are all entitled to work in a good atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The college was built on one of the finest sites on these islands, on the banks of the River Shannon.  It is a poetic place near Plassey, and it was a great pity to ruin such a lovely environment, the beautiful scenery and the river by a badly designed building.  I find this incomprehensible. A place of learning should uplift the spirit, not demoralise both staff and students who have to work in an airless building which could be better designed.  I could say much more but I will leave it at that for the present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> I hope the university will improve with the infusion of talent from Thomond College. Deputy Higgins asked what is the purpose of a university in the present world.  We should constantly ask ourselves that question when speaking about education in this House.  We should also ask what is the purpose of university education. I had a friend in Limerick, a great wit, who said that universities polish stones and dull diamonds.  I do not necessarily go along with that view.  Universities are very important in the modern world, especially a technological university like Limerick which specialises in courses on technology, industry and the economy, which is vital to our survival. Sometimes we vote through large sums of money for the universities on the nod without questioning where the money is going.  Is there any public accountability for the money voted to the universities?  What are the universities doing to solve our problems?  The world is now full of problems, 250,000 of our people are unemployed, a third of our people are on the poverty line and emigration is now in full spate.</P>
    <P>I will not say that the people in universities are in their ivory towers working in isolation, but they continue to work.  I would not for one moment wish to distort the purpose of education, but there must be some public accountability when public money is involved and we must ask for some stewardship.  This applies to Limerick University and to every other university in this country.  At a time when we have a great many problems, it is important that the University of Limerick contribute to finding solutions to these problems.  We are constantly being told about the success rate of Limerick University graduates finding employment. Many find employment in multinational companies or in foreign countries and there is nothing wrong with that as far as I am concerned.  The fact that a person gets work is a good thing.</P>
    <P>However, there are questions which have never been asked.  Have the universities an obligation to find solutions to our problems considering the vast amount of money we pump into them?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> That question should be asked during this debate.  We cannot have too narrow a focus on the purpose of the university, because as far as I am concerned the University of Limerick must be used to find answers to our problems, and perhaps we should address this point at some future date.  The university should use all their expertise to find answers, to suggest blueprints and design programmes and policies to create employment thus ending the misery resulting from unemployment.</P>
    <P>Another point we should address is integration and the gap between town and gown in Limerick.  The University of Limerick and Thomond College are located approximately three miles from the city centre and there is a physical gap between the colleges and the town centre.  That is not the position in other universities such as Trinity College and UCD, which are part of the fabric of Dublin society.  The students at University College, Cork, University, College Galway and Queen's University, Belfast, are very much part and parcel of urban life in those cities.  Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the University of Limerick. There is a physical and mental gap there.  However, the colleges made a good contribution to Treaty 300 and that process should go on.  The infusion of young people into a city enlivens it and gives it vitality.  The integration of students and academics into city life will help the city to flourish and diversify.  I would like to see that process continuing in this new institution and there is no reason that it should not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins alluded to the fact that the Minister might have further designs on Limerick and he mentioned the possible merger of Mary Immaculate College with this new university.  The Minister was wise enough not to mention it in her contribution &mdash; perhaps she would be biting off more than she could chew &mdash; and she was quite right to leave it out for the present.  That is another day's work. In Limerick this move is seen as inevitable. I have not dealt with it at length in my contribution because we do not need <Col N="636" /> to tackle this issue today.  We will deal with the present problem before the House and guide the legislation through as best we can.  If it emerges that the Minister is working on a further measure she will put it before the House in due course.  However, let me say that I am not opposed to the concept of merging this college with the university.  I do not think there would be much opposition from Mary Immaculate College either, but we can deal with that later.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile let us stay with the problem before us.  This looks like a simple, short Bill but it could have a rocky passage in Limerick unless the right people make the right decisions and provide the right framework.  The Minister plays a pivotal role, and she is the authority.  She has the respect of both colleges and must ensure that this integration is not a lustful mating but a democratic integration of two colleges for the benefit of the students and academic education.</P>
    <P>I am confident that with the goodwill of all the parties concerned, this will be progressive legislation, and I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in welcoming this Bill. Thomond College have in a very short period developed a tradition and have become very well known.  I hope that the traditions they have developed will be preserved.  One of their traditions was professionalism in teaching.  The college provide fine teachers who were able to instill in graduates the very best concepts of discipline in sport and physical education. I know a number of their graduates who were very much sought after by schools and colleges both at home and abroad.  Teaching was their most important function.  Their students did not have to excel at a particular sport but they had to know it and they had to be able to convey the principles and concepts of discipline to the pupils.  The teaching function must be preserved and this might be lost in the amalgamation with the university. I hope, as both Deputy Kemmy and the Minister said, that it will be a merger, as is intended, although the legal <Col N="637" /> mechanism is the dissolution of the college. I hope that the merger concept is maintained and that the Thomond ethos will have a will of its own within the university so that they can maintain and preserve the traditions they have built up.</P>
      <P>Limerick University is also new and the people of Limerick fought very hard for it.  Deputy Higgins described Professor Edward Walsh, the President of the university as an extraordinary individual. I would agree with that.  He also described him as an educational entrepreneur. I think that is precisely what he is, and that is a very dangerous thing.</P>
      <P>We were issued yesterday with the third edition of <i>Decision Maker</i> which contains an article by Rex Cathcart on an Education Act for the South, on which he gives a view from the North.  That article states:</P>
      <P>While the delegate at the British Young Conservatives conference who asserted, &ldquo;it is time to proclaim education as a commodity to be bought and sold, and to disclaim the Marxian view that education is a right&rdquo;, may have been indulging in extremist rhetoric, there is little doubt that he expressed the effective tenor of Thatcherite policy. </P>
      <P>Professor Edward Walsh was five years ahead of that young Conservative when he said that education should be regarded as a commodity like any other which is available for those who wish to purchase it.  He was well ahead of the Thatcherites. That is his philosophy of education.  It is a very simple, clear, very right wing aristocratic philosophy of education but it is a philosophy.  It is not the educational philosophy held by people generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately we do not have an education Act, although the Minister intends to produce one.  That matter is the subject of debate among educationalists.  If we have an education Act I presume it will set down some philosophy of education. Our Constitution states clearly that education is a right, to the extent that it must be provided free at primary level.  If we have an education Act with an education <Col N="638" /> philosophy which is in accordance with our Constitution, public servants, such as Professor Edward Walsh, must conform to that educational philosophy or resign from their office.  Unfortunately we do not have an educational philosophy and people like Professor Walsh can proclaim any philosophy they like.  If that is an attitude which develops in the University of Limerick, those who go from Thomond College may expect fairly short shrift if they cannot by the commodity which Professor Walsh has for sale, which is a very poor beginning to an educational system.</P>
    <P>I agree with this merger but I wonder if it could be the beginning of a new policy of amalgamating all teacher training colleges with universities.  The idea has been suggested already and it may well be a developing policy within the Minister's mind or within the Department of Education, where most policies develop.  It may be a good idea in time but I would be against it until such time as we have an education Act which sets out clear policies at all levels of education so that we do not have this hit and miss, stopgo approach to problems of educational policy.  The importance of an education Act is that we would have a clearly laid down philosophy, policy and structure to which we would conform.  The idea of teacher training colleges being amalgamated with universities without clearly set out policies for both teacher training and pupil training at all levels would be a disaster.  The suggestion is that teacher training could well fit into the arts faculty of a university.  What is missed there is the teacher training concept.  The teacher training aspect of Thomond College is vitally important.  That could well be lost if the students are fitted into a university degree system.  While I would oppose the idea at present, there could come a time when I would agree to it if necessary changes were made in the system.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the reduction in numbers in teacher training colleges. Over the years the concept has developed that there is a large pool of unemployed teachers without full-time jobs who can <Col N="639" /> be called upon at any time and that therefore we can reduce the number of teacher training places.  I believe only 250 are qualifying this year at primary level, about one third the normal number.  The Department of Education may be overestimating the number of unemployed teachers.  Many teachers who were available for part-time or temporary jobs have emigrated or obtained jobs in other areas.  I do not believe there are accurate estimates of the numbers available for teaching work.  The Minister's commitment in the PESP means an increase in the number of teachers required and I am worried that the number of places in the training colleges has fallen much too low.  The same anxiety might be expressed with regard to Thomond College and to the universities.  The Minister should consider this matter.  There is no organised system of panels for substitute teachers.  Schools have to ring around to find out who is available for substitute work instead of contacting some central agency.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides as follows:</P>
    <P>The University in relation to the performance of its functions shall have due regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and culture. </P>
    <P>That is a very generalised statement. What is required when we are talking about teacher training?  What is the policy in regard to the Irish language in that area?  This provision needs amendment and I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 11, 32 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>No proceedings against Ireland have been issued by the EC Commission about the legal status of the ESB.  The Commission's intention to scrutinise the Community's electricity producers relates to its concern that some member states are protecting their own electricity utilities from competitive importation of electricity across Community borders.  This situation is not relevant to Ireland at present as there is no interconnector in operation to engage in such trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> Ireland was responsible during its Presidency for getting agreement on the Electricity Transit Directive which facilitates the exchange of electricity between utilities.  In the event of an interconnector being built there would be opportunities for both the import and export of electricity as well as improved security of supply.  Discussions are taking place between the ESB and the National Grid Company in the UK about the feasibility of such an interconnector.</P>
    <P>The question of amending the existing legislation both in relation to the ESB's monopoly position in Ireland and to take account of EC developments regarding competition is considered regularly in the context of ensuring the best possible service for all Irish electricity consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw a printed matter indicating that we were amongst almost all of the countries in the EC against whom proceedings were being initiated as a result of anomalies.  Is the Minister stating that that is not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In March this year the EC Commission issued a press release in which they announced that under competition law it intended to open proceedings against ten member states which maintain exclusive import and export rights for electricity and gas.  Some member states have rules which grant monopoly rights in respect of cross-border trade in these fields.  Despite press reports the Commission so far has not started any proceedings.  If they do decide to proceed the action would initially take the form of a letter to the ten member states asking them to show that their energy monopolies conformed to competition rules of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>On receiving responses from these member states, the Commission will examine the situation further to see if there is a basis for further action.  Only then will the Commission consider, after exhaustive examination of each case, whether a complaint is warranted and whether action should be taken in the European Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the first priority is to achieve the construction of a gas interconnector.  Preliminary work is proceeding on the question of following on with an electricity interconnector. Contact has been made with the UK authorities in regard to that matter. There was a hold-up because of the privatisation programme which was under way in Great Britain but now the distribution company has been established over there and the ESB have been holding discussions with them.  It is the next priority after we achieve the gas interconnector, but preliminary work and investigation is proceeding.  We have not reached the stage yet where we will be carrying out a viability study.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>if he has sought any facilities for monitoring the level of radioactivity in water discharges from Sellafield and in particular for monitoring the greatly increased discharges which will arise when THORP is commissioned: if not, if he will outline the information which is made available for making a scientific assessment of the effects of these discharges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual discharges from Sellafield cannot be measured directly by our authorities but the concentration of radioactivity from Sellafield in our coastal waters and in the Irish Sea is measured by the Nuclear Energy Board in conjunction with the Department of the Marine.  This is an indirect method of measuring Sellafield discharges and the facilities for making these measurements exist already.</P>
      <P>The same facilities will be used to measure any increase in concentration which may arise when THORP is fully commissioned and operational.  The operators of this plant are of the opinion that there will not be a significant increase in discharges when THORP is operational, because additional treatment equipment has been commissioned.</P>
      <P>The scientific assessment of the effects of Sellafield discharges is carried out by the NEB, principally on the basis that by estimating the dose arising to fish eaters and comparing this to international limits and doses from natural background, they can arrive at a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The latest information on this may be found in the NEB annual report for 1989 and the NEB report entitled &ldquo;Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment &mdash; 1987&rdquo;.  A report on radioactivity monitoring of the marine environment covering the years 1988 to 1990 will be published shortly, and it will show a continuing decrease in radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea, consistent with the reduction in discharges from Sellafield over recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there is no direct method of monitoring. That was precisely the purport of the question.  Has the Minister ever sought any direct monitoring facilities in view of the long campaign the Government and the Minister himself have waged in <Col N="644" /> regard to Sellafield on the extent of the discharges into the Irish Sea and the dangers for Irish people?  Could the Minister ask for monitoring facilities, particularly as the discharges of water following the development of the new THORP facility there will be more than doubled?  They may say that the level of discharges will not increase appreciably but the facts are that the level of water discharges will increase enormously following THORP. I wonder if the Minister should now ask for special monitoring facilities to see that they are telling the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the continuing refusal of the UK Government to agree to a Europe-wide inspectorate to give access to the nuclear stations in Great Britain.  I have no reason to believe that a request for an Irish presence at the discharge point from Sellafield would receive any more positive response than the negative ones I have received to the requests for a Europe-wide inspectorate. We are dealing with another sovereign State and if that is the position they wish to take up, it is their right to do so.  We as a Government have been seeking to obtain Community agreement to more adequate, more satisfactory and more transparent controls that would be open to inspection.  All that is promised at present is the right for the European Community to have access to inspect that the controls and the measuring equipment are in place but not to go any further than that.  This is some small way towards the position we are trying to establish but it is not at all satisfactory yet.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister has said, that the level of radioactive discharges from Sellafield has reduced in recent years.  From a point where they said there was no danger whatever five or six years ago they have now reduced them enormously, which indicates that there was great danger then.  I am particularly interested in the development of THORP in which now there will be passage of ships bringing highly intensive radiation material from Japan up to Sellafield along the Irish Sea <Col N="645" /> and it will be much more difficult to reduce the level of radiation from the water before discharge.  That is why I am worried as to whether either the EC or the Government here can have some facility to see that what they tell us is true &mdash; that there will be no increase in the level of radiation discharges.  Every indication is that from the type of material that will be going into THORP discharges must be much more radioactive unless huge equipment is installed to reduce the levels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me appeal for brevity, for obvious reasons.  There are two more questions to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of aspects to the questions being posed here. I repeat that, according to the Nuclear Energy Board's advice to me which was obtained from their consultations with the authorities at Sellafield, the operators of THORP expect no increase in discharges from the plant in its operation as they have commissioned additional treatment equipment.  Furthermore, we are informed reductions in discharges from existing installations at Sellafield are planned.  As I said, EC requirements will now come into operation.  This is the change announced some time back that will affect the THORP situation in that the discharges there will be subject to scrutiny by the Community under Article 37 of the EURATOM Treaty.  British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. cannot make their final arrangements for discharges until they have received the Commission's opinion under Article 37 after consultation with a committee of experts drawn from member states.  That is distinct from the original question if the Irish Government would be present or have their own people present to monitor the discharges.  We are achieving some progress at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of transportation, we have had that issue up here on a number of occasions.  I have explained the position and I can only express again my personal concern as well as the Deputy's at the possibility of some kind of accident <Col N="646" /> happening while this radioactive waste is being transported up the Irish Sea.  That is a matter of serious concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The introduction of standards is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I understand that preparation of a standard for smokeless fuels is under consideration, but that it would take some time and resources to develop.</P>
      <P>I hope that as people become more used to using these fuels much of the difficulty which has arisen will disappear. EOLAS will of course continue to give advice on the use of fuels.  Earlier this week the Solid Fuel Advisory Confederation produced a booklet entitled the <i>Solid Fuel Heating Directory 1991,</i> the aim of which is to provide information about the wide variety of solid fuels and appliances on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my view that one of the difficulties people faced last year while coping with the wide variety of fuels undermined the attempt to improve the environment in Dublin and that it is vital to get it right this year? Will the Minister's Department through EOLAS be working with the Solid Fuel Advisory Confederation to ensure a proper grading system, which I believe is <Col N="647" /> the answer to this problem, which will clearly identify fuels in relation to the various qualities that are relevant to the consumer, their firing ability, their heating ability, their sparking qualities, etc? Does he see any role for himself in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I have to disagree vehemently with the Deputy that attempts to clean up the environment in Dublin by taking action against smoky fuels have been undermined.  If anything that has been a success, as the monitoring facilities have so dramatically recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very pleased. There has been some difficulty in regard to some of the fuels, one in particular, petro-coke, which the suppliers by way of agreement among themselves withdrew from the market because it was dangerous to use on its own and it must be mixed with some other fuel.  That information was disseminated widely.  I accept there will still be people who may not be aware of it but at least now it is not being supplied on its own on the market.</P>

      <P>The main policy objectives for energy were set out in the National Development Plan 1989-1993 and in the Programme for Government.  As I have stated previously, I am not convinced that the publication of a White Paper on energy would alter these objectives or enable them to be achieved more effectively.

      <Quest>whether the prospects of getting Irish oil ashore have changed in the light of the current higher level of oil prices and the number of wells that will have been drilled in Irish waters during 1990; and the forecast for 1991.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 15, 30 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four wells were drilled in the Irish offshore during 1990.  Two wells were drilled by Marathon and one each by Conoco Celtic Ltd. and Hydrocarbons Ireland Ltd.  My Department receive, on a confidential basis, all information which arises from the drilling of wells.  I do not propose to comment on the results of drilling due to the confidential nature of the well data.  In 1991 I expect at least three exploration wells to be drilled.  The <Col N="650" /> first well will be drilled by Marathon on the &ldquo;Kilmore&rdquo; prospect in Block 50/3 in the Celtic Sea and will be spudded within the next few days.  In addition both Aran Energy and Bula have drilling obligations this year in the Celtic Sea.  The precise location and depth of all wells is, of course, subject to approval by my Department.</P>
    <P>Although oil prices have stabilised somewhat in recent weeks at a level slightly below $20 per barrel, it is perhaps too early to predict the long term effect of recent events in the Middle East on hydrocarbons exploration activity.  While this country cannot influence this crucial factor of price, I am nonetheless anxious that we should take all reasonable measures within our own competence to promote further exploration effort within our own territory.</P>
    <P>On 19 April 1991 I announced that a licensing round will be held in mid-1993 which will cover offshore blocks in the Erris and Slyne troughs off the west coast.  The purpose of announcing the round at this stage is to allow the industry time to acquire seismic data of the region so as to be well placed to make decisions on applications for licences under the round.  The open door policy regarding licensing will continue for areas not included in the 1993 round.</P>
    <P>I have also asked my Department to review our offshore licensing terms. These were last reviewed in 1987 and I am anxious that our terms be brought up to date and that measures to further encourage exploration efforts are identified and implemented.  I might also mention in this context the Government's recent decision to incorporate petroleum taxation legislation in the Finance Bill, 1992.  This will remedy a long-standing deficiency in Ireland's overall regime and, as a measure which dispels an element of industry uncertainty, should impact positively on the perception of Ireland as a location for exploration and production.</P>
    <P>As part of the on-going promotion of the Irish offshore my Department make well and seismic data available to the industry at minimal cost as soon as they <Col N="651" /> become available for release.  Technical reports on acreage considered worthy of specific promotion are also prepared and sold to the industry.</P>
    <P>While oil accumulations have been discovered in the Irish offshore none of these has so far been deemed commercial by the companies concerned.  Deputies will, however, be aware that Atlantic Resources and its partners are currently undertaking an assessment of the feasibility of producing oil from the Helvick Field, located in Block 49/9 in the Celtic Sea off the coast of Waterford.  The decision on whether to proceed or not with this project is in the first instance one for the relevant companies themselves to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the companies concerned have not deemed any of these projects to be commercially viable.  Does this mean that because the world is awash with oil they do not see any commercial necessity to explore in this case or, alternatively, that the oil is not there?  Does the Minister agree that the recent Gulf crisis has accentuated the need for an independent supply, preferably a domestic one?  Is it a question of no tax incentives being available or no supply being available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences are issued to the companies and if they wish to come forward to the Department with a development plan for the blocks for which they have licences they may do so.  They are under no obligation to do this.  The Department are fully informed of the results of all drilling tests carried out. With regard to my statement about the companies not deeming any of their finds to have been commercially viable, this was decided on the basis of whatever criteria the company apply.  The Deputy should bear in mind that the Department also have full information in regard to finds in any of these blocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty with the term &ldquo;commercial find&rdquo; as calculated by the companies concerned.  This could <Col N="652" /> mean anything.  Given that he has the information.  I want to ask the Minister if the oil is there?  Is it because there is a lot of oil elsewhere and they have other interests that the companies do not want to declare this commercial find?  Will the Minister tell the House when the first drilling licence was issued?  Would he consider setting up a State exploration company if these commercial enterprises are not interested in bringing ashore whatever oil finds are there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very wrong of the Deputy to seek to convey the impression that there is an enormous quantity of oil off our shore which has been found by companies who for one reason or another have decided not to bring it ashore.  That is a very unrealistic scenario.  I want to dispel any such impression the Deputy might be seeking to create, because some people believe that when oil companies make a find they keep it to themselves, do not tell anyone for their own reasons and develop it when it suits them.  I want to assure the Deputy that the Department have full knowledge of all the drilling tests carried out.  If world oil prices were to stabilise at a somewhat higher level than that which has obtained in recent years this might prompt a re-examination of the oil finds which have been made already but which were deemed to be uncommercial at the time.  If prices were to stabilise at a higher level it might be worth exploring those blocks further. This has not happened and, despite peaks at the start of the troubles in the Middle East, prices have settled down to the $20 mark.  Indeed, prices have been much lower than that in recent years.  Therefore, the incentive from a commercially viable point of view was not there to develop these finds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, it is important to recognise that there are companies who are prepared to continue looking, investing and carrying out tests on their blocks. I think it is against this background that Atlantic Resources are examining the feasibility of developing the Helvick oil field in the Celtic Sea and that Aran are <Col N="653" /> conducting a similar exercise in the Connemara field in the Porcupine Basin off the west coast.  To sum it up in a few words, if oil prices rise dramatically and remain high then there could be a massive renewed interest in our offshore.</P>

      <P>For years we have all been very anxious to see an oil strike. I think every Government have looked for an oil strike to pull them out of the doldrums.  There have been some oil discoveries. As the Minister is aware, an agreement was reached between Atlantic Resources and a Dutch-Australian consortium in regard to the oil find in block 49/9.  Is the Minister aware of the extent of that agreement and has any initiative been given to the Dutch-Australian consortium in regard to whether and when oil will be brought ashore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly said, an announcement was made by Atlantic Resources that they had reached agreement with an Australian-Dutch consortium whereby they would farm out some of their interest in licence No. 2/81 which covers block 49/9.  As part of this arrangement it is proposed that an early assessment will be carried out on the <Col N="654" /> feasibility of proceeding with a commercial development scheme for the block 49/9/2 accumulation, known as the Helvick oil field.  It will be up to the companies to decide on this issue.  The farm out agreement has, as required, been submitted to me for approval.  I want to say at this stage that I welcome the development in so far as it could result in Irish oil being brought ashore in commercial quantities, albeit fairly small quantities.</P>

Can the Minister take this opportunity to clarify whether it is the shortage of refining capacity worldwide that is responsible for maintaining the price and is the lost refining capacity related to the Gulf situation and the Middle East?</P>

      <P>An old gentleman in the oil business advised me, in the early months, never to try to predict the price of oil or the reasons for the price increasing or decreasing.  It is far too complex and a myriad of factors, many of which are irrational, have a serious influence on why oil prices increase and decrease. <Col N="656" /> They are based on much wild guessing by people at times.  The question of refining capacity is interesting from our point of view.</P>
      <P>There was an excess in refining capacity worldwide but that situation has changed in recent years and I hope it will be to our advantage because of the existence here of the national oil refinery at Whitegate into which the State is anxious to attract investment for the purpose of modernising and expanding its facilities to enable it to meet modern standards for petroleum products and to remove the mandatory regime and the diseconomy that exists because of prices here.  Now that the refining capacity is moving more to our advantage, I hope that will help investment in Whitegate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 13, 18, 23, 25, 34 and 40 together, all of which seem to be identical. There is something to be said about the need for reforming our procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have strongly encouraged the establishment of a wind-farm in Ireland under the Valoren programme. Following the issue in October 1990 of an invitation to tender for the construction of Ireland's first wind-farm which could qualify for grant assistance of up to £3.9 million under the Valoren Programme, eight proposals were received on 30 November 1990 including proposals from the two firms to which Deputies have referred.  A rigorous appraisal of the proposals was carried out by a Departmental assessment team specifically established for that purpose. The assessment team had available to it independent outside experts in the wind energy area.  Following this appraisal the proposal from Renewable Energy Ireland Ltd. to construct a wind-farm at Bellacorick, County Mayo was accepted. Planning permission has been granted by Mayo County Council on 22 January 1991 following submission by the company of an environmental impact assessment and other relevant data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no specific requirement under <Col N="661" /> the Valoren Programme for commencement of construction but the aim is to have the wind-farm operational by the end of August 1992.  I am satisfied that there is sufficient time available to complete all aspects of this project.  Discussions are taking place at present between the company and the ESB to settle the terms for supply of electricity from the wind-farm to the national grid.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of review by the European Commission of the Irish Valoren programme the position is that such a review was carried out early in 1990.  The results of the review were not provided to my Department.  However a revised programme which took account of new possibilities in the areas of wind energy and geothermal energy was approved by the Commission in October 1990.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister indicate whether he will take an interest in ensuring that the terms which the ESB will offer to this project will be such that it will assist in its development and its success because, as the Minister and I know and I am sure he will confirm to the House one of the problems which has stymied earlier similar developments has been the inability to get a decent price from the ESB?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions on the unit price payable have taken place between the company and the ESB.  While the final terms have not been settled I am satisfied at this stage that the ESB are approaching the matter in a fair and reasonable way.  The Deputy can have my assurance, in view of the public support I have given for the project, that I will take a keen interest in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is an extremely important project in terms of our programme for renewable energy and that what is basically a bookkeeping exercise between this new company and the ESB should not stand in the way of this project going ahead?  I would ask the Minister to undertake within, say, a period of one or two <Col N="662" /> months to give the ESB an ultimatum.  If agreement is not reached in that time the Minister should impose some solution on the ESB and get the show on the road.</P>

Discussions are taking place in the normal way and I am satisfied that the ESB are approaching this matter in a fair and reasonable way and I expect that it will be settled in a short period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister define &ldquo;a short period of time&rdquo;?  Will we still be talking about this next October or November?  This whole project could be shelved and it could disappear with the intransigence of the ESB who are notorious for their lack of interest in any renewable energy project.  Can a time limit not be put on it?</P>

      <P>I am not two years in this Department yet.  This is an initiative which I took.  There would be no wind energy project in County Mayo or anywhere else had I not taken the initiative. Obviously, having done so, I am keener than anybody to ensure that this project proceeds as quickly as possible and I am happy that it has done so.  In order to inform myself as best I could before arriving at the decision regarding which of these proposals would be recommended, I took the trouble of travelling to California and to Denmark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider it useful to introduce an amendment to the Electricity Supply Acts in order to require the ESB to change the pricing formula they use for electricity bought from sources outside the ESB to ensure that these are not priced on a monopoly basis but on a basis that takes due account of the need to promote competing sources of electricity supply? Would he agree that this issue is quite important in view of the recent electricity supply strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there should be any need for legislation.  I am anxious that the ESB would purchase electricity from private generators, whether through hydro-electricity, a wind energy project or even a wave, if it is developed and becomes viable.  I have initiated discussions in the Department with a view to establishing a formula for the determination of the price to be paid for hydro-electricity.  If necessary I will do the same in regard to wind energy and any other sources of energy that arise or any other producer who wishes to sell electricity into the ESB system.  I am doing that because of my concern to ensure that we as a Government make a commitment to renewable energies.  We must make our contribution to cleaning up the world global environment.  That policy has the support of all parties in this House and of the community.  One must <Col N="664" /> bear in mind that one can produce electricity at its cheapest by using coal.  If one uses a fuel to generate electricity which is dearer than coal one would be imposing a cost penalty on the economy.  The State should support that in its energy policy and work out some reasonable method of determining what the price should be. In the case of hydro we are at the point where it is practically determined how it should be compiled.  I hope there will be no necessity to bring in legislation to ensure this pricing policy is implemented by the ESB, but if I find it is necessary I am glad to know I will have the support of the Fine Gael Party in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, while the efforts he is making are entirely laudable and are supported, to rely on a formula agreed between officials in his Department and officials in the ESB would not have the guarantee necessary for the making of capital investment in the sense that people realise that officials can change and, therefore, formulate change?  People who are asked to make a substantial investment in a new electricity generating source would like to know that the formula cannot be changed at the whim of officials or because a particular Minister moves to another portfolio or ceases to be a Minister.  Therefore, there is a strong case for enshrining the formula when it is fixed &mdash; I am not asking the Minister to rush this matter &mdash; in legislation.  He should agree in principle at least to consider putting the formula into legislation.</P>

      <P>The energy conservation programme arising from the Government's Environment Action Programme published last year took the form of a number of new initiatives as well as a continuation of existing activities.</P>
      <P>The National Energy Conservation and Efficiency Advisory Group which I established last year completed a report for me on energy conservation proposals which would be worth pursuing.  Their suggestions are being examined as a matter of priority.  In addition a number of headline practical projects were undertaken notably a survey to trace more precisely the location of groundwater, which can be used in conjunction with heat pumps to provide heat for buildings in the city centre area of Dublin, has been completed; support by way of a grant was provided to the charitable group &ldquo;Energy Action&rdquo; for draught-proofing the houses of the needy and elderly and a project to demonstrate the energy and cost savings which can be made by the installation of energy management systems in hospitals is still ongoing and will be completed this year.  The budget for those elements of the programme which were carried forward into the current year is approximately £140,000 which is included in the total provision for conservation of £570,000.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that apart from the above measures an on-going programme of conservation activities is being promoted by Eolas on behalf of my Department, and that the ESB are also engaged in energy efficiency promotion activities in the electricity end-use area.</P>

      <P>The aim of the project was <Col N="666" /> to demonstrate the potential for using groundwater in conjunction with heat pumps to provide heat for buildings in the Dublin city centre area.  This resulted from the discovery used for the Trinity College heating system.  As Deputies know, that area is not a highly residential area but has mostly commercial buildings, including this complex.  Of the 13 bore holes drilled four sites yielded promising results and the Department will be monitoring follow-up work by the owners of these sites.  A seminar will be held on 18 June 1991 to publicise the results of the study.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 8, 9 and 26 together. The principal response to problems of disputes in essential services like the recent ESB strike is the development of a code of practice by the Labour Relations Commission in consultation with the employer and employee bodies.  I understand that this will be presented to the Minister for Labour within two months. As well as contributing to the development of this code of practice, the ESB are carrying out a joint management-union review of labour relationships in the organisation with the assistance of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the services of independent experts of international repute.</P>

      <P>It is getting more and more difficult to pin the Minister down to responsibilities for certain areas.  As soon as we ask a specific question responsibility is shifted to another Minister. Surely the Minister must take an interest in this matter in that he deals with the ESB on a day to day basis and should have a useful input into this.  For example, is the Minister involved in any way in an early warning system or in ensuring that when internal mechanisms for solving disputes are exhausted what happened recently will not happen again, that there will not be recourse to a strike? There should be a requirement in the internal code of practice that they avail of the State system to try to resolve these problems.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has chosen to ask me questions about industrial relations.  If this House decided some years ago to establish a Department of Labour with a Minister with special responsibility for those matters, it is unfair of the Deputy to suggest if I am not giving her an answer that there is something wrong in that approach.  That has been a long standing approach here. Of course, as a member of the Government I participate in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Labour, in regard to industrial relations matters and particularly in regard to semi-State bodies who come under my responsibility, such as the ESB.  There is a need now to develop a code of practice which will hopefully deal with the type of situation that resulted in the ESB strike some time ago and which had such a terrible effect on everybody.  The Minister for Labour has taken an initiative in this matter and is fully supported by all members of the Government.</P>

      <P>As regards the finds in blocks for which Marathon have a licence at present, the terms that will apply will <Col N="669" /> be along the lines of those agreed previously. The Deputy asked if I was satisfied with the level of royalty payments. The direct financial benefit to the State in the form of royalties represents only one of the positive benefits which this country has derived from Kinsale natural gas.</P>
      <P>Out of the revenue earned by BGÉ from the sale of gas they have returned dividends to the State totalling £260 million to date, they have been able to build up an extensive gas grid and they have achieved a turnaround in the fortunes of Dublin Gas.  In addition, our balance of payments has benefited because of the substitution of natural gas for imported fuels &mdash; the value of replaced imports is about £2 billion.</P>
      <P>Reliance on imported oil has been substantially reduced from almost 75 per cent of energy requirements in 1979 to less than 50 per cent now.  Homes and industries have been afforded a reliable, efficient, clean and competitive energy option.  Other environmentally damaging energy forms have been displaced.  The rate at which royalties are paid by Marathon is determined by longstanding contractual agreements with the company.  In my view the applicable ratio of royalties is fair and reasonable having regard to the necessary investment incurred in developing the Kinsale field and in production, processing and transport of the gas and also to the wider economic and social benefits that Kinsale Gas have bestowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20, 28, 38 and 41 together. I assume that Deputy Browne's question relates also to the Ireland-UK gas interconnector. Planning for this gas interconnector is now at an advanced stage. There are various aspects of the project that are scheduled for execution at different times throughout the period up to the target completion date in October 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pipeline route has now been decided and will run from north County Dublin to Moffat in southern Scotland. Negotiations for a supply of gas are ongoing and engineering design is now well under way.  I expect to put the project before the Government for final approval <Col N="671" /> soon so that the major procurement and construction contracts can be placed. Construction should commence in March 1993.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that the pipeline will effectively be owned and operated by Bord Gáis Éireann.  Initial imports will be used for electricity generation, but as indigenous reserves are depleted, increasing amounts will go to BGÉ's other markets.</P>
    <P>Pipeline capacity is a function of both pipeline diameter and the compression installed.  It will be possible to increase capacity as this is required by the installation of additional compression after the pipeline has been laid.</P>
    <P>The project has been chosen by the European Commission for support through its REGEN initiative under which 300 million ECU have been allocated to assist five energy related projects in the European Community.  A formal application to Brussels for assistance has been made but the amount of the allocation to the Irish project will not be known for some time.</P>
    <P>Electricity interconnections are also being examined.  The question of restoring the link with Northern Ireland is under constant review.  Discussions are taking place between the ESB and the National Grid Company in the UK about the possibility of electricity interconnection with the UK sometime in the future.</P>
    <P>However, the first priority of the Government at this time is to have a gas interconnector to the UK in place, which will allow us to tie in to the European gas grid in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>Any decision by Ireland to take specific initiatives would be counterproductive and would lead to duplication of effort and interorganisational conflict. Furthermore, the destruction of tropical forests is a complex issue and timber imports are only an element of the problem.

      <P>I should like the Minister to consider two actions in relation to the problem such is the possibility of devastating consequences on the environment. At national level, would the Minister accept that there has been a 65 per cent increase in the consumption of tropical hardwoods during the past decade, and would he examine the use of alternatives to tropical hardwoods, such as native hardwoods or non-toxic pressure-treated softwoods?  I accept, of course, that Ireland is not going to change the world, but we do have a voice.  At international level, would the Minister pursue a proposal made a few years ago involving the imposition of a levy on imports of tropical hardwoods and the use of that levy for the better conservation of tropical rain forests in producer countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two proposals, one at national level and the other at international level.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the extensive afforestation programme which the Government have undertaken and which is achieving outstanding success resulting in a dramatic increase in the acreage under forestry each year.  It is my intention to increase the percentage of hardwoods that are being planted here annually.  The figure was very low.  I have given the industry and Coillte Teoranta a target of achieving 10 per cent of forested areas in hardwoods as distinct from softwoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of development in improving the quality of our softwoods and there is a huge increase in the sale of Irish manufactured timber products now. It is particularly noticeable in the building industry.  Up to ten or 15 years ago a very small percentage of home produced timber was used in the construction industry.  That has changed completely because of an improvement in techniques and treatment and because of the way in which the industry has developed.  Irish timber has become much more competitive and it is displacing large volumes of imported timber.  I hope we will soon be net exporters of timber.  We are trying to make our contribution to finding a solution to the problem of deforestation <Col N="675" /> in the rain forests.  This week, at a meeting of the International Tropical Timber Organisation, an Irish project proposal, which was submitted with my support, involving the examination of the merits of planting good quality hardwoods in the tropics on appropriate land, together with a means to attract necessary funding, is under discussion.  Our officials are out there actively working to try to find solutions.</P>

      <P>The ESB have installed extensive and scientifically based equipment at many locations to monitor Moneypoint emissions.  This process is validated independently.  One of the 14 stations is located in the Burren.  The evidence so far indicates that the impact of Moneypoint emissions on the Burren and the Irish environment generally is negligible.</P>
      <P>The cost to the ESB and to the consumer of providing scrubbers in Moneypoint would be very expensive.  This expense is not immediately necessary to meet our existing obligations under EC law or under the Helsinki Protocol.

      <P>I do not have the name of the body carrying out the validation of the results of the monitoring but I have some information on the EC directives and on the Helsinki Protocol.  Under the EC directive which was adopted in 1988 all sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants in Ireland must be reduced to 120,000 tons by 1993.  However, this directive has now effectively been overtaken by the Government's intention to accede to the Helsinki Protocol on transboundary air pollution.  This Protocol provides for a 30 per cent reduction in the total sulphur dioxide emissions from all sources in each country by 1993, based on 1980 levels.  The amount for the ESB will be 75,000 tons.  The Protocol has been open for signature since 1985 and it has been signed by 21 countries out of 35.  Of the 21 countries which signed five were EC member states.  It is the <Col N="678" /> Government's intention to sign the Protocol. The Government in their environment action programme stated that they will accede to this Protocol.  This implies a limit of 157,000 tons of SO2 from all sources in 1993, both in the industrial sector and the power plants.  Power generation accounts for just less than 50 per cent of existing national emissions with industrial activities contributing to the greater part of the balance.  To ensure that emissions remain below the limit of 157,000 tons and that power generation and industrial sectors contribute towards that end, a mix of the following steps will have to be taken: use of low sulphur coal at Moneypoint and low sulphur fuels at other stations; increased use of natural gas by the ESB, installation of desul-phurisation equipment, if necessary, and action to reduce industrial emissions at source.</P>

      <P>The final report of the independent expert committee on the future uses of Bord na Móna cutaway bogs was presented to me in February of this year. In total there were 53 submissions made to the committee from a wide range of interest groups and individuals.  The report covers a broad range of issues relating to the potential of cutaway bogs and I am having the implications of the various recommendations examined by my Department at present.  I will be bringing a policy paper on the matter before Government in the near future, when the matter of publication will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to acknowledge the importance and significance of this matter for Board na Móna who are starved of capital and for whom the issue of cutaway bogs is vital in the context of providing much needed capital, especially in view of the fact that they have a number of very interesting products which they do not have the capital to develop and market.  In that context in particular and in view of the need for jobs, particularly in that region, will the Minister undertake to deal with this matter expeditiously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that there is a range of options for cutaway bogs, including forestry, agricultural, horticultural and amenity <Col N="681" /> units.  It may be appropriate for parties, other than Board na Móna to pursue these options and this also will be considered by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Among those options, will the Minister consider the possibility of using some of the vast cutaway bog resources from the point of view of organising vegetable co-operatives because of the constantly increasing level of horticultural imports?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Cutaway bogs are now regarded as having a major influence on rivers in their vicinity because although they once acted as a sponge, that no longer applies, with the result that there is a raised water level, especially in the Shannon system.  Will the Minister say whether that has been taken into account in the study, because downstream of these cutaways there has been major damage which is directly related to this phenomenon?</P>

In dealing with the future of cutaway bogs, will he consider the small farmers of County Offaly whose lands adjoin the cutaway <Col N="682" /> bogs and from whose families Bord na Móna originally acquired them?  In many respects these families have an entitlement to an option on these lands when Board na Móna have completed their work on them.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that huge areas of cutaway bogs have been available over the past number of years at the time when his party, and indeed the previous Government, were in office.  The decision I inherited was to give Coillte Teoranta the first option on carrying out afforestation work on any cutaway bog.  I did not consider that was the best way to tackle the matter and I got the agreement of my colleagues in Government to have the whole issue of the future use of cutaway bogs reviewed.  A group of people who had expert knowledge in the area were asked to examine it and to make recommendations. They did that and produced an excellent report, but I am not in a position today to discuss their recommendations and what was decided.  My duty is, having considered it, to bring it back to my colleagues in Cabinet and I have not yet done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The time constraints on me and the fact that I have decided to break my vow of silence means that at most I can address the House for ten minutes.  I am encouraged to do so because earlier I heard the Minister, and others, express their satisfaction and optimism that, in the matter of the humanities, the new proposal would cater adequately for what we all desire.  It is appropriate that we should on occasions like this present ourselves with the question, what is education, and, having endeavoured to get the answer, to ask, what is the modern perception of it?</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, as I see it in the times in which we live it is no longer accepted as the pursuit of a healthy mind and body. That definition will be given but the practitioners of education do not seem to honour what they say.  One could demonstrate that what is education is today equated with technology, capitalism and jobs.  If that is so the sooner we change it the better because it is not about those. People talk about the need to make education relevant and then try to establish that education is about jobs but it is not. When they proceed to try to establish that there is not any room for the humanities that is when they convolute themselves and do a disservice to education.</P>
      <P>On study we will find that the only form of education that is eternally relevant is to be found in the humanities &mdash; the pursuit or exercise of the mind and body into how best we can fulfil our position in the short journey we have through this life.  People may say that Deputy Tunney is being over-idealistic but I am not.  If it is not that and if we take that away what will people have to live for and what will we put in its place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Man, as we know, is an extraordinary creature.  Man has changed dramatically his environs and everything around them. He has developed his mind to the point where, technologically speaking, he can perform miracles but, on the other hand man today is as feeble as he was in the time of Aristotle, Plato or Seneca.  If one reads any of those great philosophers one will find that what they said then is as applicable to the times in which we live <Col N="697" /> because whatever is that undiscovered formula for how we should behave and get whatever enjoyment and satisfaction that is lasting in this life it has escaped man to date.  My word of warning is that whatever is in it is in the retention of the idealistic definition of education.</P>
    <P>Education, as I said today, is the new capitalism &mdash; if I have it, I will charge plenty for it.  Most of our people are endowed with the same intellect and capacity but, because of an unfortunate selectivity which obtains, only a few get by having obtained what is called an educational qualification at the expense and exclusion of others.  I tell my sons and daughters and every student in university today that he or she would not be there except for the fact that there are people in the community who are prepared to pay nine-tenths of what it costs to keep them there and that if they had any sense of fair play and justice they would return to those people some form of gratitude. What do they do having got this qualification at the expense of others?  They proceed to impose on those people oft times charges which they are not able to pay.</P>
    <P>Earlier we dealt with a Bill dealing with matters of health.  That debate centred on the consultants, great people, who would not be there except for the fact that the rest of the community were prepared to pay for their education.  We find that they will withhold the service they could give if the person is not in a position to pay for it.  If that is education then the sooner we jettison it the better because it is not education.  Again, I am heartened by the fact that the Minister has taken the attitude that the humanities are eternally relevant.  The only hope for man today lies in the pursuit or exercise of the mind and the body to the state where one can be at peace with what one has; if it is adversity that one will understand adversity and live with it in the understanding and contemplation that adversity is not eternal and that the light will follow the darkness.  If we take education as the preparation of someone in some specialised area of technology we are doing to him or her a grave disservice <Col N="698" /> and, more especially, to that great discipline called education.</P>
    <P>I regret that because of the time constraints on me I cannot elaborate but I would like to make one further point.  I agree with everything Deputy Kemmy, a man for whom I have great admiration, said except in one instance.  He talked about the extension of Seanad representation to the new university as if that would be worthwhile and justifiable. I have to disagree with him, especially in the matter of his proven interest in what is called socialism and justice.  I want no representation for third level in the Seanad.  They are well able to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>Why should I as a graduate of UCD at election time have one vote for the Dáil and another for somebody to represent me in the Seanad when simultaneously that huge body of people which made the education possible &mdash; I am talking about the unemployed, the people who never went beyond primary certificate, intermediate certificate or leaving certificate, who have as much intelligence and as high an IQ as I have and whose needs are greater than mine &mdash; do not have the right to have their representative in the Seanad?  I have made this point before and I will continue to advocate it.  The Seanad is supposed to represent vocational interests so what justification is there in the wide earthly world for giving the university graduates, people who are well able to articulate their ideas and lobby and press for what they want, a seat in the Seanad merely because of the fact that they are graduates, people who owe so much to the community already?  Why should we give them an additional favour while at the same time excluding the babble, the inarticulate lobby of the unemployed and those who have hitherto been excluded because they are poor materially, but not intellectually?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the debate on the present legislation is not the time to seek to debate what education is about. However, let us avail of this opportunity to sound a word of warning &mdash; if we are <Col N="699" /> to continue accepting what is presented to us as education, we are accepting a system, especially at university level, where everything is satisfactory for the people in the institution, the people who are of the gravy train but who, I think, have not fulfilled their obligations.  They have missed identifying and articulating what education is and how it affects our lives.  It is the ingredient without which life is the poorer for all those we presume to serve.</P>
    <P>Although it is a small audience I enjoy I am happy that in the course of my short contribution nobody has attempted to interrupt me or to take issue with me. That may be, a Cheann Comhairle, that they appreciate the rules of the House and know that interruptions are out of order, but I am presumptuous enough to hope that there is an acceptance of the fact that the time has come to say that grave injustices have taken place under what people for their own purposes call education.  Licence is given to the people who have it because they can quote it and because they can make the so-called uneducated feel inferior.  I see evidence around me of real education but there is greater evidence of it among the so-called uneducated because these are the people who apply themselves day in and day out to the improvement of their neighbours welfare.  The so-called uneducated, too, are the ones who practice unselfishness and, for example, take young boys and girls out in the pursuit of physical education. The so-called uneducated also are the prime movers in all worthwhile community work.  I am afraid I detect a very definite absence of the so-called educated, the academic and professional people doing anything other than what he or she is paid for.  If that is what education is, it is time it were changed.</P>
    <P>Our very special Minister has demonstrated to date that in the matter of all aspects of education her view is based on education and not necessarily on imitating other people.  That is why I am heartened by the Minister singling out in her introductory speech that in the new <Col N="700" /> University of Limerick there will be regard for real education.</P>
    <P>My final point, and I do not like naming any one here, is that while my good colleague, Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, could quote Dr. Edward Walsh's statement, from what I know Dr. Walsh probably made the statement in the light of the prevailing times in education and because, if he was going to stay in the race, he could not hope to enjoy the necessary funding.  One may ask if he has changed his mind since then.  I have not read that he has said so but from what I know and my acceptance of him as a real educationalist, if the responsibility is put on him and if he is reminded, as the Minister has reminded us that in the new University of Limerick real education is to be foremost and everything else is to be a subsidiary consideration, it will be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as I believe it represents a major step forward in meeting the needs of third level education.  With the merger of Thomond College with the University of Limerick, we will have a stronger and more vibrant third level sector in the south west.  Therefore I welcome with much enthusiasm the conferring of university status on Thomond College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure we will all agree that the people of Limerick and the surrounding areas have campaigned long and hard for a university in their city.  They have succeeded and must be congratulated on that.  They will welcome wholeheartedly this proposal.  It is an important step in third level education not only in Limerick but nationally.  Both colleges are on the same campus and it is logical both educationally and otherwise that they would have the same status.  I hope that the Minister's interests in promoting the status of the colleges in the south west will extend to my own county where we are campaigning vigorously and with much endeavour for a third level institution that will specialise in rural development. I am hopeful that when the Minister has Limerick sorted out she will turn her attention to Thurles and give us the go <Col N="701" /> ahead for a rural and business development institute.  We believe that the Minister is with us and we hope that the resources will be available so that the Minister can give us the important word to go ahead.  I can assure the Minister that if she gives us the go ahead for a rural and business institute in Thurles she will one day find herself conferring the status of a university on it.</P>
    <P>Thomond College is now being amalgamated with the University of Limerick and is worthy of much admiration and congratulation.  Limerick University developed in the seventies.  During its growth the university has evolved as a technology base while combining, perhaps to a lesser degree, the humanities. It comprises three colleges, business, engineering and science, and the humanities. Its programmes of teaching and research are designed to meet the demands of graduates and postgraduates, providing expertise that is needed for Ireland's economic and social development within the European Community. Programmes are studied to degree, master, doctorate and post-doctorate levels and they are orientated to the needs of business, industry and the professions.  It is now Ireland's leading centre for engineering and business studies and it is continuing a 20-year programme of development.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick introduced the concept of co-operative education in Ireland.  This concept was first developed in the United States in 1906 and it involves the placement of students in employment in areas relevant to their academic interests as an integral part of their educational programme.  Classroom theory and laboratory practice are thus integrated in real working conditions. Co-operative education is based on the principle that well educated, mature individuals will develop more effectively through an educational experience which at periods places them outside their university environment.  At Limerick the curriculum offers an opportunity for placement for nine to 12 months.  This is a welcome innovation in university life. For too long universities were places <Col N="702" /> where we spent time in classrooms and there was little or no work practice.  That is what many of us experienced in the old system.  Students who emerge today have confidence gained from practical experience in the workplace.  Through the existing programmes in Limerick University an established network of employers has become involved in the educational process and they have an opportunity to work with groups of undergraduates and to interact with faculty members.  Many graduates, as a result of the mingling of theory and work practice, seek careers in industry and commerce and many start their own businesses.</P>
    <P>The progress and achievements of Limerick University can be seen each month in a document which they circulate. Every month there is an innovation and much of the credit must go to Dr. Walsh, whom I greatly admire as an innovator and a creator.  The March document refers to a new £14 million research and cultural initiative and it states that post-graduate education and research capabilities will be increased threefold with the provision of a new 10,000 square metre facility on which work is to start this year.  Funds are being raised by the University of Limerick Foundation.  That is real initiative and enterprise.  Another document refers to EC funding for ceramic research and the establishment of new law scholarships. These are all creative initiatives.  Another document announces the introduction of a university-industry partnership.  It is an exciting time for Limerick University, which is availing of every opportunity to meet the challenges of the future and to march ahead.</P>
    <P>Into this rich pasture, Thomond will bring its own strengths and achievements. In 1973 it opened its doors to the National College of Physical Education. Hitherto students had the choice of two female colleges in Dublin and male students had to resort to Britain.  Its inception filled a vacuum that urgently needed attention and since 1973 it has produced excellent graduates, not only in the sport <Col N="703" /> and leisure area but also in the humanities. It is a pity that past graduates did not attend a college of university status.</P>
    <P>The merger, as provided, will contribute greatly to the advancement of the University of Limerick, and Thomond will bring to the university a valuable expertise in teacher education.  They have trained teachers to the highest possible standards and therefore it is important that this work will continue and remain intact in the new institutional development.  I am hopeful, and I consider it most important, that this new institution will not only provide for the training and education of teachers but that they will also provide for in-service education and training, and for research in different areas related to the college.</P>
    <P>The motto of Thomond College, &ldquo;The Best in the World&rdquo;, must continue.  I compliment the college on ensuring that their graduates are not only qualified in the physical education area but also in various subjects such as Irish, English and any of the arts.  This has helped graduates to play an even greater role in the entire school curriculum.  It is good for students to be able to change from games and exercise, etc. to studying Irish, French or English with the PE teacher. That is a healthy combination and can lead to more effective and worthwhile communication in the relationship between teachers and students.</P>
    <P>I regret, however, that many of the graduates are unable to utilise fully their expertise due to a shortage of resources and facilities in our schools.  It is a contradiction in our education system that we produce graduates of such high expertise and then find that this expertise cannot be utilised due to the shortage of facilities.</P>
    <P>I accept that we live in times of scarcity but nevertheless I believe it to be far more prudent to provide the facilities that we spent money on educating our graduates to use.  Many PE teachers are frustrated because they cannot implement and utilise their training and expertise in our schools.</P>
    <P>I consider it an enormous lack in our <Col N="704" /> primary schools and national schools that they are unable to avail of PE teachers. Children at this age are so enthusiastic about sport and training.  It is regrettable that we cannot have qualified PE teachers, even on a shared basis, in our national and primary schools.  I hope some improvement can be made, but I must congratulate the teachers in our schools, who do a fantastic job in this regard, without the adequate training or facilities.</P>
    <P>National school teachers give our children a good attitude to sports.  Many of them organise matches and make transport arrangements etc. outside school hours and at weekends.  Their contribution must be acknowledged.  Without it I doubt if sport would be such a valuable asset in our lifestyle.  We develop in our children at a tender age a real love of sport.  The method by which this is done in our national schools is a healthy one and children develop an enormous love for our native and other games.</P>
    <P>It is right to congratulate the GAA on the role they play in this regard.  Representatives of the GAA go to schools once a week to give the children skills in the games, and this, in turn, gives the children great enthusiasm for the games. Although we cannot provide qualified PE teachers in our schools nationally, we are lucky that this job is being well done by the teachers and by the GAA.</P>
    <P>Thomond College's outstanding feature is its standard in the training of specialist post-primary teachers.  It is important that all the elements of this teacher training be maintained in the new university.  In Thomond there is a well structured training regime.  Teacher graduates, with a high level of knowledge of their subjects, are noted for their confidence and eagerness to face their lifetime profession.  Thomond has in place the basic structure for training any teacher, and Limerick University will benefit from this.  It would be madness to allow any of the present standards or methods to be undermined by this amalgamation. We cannot afford to train our teachers badly because on their shoulders <Col N="705" /> rests the responsibility for future generations. Money invested in education is a sound investment for the future.</P>
    <P>This merger will result in greater emphasis on the humanities in the new University of Limerick and this will benefit students of all the sciences.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill contains a section relating to the preservation and promotion of Irish language and culture.  I enthusiastically support this section and I agree with my colleague, Deputy Higgins, who believes that the promotion of Irish culture and language should be a clear role for this new university.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will result in more places and easier access to third level education.  Our enthusiasm and our hope for the new University of Limerick will be diminished if there are not more places and better access.  Many of the students who are about to sit their leaving certificate next week have to worry not only about achieving the academic standard but about whether they can afford to go to third level education.  Unfortunately it is at this point that their hopes and dreams might fade.  Too few of our students are eligible for the higher education grant.  Out of 37,500 students almost 24,000 receive no grant aid whatsoever; 10,000 receive a full higher education grant and 3,500 receive a partial grant. That still leaves 24,000 students with no grant for maintenance or fees.  It would be a pity if any of our universities could not have the students who are most suitable to that type of education merely because they cannot afford to go.  Something will have to be done as a matter of urgency to rectify the injustices of the higher education grants system.  As a start we will have to accept that the income thresholds are far too low.</P>

      <P>I have to differ with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Elections to the Seanad are far less relevant than access to the new University of Limerick. I am deeply interested in this university which is in the county next to mine.  I am interested in having as many good, qualified graduates as we can, but we certainly will not have them unless we provide the opportunities and, most important, the State support to help those who cannot, under the present system, receive higher education grants.  It is demoralising to meet students who attained the academic standards but who are unable to accept their place in the HEA colleges for lack of finance.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  It is really not in order to pursue that matter.  Again, one would defend the situation in regard to university representation in the Seanad in so far as Limerick is now a university.  A case could be made there but it was not made at any great length.  However, on Second Stage we aim at criticising or commending what is in the Bill or what could be in it.  Surely the Deputy could not argue that provision can be made in this legislation to extend university entrance which is governed by a matter that is not provided for in this legislation.  A passing reference is in order but not development of the point because it is really not relevant to this legislation.</P>

If the students who are most suited to the course cannot gain entry to our new university in Limerick or any other university, then we will not achieve what we expect from our third level education colleges.</P>

    <P>I still think it is prudent to urge the Minister to reconsider the higher education grant system as it stands.

      <P>In conclusion, I wish to compliment the National Council for Education Awards on the development of Thomond College to the level it is at today.  This Bill is an acknowledgement of the excellent standards achieved and I wish the college continued success in its merger with the University of Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The Minister has outlined the purpose of the Bill: first, to dissolve Thomond College, <Col N="708" /> second, to transfer the teacher training function from the college to the university and, third, to transfer the staff, the property rights and liabilities of the college to the university.</P>
      <P>It must always be a sad occasion when a Bill is brought in to dissolve an institution, even though it is an institution which has a very short history in comparison with other academic institutions in the country.  I compliment the staff of Thomond College, particularly Mr. Jim Christian of the senior staff who set up the college and administered it in the first instance.  More recent staff have arrived who have no less a commitment to the college than their predecessors had.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the college cannot remain as a separate institution, but I agree with the Minister.  The enrolment is such now that it has gone from a maximum of about 1,100 down to something in excess of 300.  I understand the Minister keeps the figures.  When we project the requirements of PE teachers, metalwork teachers, woodwork teachers and rural science teachers it is no longer viable to have a separate college of education in Limerick simply involved in the education and training of teachers in this category.</P>
      <P>At a time when the institution has declining numbers it is fortunate to be sharing a campus with the University of Limerick.  It is appropriate that the dissolution enables the Minister to merge the college with the University of Limerick, an institution which has not a very long track record in contrast with other academic institutions but has a very good track record indeed and has already established an excellent reputation not only nationally but internationally.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister.  On the day she brought in the Bill to give university status to the then National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick I proposed that she would merge Thomond College with the University of Limerick and she said on that occasion go mbeadh lá eile aici.  Tá an lá eile tagtha anois agus ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): &mdash;&mdash;mar do chomhlíon sí an gheallúint a thug sí ar an lá sin.  When the smaller institution is merging with the larger one I hope the interests of both students and staff will be taken fully into account.  There is always certain anxiety, not on the part of the students, because they come and they go when they qualify, but on the part of people with a long term commitment to Thomond College whose teaching careers are totally committed to that college. I hope their careers will not be upset in any way by the merger with the university, that full consideration will be given to the existing rights and conditions of the staff, and that their future careers will be enhanced rather than inhibited by the merger of the two institutions.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the students who are graduating this year would like very much to graduate with degrees from the University of Limerick. I presume the Bill will be passed through the Seanad and signed by the President in time to allow the university to graduate this year's crop of Thomond College graduates with University of Limerick degrees rather than the degrees they would be in receipt of if this Bill did not go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister also to take an interest in the future of a certain category of students there.  She is very well aware that as the number of trainee teachers declined Thomond College was looking around to see what other appropriate functions it could perform.  It started a diploma in equestrian studies. The Minister has been silent on the future of the equestrian studies course.  Can this be incorporated into the University of Limerick and at some stage achieve full degree status?  When the NIHE was first set up it had a dual qualification system whereby people in the first instance could get diplomas and other students could get degrees.  Now it deals only in degrees. What will be the position of the course in equestrian studies now the college is to merge with the University of Limerick? <Col N="710" /> It is a very valid course with our strong reputation all over the world for being a great source of horseflesh.  Young people who are interested in equestrian studies should be accommodated.  Even though they are a very small group, when the merger takes place their rights and the status of the course should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is fortunate the college is merging with the University of Limerick because that is a very forward looking institution. I would like to compliment the president of that institution, Dr. Edward Walsh, who has been such a far-seeing educationalist. What he did in the early years was innovative in this country.  It is no longer so innovative because the other institutions, colleges and universities are taking many of the new ideas on board. It is no longer the unique institution it was in the seventies, not because it has diverged from its unique path but because some of the traditional universities have come on line as well.  I suppose one of its unique ventures was its scheme in co-operative education where students on four-year degree courses spent two periods of six months at intervals in appropriate work experience either nationally or internationally.  This has been a great innovation and the record of students in getting jobs subsequently underlines the merits of this form of education where one can move easily from the academic halls to the world of work.</P>
    <P>The college is strong as a college of business and of engineering and science but it also has a significant humanities faculty where a degree in European studies is granted to graduates who complete that course.  I think some of the physical education student teachers would be appropriately integrated here.  Of course, those involved in metalwork and woodwork will fit easily enough into the general scope of the engineering schools within the university.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to pay particular attention in the future to teacher training.  The four elected Members in the House at the moment have teaching <Col N="711" /> backgrounds.  I was in St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, and subsequently took the Higher Diploma in Education in UCD and I have seen the two sides of it but it has changed dramatically since my time.  There is now and will be for the foreseeable future a lesser number of teachers required than there used to be.  Birth rates have fallen and that already has made its impact felt very much in the primary teaching colleges, and we can see how the numbers have declined in Thomond College.  It is appropriate at a very early stage to focus on the quality of the teaching force which is now in the schools.  Whatever we say about laboratories, facilities or plant and machinery, when you come to education the quality of education depends on the quality of the teaching staff.  It will not be possible to maintain the very high quality we have had in schools if the staff are progressively getting older, becoming burned out, undergoing all the stress we know about in teaching, and if there is not a blend of younger teachers coming on stream.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to examine how, with declining birth rates she can ensure that the flow of new blood still comes from the colleges of education and the universities into our schools at all levels.  She must consider how she can on the one hand absorb teachers on the panel and at the same time make openings for new teachers.  I think the answer is self-evident.  There has to be a major early retirement scheme for the teaching profession in both primary and secondary schools for two reasons: first, in the interests of those teachers who are totally overstressed and on the fringe of burnout at present in our schools and colleges; this is not only in the interests of the teachers and their profession but in the interests of the pupils who sit in front of them day after day.  Second, the opportunities have to be made for the young teachers who come through.  Let us look at the young student teachers in the training colleges, Mary Immaculate College &mdash; Carysfort no longer &mdash; St. Patrick's, Drumcondra or Thomond College or any <Col N="712" /> of the colleges of education, and at the Higher Diploma in Education courses in the universities.  It is feasible no longer to tell young people at 19 or 20 years of age that they are going to be trained only for a career which will allow them to spend 40 years in a classroom.  That day is gone.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to initiate discussions with the authorities in the training colleges and those in charge of the higher diploma in education courses to see if it is possible to organise a course in, for example, Thomond College or Mary Immaculate College, where pedagogics would be one very strong element, but the qualification would not be solely directed to teaching and the other parts of the qualification would have a market value independent of teaching.  I cannot see why a person in the new University of Limerick cannot follow a business course and at the same time be qualified in physical education.  They should be able &mdash; to use the American expression &mdash; to major in physical education and have the minor option of pursuing a business degree.  I believe future education will be along those lines.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am a great admirer of the university in my city of Limerick. Deputy Tunney stressed the importance of the humanities.  He was absolutely right.  When unemployment has reached an all time high and the real rate of unemployment is in excess of 30 per cent, if we include those who have emigrated over the past four years, there is a danger that everything will be measured by the yardstick of jobs.  This might reduce the quality of education in our universities.  I should like the humanities school in the University of Limerick to be strengthened and I hope the college will endeavour to do that.  I also hope the inclusion of Thomond College in the university will also strengthen it.</P>
    <P>I want to make a final point on a remark made by Deputy Tunney.  There is no valid reason certain universities should have a vote in Seanad elections while other universities do not.  That is untenable. The Seanad franchise should either be abolished or, alternatively, all third <Col N="713" /> level institutions should be given equal rights.  I recently went to the trouble of looking at the legislation and I understand that one can go forward as a candidate on the university panel even if one does not have a degree.  The disqualification does not rest on the candidate who seeks a seat in the Seanad on the university panel; the disqualification is on the voter.  One must be a graduate of one of our traditional universities before one can vote.  I cannot see any valid reason for ruling out students of the University of Limerick, the new Dublin City University or regional technical colleges from voting in Seanad elections.  This creates a division between students in higher education which is not sustainable in the last ten years of the 20th century.  This anomaly needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I should like to again thank the Minister for introducing this important legislation. I am glad she was able to meet the deadline and bring it in before the summer recess.  I wish the enhanced University of Limerick which will include Thomond College, every success.  I hope it goes from strength to strength.  Even though this is a new college, it is already making its mark.  It is now spoken of internationally in the same breath as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Georgia Tech.  I hope it not only continues to receive that level of approval but that it will have an enhanced humanities school on its campus also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will consolidate the view that non-academic subjects are very important. When I was preparing for this debate, I could not but give myself credit in this regard.  When I gave my pupils their summer tests &mdash; I did this long before it became popular &mdash; I always told <Col N="714" /> them that those who did not end up in the first ten could some day pull up beside me in a Mercedes and offer me a lift while those in the first ten might finish up looking for a lift.  We should never emphasise the importance of academic subjects over practical subjects, especially in this day and age when people have to earn their living in a different way to previous generations.  Before the introduction of free education people who had their leaving certificate were guaranteed a job.  I welcome this Bill which will amalgamate Thomond College and the new University of Limerick.  I believe this move is welcomed by everyone.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the university shall have due regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and culture.  This is an important provision. The promotion of the Irish language and culture should be part and parcel of any third level college, whether in regard to academic or practical subjects.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will give students who are seeking places in third level colleges an opportunity to gain such places and enable them to concentrate more on nonacademic subjects.  As anyone who has taught in a classroom knows, some pupils who are not good at academic subjects have some marvellous hidden talents.  It is great that the Lord has so ordained it that people who are not good at calculating arithmetic can make beautiful things with their hands, paint, etc.  How often have we heard wives complaining that their husbands who have university degrees would wreck the house by hammering a nail in a wall to hang a picture?</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister is waiting to reply to the debate.  I could say a lot more about third level education but because of what has been said by previous speakers, I will conclude and give the Minister an opportunity to reply to the comments made.  I welcome this Bill and I hope it will not be long before the regional college in Carlow is given university status also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank those who contributed to the debate &mdash; Deputy <Col N="715" /> Jim Higgins, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education, Deputy Jim Kemmy from Limerick, the Labour Party spokesperson on Education, Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, The Workers' Party spokesperson on Education, Deputy Jim Tunney who, as usual, spoke with such style, Deputy Therese Ahearn, Fine Gael junior spokesperson on Education, Deputy Michael Noonan, who also comes from Limerick and Deputy John Browne who spoke with his usual wit.  It falls to me to be pedantic and to reply to the nuts and bolts of the points raised. I should again like to thank the seven speakers who contributed to the debate for proving that a debate on education can be most interesting, wide ranging, when it is allowed to be, discursive and enjoyable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins suggested that the academic council should be expanded. The academic council are appointed by the governing body to assist them in running the university, as is the case with all universities.  Therefore, the question of expanding the academic council would be a matter solely for the governing body.  I am sure the governing body will read what was said during the debate and pay attention to the points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputies Kemmy and Higgins referred to the governing body and said that Thomond College should have specific representation on the governing body.  As I said, Thomond College will no longer exist as a legal entity.  Consequently, no provision can be made in a legal document, such as an Act, to provide for its representation on the governing body.  However, the staff of Thomond will become staff of the new merged college. The university staff elect four members to the governing body and that question is decided by the staff.  I hope they will show due sensitivity in the matter.  The Minister of the day can appoint nine members but must look, <i>inter alia,</i> to the extent the staff are represented. There is a certain amount of flexibility between the number which the Minister can appoint and the number which the college can appoint.  I hope <Col N="716" /> regard will be had to the need for representation for Thomond College.  The term of office of the governing body ends in July 1991.  I, or whoever is in office, will consider that matter and it will be considered also by the person nominating the staff representatives.  That would be the correct procedure so that specific exposition is given to the earlier tradition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins, and other Deputies, made reference to section 10.  I should like to thank them for their enthusiasm for it.  Deputy Higgins referred to a drafting problem.  The section will apply to the general functions of the university and not solely to teacher training.  Due regard for the promotion of the Irish language and culture will extend throughout the college.  I can make a ministerial order if I consider it is not being attended to. We will deal with the specified drafting question on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy referred to the archaic terms of officers and servants.  I do not particularly care for that term either but I have been advised by the Attorney General's office that it is legal terminology and must be used.  Under the provisions of the University of Limerick Act, 1989, the Copyright Act of 1963 was extended so that a copy of every book published in Ireland would be deposited in the library. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to enforce the provision and it is up to him to look into that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the word &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo; I said at the start of my contribution that I did not like it but it was the legal one put to us.  Deputies Noonan and Kemmy referred to equestrian studies and I am aware that the university is anxious to introduce a degree course in it as soon as possible, hopefully in 1992.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney questioned the need for Seanad representation and gave a very fine exposition &mdash; as did other Members who spoke &mdash; with regard to the philosophical basis for education and the need to frequently articulate our thoughts on the true meaning of the word education.  He said also that those who have attained the highest level of education have a duty to repay it back to the wider community from whence they <Col N="717" /> came.  In his own inimitable fashion he outlined his thoughts on that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Therese Ahearn referred to the need to consider the rural and business development institute in Thurles and said it was necessary.  She put forward her point of view with regard to her constituency and paid tribute to Dr. Edward Walsh.  I wish to join in that tribute by her, Deputy Higgins and other Members. She referred to the need for more sporting facilities in our primary and second level schools and went on to speak at length on access to third level.  We will not go into that issue in detail now: beidh lá eile againn.  The Deputy referred also to the HEA sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said it was sad that any Bill should seek to merge an institution but he recognised the reality, extended his congratulations and asked that the existing conditions of the staff be examined and that the students leaving in June be graduates of Limerick.  I hope on Committee Stage, and in the Seanad, that that can be accommodated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me the opportunity to raise this matter.  On 3 September 1990 the senior part of Scoil Mhuire, Ballymany &mdash; third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes &mdash; had an enrolment of 545 pupils.  Up to the middle of last year the school had 15 assistant teachers and an application had been made to the Department of Education for the appointment of a sixteenth <Col N="718" /> assistant.  That appointment would have been fully justified on the basis of the numbers enrolled in the school.</P>
      <P>For the previous ten years, the school had operated a programme in which children with special educational needs &mdash; amounting to about 7 per cent of the total enrolment in the school &mdash; spent two years on the sixth class programme in order to prepare them adequately for second level education.  More precisely, the programme focused on the needs of younger children with special educational needs who had completed fifth class.  That group amounted to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of children completing fifth class in the school.  That programme was set up as a response to a request from parents, in conjunction with the staff and management of the school, to serve a very real need in the area.</P>
      <P>Unemployment in the school's catchment area is in the region of 12 per cent. In one part of the catchment area, comprising two housing estates with a total of 388 houses, unemployment runs at 56 per cent.  Social workers in the catchment area, together with local clergy, have noted a marked increase in the number of single parent families, the incidence of marital breakdown, the level of child abuse, alcoholism, gambling and other problems affecting family and community life.  These were among the considerations which led the school to set up the programme which I have described. That special programme was provided only to pupils with a particular educational need and the selection was based solely on educational principles.  It had the complete backing of the second level schools in the town.  Many children who otherwise would have failed, were enabled by the programme to cope with the demands of second level education. The evidence suggests that the programme has been responsible for a significant decrease in dropout numbers at second level.  Having been in operation for ten years, it was regarded by management, staff and parents as an established tradition and an integral part of the school's operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the school authorities made their <Col N="719" /> application for a 16th assistant teacher, the Department of Education, ten years after the programme had been instituted, informed the school that the programme was in breach of Circular 10/67 concerning the retention and promotion of pupils.  This aspect of the matter had, apparently, not occurred to the Department during that period, even though enrolment was rising, additional assistants were being appointed, and the Minister for Education herself had agreed to open a further extension to the school, though in the event other matters prevented her from attending and a senior inspector carried out the function instead.  He brought back to the Minister the good wishes of the parents as well as some messages from them.</P>
    <P>When it came to the request for the appointment of a 16th assistant, the Department quite bluntly said that consideration of that appointment would be deferred until the school &ldquo;regularised&rdquo; itself to conform with the provisions of Circular 10/67.  After ten years of operation of the programme this was, to put it mildly, rather a brutal response from the Department of Education.  The school authorities contested this and had lengthy exchanges of correspondence with the Department.  The Department, however, stuck rigidly to its line and, in the end, the school authorities had no option but to give in to the Department and terminate the programme in order to secure the appointment of the 16th assistant teacher.</P>
    <P>In May 1985, the then Minister for Education announced that the second level programme was being increased to six years.  Against that background, the Scoil Mhuire authorities decided to reexamine the programme.  Separate meetings were held with the management and staff of the second level schools in the town.  Each of those schools requested that Scoil Mhuire continue with the extra year and sent representatives to talk to a general meeting of the parents of pupils in Scoil Mhuire on the definite advantages of the extra year from the point of <Col N="720" /> view of primary and second level education.</P>
    <P>In June 1986, the school authorities submitted a request to the Department of Education to have the school recognised as serving an area of disadvantage. That was followed up by a further request in May 1988, and a further detailed study in 1990.  None of this seemed to have any effect on the Department of Education. I took the matter up with the Minister for Education, but her response was rigid.  By letter of 23 April last, she informed me, in effect, that the agreement of the INTO to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> laid down staffing levels for national schools and precluded the treatment of any individual school on a different basis.  Fine Gael opposed that programme.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position of the school.  If she finds that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the agreement of the INTO thereto constitutes an obstacle to solving the problem of meeting a real educational need she should reconsider her position on the matter of reclassifying the school as one serving a disadvantaged area and put back in place a programme which has been of immense value to the children in the area.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for raising this matter.  Naturally a person who puts forward a case gives his point of view according to his information, and the Deputy has detailed the matter down the years.  I noted with interest that despite the fact that the Minister of the day in 1985 and 1986 was from the Deputy's party there was no movement in that regard.  The Deputy stated that quite clearly.  I acknowledge that they did not see fit to move then and so the position has gone on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two questions here including the question of the extra educational facility which was long established in that school.  As the Deputy put it, this facility served the children well and fitted them out for later education.  At present we provide the longest period of primary <Col N="721" /> schooling in any country in Europe.  The provision of seventh class, or whatever it was called, was a great feature in Ireland. In my time as a teacher many primary schools catered for seventh class because there was great difficulty in getting further education.  With the introduction of free education full seventh classes became the exception rather than the norm.  The circular on retention was then introduced and we all know about that. In the eight years of primary schooling there is provision for retention if one needs it for particular purposes.  By and large the whole question of seventh class has come increasingly under scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I do not decry the very good work that took place under that educational programme.  Nothing is lost in education. The longer a person stays at school the more educated he becomes, but when administering 3,500 primary schools, whether one likes it or not, there has to be a relatively uniform level of application, particularly regarding the number of years.  Otherwise the system would get out of hand.  However, that is not to decry the good work that took place under that programme.</P>
    <P>The second matter under debate is that the school be deemed to be a school in a disadvantaged area.  That is a separate issue and one that can be considered.  The analysis for deciding on schools which are deemed to be schools in disadvantaged areas rests with the management, the parents, the Department and the unions who have drawn up criteria.  That is the only way to proceed.  We also work out a points rating.  This sounds very cut and dried but again it has to be done because the demand is so much greater than the service that can be provided.  Therefore, the only equitable way to proceed is to work along a series of headings.  That is how the posts under this heading were allocated last year.  It is above board and can be scrutinised through the various agencies.  Any Deputy who wishes to discuss this matter with me privately, not about a particular school but about the broad criteria of the headings under which the points rating is made, is welcome to do so.  I do not like to talk about <Col N="722" /> particular schools but it is necessary to explain how one is deemed to be disadvantaged. The various headings are then considered and a points rating is issued.  I will request the committee to consider the position of Scoil Mhuire in Ballymany, Newbridge, under that heading and I will communicate further with the Deputy on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of raising this very serious subject this evening and seeking clarification from the Minister.  The reclassification of all of Counties Cavan and Monaghan to the status of severely handicapped has been the subject of great debate since our entry into the EC.  We have been requesting various Governments to bring about this important development for the farmers in the region but to date we have not been successful.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the only time progress was made in having extensions granted in Cavan and Monaghan since our entry to the EC was when Fine Gael were in Government.  As yet Fianna Fáil have never granted an extension of the severely handicapped areas in Cavan and Monaghan.  The Minister of State is looking at me in amazement, but I know that that is correct.  I should hope that the great injustice done will be put right this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 October 1990 in a Dáil debate on agriculture, the Minister said that on 4 February 1987 a submission from the former Government had been lodged with the Commission proposing reclassification of all disadvantaged areas to more severely handicapped status, the object of that was to secure higher grants and greater benefits for cattle farmers residing outside the more severely handicapped areas.  That application was <Col N="723" /> lodged but was later withdrawn by the incoming Government.  Nothing but confusion has prevailed since.  Various identification exercises and surveys have been carried out, all of them unnecessary. The best information I have to date is that the application in Brussels at present does not seek reclassification for all of the counties of Cavan and Monaghan. There was talk of bringing the figures to about 60 per cent in Cavan and possibly 34 per cent in Monaghan.  However, the neighbouring and more prosperous counties of Longford and Roscommon &mdash; indeed, I congratulate them on being able to achieve it &mdash; have succeeded with applications for 100 per cent reclassification. Farmers in those regions with 200,000 gallon milk quotas are deemed to be severely handicapped while neighbours of mine in County Cavan with milk quotas of 10,000 gallons, and perhaps three, four or five small cattle following, are said by the present Minister for Agriculture to be not severely handicapped. That needs explanation.  It is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Confusion has arisen from the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture and Food recently announcing the extension of the disadvantaged areas, which has no relevance at all to my constituency. We are waiting for the announcement of the reclassification from &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; to &ldquo;severely handicapped&rdquo;.  The Minister says he will not be making that announcement for another month, yet the closing date for applications for headage payments under these schemes is 14 June 1991.  Earlier this year the Minister for Agriculture and Food stated clearly on several occasions that payments would be made in the new areas this year.</P>
    <P>I want clarification on two points.  First, will all of Counties Cavan and Monaghan be classified as severely handicapped?  I want a yes or no answer to that question. Second, will the payments in the new areas to be announced commence this year, and what mechanism does the Minister intend to use to allow farmers to apply after the closing date?  That issue is <Col N="724" /> creating great confusion.  Never was it more important that the benefits available in Brussels be brought to our farmers in the Cavan-Monaghan region.  There is the collapse of farm incomes, which is accepted right across the board, and the more recent news from Brussels of further serious cutbacks.</P>
    <P>I say to people outside of farming that while I am making the case this evening for the farmers, the benefits beyond the farm gate, with extra money available in the economy, will generate a pile of activity.  People in the concrete business, the hardware business and so on will say that activity has noticeably slowed down in their industries because of the fall in farm incomes.  We are not paying out at the maximum level available to be paid from Brussels, but if those payments were made they would have the marvellous effect of generating a new boost and giving a lifeline to farmers, who see the future of farming as being very dismal.  I look forward to the Minister's reply, and I have no doubt that he will clarify the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Boylan for providing the opportunity of dealing with the matter in the short few moments we have available.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for me to go into the history of the application to have additional areas in the country designated as severely handicapped, that has been recorded many times in the House.  The issue was first raised in 1987.  There were difficulties with the original application. Since then the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, has made significant efforts for progression of the application with the Commission in Brussels.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Boylan rightly says, the additional areas to be designated disadvantaged have just been announced. The Deputy, along with all Members in the House, must agree that the extension has been one of the most significant for many a long day.  It will be of immense benefit to farmers within that catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> I can tell Deputy Boylan, too, that the matter of reclassification is at present under consideration by the Commission. I cannot yet anticipate when a decision will be made, but I can say that Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Members from Counties Cavan and Monaghan have been pursuing the matter actively with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, reflecting their particular interest in that constituency.</P>
    <P>I shall now come to the original point on the item for the Adjournment Debate. I am pleased to have this opportunity to explain to farmers in the extended areas how they should go about applying for headage payments this year.</P>
    <P>First, I should explain that the application form which has issued to all herd owners has been redesigned to cover both the severely and less severely handicapped areas.  Farmers in the new and existing areas should now apply and should list on their application forms all the animals on their farms.  When a decision is made by the EC Commission in due course on the areas to be re-classified the Department will arrange to make the appropriate payments to farmers on the basis of the information contained in the forms.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has already announced the new areas which the Commission proposed be added to the existing less-favoured areas and I am confident that a Council decision on this proposal will not be long delayed.  Officials of the Department are vigorously pursuing with the Commission the matter of the reclassification of areas and I am hopeful that the matter will be brought to finality without undue delay.</P>
    <P>I may add that an advertisement will appear in the press in the coming week advising farmers in both the new and existing areas of the procedure for applying for headage payments this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle and yourself for facilitating my raising the matter in the House this evening.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in to listen to what I have to say.  I do have to say that although I argued strongly for the appointment of a Junior Minister to the Department of Justice I did not intend that to mean that the Minister himself would disappear off the Oireachtas face.  I wonder whenever, if ever, the Minister will return to listen to some of the issues raised during the Adjournment Debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I wish to make very succinctly is that the civil legal aid scheme is in a shambles, particularly in Dublin, the area that I am more in touch with and more aware of.  Nothing illustrates that better than the fact that a board appointed to administer the business of legal aid generally can and should consist of 13 members but currently has five members.  That position has arisen because some members simply departed in protest &mdash; one remembers that the chairman, the vice-chairman and others <Col N="727" /> did so last year &mdash; and others then ceasing to hold office by reason of their five year term running out in March of this year. All of that might be very well &mdash; the board is &ldquo;quorate&rdquo;&mdash; but for the fact that under the scheme as it exists there is a positive duty on the Minister to ensure that a sufficient number of experienced members are retained to enable the board to discharge their functions effectively. One vital activity of the board cannot function at all because of the absence of numbers, that is the hearing of appeals against people aggrieved and who have not been granted legal aid in the first instance by a certifying committee of three.</P>
    <P>The problem for those who work in legal aid and are concerned to maintain a national effective system, is that this inexplicable failure by the Minister reflects so poorly on them and on any commitment by Government and the Minister to maintain a national effective system.</P>
    <P>Under section 4.2. of the scheme of civil legal aid an application for aid must be certified by a committee made up of three members of the board.  If an application for civil legal aid is refused the person may, under section 4.7 of the scheme, appeal to an appeals committee, which has to be made up of the chairman and four members of the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>However, persons who were members of a certifying committee may not serve on an appeals committee.  So for the board to function properly and to carry the functions assigned to them there needs to be a minimum of eight members on the board.  This is where the current difficulty arises.  As I understand it, there is now only the chairman and four ordinary members of the board.  In other words, it is impossible to come up with an appeals committee of five members who have not also been members of the certifying committee.</P>
    <P>I understand that many people who have been refused legal aid have appealed and have been waiting since March and earlier to have those appeals <Col N="728" /> determined.  They are still waiting.  I understand also that there are writs in the offing to be launched in the High Court in the very near future to seek to mandate the Minister to fulfil his functions under the scheme and to fulfil his commitments in this area.  This might press home on the Minister of State the urgency of this matter.</P>
    <P>The result is that people who have had their applications for legal aid turned down are being denied the right of appeal provided under the scheme.  This has been the situation since the term of office of several members of the board expired in March last.  My understanding is that these have not since been replaced.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Minister for Justice to ensure that there is the minimum number of board members required is unforgivable, but perhaps not surprising, considering the shoddy and half hearted approach of successive Governments to the civil legal aid system.  Indeed, the situation was so bad that we know several members of the board were forced to resign to highlight the situation.</P>
    <P>The civil legal aid system has been systematically starved of funds and staff working in the centres have been placed under enormous stress.  In Dublin about which I am most informed, there is a two month waiting list for new clients to have an appointment in any of the four centres. From 20 May, I understand that all four centres closed their doors to new applications.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the situation remains so bad that people, and, especially lawyers, are unwilling to serve on the board, although I doubt that this is the situation.  There is simply an obligation on the Minister to fill the positions on the board without further delay.  I would ask the Minister to do that.  It is also time that the membership of the board was extended to include people representing those who have to avail of the services of the legal aid centres.  For instance, legal measures to curb domestic violence are a major part of the work of the legal aid centres.  Why should the <Col N="729" /> Minister not appoint to the board a representative of AIM, or one of the other organisations assisting battered women?</P>
    <P>The failure of the Minister to appoint board members is one of the worst cases of ministerial negligence I have come across in my years in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister and the Minister of State to act to appoint members without further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be here representing the Minister and the Department of Justice.  The Minister for Justice is on Government business at the moment and he asked me to come.  I appreciate the opportunity to represent him and to cut my teeth in this Department. The civil legal aid scheme is not in a shambles and no member of the board was asked or forced to resign.  They did so of their volition some two months ago and the matter will be rectified fairly soon.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, the Legal Aid Board are appointed by the Minister for Justice.  They consist of 13 members, including the chairman.</P>
      <P>The scheme specifies that two of the ordinary members of the Legal Aid Board shall be practising barristers and that two shall be practising solicitors &mdash; each with ten years practising experience. This requirement reflects the fact that certifying committees of the board, which decide on the grant of legal aid, must have regard to the legal merits of applications.</P>
      <P>The term of office of each member of the board cannot exceed a period of five years, though members can be reappointed for a second term.  The scheme provides that the Minister for Justice, in deciding what the term of office of any board member should be and whether he or she should be reappointed, must have regard to a policy of regularly changing board membership.  At the same time, the Minister has to ensure that a sufficient number of experienced board members remain so that they can discharge their functions effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> The composition of the board was designed to ensure a majority of nonlegal members.  Since the establishment of the scheme successive boards have been carefully balanced to meet this objective.  It is usual, also, to appoint civil servants from relevant Government Departments, that is from Justice, Finance and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The position as of now is that the terms of office of all but four members of the former board expired on 23 March 1991. Since that time, the Minister for Justice has made one appointment to the board &mdash; a representative from the Department of Justice.  The board have a sufficient number of lay and legal members at present to conduct their affairs in relation to the administration of the scheme and their principal function of granting legal aid certificates.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious that a high degree of consideration has to go into these appointments.  The new board members will have a particularly onerous task ahead of them now that the service is being expanded to 16 full-time law centres and 25 part-time centres and also in view of other developments which may be in the pipeline in the future.  That is positive proof of the Government's commitment to the consolidation and the expansion of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice indicated in reply to a question yesterday, he hopes to be in a position shortly to announce these appointments.  I wish the new members, whoever they may be, every success on the board.</P>

The agricultural officers attached to the Ballybay office have been working in a corridor which has been a fire escape for years.  I understand that negotiations with the Department have been going on since 1987.  The union and the agricultural officers are anxious to have proper working conditions. Indeed, the officers recently refused to work in these conditions and are working from their homes.  The service they are offering is not as efficient as it could be because of the unavailability of files and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most unbelievable part of the problem is that the Department have been flouting fire regulations for years. This is hardly a respectable practice from a Government Department.  It is illegal and it is dangerous.  The Minister's failure to provide proper office space for these officers has been putting lives at risk for years.  There are about 20 or 25 people <Col N="732" /> working in the office and in the event of a fire breaking out it might be impossible for everyone to get an easy exit from the premises, thus lives would be at risk.  Will the Minister immediately give a commitment to sort out this problem at once?</P>

The Department have arranged as a temporary measure to allow some of the agricultural officers based in the Ballybay office to work from their homes.  As the duties of these staff are primarily on-farm inspections, this arrangement is feasible. Indeed it operates in several other counties.</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann have a statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis.  Accordingly, proposals for the extension of the gas grid are a matter for the board themselves to assess in the light of that obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> I am advised by the board that they are not, at this time, considering a supply for Dungarvan, County Waterford.  The nearest gas supply is 20 miles away, the cost of extending the gas network would be very high and there are no loads <i>en route</i> which would contribute, in any significant way, towards recovering the infrastructural cost.  In these circumstances, the board are satisfied that it would not be economically viable to extend the network to Dungarvan.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the Soviet authorities have completed modifications to the design of some of the RBMK-type reactors and that such modifications are well advanced in all the others.  Operational procedures with regard to these reactors have also been changed and have been put into effect.</P>
      <P>The Soviet authorities have also taken steps to improve the training of operators and the effectiveness of their nuclear regulatory system.  The Nuclear Energy Board consider that these changes will make these reactors more stable, improve the response of their shutdown system and increase their overall reliability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has consistently advocated the acceptance of internationally recognised minimum safety standards by all nuclear power countries, because of the transboundary implications of nuclear <Col N="684" /> accidents.  We have long called for an inspection force within the European Community countries which would be independent of national authorities and would examine all safety aspects of the nuclear industry throughout the European Community.  Western countries should be seen to have exemplary standards of safety in their own nuclear industries, given the increased transparency about the nuclear industry in the USSR and Eastern Europe, which I welcome. Improved co-operation with the West is to be encouraged to solve existing problems.</P>
    <P>At EC level, Ireland has supported the concept that nuclear safety should be an integral part of the economic co-operation agreements between the Community and Central and Eastern European countries.  The agreement with the Soviet Union provides for a series of agreements, one of which is specifically on nuclear safety.  Ireland will also be pressing that the question of nuclear safety be fully addressed within the European Energy Charter, in which Central and Eastern European countries, including the Soviet Union, are expected to participate.</P>
    <P>The Soviet authorities are well aware of our position through their membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency which this September will host an international conference on nuclear safety as a result of an initiative launched by Ireland during our Presidency of the EC.  The agency have also co-operated with the Soviet Union in projects to assess the radiological consequences of the Chernobyl accident, to establish the Chernobyl Centre for International Research and to launch a major international effort concerning the safety of older nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union. Ireland supports all these initiatives.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I should explain to the Deputy that my Department receive each year a significant number of applications for the removal of small amounts of sand from the State foreshore.  The long established procedure in relation to the processing of such applications is that the local authority concerned are asked for their advice and, if there is no objection, such licences are normally issued.  The local authority have, of course, primary responsibility for coast protection and would be aware of local circumstances.  It is not the practice to give public notice regarding such proposals or the issue of such licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> In this particular case, when the application was received, it was referred to Galway County Council in writing and a written response was received indicating no objection to its issue.</P>
    <P>A licence was accordingly issued by my Department to a firm in Carna, County Galway, on 22 March 1991.  This firm was acting on behalf of the Italian State electricity company and their licence permitted the removal of 30 tonnes of sand from the State foreshore adjoining the townland of Errisbeg West, County Galway, i.e. the bed and shore of the sea below the line of high water of ordinary or medium tides.  For the Deputy's information, the University of Turin is associated with this project.</P>
    <P>The licence was subject to the further conditions that it terminates at end-May 1991; the sand was to be removed evenly from the surface so that no holes are left; and removals were to be made by hand shovel only in the area designated by the licence.</P>
