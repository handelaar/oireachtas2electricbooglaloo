      <asker>Mr. J. Higgins</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>whether, further to the recent announcement that the seas of Ireland are now a whale and dolphin sanctuary, he will outline the penalties for failure to comply with this decision; whether other countries have been appraised of the decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalties are contained in the Whale Fisheries Act, 1937, which provides that if any ship is used for the taking or treating of whales, within the exclusive fishery limits of the State, the master of such ship shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or, at the discretion of the court, either to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and imprisonment.  Any Irish registered ship caught contravening the provisions of the Act can be seized and detained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 January 1977 the exclusive fishery limits have been extended to 200 nautical miles under the Maritime Jurisdiction (Exclusive Fishery Limits) Order, 1976, (S. I. No. 320 of 1976).  The provisions of the Whale Fisheries Act, 1937, cover Baleen Whales and by S.I. Nos. 158 of 1937 and 240 of 1982, these provisions <Col N="2067" /> were extended to cover all whale species including dolphins and porpoises.</P>
    <P>The fishery protection service and Navy will, as part of their normal duties, ensure that the provisions of the sanctuary are upheld.  The International Whaling Commission have been notified of the declaration.  This is the appropriate means of communication to all other countries which are party to the International Whaling Convention.  This, of course, includes the major whaling nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Will he acknowledge that, in view of the fact that we are a maritime country with a long and proud seafaring tradition and the only truly insular country within the EC, we should have a national maritime museum?  Will the Taoiseach give active consideration to this?</P>

      <P>First, it would be appropriate to welcome the fact that the first strand of talks are now under way in Northern Ireland.  This is a historic occasion and I wish them well.  Will the Taoiseach indicate, in line with a commitment he gave in the House previously that he will consider ways of consulting the parties in Opposition in Dáil Éireann on developments in Northern Ireland, if he has decided yet in what why such consultations could take place?  Will he take an early opportunity to meet the leaders of the parties in Opposition in the Dáil to brief them on developments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be considered to be so but I asked about the meeting the Taoiseach had with the <Col N="2069" /> SDLP, a political party in Northern Ireland.  I am simply asking if the Taoiseach would be prepared to extend the same courtesy to the parties in Dáil Éireann on the issue of talks in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about the use of the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;, but it is my intention to keep Dáil Éireann fully informed as it is appropriate to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point with regard to consultation, but would the Taoiseach not consider it important to have at least the leaders of the parties in Opposition briefed on a regular basis with regard to developments of the talks, particularly as they approach the commencement of the second strand of talks which involve the Republic of Ireland?</P>

      <P>The next meeting of the European Council will be held in Luxembourg on 28 and 29 June.  Bearing in mind the conclusions of the Rome meeting in December last it can be expected that the major part of the discussions at the Luxembourg meeting will be devoted to progress with the internal market and to the Inter-governmental Conferences on Political Union and Economic and Monetary Union.  Beyond this, and in accordance with established practice, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in advance on what other issues may be discussed at this meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach raise the issue of the plight of Irish agriculture <Col N="2070" /> at the summit meeting in view of the fact that it is quite likely that discussions on the reform of the common agricultural policy and the negotiations on GATT might well have concluded by the time the next meeting takes place in December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, it is likely that other issues will be raised.  It is possible that the GATT negotiations will be discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach specifically whether he will raise the issue of the plight of agriculture in this country if the proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are as dramatic and as drastic as we are led to believe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I cannot decide on the agenda of a Council meeting. That is a matter for the Presidency. However, on previous occasions GATT negotiations have been discussed and that presents an opportunity for any member state to voice any concerns they may have about the outcome of the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that the President determines the agenda.  Is he therefore saying that he has no opportunity to seek to have matters placed on the agenda?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The agenda has already been decided by the Presidency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the heavy dependance of the Irish economy on agriculture and food, did the Taoiseach seek to have the future of the Common Agricultural Policy placed on the agenda, and, if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be very appropriate to have the matter placed formally on the agenda.  As I have <Col N="2071" /> said, it is likely that the GATT negotiations will be discussed, though there is no particular movement in regard to the GATT negotiations at the moment, so any discussions of that kind would be a little premature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate because the Presidency has already decided on the major matters to be discussed at the formal Council meeting, general agreement that discussions should be confined to those matters.  It is not possible to have every subject discussed at the formal council meeting, although, as I have already indicated, it is not unlikely that the GATT negotiations will come up during the course of the meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach whether there is anything on the agenda pertaining to education.  This country has become the provider of top-quality university graduates to other EC countries. Is there any way of pointing out the considerable financial cost and drain to the Exchequer and seeking a reciprocal arrangement to enable additional financing for such third-level activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the European Council would not be an appropriate forum to do that.  There are other Council meetings at which matters of that kind may be raised.  The Deputy will understand that the European Council meeting takes place over a very short amount of time and the agenda is tightly controlled and managed.  It is not possible for member states to raise all of the various issues that affect them.  As I said, the agenda is decided by the Presidency in accordance with the general view of member states as to what are the urgent matters that need to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that if the Constitution were being drafted today, as distinct from 1936, the Islamic community and the Islamic religion would be recognised and referred to in the same way as other denominations are referred to?  Having regard to that, does the Taoiseach not think, in view of the fact that many Irish citizens now belong to that religious denomination, that the Islamic community are entitled to the same kind of official recognition enjoyed on such official occasions by other denominations that are perhaps smaller in number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Constitution were being redrafted now perhaps it would not contain reference to any church.  I should like to say that members of the Islamic community would be very warmly welcome at National Commemoration Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that this issue was raised on a separate occasion &mdash; that of the inauguration of the President &mdash; that the official National Commemoration Day accords a formal platform for representatives of different religious denominations recognised in the Republic, that the Islamic community now number more than 5,000 members, that they can no longer be ignored, and that they are as much entitled to official representation at such ceremonies as others whose numbers are much fewer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy when he suggests that National Commemoration Day is a platform. National Commemoration Day was brought forward for a very specific purpose. The Deputy will recall that it took a fair amount of discussion and co-operation among the parties in the House to decide on its format.  However, efforts to have the day initiated were successful and the ceremony has been very well supported and widely appreciated by both the participants and the general public.  Its success is one of the important improvements in the general approach to <Col N="2074" /> such matters in this country.  There is no question of anybody being excluded.  It is just that for the particular purpose of commemorating all Irish men and women who died in all wars the ceremony was constituted and the particular religious churches involved participate in it.  By the very nature of the ceremony it is not exclusive in the way that the Deputy suggests.  I would put the ceremony in a completely different category from that of the inauguration of the President, and different considerations would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that while representatives of the Methodist Church, the Unitarian Church, the Baptist Church, the Jewish community and the Church of Ireland are entitled to official invitations and representations on such occasions, a religious representative of the Islamic community is not so entitled and will never be invited to such an occasion?  Is that the correct interpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>No, the Deputy need not take anything of that sort from my reply.  It is a little invidious to start naming individual churches.  Some of the churches named by the Deputy do not participate.  It is a matter of religious leaders giving a blessing.  It is not a question of conferring honours on anybody or anything of that kind.  We are all aware of ceremonies of different kinds that take place throughout the country and at which the constitution of the religious group performing the ceremony varies from time to time and from locality to locality.  National Commemoration Day was constituted in this way because of the events commemorated by the day.  I do not see any exclusion or attitude of exclusion towards any particular religious body.</P>

For my own part, in relation to the National Commemoration Day, I find it ironic that religious institutions bless the wars and then pray for the victims, but that is a separate issue.</P>

      <P>Official estimates of the number of jobs sustained by tourism are prepared annually, as soon as final figures for tourism performance and the annual balance of payments are available from the Central Statistics Office It is, therefore, too early to provide an outline of the number of jobs created to date in the tourism area in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The targets for tourism set in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for the five year period 1988 to 1992 include the creation of 25,000 new jobs.  At the end <Col N="2076" /> of 1990, estimates for employment sustained by tourism activity stood at 80,000 jobs, up over 16,000 on the 1987 figure. The target for tourism employment in 1991 is 85,000.</P>

I asked how many jobs were created last year and the Minister bulked the figure with the total amount of jobs at 80,000 in 1990.  Of the 25,000 jobs per year, how many were created last year?  Surely the Minister must have some estimate, given that he made a speech only last week saying that 15,000 jobs would be created this year.  We are nearly half way into this year and surely we must have some estimate.</P>

All the informal estimates from the industry are that we are on target for 5,000 additional jobs in the tourism industry by the end of 1991.  That is the best I can do.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2079" /> Government policy in relation to the establishment of an independent television service is set out in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, as expanded by section 6 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990. There has been no change in that policy.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that negotiations are continuing between the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the promoters of TV3 regarding the terms and conditions of the contract to be concluded between the parties.  I welcome the statements in recent days that the prospects of a contract being concluded quickly are now regarded as good and that in such circumstances the promoters of TV3 hope to be able to begin their service before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I have seen the report referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan.  It is a welcome contribution to the debate on the Irish broadcasting environment and its conclusions and recommendations will be taken into consideration as part of the ongoing review of the effectiveness of broadcasting legislation in achieving Government policy in this area.  I can assure Deputy O'Sullivan that I have no plans to privatise Network 2 or any other element of RTÉ's broadcasting services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to statements in recent days which he has welcomed.  Would he agree that many of these statements have been conflicting statements and that obviously there has been a lot of inspired leaking from both sources and, I would suggest, his Department? In view of his comments, would the Minister tell us whether he is satisfied that the promoters have met the requirements of the Independent Radio and Television Commission?  Is the Minister satisfied that there is sufficient long term funding in place?  Can he confirm that there have been changes from the original sponsors and would he tell us what he believes the position to be of the Smurfit organisation, of TVS, and of Yorkshire Television?  Will the Minister welcome <Col N="2080" /> the fact that he has been given an opportunity to answer these questions in order to clarify the situation which is currently very confused?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of the possibilities for TV3 is a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission. Funding and sponsorship have to be and are being taken into account by the IRTC and it is their responsibility to assess whether they give the green light to TV3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of speculation to the effect that the Government believe there is no longer a market for TV3.  Will the Minister say bluntly what is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have and I will repeat it.  It is a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission to decide whether to give the go-ahead to TV3.  It is clearly Government policy that there should be a choice of Irish channels.  The Act lays down that the Minister shall initially direct the Commission to invite applications to provide such a service.  They have done that and they are now in the assessment process. What is going on is quite clear.</P>

Is the Minister aware that long before the end of this year RTE will have reached their capping level of funding available and will have to cease advertising entirely with all of the disastrous results that will have in diverting much needed revenue to foreign broadcasting outlets?  Is the Minister telling us that he intends to sit back and fiddle while the whole advertising revenue of RTE is diverted abroad?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Act is not that old.  We cannot go around changing legislation every couple of months.  When we pass complex legislation we have to assess how it works.  I am watching the legislation very carefully and I am having discussions with a broad range of interests in the broadcasting sector.  It is appropriate to monitor the legislation to see if the objectives of the Act are being met. The objective was to establish a fair, competitive broadcasting environment for all the participants.  It is premature to try to make a decision one way or the other. RTE's financial situation, by any measure is reasonably healthy at the moment; figures available to me indicate that RTE are in a good financial position.  We will take that into account as well as the performance of the other stations, the possible future for TV3 and so on and we will monitor the Act over the months ahead. That is the sensible thing to do rather than to rush into major changes at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Act has not achieved what the Minister's predecessor set out to achieve &mdash; the levelling of the playing pitch &mdash; it could be said that despite the fact that the Act is only one year old, it has prematurely aged as already many flaws have appeared in it. According to the report the Minister mentioned earlier about 43 per cent of advertising has now gone to what is referred to by the advertising trade as below the line advertising, sponsorship, sales promotions and things like that.</P>
      <P>The failure of the IRTC to introduce community radio is another area where the Act has failed.  To say that RTE are in a fairly sound financial position is an indictment of the Government because so many jobs were sacrificed.  It confirms what people on this side of the House said during the passage of this very controversial legislation.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any intention of allowing the commercial radio stations to shed their news content, which content is required by the Act? Already one of the major commercial stations has dismissed some of their senior news staff and there is the possibility that they will try to jettison any news casts from these commercial stations. Could the Minister give the House an assurance that this will not happen?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the 20 per cent current affairs and news rule.  That is a wide ratio.  In the last few months I visited a number of these stations and they are more than meeting this requirement.  I am sure it is not coincidental that the stations meeting the requirement are among the most successful stations.  I support the retention of the 20 per cent rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The air traffic control service in my Department is part of the Air Navigation Services Office &mdash; ANSO.  As I have told the House on a previous occasion, I am considering proposals for the restructuring of ANSO but no decision has yet been reached in the matter.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House, however, that I have no plans to privatise the Air Navigation Services Office.  Furthermore, safety is, and will continue to be, the guiding principle for ANSO and for the air traffic control service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister say that safety will be one of the top of priorities of ANSO.  Would the Minister not agree that he has condemned both himself and the Government by acknowledging that Government control has led to staff shortages and inefficiency in this sector? He said that the problems in regard to air traffic control were the result of the Government's lack of long term vision. In view of the fact that approximately 500 aircraft fly over this country every day and approximately five million passengers use Dublin Airport every year, can the Minister give the House an assurance that he will lift the ridiculous ban on recruitment in the air traffic control sector?  The safety of passengers using our airports and those overflying our country must be guaranteed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of recruitment, this is one of the few areas where additional recruitment has taken place over the past few years. I should point out to the Deputy that a £30 million investment programme in air traffic control and air navigation is nearing completion.  This will give us one of the most up-to-date traffic control systems in the world.  There are approximately 600 staff in my Department dealing with air navigation and air traffic control.  This is basically an operational matter.  One of the options I am looking at is the setting up a new structure which will put some distance between the policy making and operational aspects of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that while there were 271 air traffic controllers ten years ago, there are only 217 today in a business which has doubled in volume during that time?  Is he also aware that there is great dissatisfaction among air traffic controllers who have to turn off the radar control so that they can take a break?  These overworked staff can no longer keep our airways safe.  Will the Minister outline the role he envisages for Aer Rianta in the new structure and when the final plan proposed by the Government will be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of air traffic controllers has not changed that much over the years but technology has changed dramatically, particularly in the area of aviation.  This has greatly assisted in alleviating the additional workload.  I want to join with the Deputy in expressing my admiration for the air traffic controllers who do a very find job.  This is why I am particularly anxious, with their <Col N="2087" /> agreement, to put them into a new an more commercially-orientated structure which will allow them to grow, earn additional revenue, perhaps do more consultancy work and, without losing sight of their safety duties have a more acute commercial approach to the development of their present business. Handing this over to Aer Rianta, as one of the subsidiary companies, is one of the options I am looking at and the establishment of a new semi-State company is another option.  I should be in a position within a few months to bring final proposals before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief, and I know you will be sympathetic to my point.  Is the Minister concerned at the fact that air traffic controllers have to shut down their monitors at times so that they can take a break?  Does he not agree that this indicates there is a lack of replacement staff in this sector?  This is very worrying in terms of the safety of aircraft overflying this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest anyone gets the wrong impression from this debate, I want to say loud and clear that there is no danger whatsoever to travelling passengers from our air traffic controllers. They do a very fine job and are well within the safety limits.  There is absolutely no danger to the travelling public in any way.  I am interested in setting up a new structure which will improve the conditions of the workforce in air traffic control and, at the same time, develop a more vibrant organisation of air traffic controllers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The papers presented at the seminar held in Trinity College on 8 March last, at which my Department were represented, are being considered in the context of possible future strategies for the development of public transport infrastructure in Dublin.  In this regard, I have extended the remit of the high level working group, which was originally established to assess and report on the most suitable transport option for the Harcourt Street line and the Tallaght area, to enable the group to examine the possibility of developing a light rail system for Dublin and to devise a blueprint for such a system.  I have requested the working group to submit their report to me as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have extended an invitation to the private sector to submit proposals to me for the development of a modern public transport system for Dublin.  Already considerable interest is being shown by a number of international transport companies in association with local, private and public interests for the development of an integrated light rail system for Dublin.  However, a number <Col N="2089" /> of issues must be evaluated comprehensively, including the possible network of operations and the financing of the investment involved.  These matters will be examined in detail by the working group.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can assure the House that I am determined to encourage the development of innovative solutions to Dublin's public transport problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are all aware, the local government elections will be held on 27 June.  Will the Minister agree that over the past number of years he has been playing politics with the issue of public transportation, that he has jumped on a bandwagon in calling for the introduction of a light rapid rail system and has no commitment whatsoever to the reopening of the Harcourt Street line or to the establishment of an integrated public transport system?  I want to ask the Minister two simple questions.  First, how does he equate his proposals in regard to transportation with his self-acclaimed statement that he has cut the annual subsidy to CIE by 15 per cent in real terms?  How will the Minister explain the lack of service on the 19, 20, 22 and 50 bus routes to the travelling public? Second, would he agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is basing the prospect of the provision of a light rail system on two experiences, one of which relates to the Docklands area of London where the massive development attracted <Col N="2090" /> private investment.

      <P>I want to strongly reject the suggestion that I am jumping on a bandwagon, particularly in regard to the Harcourt Street line.  I should like to remind the House, and in particular, Deputy Byrne, that during my first election campaign for this House in 1981 I put forward a proposal in a formal report which I commissioned &mdash; I can make this available &mdash; in regard to the Harcourt Street line.  To my knowledge, I was the first public representative to do so.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is serious in his pursuit of the establishment of a rapid rail system for the greater Dublin area, may I ask him if he has addressed the decision made by the Government in 1987 to abandon the extension of the DART line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to answer these questions but if I am interrupted I do not see any point in doing so.  In regard to the reduction in the CIE subsidy, the CIE subsidy is £109 million, over £2 million per week.  When one considers that a reduction in income tax by 1 per cent costs between £27 million and £30 million, one has to be very careful in demanding increases in subsidies across the board <Col N="2091" /> for CIE or any other group.  With regard to private sector involvement, for example, the private sector are heavily involved in the West Link and East Link bridges.  Ten years ago no one would have foreseen private investment in roads.  I see no reason there cannot be some private investment in public transport.  I renew again my invitation to the private sector to consider entering into joint ventures with me and, possibly, with CIE in developing a public transport system for the city.  I am not averse to private investment. Perhaps the Deputy has an ideological problem with it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not convinced that the deflector system is a perfectly good one?  Rural communities have used their ingenuity, harnessed a signal and are rebroadcasting it, in the process bringing six channels to areas of rural Ireland which will never be able to avail of an MMDS system.  Surely his Department have the capacity and expertise to legalise and licence those systems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as simple as that.  Substantial technical and legal problems have to be overcome.  For example, the Department have already signed legal contracts throughout the country to permit MMDS operators to go ahead.  This debate on the MMDS system requires that I put on the record that Deputy Jim Mitchell announced publicly in 1986 that the MMDS system was the preferred option and he was proceeding on that basis.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the sensible course of action five years on would be to allow rural areas to continue with the deflector system? Given that in a few years time, a service will be provided via satellite would the Minister accept that the proper thing to do would be to scrap the MMDS system and let rural areas, as my colleague, Deputy Higgins, pointed out, enjoy the service they have been receiving for the past number of years in the same way that areas in the eastern part of the country are enjoying a service?</P>

      <P>There is no question of anyone being switched off.  The sets of <Col N="2095" /> consumers under the old system will not go black until a new system is ready to go.  There is no question of permitting a gap to be created.  Therefore the consumer need not be over-concerned about losing a service.  It is important that I reassure them that is my intention to ensure that no gap is created between one system and another but I have to remind the Deputy that legal contracts have been signed to provide an MMDS system throughout the country.  Both the Deputy's party and mine gave a commitment at different times to provide such a system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>An Post already operate the Post Office Savings Bank on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  As explained to the House in reply to a question on 30 May 1990, development proposals for the banking and retail services of An Post drawn up by the company in conjunction with their main agency customers, viz. the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance and to be co-financed by them were finalized and approved at the end of 1989.  Implementation of the proposals had to be deferred because of difficulties experienced by the company in relation to the supply of a central software package. An Post have now informed me that they have completed their reassessment of the proposals in the light of these difficulties, and that the company are currently discussing the revised proposals with their main agency customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals would encompass widespread networking of computers to post offices nationwide and would include a number of the retail facilities of a giro <Col N="2097" /> banking nature, for example, bill payments, money transmission, direct debits, standing orders, etc.</P>
    <P>I understand that An Post have already studied the question of the introduction of a full giro banking service and that the company decided against it having regard to such factors as the capital investment required, the minimum solvency ratio and the extent to which the marketplace is already served for such a service. However, it is open to the company to submit proposals to me at any time for a full giro banking service and I will have them considered speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has to say about the operation of a banking service by An Post.  Under section 67 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, provision was made to allow the post office to develop a banking service provided they got the permission of the Minister for Finance.  Would the Minister inform the House if that permission has been granted by his colleague, the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, it has not. On the surface it appears that it is an attractive proposition for An Post to go into the banking business flat out but there are aspects which are not so clear, for example, if An Post were in banking they would have to ensure that the very substantial solvency ratio deposits be kept as well as a whole plethora of very stringent Central Bank rules and regulations. I understand that An Post have studied this and they themselves have indicated they do not wish to proceed to a full banking service at this time, but no doubt they will continue to study the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister's reply that he doubts very much that An Post have the competence to provide a banking service despite the incursion of the building societies into banking with the full blessing of the Government?  I cannot accept that the post office would not be able to <Col N="2098" /> compete in this area.  If we are to make the post office viable I think it is absolutely essential to allow them to develop in this area, as provided for in the Act.</P>
      <P>Questions Nos. 30 and 31 deal specifically with the provision of computer facilities.  How soon does the Minister envisage the computer package being made available to An Post which would enable them to diversify into the banking service.  How far have we gone down the road in regard to the provision of these computers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point, let me say there has been a breakthrough in the supply of the central softwear package and An Post are completing their reassessment of the proposal.  That difficulty has been sorted out.  I cannot put a date on it but we have got over one hump, as I understand the package is now available.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear about the idea of An Post providing a banking service; the Government and I are not standing in the way of the post office providing a banking service and if An Post wish to put a proposal to me I will have it studied very carefully indeed.  However, getting into banking is superficially attractive for An Post because of their present difficulties but I would be nervous about grasping at it as a readymade solution because banking is neither as easy a business nor as cheap to get into as we might consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that many of the sub-post offices in urban areas, particularly in Dublin, are inferior in structure to the banks, building societies and credit unions and that the viability programme would have to address the quality of the environment in which people would be doing their business?  If An Post do not make the sub-post offices attractive places for people to conduct <Col N="2099" /> their business, the viability proposals will get nowhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-post offices and, in fact, all post offices should be attractive to the customer.  I should point out that An Post already have a very substantial saving certificate business and that is being conducted through all the offices. I take it the Deputy is encouraging the sub-post offices to continue to improve the quality of their offices and I join with him in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that when he talks about An Post's difficulties he is talking about his difficulties? Will he indicate whether he is actively promoting and assisting An Post to diversify?  In his reply he said he would not stand in their way but he is still the Minister for Communications and has responsibility for the postal services.  Can the Minister quantify the capital requirements of An Post to provide the limited programme of a bank giro service?  What assistance by way of capital investment will come from his Department or from the EC or elsewhere through his efforts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, An Post's difficulties are mine and all of the people of Ireland.  We want to see a vibrant, healthy post office service.  I think I have been helpful in that I have asked the NESC-appointed consultants to examine additional sources of revenue for the sub-post office network.  I am not concentrating solely on the cost side as I am also examining possible sources of revenue.  There have been interesting suggestions in the House and I will ensure that the consultants study those suggestions carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Authorisation has not given but let me repeat that it is open to An Post at any time to request me or the Minister for Finance to look at the potential for the provision of a banking service through the post office network. I will not delay in considering An Post's proposals at any time.  The position is that they do not wish to proceed at full speed in that direction at present but wish to examine the initial area.</P>

These included, for example, the area of advertising time limits and standards and the &ldquo;right of reply&rdquo; provisions.  The question, however, of the need to adopt further measures in the form of a statutory instrument under relevant EC legislation is currently under consideration in conjunction with the Attorney General's office.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate if negotiations regarding the implementation of these important directives are taking place?  When will the mandatory directives be implemented in full?  Would the Minister accept that the directives, if implemented, would have profound, if not amending, effect on the provisions of the 1990 Act?  Will the Minister explain how he proposes to deal with them by way of ministerial directive? Would he accept that it would be preferable, if not necessary, to have amending legislation dealing with these directives?</P>

      <P>I want to assist the Deputy in clarifying matters, but it is a well known fact in this House that if Deputies are dissatisfied with a Minister's or the Taoiseach's reply there are many ways open to them to deal with the matter, but not on the Order of Business. Furthermore, if a Deputy is making a serious allegation against any Member of the House he should proceed by way of substantive motion.  He may not pursue the matter now.</P>

    <Title>Payment of Wages Bill, 1991  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was last in possession we had cast our minds back to why there was a need for legislative changes in this area.  It was outlined by most speakers both in this House and in the Seanad that, given the political &ldquo;military&rdquo; climate that prevails in Northern Ireland and which often spills over to the South and with the involvement of gangster and criminal elements, there was great difficulty in moving large sums of money from point A to point B and that, therefore, the Bill should be welcomed because it would allow payment to be made to manual workers other than by cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree that the situation is of concern and that we should update our legislation, the legislation before us is rushed in so far as it does not take on board the submissions which have been made to the Minister or address satisfactorily the negative effects of its implementation on workers and their families.  It is important to record that the legislation we are seeking to amend is essentially excellent and it was sound legislation in the period in which it was initiated.  It was recognised as far back as 1464 that legislation was necessary to protect people who were engaged in the selling of their labour to employers. Every time legislation was brought forward subsequent to 1464 &mdash; in 1743 and <Col N="2197" /> 1896&mdash;the unscrupulous employers kept running ahead of the legislation and changing the circumstances of the method of payment of their workers.  We all know that as far back as 1464 the workers were paid by produce, presumably produce off the land and the mills they may have worked in; it was a payment in kind as opposed to cash payment.  It was recognised that something had to be done to protect the method of payment.  Subsequently legislation was introduced to protect workers who were in receipt of subs.  Prior to subbing, the method engaged in by employers was that the company store sold at exorbitant rates produce which was often inferior to the workers who were in employment either in mines, big farms or wherever they were located, as part payment of wages, so that the legislation had to be changed to catch up with these nasty employers who were underselling their workforce.</P>
    <P>We arrived at a stage where the legislation had to be changed to offset the negative effects of huge interest charges being made by unscrupulous employers on moneys given to the workers in the form of a sub.  As a former building worker I am aware that the method of collecting subs from an employer was certainly a common day occurrence.  The first thing many manual workers did arriving at building sites, in the sixties and seventies, was to go to the employer and seek a sub payment that would tide them over the week they worked.  I am not aware of interest charges to workers as late as the sixties and seventies but obviously that was something that happened in the past and had to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Essentially, what I am saying is that all legislation we are about to amend today was legislation for the protection of the workforce.  When we look back to 1460, 1743 and 1890 and right up to 1990 and the Payment of Wages Bill, 1991, which is before the House, one has to question the intent of the Bill.  The intent of the Bill was very clear from the Minister's presentation both in the Seanad &mdash; where the Bill was introduced &mdash; and here in the Dáil and from the speeches of Members <Col N="2198" /> from the various political parties.  In summary, it is my understanding that the presentation has been made on the basis that in the nineties it is difficult to ship large sums of money from point A to point B.  An extra charge is imposed on employers because of extra insurance costs and an extra charge for the cost of conveying the money from banks through city streets.  I take it that the term &ldquo;manual worker&rdquo; means particularly a tradesman and in the building industry. Because of the cost of servicing the transfer of large sums of money, the employers obviously have put pressure on the Minister and the Government to change the rules.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that we are not opposed to the changing of the rules.  If huge sums of money will be saved for the employers, then we had better look at the implications for the employees and whether there will be negative effects for the employees who are forced to accept payment other than in cash.  I would argue that there are major disincentives for workers to accept payment in a form other than cash.  One of the major reasons for the reluctance of the organised workforce to accept any other form of payment is based on personal and historic experiences, the insecurity in particular in the building industry and the fear that perhaps payment in cheque form might not be honoured.  Many manual workers are paid on an hourly basis and need instant access to cash for their own needs and those of their family. That worker needs instant access to cash so that the gas and ESB bills can be paid. Indeed, many working class families still operate a tick system with the local shop which often allows the bill to be paid at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>When speaking in the Seanad I think the Minister compared this country to Denmark in this regard, where 90 per cent of the workforce are paid by a method other than in cash.  I do not know the reasons for this, maybe there is better legislative protection for the worker.  I cannot compare this country with Denmark because I do not know how the system operates there.  We should try to <Col N="2199" /> find out why the workforce in Denmark accept payment other than in cash.  Is there a degree of compulsion?  The Minister has not adequately addressed the reluctance of the Irish workforce to accept non-cash payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not taken the reservations of Irish workers in this regard into account.  One reason could be the schedule of charge for customers of the AIB and Bank of Ireland.  If a worker is forced to accept a cheque payment he, presumably, is obliged to open a bank account.  However, that involves a huge range of charges for which the Minister has not included compensation for the worker.  Charges include 17p for an automated transaction, between 14p and 17p on each cheque which is cashed and £3 per annum for a cheque card.  There is also a payment of 7p per cheque in Government tax.  Employers would make huge savings if workers were paid by cheque, in insurance and in the cost of transferring money from the banks to building sites or factories, but it is legitimate to ask why the savings should all go to the employer with apparently no benefit to the workforce.  Indeed, there are penalties involved for workers.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to speaking here the last time we debated the Bill, I received correspondence from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which is on the lines of what I initially intended to bring up.  They said they are extremely concerned at the failure of the Bill to address a number of key issues, in particular the failure to provide a statutory right to workers to time off to cash cheques or orders and to provide that additional costs, i.e. bank charges, and so on be borne by the employer.  They said &mdash; and I agree &mdash; that these constitute a major defect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>What would happen if workers in rural areas were obliged to accept payment in cheque, money order or some other form other than in cash?  In some areas a travelling bank makes a periodic appearance and in other areas there is no banking service whatsoever.  How does the Minister propose to encourage employers, <Col N="2200" /> even in an urban area like Dublin, to facilitate workers to transact business in the bank given the hours which operate in banks at present?  It will be impossible for someone working from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. to cash a cheque.  I disagree with Deputy Shatter who said that this was great legislation because most workers have bank accounts and, therefore, should be happy to be paid by cheque.  There is a difference in the lifestyle of TDs, who have access to a decent wage, professional people and ordinary working people.  Many workers do not have a bank account and, incidentally, there is no reference in the Bill to credit unions whose members comprise most of the workers engaged in manual or unskilled labour.  I ask the Minister to take on board the reservations expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>I will not labour the point but I should like to reiterate my reservations in relation to this Bill.  While the legislation is good, we must be realistic and recognise that Ireland in the nineties as far as security is concerned is not the Ireland of long ago.  There are problems of security in relation to the transfer of cash.  The massive savings to employers should mean that some benefits will also accrue to workers.  I hope the Minister will address the question of banking hours and the difficulties of workers who do not have a bank account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome many of the provisions in this Bill.  However, there are a few areas in relation to which it will be necessary to table amendments on Committee Stage because there is an imbalance and a bias in favour of the employer, which must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned about many areas. As Deputy Byrne has pointed out, there have been various pieces of legislation in place dealing with this matter.  He mentioned legislation of 1464, 1743 and 1896. A person's entitlement to work goes back to biblical times when people laboured in the vineyards.  &ldquo;The last shall be first and the first shall be last&rdquo;&mdash; in a sense that is what this legislation is all about.  Much <Col N="2201" /> of the legislation in this area is pre-PESP and there is a need to address the problems which have arisen regarding the payment of wages.  One of the major problems has been the question of security. People's lives have been put at risk while conveying large amounts of cash from banks to places of employment.  The Minister has attempted to respond to that problem and we welcome that.  However, it is necessary to ensure that no injustice is done to any section of the community. There are sections in the legislation where the Minister, perhaps inadvertently or through lack of foresight, has failed to respond to the needs of the workers.</P>
    <P>Workers are now compelled to use the banking system.  Despite what Deputy Shatter has said, a large majority of the working population in this country do not have a bank account.  We are now creating a situation whereby people who have not had access to a bank in the past due to a shortage of money are now compelled to open an account.  It will not be possible for people to cash a cheque if they do not have a bank account.  In 1979 very serious problems arose in my own city, particularly in one firm who made the transfer to cheque payments. By virtue of the fact that some workers in that company did not have a bank account they were refused payment and, as a result endured quite a lot of hardship. The same is likely to happen again, and this is something that cannot be ignored. The Minister should ensure that there will not be a recurrence of that problem. We will try to deal with this matter by way of amendment.  A guarantee should be given to workers that they will not encounter problems.</P>
    <P>There is another problem regarding the banking service in that it is not nationwide. For example a major bank which was operating in the Ballymun area of Dublin withdrew its services.  If a person in a heavily populated area such as Ballymun is paid by cheque he has to travel to an adjoining area to have his cheque cashed and is not compensated by way of time off to which he is entitled.  Provision should be made to ensure that people <Col N="2202" /> should be given time off to cash their cheques without any expense to themselves.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is presented, any savings that will accrue will be to the benefit of the employer.  Savings should be shared by both the employer and the employee. While there is provision whereby the employer must meet certain conditions regarding payment of wages, there are no conditions laid down for the banks as regards bank charges.  This has been referred to by Deputy Byrne.  At present if a person wants to see a bank manager it costs money.  If a worker in a low paid job has to consult with a bank official will he be charged for that service?  If, for instance, there is a demand on his account for payment by way of a standing order and that payment cannot be met, the bank will charge for refusing payment. These are matters that will have to be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage to ensure that no further problems arise for people at work.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has made provision for employees who wish to take their case to a commissioner to have it investigated.  If an employee has a problem regarding payment of wages and wins his case against the employer, the employer may be fined £1,000 but that is likely to militate against the employee in the long term.  I have no doubt that an employer who is penalised for non-compliance with the provisions of this legislation will not readily forget the fact that his employee has brought him to court and exposed him in this way.  That could be detrimental to the promotional opportunities of employees.  There should be a register of cases that go before a tribunal, commission or court for investigation to ensure that in the event of an employee being successful against his employer that person is not victimised.  That is a real possibility and is a matter that has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives the Minister for Labour power to appoint authorised officers to monitor compliance with the terms of the Bill.  In addressing the financial implications, the Minister said there will be no extra cost involved and no significant <Col N="2203" /> staffing implications.  How will the process he monitored and how will inspections be carried out if the staff is not available to do so?  It is contradictory to say that the proposals have no significant staffing implications.  Section 9 provides that the Minister may appoint authorised officers to monitor compliance with the terms of the Bill.  I would like the Minister to explain how he hopes to achieve this. That provision is contradictory and will affect the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If a company goes into liquidation and in that week an employee has been paid by cheque, does the employee have to wait until such time as the case comes before a court, which as we know, could take a long time?  The lengthy waiting period would be a deterrent to anyone. If a company goes into liquidation, has the employee first call on any resources the company may have?  What would happen in the interim, from the time the company goes into liquidation until the case is brought to court?  Would the employee have to rely on the social welfare system?  What safeguards does the Minister intend to introduce to ensure that in the event of a company going to the wall the employee who has given his service willingly will not suffer as a result? This is an extremely important point and there is no provision for it.</P>
    <P>This is quite a short Bill but there are loopholes in it that will have to be addressed. The balance is very definitely in favour of the employer who will gain substantially.  Can the Minister assure me that employees will not be out of pocket as a result of this legislation?  If that should be the case it will be due to failure on the part of the Minister to deal even-handedly with the legislation.  In future there will be more computerisation and companies will have less cash in hand. There is no insurance to cover the conveyance of cash from one point to another.  For that reason they will gain handsomely from this legislation.</P>
    <P>Certain measures will have to be taken to protect the rights of workers.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will make changes on Committee Stage without any <Col N="2204" /> prompting from this side.  Opposition Members will certainly table some amendments.  I do not think the Bill calls for too many amendments, but some key changes are required, as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have already intimated to the Minister.  I regret very much that the Minister, despite the goodwill that prevails between his office and the Congress, has been unable to reach a suitable agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to encompass all the needs of the workers who will be affected by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with previous speakers, I welcome the Bill which reflects a growing consensus for change in the law relating to the payment of wages.  As the Minister pointed out in his opening speech, the Bill is indeed historic because it repeals sections of the Truck Act, 1743, one of the last enactments passed by the old Irish Parliament in College Green before 1800 when the Act of Union changed all that.</P>
      <P>The Payment of Wages Act, 1979, stopped short of a fundamental review of the Truck Acts.  This Bill goes further.  A high proportion of manual workers already avail of non cash methods of wage payment; two out of three workers do so, which is a substantial number by any standards. It is important to stress that those two out of three workers have negotiated agreements voluntarily under the free collective bargaining system.  There is no question of this legislation or its predecessor imposing legal obligations on either side in relation to the payment of wages.  The payment of wages is subject to negotiation in accordance with the fundamental institution of free collective bargaining that both sides want and practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that Ireland is low down the league in relation to the proportion of manual workers who avail of non cash payment of wages compared to the proportion in continental Europe, it is true that our numbers are growing.  Indeed, in our case there are several advantages. If the trend increases that much more, if a proportion of the remaining one-third <Col N="2205" /> who are not on non-cash payment of wages at the moment opt to follow that route, then the security risk attached to the transfer of large sums of cash for wages payment will be reduced.  At the moment gardaí, the Army and security firm personnel risk life and limb when moving and supervising the movement of large sums of cash for the payment of wages.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned savings in costs to employers if more manual workers opt into this scheme.  It is true that costs will be reduced in relation to insurance payments, security arrangements and the use of computer facilities that are now widely in existence.  In other words, it will be possible to facilitate the electronic transfer of cash by using computer capacity that typically already exists within companies.  Furthermore, use of the computer as a method of electronic payment has clear benefits in terms of efficiency, economy and security.</P>
    <P>If employers save by the move to non-cash payment of wages it is up to employees, and their trade unions, to negotiate a slice of those savings.  Far from imposing legal obligations on either side in relation to the payment of wages, if anything the Bill provides a valuable framework for the exercise of free collective bargaining and for unionised employees to obtain as good a share of the savings made as they can.  I might add that free collective bargaining and the absence of legal regulation, unlike British legislation in this regard, is fundamental to negotiations between unionised employees and employers.  Indeed, it is a valuable worker right enshrined in legislation as far back as 1875 by an Act of the West minister Parliament.  It is greatly valued by trade unions and is also preferred by employers as a means of negotiation.</P>
    <P>I understand that under the 1979 legislation there are some 600 agreements relating to non-cash methods of wage payment.  They are reviewed at intervals. Agreements are made between both sides and when the agreements run out the option exists, if the employee wants to take it up, to revert to payment of <Col N="2206" /> wages by cash.  The Bill provides opportunity for both sides.  Employers have an opportunity to buy out permanently under free negotiation in one lump sum the entitlement of manual workers to opt for non-cash methods of wage payment. By the same token, employees also have the opportunity to sell their entitlement at a negotiated price.  The Minister, and the Government, are not in the business of legislating for what sums should apply to that exercise.  That is a matter for free negotiation between the two sides.  That system is supported through the action now taken under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 has been somewhat contentious in relation to transitional arrangements for non-cash payment of wages.  The Bill provides for employees to opt for continued payment in cash. It also provides that where there is an agreement under the 1979 legislation for non-cash payment of wages employees may if they so wish revert to cash payment of wages at the end of the period of that agreement.</P>
    <P>As usual the Minister and the Government are faced with the task of striking a balance.  It is the job of the Minister and his officials to listen to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to the Federation of Irish Employers, both of whom have their own case, and then strike an honourable compromise, the primary consideration being to make the legislation work and to improve the present position.  By providing a breathing space in transitional arrangements, the Minister achieves and enhances the opportunity for agreement between both sides made within the voluntary framework of free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>A by-product of computer payroll systems is unity in the system of payment for all employees.  I welcome that.  That is not the primary intention of the legislation, but it seems to me that any measure &mdash; by-product or otherwise &mdash; that closes the gap between so-called white-collar workers and blue-collar workers is very much a step in the right direction. It is a move towards a single status of employees within an organisation, and that is important.  The repeal of the Truck <Col N="2207" /> Acts today, which Acts spelt out the division between white collar and manual workers, removes distinctions between white-collar and blue-collar workers.  It is the appropriate route to take in relation to contemporary work conditions, which should be more participative and democratic.</P>
    <P>From research I have been involved in with companies I can confirm that when companies recognise people as their key resource one of the first issues they tackle is the distinction between white-collar and manual workers in order to provide a more equitable treatment of all employees.  In its own way, the repeal of the Truck Acts facilitates that development.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers made several references to financial institutions, the possible inconvenience that will be caused by the cashing of cheques, and so on.  The Bill will promote greater contact between manual workers and financial institutions. In the Minister's opening speech he said that the encouragement of non-cash payment of wages would mean that more business would be driven into the hands of the banks.  Of course, in that context one is referring to more than just the banks.  Deputy O'Sullivan knows that An Post are a very important financial institution in Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the question of hours, since the passage of the Act in 1979, the number of financial institutions and the range of their services has greatly increased.  It is now possible, for example, to engage in banking with building societies.  The Trustee Saving Banks are there as well. They have longer hours than the associated banks, and that will facilitate many people.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that the points made by the Deputy are not valid.  Obviously we will return to them on Committee Stage and I look forward to the debate at that stage.  On the convenience front, there are 24 hour teller machines as well as flexibile banking hours.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I would like to make relating to the role of the Rights Commissioner where manual workers <Col N="2208" /> have complaints about deductions from their pay.  I should say straightaway that I regard the Rights Commissioner as an informal, speedy and successful service in handling individual employee problems. Its status makes for a welcome for that institution in the context of the Bill.  For the first time in legislation the Rights Commissioner is now written into the Bill as a first stage or mandatory step in relation to complaints which, in turn, are related to deductions from pay or at least offences in that regard by employers.  I think the sums involved will be very small if employers offend in this regard.  Furthermore I think the number of offending employers would also be small, but that remains to be seen.  Naturally it is important on grounds of equity for employers and employees to be able to appeal to the Rights Commissioner service if they disagree with the decision of a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill.  I feel that it is a considered compromise, a balanced piece of legislation in the context of the differing views from employers and trade unions on this issue.  Overall I see it as a valuable updating of legislation to match contemporary needs and conditions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne, every Deputy here is entitled to express his own views without interruption.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am no admirer of banks and the way they conduct their business but I realise they are very necessary and while, horror of horrors, I certainly would not adopt the socialist attitude of nationalising them, I recently suggested at the Committee of Public Accounts that the banks were a group of vultures who would charge you to breathe, indeed they would charge you to blink.  Undoubtedly this Bill will drive into their clutches a small army of people who have never had any dealings with banks.  That is a regrettable feature of this Bill.  Section 5 actually decrees that no employer is empowered to make any deductions from a person's wages unless authorised.  If a person owes a bank money, will the bank, after a time, be empowered to touch that wage cheque to <Col N="2210" /> make deductions from it or possibly grab the whole cheque and leave some family without money for food?  That is something I would ask the Minister to look at to ensure that that cannot happen.  That is my particular concern and the reason I wanted to say a few words on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the banks should be entitled to take a penny out of any person's wage cheque.  I would not trust the banks.  I feel that by bringing a whole new area of business to the banks their exorbitant charges will be increased from time to time.  Who will monitor that?  Will the Minister or the Minister for Finance be invited to participate in discussions and negotiations on that or will the banks have <i>carte blanche</i> to do what they like?</P>
      <P>The Irish banking charges are quite high but there are many people who manage their own finances well and do not have any business with them.  I realise that banks are necessary.  I know it to my own cost and I am not attacking them unduly, but there are many people who will be forced to deal with banks who would prefer not to.  Given the nature of banks and the ever increasing need to increase profits I would have reservations about them.  If they can identify this sector as a lucrative sector they will raise charges when they like.  I would ask the Minister to address the problem I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  It was gratifying to see widespread support for the measures proposed. I look forward to the speedy passage of the remaining Stages of the Bill so that its provisions can come into force as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my aim to help effect the move to non-cash wages as speedily and as effectively as possible.  The Bill will contribute to that process by helping employers and employees.  Employers have a lot of gain financially in the short term and in the long term from a move to non-cash wage payments.  They should not expect employees to agree overnight to a change without the goodwill of an employer being demonstrated in some <Col N="2211" /> way.  Employees must show their goodwill too in the move to cashless wages. They must not stubbornly hold on to their ancient rights to cash payments without due cause.  Employees will benefit from the change-over due to better business efficiency which will increase job security and the safety of employees engaged in handling of the payroll will increase.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that people would lose their rights on the passage of the Bill.  Under section 3 (2) all employees who are paid their wages in cash immediately before the commencement of this legislation can continue to be paid in cash under the existing contracts of employment until and unless they agree to one of the alternative methods of payment listed in the Bill. Agreements may be made between the employer and the employee or between an organisation representing the employer, such as the FIE, and an organisation representing the employee, such as a trade union or staff association.</P>
    <P>Employees paid wages by a mode other than cash due to an agreement under section 3 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1979, will retain the right of revert to cash wages at the end of the agreement or where there is no termination date at any time, provided four weeks notice of intent to revert to cash wages is given to the other party.  We intend to guarantee for the employees concerned, arrangements for reverting to cash wages similar to those which were accepted in 1979.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies today missed the point that employees have a right to stay as they are.  We are encouraging organisations to move but the legislation does not do away with anybody's right, as some Deputies suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that following the enactment of this legislation pressure will be put on employees to accept a cheque payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the pressure will be on both parties.  Pressure will be on employers to stop hauling millions of pounds of cash around the country every <Col N="2212" /> week and they will be pressured to make agreements with employees.  The legislation does not in an arbitrary way abolish the right of the employee to cash wages.</P>
      <P>It would be entirely inappropriate in relation to our system of free collective bargaining if I were to write into the Bill, as suggested by Deputy McGahon, that people should get time off because of this system or that they should be paid for it. I would have to write into the Bill what an employee could expect from an employer in relation to free collective bargaining.  Neither the trade union movement nor any employee would like me to set out in the legislation what an employee should get under the legislation. That is a matter between employees, their staff associations, trade unions and employers.</P>
      <P>The two sides of industry will not be the only beneficiaries of the move to cashless payment.  The banking fraternity can look forward to the optimum use of technology and to a possible new source of customers.  In attracting those customers there may be scope for developing a personal friendly ethos.  In the course of the debate there has been much criticism of the banks and the service they offer. Much of the criticism is justified.  Some of their practices are as outdated as the legislation it is proposed to repeal in this Bill.  The banking institutions should pull themselves into the 20th century by providing the type of service demanded by ordinary people today or they will be left behind other financial institutions who are expanding into the personal banking field and who are offering the type of service which will attract employees into the cashless economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last day, Deputy Shatter referred to a number of organisations and the services they provide.  It is not only the banks who provide the service, but An Post, building societies and the Trustee Savings Banks, some of whom are open late at night or on Saturday morning. We are not talking only about banking services where the banks still have the luxury of closing their doors to the public at 3 o'clock every day, except one day.  In negotiations people will take that <Col N="2213" /> into account.  It is up to the banking institutions to change.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the legislative framework necessary to facilitate the move to non-cash payments.  As with all changes, new attitudes must be fostered. Employers need to look at their present organisational methods and address the options for increased efficiency offered by a non-cash payroll and employees should be encouraged to seek information about the various kinds of non-cash services and the likely benefits.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the UK introduced new legislation to repeal the Truck Acts and at that time many of the UK employers took the initiative in preparing employees for the move to non-cash wages.  Some employers organised open days to which local banks and building societies were invited to meet employees and to explain their services to them.  This approach may be suitable in some cases.</P>
    <P>There is the important question of timing when it comes to managing any change.  Change is often more acceptable when it occurs gradually or in pre-agreed stages.  Perhaps employees who are anxious to move to non-cash wages might make the transition some months in advance of others, and their trouble free experiences of non-cash wages will no doubt filter through to their less open minded colleagues, giving them cause for reconsideration.  We are trying to give everyone the opportunity to move, but it will take some time.  We can be certain that the moves in this legislation will in time mean payments other than cash payments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter was the first of many Deputies to stress the importance of the Bill reducing the number of armed payroll robberies.  This was one of the reasons which prompted a review of the existing legislation and, subsequently, the preparation of the Bill.  While the number of armed robberies appears to have decreased in the last number of years they continue to be a problem. Indeed it was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 7 June that the previous afternoon, the afternoon this debate began, two youths armed with a butcher's knife escaped <Col N="2214" /> with a £20,000 payroll when they held up staff in a building contractor's premises in the north side of the city.  While such incidents are mild in comparison with other armed robberies they underline the importance for employers and employees of eliminating the associated dangers of large cash-based payrolls.  The Bill will be of help in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter also referred to a problem which was first highlighted by Senator ÓCuív in the Seanad regarding pay statements which are so abbreviated and complex as to make them virtually incomprehensible.  As I have already outlined, I am in consultation with the Attorney General's office with a view to introducing a Government amendment on Committee Stage to clarify the legislation in this regard, if needs be.  I want to assure Deputy Shatter that we are taking action in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to what he described as a new type of payment in kind.  He instanced situations where computer companies give their employees a new computer every year or where some companies hold special business conferences in exotic locations for some or all of their employees.  He regarded these practices primarily as forms of tax avoidance and asked if they would be legal under the terms of this Bill.  There has been a long tradition in manufacturing industry of offering perks by way of company produce to employees.  I am not too sure if Deputy Byrne was correct in regard to some of the benefits in kind given to employees. Breweries, distilleries and cigarette manufacturers, to name but a few, have, by tradition, for many years given company produce to their employees often as a gesture of appreciation towards them.</P>
    <P>As to the legality of this practice after the enactment of this Bill, I would refer the Deputy to the definition of wages in section 1 and the list of modes of wage payment in section 2.  Payments in kind are specifically excluded from the scope of this Bill by subparagraph (v) of the definition of &ldquo;wages&rdquo;.  Accordingly, section 2 deals only with money wages <Col N="2215" /> and sets out the modes by which such money wages may be paid.  The giving of perks, such as those mentioned, are not wages for the purposes of this Bill but equally will not be outlawed by the terms of section 2.  As long as the employee is paid his contractual money wage in the manner prescribed in section 2 of the Bill, the employer will be free to offer benefits in kind over and above that wage.</P>
    <P>The role of the rights commissioner under this Bill will be to hear and decide on individual complaints regarding unlawful deductions or payments from wages.  Deputy Shatter suggested a role for the rights commissioner service in the resolution of disputes between an employer and a trade union as to the compensation, if any, to be paid to employees for switching to non-cash wage payment.  My view is that the assignment of such a role to rights commissioners would be inappropriate. Section 13 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, which established the rights commissioner service, precludes a rights commissioner from hearing a dispute involving a group of workers.  The rights commissioner's role has always been and will continue to be connected with disputes involving individual workers.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware of my conviction that disputes between employers and employees are best resolved by the parties themselves.  However, nothing in this Bill will prevent the parties calling in an independent third party to help in reaching agreements of this nature.  This is the fundamental point.  Indeed I would suggest that where problems arise in reaching these agreements, the Labour Relations Commission might be the most appropriate third party to call in. However, the Bill is deliberately silent as regards agreements to change over to cashless wages so as not to tie the hands of any party with unnecessary regulatory provisions in the matter of agreements which are, by their nature, local matters. It should be left to the parties involved to decide on the course they will take.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne suggested that the Bill does not take account of the views and <Col N="2216" /> submissions made to me and that the legislation is rushed.  I will not repeat the litany of dates the Deputy quoted.  The arguments presented&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say this legislation was rushed in the context of the previous legislation.  I said the Minister had not taken on board the submissions made to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided four years ago to issue a discussion document on the Bill rather than present it in its initial stages. Since then all interested parties have been involved in discussions with me.  I am not saying they agree with all aspects. As I pointed out last week, the ICTU are unhappy about some aspects of the legislation while the FIE are equally unhappy about other aspects.  These matters have to be discussed by them.  We have given them the forum and the legislative structure by which they can resolve these problems.  Both sides would like not to have to go through that process and would prefer if I set out the conditions for them.  It would be impossible for me to do this as I would have to come down on one side or the other, which is not in accordance with free collective bargaining.  However, both sides understand that.</P>
      <P>As I said during the debate in the Seanad, all the arguments presented during the consultative process involved in the Bill have been considered in the development of these proposals.  I accept that there are a few sticking points in the Bill about which one side or the other have reservations.  It is a measure of the balance achieved that both sides of industry, while assenting to the overall thrust of the Bill, for which I thank them, remain concerned that the interests of the other side may have been given a little too much weight.  This switches from one side to the other in relation to different aspects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said that the old truck Acts were good law.  While I agree with him, they have, as I am sure the Deputy acknowledges, outlived their time.  I have tried in this Bill to take on board some <Col N="2217" /> of the essence of the philosophy of the truck Acts and transform it into terms which will be relevant to the late 20th century.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the litany of disadvantages to employees identified by Deputy Byrne.  However, there are benefits to employees too, for example, security advantages relating to the payment of wages by non-cash means. Employees who are entitled currently to wage payments in cash but who are not being paid in cash are entitled to revert to cash wages.  Employees have the right to pay statements and there is the important new right of appeal in relation to deductions from wages.  Indeed, some of these very benefits are the aspects of the Bill which the employers interests are vociferous in opposing.  Deputy Shatter outlined these advantages eloquently and there is no need for me to go through them again.  We cannot ignore the advantages of these benefits which employees receive.  I hope these benefits will be taken into account by the people involved in the negotiations.  It is not good enough for people to sit on the fence and allow for the payment of certain percentages.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne asked about the position in other countries.  The decision was made for the social partners in those countries by the introduction of legislation which banned these benefits.  We opted not to do this as there are advantages to employers also, and the trade union movement, staff associations and individual employees have the right to trade to get some of these benefits.  They have been very successful in doing this over the years whether by way of extra time off work, additional allowances, additional perks, etc.</P>
    <P>From listening again to Deputy Byrne's concerns about cash paid workers one would not believe we are living in a country where 70 per cent of blue collar employees have bank accounts or that this Bill will guarantee cash wages.  We would be insulting the intelligence of blue collar workers if we were to suggest that they do not have cash accounts.  Blue collar workers in some of the biggest establishments already have <Col N="2218" /> substantial agreements with their employers.  Funnily enough, some of the biggest enterprises in the State area still use cash or cheques to pay their employees.  An employee can continue to be paid in cash until such time as he agrees otherwise with his employer. Because of the high level of bank charges, not every employee will decide to open a current account.  At present credit transfers can be operated economically to a deposit account.  The Deputy should look again at my earlier remarks on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan expressed concern at the possibility of workers being subsequently victimised in the event of their making a complaint regarding a contravention of the legislation.  I would like to reassure the Deputy that in regard to prosecutions in respect of contraventions of sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill it would be a matter for the Minister for Labour to bring these prosecutions where the authorised officers found an employer to be in contravention of the legislation. Employers need not in those circumstances know the identity of complainants. I agree with the point made by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Hillery for his contribution to the debate.  He addressed some of the issues raised.  I was pleased also that he pointed to the new role for the rights commissioner service, an interesting departure which escaped the attention of some Deputies.</P>
    <P>Mention by Deputy O'Sullivan of authorised officers brings me to his question of an apparent contradiction in the Bill. As he pointed out, the Minister for Labour will be empowered to appoint authorised officers to monitor compliance with the legislation while no additional staff costs are envisaged in the financial implications.  The duties of the authorised officers will be carried out by the labour inspectorate of the Department of Labour who perform similar duties under other employment legislation. It is in this way that no specific additional staffing costs are envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the Deputy recently, that section has been expanded and a greater number of calls are being made.  If there is a problem the matter can be reviewed at any time.  All complaints received are followed up.  The majority of these are made by persons who are not members of trade unions.  It has always been the practice in the Department to ensure that persons who are not members of trade unions are given their rights, given that they have a greater need for the assistance of the inspectorate and have no one else to speak for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon made a point about the banks but I must point out that the arrangements entered into between a person and a bank as to the repayment of a loan do not come within the remit of the Bill.  The Bill addresses the matter of deductions from wages by an employer and provides an appeals procedure.  It is not proposed in this Bill to influence deductions, if any, which a bank may make from a client's account on foot of an outstanding loan&mdash;this would open a whole new legislative area which in all probability would not be in the competence of my Department.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for supporting the Bill.  Naturally, I will examine all the points made today, but what is important is that we pass the Bill.  I thank Deputy Shatter and Deputy O'Sullivan for their co-operation in this matter.  It may take some years to move from a cash pay system to other forms of payment but it is our intention to encourage this.  Deputy Byrne referred to the credit unions and the answer to his question is yes.  If it is possible to have money paid direct to a credit union and an agreement is reached with an employer, then this will be another option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in 1991 there are employees in some State organisations and firms in the private sector with a payroll of 1,500 people who are still paid in cash each week.  My colleagues, the Minister for Justice who is present in the House and <Col N="2220" /> the Minister for Defence have to make vast resources available so that this money can be transported.  This is unnecessary given the advances in technology. I hope following the passage of this Bill that the social partners will move quickly and conclude agreements in the best interests of the public, bearing in mind the threat to those working in wages offices who are living in fear.  We may wish to ignore it but that is the reality. Workers told me during the course of discussions on this legislation which took four years to complete that they had switched over and that it had worked extremely well for them.  Naturally, they want to get their pound of flesh and receive some remuneration from employers.  That matter is open for negotiation.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their co-operation and look forward to taking the remaining Stages as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes substantial changes in the monetary limits of the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts, in the case of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000 and in the District Court from £2,500 to £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a number of <Col N="2221" /> other important matters.  These include provisions for the variation in future, by Government order, of the monetary limits of the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts, provisions dealing with the costs that may be recovered when a case is taken in a higher court than is necessary, an increase in the number of judges of the High and Circuit Courts and in the number of justices of the District Court, and provisions for the service by post of District Court summonses in cases of summary jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents the first instalment in a major programme of legislative reform that I plan to introduce in relation to the courts and the legal profession.  I have already announced another initiative in the courts area which does not require legislation.  That is the introduction of a small claims procedure in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The new procedure will be established as soon as necessary rules of court have been made.  Small claims courts, or procedures, operate in other jurisdictions, and I am confident that the introduction of a small claims procedure in our jurisdiction will make our courts more accessible, convenient and less costly for persons with relatively small claims.  The new procedure is consistent with my overall policy of ensuring that legal services are provided and justice is administered in a cost-effective way.  I will outline, briefly, the manner in which the small claims procedure will operate.</P>
    <P>Under the procedure, a claimant may, instead of issuing a civil process in the ordinary way, apply to have a claim, not exceeding in value £500, processed through the small claims procedure.  The procedure will not apply to claims related to personal injuries, damage arising from a traffic accident and hire purchase, leasing or other loan arrangements.</P>
    <P>The application will be made on the appropriate form to the Small Claims Registrar at the nearest District Court Office.  The claimant may call to the office for assistance in completing the form.  A fee of £5 must be paid with each application. The Small Claims Registrar will <Col N="2222" /> consider each application and take whatever steps he may deem necessary, whether by way of interview of the claimant, or otherwise, to record the full facts of the claim.</P>
    <P>The registrar will attempt to settle the claim between the parties, and may interview the parties themselves, or any other person who may be relevant in assessing the claim.  If a settlement between the parties is reached, particulars of the settlement will be recorded by the registrar. If the registrar cannot effect a settlement between the parties, he will refer the matter for hearing in the District Court and he will inform both parties of the date, time and place of hearing.  At the hearing, the Small Claims Registrar will present the facts as set out in the claim to the district justice.  The claimant and respondent will be liable for their own witness and legal costs, if any.</P>
    <P>I have decided to establish the procedure initially on a pilot scheme in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, in Cork and at two other District Court venues.  My intention is to extend the procedure to all District Court venues as soon as the pilot scheme has been fully tested.</P>
    <P>I plan to introduce a further Bill &mdash; a Courts and Courts Officers Bill &mdash; before the end of the year.  It will deal in particular with the establishment of a Court of Civil Appeal.</P>
    <P>Although it would not be appropriate to discuss the detailed proposals in advance, my general approach is to create a structure in which the Supreme Court would deal only with appeals in the more important cases involving issues of law, including, of course, all appeals in constitutional cases.  All other appeals from the High Court would be heard by the new Court of Civil Appeal.</P>
    <P>A Bill to amend the law relating to solicitors has been in preparation for some time.  Last year the Fair Trade Commission published a very comprehensive report following their study into restrictive practices in the legal profession. I will be introducing a Solicitors' (Amendment) Bill very shortly.  It will be a major piece of legislation which will <Col N="2223" /> take account of the various recommendations made by the Fair Trade Commission for changes in the law relating to solicitors.</P>
    <P>The Bill will include important provisions relating to the disciplinary provisions governing solicitors including the system for dealing with complaints and various new measures for the protection of solicitors' clients.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will probably be aware, there is no corresponding legislation regulating barristers.  Many of the Fair Trade Commission's recommendations are for fundamental changes in existing practices in the barrister's profession.</P>
    <P>I have made it a priority to initiate a dialogue with representatives of the Bar Council on the subject of change in the profession.  I met with the chairman and other members of the council on 10 April last.  I am encouraged by the response I got from them and I am aware that the Bar Council are proposing to make certain changes voluntarily.  I shall be having further discussions with the Bar Council soon to see what further progress can be made in this area.</P>
    <P>I shall return now to the proposals in the present Bill.  The limits of the civil jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts were fixed originally by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and were increased first in 1953, mainly to compensate for the fall in the value of money.  They were again increased by the Courts Act, 1971. The limits were last increased by the Courts Act, 1981, and on that occasion the civil jurisdiction in contract, tort and related jurisdictions was fixed at £15,000 for the Circuit Court and £2,500 for the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission in their recent report into restrictive practices in the legal profession suggested that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be increased to £25,000 and that the jurisdiction of the District Court should be increased to £5,000.</P>
    <P>The Government, after careful consideration, have decided to increase the Circuit Court's jurisdiction in contract and tort to £30,000 and the District <Col N="2224" /> Court's jurisdiction in these matters to £5,000.  Other jurisdictions of the Circuit Court which have been traditionally linked with the contract and tort limit, will also be similarly increased.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts Act, 1981, the Circuit Court's jurisdiction limit in actions relating to title to land and in equity cases was increased to £200 rateable valuation. However, the court's jurisdiction under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, remains limited to land with a rateable valuation not exceeding £60.  There is no good reason for leaving the court with a lesser jurisdiction in registration of title matters and the Bill increases the rateable valuation limit to £200 in these matters.</P>
    <P>The District Court's jurisdiction limit in contract and tort cases will be increased from £2,500 to £5,000.  Other jurisdiction limits which are traditionally linked with these limits are also being increased to £5,000.  These proposed increases in the jurisdiction limits of the Circuit and District Courts &mdash; which double the existing limits &mdash; are contained in sections 2 to 10 and section 13 of the Bill, and are fully justified having regard to the level of inflation since the last increase.</P>
    <P>The proposed increased jurisdiction limits of the lower courts will make access to the courts in civil matters cheaper and more convenient for litigants.  The District and Circuit Courts are located conveniently around the country.  As a result of my proposals, legal and other costs should be significantly reduced for the public over a wide range of litigation, as it will be possible to initiate many more actions in the District and Circuit Courts where costs are lower and cases are disposed of more speedily.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned, in particular, about the escalating cost of liability insurance, and are committed to reform of the present arrangements for the determination of personal injury actions.  I expect that the proposals in this Bill will lead to a substantial transfer of personal injuries actions from the High Court to the lower courts, resulting in savings in legal and other costs, such as <Col N="2225" /> travelling expenses for litigants and witnesses. This should have a particularly beneficial effect on the level of legal costs in these cases which comprise the majority of cases heard in the High Court, and facilitate reductions in the real cost of motor, public liability and employer insurance.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes in sections 11 and 12 to increase the jurisdiction of the lower courts in important areas of family law.  The Bill provides for an increase in the weekly amount that the District Court and the Circuit Court on appeal may order under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, for the maintenance of a spouse and dependent child, from £100 to £200 for a spouse and from £30 to £60 for a child.  These increases will assist many deserted spouses in obtaining substantially increased maintenance for themselves and for their children.  A similar increase in the weekly amount that may be awarded by the District Court for the maintenance of a child under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, from £30 to £60, is also proposed.</P>
    <P>It has been necessary in the past for the Government to bring an amending Bill before the Oireachtas each time they desired to increase the jurisdiction limits of the Circuit and District Courts.  Section 16 of the Bill contains an important provision which will allow the Government in future to revise, by order, the monetary limits of these courts having regard to changes in the general value of money since the limits were previously revised. This provision will enable the real value of the monetary limits of the lower courts to be readily maintained at the levels approved of by the Oireachtas in this Bill. It will avoid the necessity of amending legislation each time the Government consider that the jurisdiction limits should be revised to take account of changes in the value of money.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that if it were desired at a future date to alter the civil jurisdiction limits of these courts other than in line with changes in the value of money, this could only be done by <Col N="2226" /> introducing legislation.  The new provision will apply to all monetary jurisdiction limits conferred on the courts in civil matters, whether conferred in courts legislation or in other enactments.  It will also allow for the variation of amounts specified elsewhere in this Bill in regard to the recovery of costs by a plaintiff in a civil action.  I will come back to this matter later.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that, because of the importance of any decision to increase the jurisdiction limits of the lower courts, a motion of both Houses of the Oireachtas approving of any proposed Government draft order will be required before the order can take effect.</P>
    <P>I am proposing in section 17 of the Bill to increase the maximum number of High Court judges from 14 to 16, in addition to the President of the High Court.  I assured the Oireachtas, when the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, was being debated that I would keep its effect on the workload of the High Court under close review.  Experience to date indicates that the Act has had a significant impact on the workload of the High Court, and two additional judges are needed to ensure that these complex and often time consuming cases are dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>At present, there are two temporary Circuit Court judges and six temporary district justices.  It has become clear that the increase in work which gave rise to these temporary appointments is likely to continue, and the Bill recognises that fact by providing a sufficient complement of permanent judges for the Circuit and District Courts to deal with the current workload. This is provided by sections 18 and 19 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The number of permanent ordinary judges of the Circuit Court is being increased from 15 to 17.  Provision is being made for eight Circuit Court judges to be assigned permanently to the Dublin circuit and two to the Cork circuit.  At present, six judges are permanently assigned to the Dublin circuit and one judge to each of the other circuits.  The number of permanent justices of the District <Col N="2227" /> Court is being increased from 39 to 45, in addition to the President of the District Court.  I am satisfied that these changes are necessary in the interests of the efficient administration of justice in the Circuit and District Courts.</P>
    <P>A further important proposal, in section 21 of the Bill, provides for the service of summonses by registered post in summary cases.  This represents a major change in the existing law governing the service of summonses which dates back to 1851.  At present, under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summonses must be served personally by the Garda.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of these summonses relate to parking and other road traffic offences.  The existing system of personal service dates from a time when modern developments in the law relating to road traffic offences could not have been foreseen. The present system of personal service for these types of offences is archaic in present day circumstances, but more importantly it is very costly in terms of Garda resources.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer invests substantial sums of money in training and maintaining the Garda Síochána.  It is, therefore, imperative that the manpower resources of the Garda Síochána are utilised in the most cost efficient manner to provide an effective police service to the public.</P>
    <P>As soon as the new system of summons service is introduced it should be possible to release about 60 gardaí who are full-time engaged on summons service duties in the Dublin area for the operational police duties for which they have been trained.  When the new system is operating on a nationwide basis, it should be possible to release about a further 70 gardaí outside the Dublin area for operational duties.  A second major benefit from the new summons service system will be that a much improved rate of summons service is likely to be achieved, with a resultant increase in revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the provision in the Bill for service of summonses by <Col N="2228" /> registered post will not replace the existing system of personal service of summonses. It is additional to the existing system of personal service, which will be retained for summonses which cannot be served by post.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the Bill &mdash; in section 15 &mdash; will enable the Circuit Court to transfer a case to the District Court at the request of a party to an action, on the ground that it should have been commenced in that court.  Where the case remitted is for unliquidated damages, the District Court will be empowered to make an award up to £10,000, that is, twice its proposed new jurisdiction limit. The High Court has power already to remit a case to the Circuit or District Court on similar grounds.  Under section 4, the District Court will be empowered to hear and determine an action above its statutory limit of £5,000 where the parties to the action consent.  A similar provision operates already in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It is essential, if the increases in jurisdictions provided for in this Bill are to effect a real reduction in litigation costs, that plaintiffs are encouraged to initiate their actions in the lowest court which has jurisdiction to hear them.  This is also desirable from a social viewpoint, as otherwise litigants who are financially better off would have an advantage over poorer litigants.  This policy is reflected in statutory provisions in courts legislation which generally limit the costs which a successful litigant may recover, in an action, to the costs appropriate to the lowest court having jurisdiction to grant the relief given.</P>
    <P>The current provisions governing the limitation of plaintiff's costs are contained in section 17 of the Courts Act, 1981.  These give a wide latitude to the courts to grant costs which are higher than the level of costs appropriate to the lowest court having jurisdiction to grant relief.</P>
    <P>I have decided in the light of experience of the working of these provisions that further restrictions are necessary on the grant of higher costs.  Accordingly, section 14 of the Bill, which substitutes a <Col N="2229" /> new section 17 in the 1981 Act, contains revised proposals to limit the recovery of costs by a successful plaintiff in a civil action.</P>
    <P>Generally, I am proposing that the courts' discretion to award higher costs should be limited to cases in the High Court where damages between £25,000 and £30,000 are awarded.  In such cases, Circuit Court costs only will be payable unless the judge certifies that it was reasonable, in the interests of justice, that the action should have been determined in the High Court.  In the case of an action taken in the High Court, where the damages awarded are between £15,000 and £25,000, Circuit Court costs only will be recoverable and where the damages are between £5,000 and £15,000, a successful plaintiff will be entitled to recover the lesser of an amount equivalent to the damages awarded, or the amount of costs at the Circuit Court level.</P>
    <P>A further disincentive to taking an action in a higher court than necessary is included in the provisions in the new section 17, subsection (5) of the Courts Act, 1981.  The courts are being given a new discretionary power to penalise a successful plaintiff who takes an action in a court, other than the court with lowest jurisdiction, by requiring the plaintiff to pay to the defendant the equivalent of the additional costs incurred by the defendant in having to defend the action in a higher court than was necessary.</P>
    <P>The new section 17 of the 1981 Act is more restrictive than the existing provisions and is intended to be so.  It reflects the Government's determination to effect a real reduction in legal costs as a consequence of the increases in the jurisdiction of the lower courts proposed in the Bill, while at the same time providing reasonable scope to a plaintiff in deciding on the appropriate court in which to commence an action, if he is not to be penalised in relation to the amount of costs he might recover.</P>
    <P>The changes in the jurisdiction limits of the Circuit and District Courts will come into effect one month after the passing of the Bill.  Other proposals that <Col N="2230" /> require rules of court to be made as to procedures will come into force after three months.  The proposals for increases in the Judiciary will come into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the main objectives of this Bill are to make litigation in the courts cheaper and speedier and to facilitate more convenient access to the courts at local venues.  This will be achieved by a doubling of the present jurisdiction limits of the Circuit and District Courts.</P>
    <P>Future revisions of jurisdiction limits can be effected more quickly and simply by Government order under the Bill.  A modern arrangement for serving summonses is being introduced which will release more gardaí for operational duties and should increase State revenue. The numbers of the Judiciary are being increased to reflect the volume of work in the courts.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It was necessary to look at the monetary limits of jurisdiction which applied in the lower courts with a view to improving the delivery of service in the courts.  However, this is not a panacea for the ills which persist in our courts.  We have grown used to long delays and quaint practices and we have not succeeded in addressing the most basic problems which exist in the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>I want to acknowledge the sterling service which the Judiciary and the administrators of justice in general have given to this State.  It is important that our system of justice be held in high esteem, and that is the case.  While the public at large have confidence in the system, there is concern at the long delays in bringing cases before the courts and the costs involved.  We need a modern, efficient system of justice delivered at reasonable cost.  Long delays in bringing cases before the courts cause undue hardship to far too many people.  In personal injury cases people who have sustained serious injury often have to wait three or four years to have their cases heard.  At a time when they most need support, they are denied it.  This must be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2231" /> We need a system of justice which will provide adequate access to the courts for all our citizens, not just for some of them. The State has an obligation under the Convention on Human Rights to provide adequate access for all citizens, irrespective of financial status.  Do the Members of this House believe that this is a reality today?  We are nowhere near arriving at a satisfactory level of access. The services of the Legal Aid Board are available to some citizens only.  Surely people of inadequate means cannot be expected to travel inordinate distances even to inquire about that scheme.</P>
    <P>In places where we have legal aid centres people cannot get service because the centres are understaffed and have long waiting lists.  As we speak, there are citizens all over the country who need legal aid but cannot get it.  We need not speak of delays in processing cases for these people since many of them will never succeed in bringing their cases before the courts in the first place.  They are denied a basic constitutional right.  It is entirely unsatisfactory and very wrong.</P>
    <P>A few months ago the Minister decided to open three new centres while the existing ones were only partly operational and in some cases were closed.  Will the Minister do his utmost to bring about adequate access to the courts for all our citizens?  Will he agree that lack of finance should never prevent one from seeking his or her rights through the courts?  The Minister should bring forward a legal aid Bill to confer the right of access to justice on all our citizens.  He should examine the most efficient way of bringing this about whether through private practitioners or by extending a network of properly staffed legal aid centres.  Poverty should not prevent a citizen from seeking out justice through the proper channels.  The State has a duty to confer the basic constitutional rights on all its citizens irrespective of one's financial status.  It is failing in that duty now.</P>
    <P>The increased jurisdiction of the lower courts will inevitably entail a great increase in the number of cases coming before these courts.  Should we not now <Col N="2232" /> consider the setting up of a family law tribunal to hear certain family disputes? This would have the advantage of freeing up the business of the lower courts on the one hand while allowing us the opportunity to set up procedures to deal with matters appertaining to family law in a sensitive way thereby reducing the distress and trauma that are always involved in family breakdown.  Will the Minister agree that those responsible for handling family law cases should have a basic understanding of psycology and an understanding of family dynamics?  A family law tribunal can be set up by Statute under Article 34 of the Constitution. I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to this proposal especially in view of the huge increase in the incidence of family breakdown in recent years.  For obvious reasons there should be a minimum of delay in processing applications to the court for barring orders, for example, and for maintenance orders and child custody.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in the maximum maintenance order payments in the District Court as proposed in section 11 of the Bill.  This is a sensible increase and will allow a majority of cases to be dealt with in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the present state of play on the proposals the Minister was preparing to put before us to close courthouses all over the country? Will the Government now reconsider their position in that regard?  Has the Minister examined the likely increase in the number of cases coming before the courts in the light of the extension of jurisdiction proposed in the Bill?  Has he examined the changes that occured when jurisdiction was extended previously in 1981?  Will it be necessary to provide extra accommodation?  In view of the fact that it is proposed to increase the number of High Court judges from 14 to 16, will the Minister also be proposing to appoint extra support staff there?  There is no mention of that in the explanatory memorandum.  It is also proposed to increase the number of District Court justices from 39 to 45.  Surely there is a need, too, to appoint additional <Col N="2233" /> registrars and clerks.  Has the Minister made provision for this?  Has he decided what the extra requirements are?  There is no mention of that in the memorandum either.</P>
    <P>This Bill will inevitably place a heavier burden on the lower courts.  If the Minister has not done his homework it is possible that a Bill which was intended to remedy problems in the administration of justice could well, at least for a time, make the situation worse.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on this in his reply.</P>
    <P>The administration of justice remains unsatisfactory.  There is much this House can do to improve this area so I am glad the Minister in his introduction brought forward some new ideas in that respect. There is much the legal profession can do also.  Long delays in bringing cases before the courts bring the law into disrepute and lead to frustration among the general public.  High costs prevent people from seeking justice and we are all forced to bear the brunt of that in the form of unreasonable insurance costs, for example.  To be successful the fight against crime needs prompt prosecution and sentencing of criminals.  We are well aware that long periods on bail leads to further crime in the interim.  As well as examining ways of improving the delivery of justice the Government should turn their attention to the prevention of crime by dealing with the symptoms when they are first noticed.  A proper investment in treatment for child abuse cases, an improvement in the level of child literacy, support for families who are unable to cope and other such measures would take a great deal of strain off the system of justice.  Indeed, if we do not pay attention to these areas we are likely to witness an explosion in the time bomb of crime.  We are seeing it already in the huge increase in juvenile crime.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents only a tentative step in the direction of a proper system of justice.  Maybe some of the positive noises we have heard recently from the Minister and the Taoiseach and other members of the Government will result in a positive programme being introduced.  I <Col N="2234" /> welcome some of the ideas put forward in this Bill.  In particular, without examining the Bill in detail at this stage. I think the small claims procedure in the District Court is an excellent innovation.  I am glad to see the procedure will be established fairly soon and I look forward to seeing how effective it will be and how it will lessen the strain on some of our courts.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that the Minister proposes to introduce a court and courts officers Bill, and a Bill to amend the law relating to solicitors.  In the Minister's statement to the House this evening are the seeds of fundamental changes in the administration of justice.  He will have my full support for any of the far-reaching proposals he intends to bring before the House and I hope we will be very successful in dealing with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Cotter in welcoming this Bill which will have the full support of the Labour Party.  I think we would all agree that many of the proposals in the Bill are long overdue.  I would like also to refer to the situation of courthouses.  Those of us involved in local authorities, and there are many, understand fully and appreciate that that aspect of the whole operation of the courts has been very badly neglected over the years, the reason being that courthouses very often are located outside the territory controlled by the county council. For example, while the county council in Louth have responsibility for the courthouses in Dundalk and Drogheda, Drogheda Corporation and Dundalk Urban District Council have no responsibility for them.  Therefore, I feel they are contained in a sort of no man's land and are very low in priority as far as local authorities have been concerned.  That situation must be addressed because many of the buildings are in a dangerous condition, to say the least, and were not designed for this century.  They do not have proper facilities for consultation between solicitors and clients and are deplorable in terms of lighting, heating and acoustics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions under which solicitors, <Col N="2235" /> judges and particularly the public have to operate are deplorable.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister would take that on board and give some indication of what his Department propose to do.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is responsible for that, it is a matter that comes under a completely different heading than justice but one that could play a very important role in the efficient administration of this Bill and of justice as a whole.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the idea of changing the serving of summons procedure to registered post as opposed to using gardaí in this way.  On many occasions I have seen at first hand gardaí going to places of work, to places of entertainment or to peoples' homes trying to serve summonses. It is, to say the least, a ridiculous waste of Garda time when they could be engaged much more usefully on the beat to restrict the level of crime on the streets and towns rather than chasing after people trying to serve a piece of paper on them.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in the Minister's speech reference to many of the items of legislation under which we are currently operating. We are back into the mid-18th century in terms of British law under which the Garda Síochána still have to operate 150 years later.  The Minister referred to increased revenue.  That money should be channelled into courthouses and the back-up services necessary to service the additional members of the Judiciary who will be appointed.  I support that proposal and compliment the Minister on making that decision, because the delays involved in having cases heard from one court to another is absolutely ludicrous.  In fact, some people have to wait years to get into the High Court, unless it is a very serious and urgent matter.  Many of the cases on which I have had to give evidence in the High Court on wages and conditions of employment were waiting two, three or four years before they were dealt with.  I do not know the absolute answer to that problem but I hope the shifting of emphasis and the appointment of more judges will be dealt with more speedily.  It must <Col N="2236" /> be frustrating also for the Garda Síochána who have to operate under these conditions and the delays which consistently occur.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the new proposal dealing with deserted spouses because this is an ever growing problem.  Many men walk away from their wives and families and take no responsibility whatsoever for their maintenance.  One often gets the impression that this is done deliberately. I do not think the taxpayer who has to pay his PAYE every week should be asked to foot the bill for people who run away from their responsibilities.  I am glad that at last some positive move is being made in this Bill to come to grips with that problem.  The guy who is hiding in London or Birmingham will not be found, but the efficiency of the courts in dealing with the matter will be of assistance to everyone, including the Members of this House and other public representatives, who are left to sort out the problems and pick up the pieces afterwards. The question of family courts has to be looked at because it is a new development.  This problem was around in the mid-18th century, unlike some of the other matters referred to in the Minister's speech.  It is a new phenomenon and one we will have to look at very carefully.  The public are concerned about the manner in which that aspect of justice is administered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  In his reply I hope the Minister will be able to give us some details on the points already raised and on the points I am sure Deputy McCartan will raise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party fully support this legislation and will support its Second Reading.  Nonetheless, there are a number of matters we could deal with by way of amendment, although having considered the legislation, there is nothing of great substance that needs to be dealt with by way of amendment.  This is substantial legislation which, in effect, proposes increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts, increasing the number of judges and providing for service of <Col N="2237" /> summonses by registered post; each in its own way is important and welcome.  As with so many innovative Bills coming before this House, we are often left wondering why it has taken so long for such an obvious and clearly needed reform, such as the service of summonses by registered post, to be introduced, particularly having regard to the Minister's startling revelation that that simple amendment of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, would make available 60 extra gardaí to walk the beat in Dublin alone.  That is a remarkable, startling statistic in itself and says a lot for previous Ministers for Justice who have failed to address this matter sooner.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the legislation must be recognised for what it is and its limitations. It seems that the Government, in seeking to address their programme for the local government elections, sent the Minister for Justice back to his Department to look again at his legislative programme and to come forward as quickly as possible with any type of new legislation that could be announced at the press conference which launched Fianna Fail's local government programme a few days ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that a very useful start to a legislative programme was brought forward in that stark and narrow way &mdash; to simply increase the jurisdictions, to play around with the backlog of litigation and increase the number of judges is not enough.  Left on their own, they may prove to be a set of proposals that will boomerang on the Minister rather than help to promote an image of a Government attempting to catch up on legislative reform in the few weeks before the local election date.  That is the image that comes across in the media reports of what has been going on in the Minister's Department.  His rare appearances in this House in recent months to deal with any of the debates in the area of his remit would make it <Col N="2238" /> almost impossible for us to find out what is going on in the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>We were told that the Government, in the last number of weeks, realised that the phenomenon of the massive increase in crime in the Dublin area would be a major issue for debate and that the Department of Justice had to get their act together and start coming up with some scale of proposals.  The reports in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> are extremely worrying and I have no doubt are more worrying for the Minister for Justice than for many other Deputies when one sees that the level of crime in the north Dublin area in particular has risen dramatically in the past year.</P>
      <P>Today I spoke at a meeting of the Raheny Businessmen's Association; it is very sad to see a well settled area like Raheny which has a good reputation noted in the front pages of the national media as recording the single highest increase in crime, in the order of 28 per cent, almost one third up on last year and far greater than anything recorded on the south side of Dublin or indeed in the country.  In that regard we have been presented in the last week with two Bills by the Minister for Justice, the Courts (No. 1), Bill, 1991, and the Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1991, before us today.  The Minister introduced them with a fanfare and a flourish and said that they were the first instalment in a major programme of legislative reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principles of these concepts taken in isolation cannot be argued with.  It is important to increase the number of judges and the question of redressing the jurisdictional level is long overdue as it is a decade since this was last done.  It is also certainly long overdue to release the 60 or so members of the Garda Síochána who are tied up with serving summons, a job foisted on them by an 1851 Act.  As I said, in principle and taken in isolation, these are very good concepts but there is a far greater programme of legislative reform needed, far greater than anything about which the Minister spoke this evening and far greater than anything contained in the Bill before us.  It is not enough to increase jurisdictional levels <Col N="2239" /> and the number of judges; what is at issue here is the whole credibility and confidence that the public can retain in our Judiciary and the way in which justice is administered.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Seán Barrett speaking on this subject last week.  It is often a phenomenon of debates of this sort, particularly in relation to members of the conservative and right parties, that they preface their remarks about any debate on the Judiciary, the administration of justice and the functioning of our courts generally, by saying we must honour, respect and defend at all times the independence of the Judiciary.  It is a concept with which I do not have any difficulty but, apparently, it is something I am first to be reminded of whenever an element of criticism or controversy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Or character assassination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; enters any contribution with regard to the Judiciary, the functions of the courts or indeed any matters dealing with that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest threat to the independence of the Judiciary, to the maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice and indeed in the development of public support for our courts and Judiciary is the indifference which successive Ministers for Justice have shown in this House to the general conditions of courthouses, the fabric of the buildings and the way we have vested the Judiciary and the officers of our courts to expeditiously deal with their workload &mdash; and our needs &mdash; in an intelligent, accessible and understandable manner.  It is this failure of successive Governments and Ministers for Justice to address this problem which has allowed our courts to become out-of-date, archaic buildings, outmoded and unsuited to the jobs we have given them.  We have allowed our courts to be administered by a plethora of paper pushing, file amassing civil servants, incapable of dealing with the weight of paper which surrounds our litigation. This allows the backlog of cases <Col N="2240" /> to develop which, in time, will do more damage to the independence of the Judiciary and to the reposit in them of the respect and support which they deserve and require to ensure effective administration of justice.  In that context, the Bill before us is utterly inadequate to deal with the job facing the Minister; it is a rushed job, a cobbling together of a number of isolated ideas in the Department which might appeal to those who have not thought deeply about what is involved.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facilities we make available to judges in which to work with their court clerks and registrars and to members of the public who come before our courts seeking redress, a fair hearing and speedy disposal of their litigation.  As Deputy Bell pointed out, many of the court buildings, particularly at the District Court and lower levels, are in a shabby, if not dangerous condition. Many of them are close to falling down; they are draughty, leaking and an insult to the concept of judges being required to sit in them with dignity to dispense justice.</P>
    <P>What does a member of the public think when he or she arrives as a litigant, or as a witness?  They must stand in court rooms with bare, dusty and knotted floor boards; they must sit in an adjoining room because there is not adequate space in the courtroom.  There is very poor amplification in the courthouse with the result that nobody can hear what is being said or follow what is happening.  There is nowhere for people to consult their lawyers apart from the street, across the road in a public house or on the stairwell or draughty corridors in many of the court buildings.  Week in, week out, judges complain that they must use buckets in their consulting rooms and in their own chambers to collect the water dripping from the roof.  They have entered into endless correspondence with the Department of Justice in the hope that something will be done with the fabric of the buildings.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that there are pockets of improvements; for example, Waterford has a reasonably modern and effective <Col N="2241" /> Circuit Court building in which to administer justice.  However, that was as a result of solicitors and lawyers in Waterford bringing declaratory action in the High Court against the Minister of the day under existing legislation and regulations dating back to the last century, obliging the Minister to maintain proper conditions.  They were supported in their action by the Law Society and ultimately won the day, forcing the Minister to settle.  It was hoped, as a result of that litigation, it would lead to a serious commitment by the Department to improve conditions comprehensively around the country, but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge that particular local authorities have been singularly progressive in the area providing good court accommodation.  Bray in particular &mdash; and Wicklow County Council &mdash; are to be commended in this regard.  However, I reiterate the point made by Deputy Bell that there is not a single authority, one office or area responsible for the national development of our courts stock and building.  It is a matter for the local authority in many instances but the problem here is that local authorities often have to raise money by way of a loan and are out of pocket because the Department are so slow to recoup the expenses; the interest paid by the local authority is never recouped.  There is a disincentive to local authorities to carry out improvements to buildings.  Local authorities often ask why it should be their responsibility to carry out repairs to buildings when the buildings carry a far wider remit of responsibility in relation to the circuit courts&mdash;or higher courts&mdash;in the Dublin area in particular.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have responsibility for the maintenance of many of the buildings in the greater Dublin area, particularly the impressive Four Courts.  It is a matter of great frustration to the Presidents of the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court, and indeed to the Chief Justice's office to have to deal with endless correspondence with the Department and the Office of Public Works requesting the carrying out of very basic maintenance work.  We see <Col N="2242" /> judges pictured with a fine array of shelving displayed behind them.  That is an unmistakable feature of the chamber of any judge who is taking his job seriously, but there is difficulty in getting proper funding for building up library stocks so that judges have ready and easy access to books for research purposes.  For various reasons I have had occasion to visit the chambers of judges and those people have a major problem as regards the accommodation available to them.  The range and quality available is laughable. It is time the Department considered the establishment of a single courts building authority, outside the responsibility of the Department of Justice, the Office of Public Works and local authorities.  It is time to give the job to one single authority within the administration of the judges, with a budget to carry out their work.  Those people have the expertise and the knowledge of what is needed and what should be done.</P>
    <P>If we want to ensure that the Judiciary have the respect and authority they deserve we should provide them with the working conditions appropriate to their status in life.  If we can spend £17 million in providing a good suite of offices for the highest office holder in the land, there should be some degree of priority in the way we provide for our courts throughout the country.  The point has been made that one of the reasons the Department are so slow to move on this issue is that they do know their own mind.  They cannot make up their mind whether they intend to close down many of the more remote District Courts and centralise the system by moving District Courts into the same towns in which Circuits Courts already exist.  I am not at all happy with the programme in this regard.  As I have stated in the House previously, District Courts should remain close to the community or district not only in name but in location.  I would ask the Minister to set out a programme for the refurbishment of our court buildings.  They should be modern and efficient, and there should be no difficulty in that regard.  There are some very good examples around the country. <Col N="2243" /> The second matter that is of great concern and is not addressed in this brief legislation is the issue I have raised here a number of times, that is the appointment of the Judiciary.  It is clear that all previous administrations have appointed judges on a party political basis.  It seems that apart from the statutory period of time a barrister or solicitor must be in practice, be it seven or ten years, the only other qualification required to be a judge is that they have shown favour or allegiance in their private practice towards the Government party or parties of the day.  That is a matter that is beginning to cause concern to the public who believe that more democratic criteria should be laid down for the appointment of these people to very high positions in the community, positions that are extremely well remunerated and are on a par with, if not higher than those of our senior civil servants and other public office holders who are appointed by means of an interview body, entirely independent of any lobby or party political favour, open in its deliberations, comprehensive in its considerations and democratic and fair in its decisions.  Such a system must be introduced at an early date with regard to our Judiciary.  There is no reason an independent commission of appointment should not apply to the Judiciary.  Why should the appointment of these people be different from the appointment of any other senior civil servant whose job is independent and is seen to be so in all respects.</P>
    <P>A proposal that could be taken on board in this regard without any difficulty, and indeed without any legislation, is the appointment of judges by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach or the Cabinet.  The Taoiseach of the day could transfer this task from his office to that of the Council of State advising the President.  She, in consultation with a committee already established and representing a broad range of interests in our community, could consider a short list of appointees to the various benches.  We would then begin to take this legislation more seriously.  We <Col N="2244" /> would begin to understand that the Minister for Justice has a commitment to ensuring the independence of the Judiciary and that they are given the highest respect possible.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of weeks we have had an unseemly debate surrounding the highest office of the Judiciary, the Chief Justice and others.  That type of debate should not be repeated but it will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan has enjoyed a certain freedom in the matter of general comment which may be more appropriate to an Estimates debate.  He will appreciate that he should apply himself to what is in this Bill and what could, with amendment, emerge from it.  He has not so indicated, and I would ask him to satisfy those two fundamental requirements of Second Stage. Deputies should address themselves to what is in the legislation or to that which they propose should be in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought I was doing.  I do not intend to labour any point at great length.  I am addressing what I believe should be in the legislation, proposals which would in some way enhance the administration of justice generally as the Minister suggests the legislation should do.  I am responding to some of the points raised by the Minister for Justice in his opening speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate we have had over the past couple of weeks in respect of the pensions legislation was unseemly in many respects and should not be repeated, but it will be repeated if issues like this emerge.  One of the ways to overcome this difficulty with regard to the appointment of members of the Judiciary at all levels, including the European Court, is to establish an independent commission and invite all qualified applicants who are interested in the position to submit their names to be included on a short list, as is maintained at present by the Department of Justice in respect of the District Courts.  The commission should then be allowed to set out clear job specifications for all positions and interview whoever is interested.  Those appointed should be <Col N="2245" /> appointed independently with specific job specifications and there should be no capacity at a later stage for people to say that they were made promises or given undertakings or assurances that their terms of reference would be put right later.  That is the way to get over that difficulty.  If that were done we would be going a long way towards ensuring an independent judiciary that will command and deserve the respect of all in the community.</P>
    <P>It is now time that the Department introduced a programme for judge training. If members of the Judiciary are invited to apply for positions in the High Court, the Circuit Court or the District Court and put their names on a list as potential applicants, they should while waiting appointment undergo a course of training on the various aspects of the job, including the administrative responsibilities of a judge.  Many judges working on a day to day basis in the courts have to be not only deciders of fact and law but also very clever court administrators in the juggling around of lists, and the backlog of work to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Such training is important and is particularly important for registrars and clerks. Many court administrators come from within the Department of Justice or other Government Departments after having been appointed as junior civil servants and progressing up the scale but they are not given courses of training to meet their work as court administrators.  Many registrars and clerks undertake educational programmes on their own initiative through the Institute of Public Administration or through a university and as soon as they obtain their qualification, degree and enhancement of status are moved on to other Departments or other sections within the Department of Justice.  That problem was adverted to in the context of the Land Registry in that as soon as or shortly after many of the officials became expert in their areas they were moved on to other sections of the Department.  The problem affects the administration of justice in the courts, particularly with regard to their day to day workings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2246" /> Once appointed to the Bench judges should be asked to attend courses on social problems and social statistics and awareness.  They should also be given the opportunity to take a break from their job.  It is interesting that judges of the Australian High Court are obliged every three years to take a year away from work in order to engage in research work, travel, or undertake investigation of the administration of justice in other countries. That is an excellent idea.  Quite often our judges become weary of their workload and the constant grind of sitting day in and day out hearing the same issues in courts, going over the same kind of cases, meeting the same people before them and, at the end of the day, having no opportunity to reflect on their job in a broader sense and develop a perspective on their job and responsibilities. Much work can be done in that regard but it has not been addressed in the Bill. Increasing the numbers of judges and juggling around with the backlog and workload of the caseload by simply changing jurisdictional levels will not remedy the fundamental problems that attack as a cancer the way justice is administered in our courts.</P>
    <P>It is also high time that our courts were computerised and worked on a computer network.  I invite the Minister, or the Minister of State &mdash; the Minister having yet again departed early from the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the one thing we keep hearing about the Minister.  He is a very busy man, indeed.  He is so busy that perhaps it is time, now that the portfolio of Communications has been taken from him, that the Justice portfolio was taken from him.  The Minister should ask someone from the Department of Justice to stroll into the central office of the High Court, the nerve centre of the High Court network, look right and left as he or she goes in the door and see the mess there.  Files are shoved, pushed and <Col N="2247" /> left hanging half in place in closeted compartments right along the serried ranks. Every document filed and dealt with in the civil process of the High Court is in written form and has to be filed in the central office of the High Court.  How can we expect efficient administrative operation of our courts when we have such an archaic, antediluvian method of recording the proceedings and processing of court documents?</P>
      <P>I remember some ten of 15 years ago visiting the Magistrates Court in Edinburgh and being amazed to see the clerk of that court at the end of a computer terminal with a telephone to hand.  On inquiring as to what kind of job was being done, I was advised that the clerk had to constantly telephone to find out information essential to the judge dealing with the administration of justice.  A similar system operates in London in the Magistrates Court in Bow Street, which we hear so much about, and in other Magistrates Courts.  The clerks find out about such matters as previous criminal records from the Central Criminal Records Office, the availability of probation schemes, the opportunitiès to put people into remand homes and what is available to a judge in regard to custody provisions.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan, sílim go bhfuil tú ar seachrán beagáinín arís.  The Deputy is making a very interesting contribution but is straying somewhat.  He has to relate his contribution to what is proposed in the legislation.  The Deputy said the Bill was scant and if it is scanty we must deal with it in all its scantiness; we cannot use it as a means of extended commentary on every aspect of the legal process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I do not wish to get into argument or debate with you.  This is the second time you have interrupted me.  The purport of the debate, as I understand it, ranges from the Bill which contains general provisions on the administration of justice, to the Minister's speech which dealt with a wide programme of legislative reform, and the <Col N="2248" /> contributions of other speakers, on the general effectiveness of the administration of justice.  I have a few short points to make, perhaps sometimes in a longwinded way, but, nonetheless, I have a short number of points.  I will not take much more time.</P>

      <P>I do not like the Deputy's use of the word &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo;. The Chair has to remind all Deputies of our approach to different Stages of legislation.  On Committee Stage, there will inevitably and invariably be the occasional comment on measures not provided for in legislation under discussion. The Deputy will accept, when he reads his contribution at a later stage, that he has made a little more than brief reference to what is not in the Bill or what cannot be in it and made no lengthy reference to what is in the Bill and what he would hope might be included in it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In relation to this aspect of the debate, the Minister introduced the Bill as being representative of his first instalment of &ldquo;a major programme of legislative reform&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's suggested programme, there is a great number of matters, some of which I have dealt with and some of which I will have to abandon in view of the strictures being laid on me by the Chair, that the Minister should look at again to see if he can fit into the busy schedule of work he has, some of the ideas I have advanced.</P>
      <P>The Minister also dealt at great length with the concept of this scheme of small claims courts.  Before I go any further, might I inquire of the Chair if I am allowed to make some comment in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entitled to comment on any matter referred to by the Minister in his introduction.  The Chair was advising the Deputy that if the Minister says he intends to appoint two new Circuit Court judges and says no more, that may not be used as an opportunity to discuss at <Col N="2249" /> great length all the qualifications, real and imaginary, that any District Court justice might have.  Of course the Deputy is entitled to comment on anything he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt at length with the concept of the small claims system and explained how it would operate.  I welcome the introduction of the system.  The question of resources arises here.  We must bear in mind that the Minister is proposing to double the jurisdiction of the District Court but he has not given any estimate of the extent to which the workload of the District Court will be increased as a result of this extended jurisdiction.  Neither has he given any indication that the staff of the District Court will be increased other than that there will be an increase in the number of District Justices and temporary District Justices available.  If the Minister is serious about establishing a small claims system in the District Court, then it is incumbent on him to explain how the personnel will be increased to implement those proposals.  It is clear that there will be a massive increase in the work of the District Court and the Minister should be in a position to tell us how he intends to ensure that the proposals on paper are matched by action, that is, with the provision of additional court space and extra court officers so the system can work efficiently.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister satisfied himself that the system being devised is non-statutory and will work effectively and be in keeping with the Constitution?  The Constitution provides in general terms that justice shall be administered by courts established and courts appointed.  The process here is one where an officer of the court, a registrar, will have the responsibility in the District Court area. I presume, unless I am advised to the contrary, that the registrar will in all probability be the court clerk for the District Court area and that the registrar or his or her assistant will be the person responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of a small <Col N="2250" /> claims system.  I am anxious that it will work efficiently and effectively with adequate staff and resources and will not be open to challenge in the High Court. In regard to a litigant who wants to avoid being subjected to the speedy and effective mechanism of the small claims procedure, is there any way the registrar can oblige that litigant to be tied by the decision of the registrar adjudicating on it?  To put it another way, if a person insists, as it would seem the Constitution provides for, that matters be adjudicated by a judge sitting in a court established under the Constitution, is there any way that a litigant, a manufacturer of a defective product or a shopkeeper who has sold a faulty article, can be obliged to attend and abide by the decision of the registrar?  Is there a possibility that the whole process could be frustrated by people who do not want to see a system for small claims operating?  There has been a very strong lobby from certain vested interests for some time and that explains why we have not made progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the establishment of this procedure.  There is a commitment there that it will be examined and established, and I am glad it will be.  However, I would like to be assured that this is not just some quickly thought up scheme being established without legislative basis, full consultation with the Attorney General and satisfaction on the part of the Minister that what we are doing is constitutional, will be efficiently and effectively established and will work to the good of all those people who so badly need a small claims procedure.  I would like to hear from the Minister in respect of these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with a proposal to introduce a Bill to amend the law relating to solicitors, he referred in passing to the report of the Fair Trade Commission published last year and he went on to say that he was involved in dialogue with the Bar Council.  In principle, it is unfair and somewhat unbalanced that one leg of the legal profession is regulated to such an extent, which is policed by the <Col N="2251" /> High Court and which will be further policed by the introduction of a legal Ombudsman, while the other arm of the legal profession, namely, the Bar is not subjected to similar comprehensive statutory control.  It would be particularly remiss of the Minister for Justice if, in introducing legislation in response in part to the Fair Trade Commission report, he did not make the Bar also subject to the authority and policing of a legal Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>For too long a litigant has been unable to get anywhere near a recalcitrant member of the legal profession.  For too long members of the Bar have been able to retreat to the safety and the sancity of the Bar library and be subject to little or no redress by an aggrieved litigant. They have a double level of protection, that of the Bar library door on the one hand and the solicitors profession on the other who simply say that they will pass on the message and that there is no access to members of the Bar.  It is time the affairs of the Bar as a profession providing a service is put on a proper contractual basis, that when they are engaged as lawyers acting on behalf of their client they have a strict enforceable legal contract with the client, that they can be sued for negligence of duty as a solicitor can be, that they in turn can sue for recovery of their fee should they not be paid, and that the old notion that the Bar can charge no fee and expect only an honorarium should be put to sleep.  If there is to be amending legislation in response to the Fair Trade Commission report to deal with the legal profession, it must deal with the legal profession as a whole.</P>
    <P>While the Minister might have dialogue with the leaders of the Bar profession, namely the chairman and other members of the council, they are a council without leadership.  The Bar have not agreed among their own members as to how they should respond to the Fair Trade Commission report, or whether they should change at all.  We have heard time and again about the last encounter the present Minister for Industry and <Col N="2252" /> Commerce in a previous Government had with the Bar Council.  Their attitudes have not substantially changed.  They are engaged in very heated dialogue within their own chambers and there is substantial resistance to change within the Bar.  There will not be change unless the Bar is put on a similar basis to the solicitors profession, accountable to the public.  It is time to have comprehensive legislation dealing with both sectors.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission report talked about a single legal education institute to cover both professions.  It is ridiculous that two schools of legal education exist, one for the Bar and one for solicitors.  Solicitors are fully regulated in legislation dating back to 1954 but there is no legislative basis with regard to the Bar.  They are not disposed to countenance change in this area or to countenance anything that will bring the Bar profession into the closing decades of this century.  I would urge the Minister to bring his dialogue to a speedy conclusion and introduce his ideas in this area into the amending legislation which is coming before us in respect of solicitors, and deal with the legal profession as a whole.</P>
    <P>The other matter dealt with in terms of increased jurisdiction in the issue of family law provisions and the increased jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts.  I welcome this but would reiterate the point made by Deputy Cotter and others that unless we increase the resources to the law centres and legal aid centres to carry out the workload, increasing court jurisdictions will not make a whit of difference to people seeking recourse through our family law legislation. If they cannot get to court and are unable to represent themselves, changes in jurisdiction will make no difference at all.  The Minister has not addressed the point that was made throughout the debate on the judicial separation legislation that the District Court should be used as a vehicle for the implementation of the provisions of that important legislation. If we are serious about giving effective redress to spouses with difficulties in their marriages, the District <Col N="2253" /> Court should be used for all of the provisions of the Judicial Separation Act. That would make that Act work much more efficiently and effectively than it does now.</P>
    <P>I was astounded at the remarkable statistic given by the Minister for Justice in introducing the provision with regard to the service of summonses by registered post, that 60 policemen would be freed to carry out more effective policing.  I welcome that provision but it is remarkable that a Minister has not addressed this matter up to now.  I hope that the 60 gardaí who will be made available for more direct police duties will be made available in those areas that have been clearly identified as having an urgent crime problem, in particular Raheny, which has had a 28 per cent increase in crime, and the other north Dublin areas which have not had a substantial increase in policing over the past five years but which have had an alarming increase in crime, according to statistics.  These areas deserve better, particularly as the Minister is a north Dublin Deputy.</P>
    <P>This is very succinct and scant legislation which needs more attention.  It should do more than increase the number of judges and juggle around with a legal workload and backlog.  This area should get wider attention than the Minister has given in his wide-ranging speech tonight. I hope the Minister will take on board the fair criticisms I have made and agree that there is an urgent issue surrounding the administration of justice generally, about efficiency and effectiveness, about the independence of our judges and about the respect that our courts deserve from the public generally.  Unless the Minister acts to deal with the wider issues our courts unfortunately will not get the regard they deserve, and this Minister will be found to be wanting in the general area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I listened to the various speakers during the evening and I am glad that the Bill seems to have a great deal of consensus.  This Bill is needed if we are to develop the legal system in an appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has introduced most of the legislation in this House, certainly in the past year.  The Minister has been complimented from both sides of the House for the legislation he has brought forward.  It is important that the Minister receives that recognition.  He has to deal with an extremely difficult area and he has introduced some very important Bills.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the monetary limit of the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000.  I have been involved in a number of medical legal cases and I welcome the fact that such cases will be heard in the Circuit Court in future.  I also welcome the increase in the monetary limit of the civil jurisdiction of the District Court from £2,500 to £5,000.  The legal profession are well aware of the necessity for this increase.  I welcome the provisions in relation to the introduction of a small claims procedure in this jurisdiction.  I note that the Minister has promised to introduce additional provisions which will deal with the problems outlined by Deputies.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I look forward to the upgrading of certain courthouses.  The Minister has already taken certain steps in this important area.  I have been in a number of courthouses and many of them leave much to be desired.  Hopefully proposals to improve the condition of courthouses will be part and parcel of this legislation.  I am delighted to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this long overdue Bill which proposes to increase the monetary limits of the civil jurisdication of the Circuit and District Courts.  It is ridiculous that these limits were not increased years ago.  No doubt every Member has been contacted by District Court clerks, members of the Judiciary, solicitors, the general public and the Garda about the atrocious condition of courthouses.  A number of years ago I received many petitions and letters regarding the condition of courthouses. I am glad to be able to say that over the years the Government, and various Ministers for Justice, have improved the condition of many of them.  Nevertheless, there is still much room for improvement. There is a shortage of finance to carry out repairs to courthouses and erect new buildings.  However, it is clear from what has happened over the past number of years that the Government intend to improve the facilities in courthouses to the benefit of judges, solicitors, court clerks and the general public who have to operate day-in and day-out in ante-deluvian conditions.  The courthouses in Midleton and Youghal have been improved and I am sure similar improvements have been effected in other courthouses. Over the years many small claims have been dealt with by courts which were designed to deal with large claims. I am glad the Minister has finally decided to introduce a small claims procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that a Bill which will amend the law relating to solicitors will be introduced in the near future.  Over the years many people have called for the introduction of such a Bill.  Last year the Fair Trade Commission published a comprehensive report on restrictive practices in that profession.  Over the years many complaints have been made about solicitors. I have had many dealings with solicitors and in general I found them very able and accommodating.  Of course, some individuals operated on the shady side of the law and they gave that profession a bad name.  The general public have found it difficult to take proceedings against those members of that <Col N="2256" /> profession who have sullied its name.  It is time statutory regulations dealing with misbehaviour by solicitors were introduced. One of the major complaints made by the general public about solicitors is that they will not act against other solicitors in their area.  I am delighted that at last steps are being taken to deal with this problem.  Deputy McCartan referred to problems in regard to barristers and they should not be ignored.  I agree that questions need to be asked and answers given in regard to the practices of some barristers.</P>
    <P>The question of High Court judges and the number of cases dealt with in the High Court in Cork has been raised time and again.  There is a backlog of High Court cases in Cork due to the shortage of a High Court judge.  I am glad to note that there will be an increase in the number of High Court and Circuit Court judges.  It is important that court cases are dealt with speedily as many people depend on quick judgments for their livelihoods and peace of mind.  However, some people have to wait for years for court cases to be heard.  It is incumbent on the Government &mdash; I am glad they are now doing this &mdash; to increase the number of High Court judges so that more cases are dealt with.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, deplores the failure of the Government to honour commitments given by Fianna Fáil in 1985 to <Col N="2257" /> (1)  abolish local charges and to repeal the legislation under which they were introduced, namely the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1983,</P>
    <P>(2)  put local authority financing on a sound basis by the introduction of new legislation to provide that local authorities would receive a guaranteed statutory contribution each year;</P>
    <P>noting that the failure of Central Government to provide adequate finances has led to a further erosion of local democracy and</P>
    <P>(a)  the virtual ending of local authority house building,</P>
    <P>(b)  the deterioration of existing housing stock,</P>
    <P>(c)  pot-holed roads,</P>
    <P>(d)  cutbacks in a whole range of local authority services, and</P>
    <P>(e)  a general deterioration in the environment;</P>
    <P>believing that service charges are unjust and represent a form of double taxation, calls for their immediate abolition; further calls on the Government to ensure the provision of a fixed proportion of central funds for local government to be allocated on a fair and equitable basis; and conscious of the appalling unemployment crisis now facing the country, believes that properly funded local authorities could play an important role in job creation through joint ventures with public, private and co-operative companies, using the skill and enterprise of local authority staff.</P>
    <P>In nine days time the people will elect over 800 councillors to city and county councils who are in a financial crisis.  The councils are under-funded and overdrawn. They are no longer financially capable of maintaining essential local services such as housing, road maintenance and refuse collection; yet, the Government are silent on the funding of local authorities.  They have announced no <Col N="2258" /> policy on how local government is to be funded for the future.  A few weeks ago they rushed through this House a new Local Government Act, which ignored the central issue of money.  They postponed local elections last year and set up an expert committee, but gave them little or no function in relation to financing except to make recommendations on how the existing inadequate cake should be shared out.</P>
    <P>We are a week away from the local elections and this House has not yet debated the financing of the local authorities; the important question of how all the election promises which are being now made throughout this country, are to be paid for.  The Workers' Party are determined that before the people go out to vote next week, there will be a debate on local government financing, when the financial crisis in the councils will be highlighted, the broken election promises of 1985 and 1987 remembered and this House asked to make up its mind about water and service charges.</P>
    <P>The Government's silence now about council fundings is in sharp contrast to the position in 1985.  Then the Fianna Fáil local election manifesto declared that Fianna Fáil were opposed to water and service charges and that when re-elected to power, Fianna Fáil would repeal the local charges legislation.  This commitment was spelled out in a letter dated 23 May 1985 from the then Fianna Fáil Director of Elections, Deputy Robert Molloy to the secretary of ACRA, Mr. Fergus Martin.  The letter stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to the new system of local charges and, on return to office, will abolish these charges and repeal the legislation under which they were imposed, namely the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act of 1983.</P>
    <P>In its place, we will introduce new legislation which will end the present unsatisfactory position and put local finances on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>This legislation will provide that Local Authorities will receive a guaranteed statutory contribution each <Col N="2259" /> year from the Central Exchequer.  This Exchequer contribution will be sufficient to provide for a satisfactory level of necessary services.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will eliminate the present uncertainty whereby Local Authorities cannot anticipate what the grant from the Central Exchequer each year will be and which has compelled County Managers to impose a new and unacceptable level of service charges against the wishes of the great majority of the local community.</P>
    <P>The legislation which will provide for the new statutory grant from the Central Exchequer will not contain any new power to enable elected members to introduce new charges.</P>
    <P>The promise was repeated for the 1987 general election.  In a letter dated February 1987, to the general secretary of NATO, Mr. Matt Larkin, the new Fianna Fáil National Director of Elections, Mr. Paddy Lalor MEP, stated:</P>
    <P>In relation to local charges, Fianna Fáil is committed to the revocation of the 1983 legislation which gave power to levy charges.  It is our intention in Government that Local Authorities will receive a statutory contribution each year from the Central Exchequer which will be sufficient to provide for a satisfactory level of necessary services.</P>
    <P>These promises were given the imprimatur of the Fianna Fáil leader.  Prior to the 1985 local elections he stated:</P>
    <P>Our policy is clear &mdash; as soon as we are returned to office we will repeal the legislation which imposes these water charges.  This is a specific and clear statement by us.</P>
    <P>No doubt, it was this specific and clear promise which elected so many Fianna Fáil councillors in 1985 and which gave the Fianna Fáil party control of several local authorities.  But what has happened to the promise?  On 7 March last, my party colleague, Deputy Joe Sherlock, at columns 432 and 433 of the Official <Col N="2260" /> Report asked the Minister for the Environment &ldquo;if the Government have any plans to amend the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983, to provide for the abolition of water charges&rdquo;. The Minister gave no answer.  Perhaps he was too ashamed.</P>
    <P>But shame was not a condition bothered the Taoiseach last week when he launched the Fianna Fáil local election manifesto &mdash; the 1991 version.  He made it clear that water and service charges are here to stay, that the Government have now no intention whatever of abolishing them and delivered the following epitaph for the 1985 manifesto: &ldquo;I am the least embarrassed man in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The official abandonment of the 1985 promise comes as no great surprise because, since the 1985 local elections, Fianna Fáil councillors and various forms of Fianna Fáil Government have presided over the reintroduction of and the increase in water and service charges; in every council throughout this country, except Dublin city and county, Fianna Fáil councillors have voted in the water and service charges; since 1985, far from abolishing the charges, Fianna Fáil councillors have voted to double the level of charges being made; since 1987, the Government have continued the policy of their predecessors by cutting back on local authority funding and staffing; and since 1985, the Government have presided over an aggressive collection regime for water and service charges, which is unprecedented in the tax collection history of this State.</P>
    <P>Big time tax evaders and tax avoiders enjoy an official tolerance in this State which is unequalled in Europe or America. In the Republic of Ireland there are no Lester Piggotts, no Patrick Gallaghers, no Spiro Agnews.  At one point the very possibility of large-scale tax avoidance was denied by Government Ministers until an &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; produced £500 million in uncollected taxes.  At local level, large farmers, still owe £20 million in agricultural rates in respect of the period prior to 1982 and no effort at all is being made to collect it.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the treatment meted <Col N="2261" /> out to law abiding, taxpaying householders, who have not paid their water charges.  In this country, the only people who have ever been sent to jail for not paying a tax have not been the big time tax evaders, but PAYE workers who objected to paying a second time for domestic water.</P>
    <P>Householders have had their water supply cut off &mdash; in one case in my own constituency from November 1988 to July 1990.  Council pensioners have £1 a week deducted from their small pensions to pay the charges.  Students have been refused higher education grants until their parents paid the charges.  Tenant-purchasers have been refused the deeds to their homes until they paid the charges. Over the past six years householders have been threatened and bullied into paying a water tax which has never won public acceptance.</P>
    <P>The heavy handed approach to collecting water charges has been deliberate and it has had the full support of the Minister for the Environment, who disingenuously claims that it is a matter solely for the local authorities.  The whole idea has been to soften up the tax paying public for an extension and an increase in these charges.</P>
    <P>The study carried out by the Institute of Fiscal Studies and published in the Barrington report showed that since 1970, and especially since the abolition of domestic rates in 1978 and agricultural rates in 1982, there has been a significant change in the sources of local authority revenue.  The proportion of the council income from Government grants and from rates has fallen sharply, but the proportion from charging for goods and services has almost doubled from 17 per cent in 1970 to 33.1 per cent in 1990.</P>
    <P>The Government really want to continue this trend, but they are reluctant to say so before the local elections.  Fianna Fáil's silence on funding, the PD slogans about value for money and their antipathy to local authority staffs, the terms of reference given to the expert committee and the various coded remarks from the Minister for the Environment, all point in one direction.  After these local elections, <Col N="2262" /> the Government intend to increase local charges and to reintroduce them in Dublin.  The Government also intend to privatise many local authority services and to charge the public for them on a consumer pays basis.  Indeed this process has already started, in a number of counties where the local authority no longer provide a refuse collection but have licensed private contractors to collect refuse and to charge house holders for the service.</P>
    <P>What we are now beginning to see is the formal dismantling of local authority services because these services have been crippled from underfunding by the Government.  We can trace this underfunding back to the abolition of domestic rates and the ending of agricultural rates.</P>
    <P>When domestic rates were abolished, central Government undertook to make up the loss of local authorities' domestic rate income by paying grants equivalent to the revenue that would have been received if domestic rates had not been abolished.  In reality this commitment was never honoured and was formally abandoned in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983.</P>
    <P>At present the total rate support grant for all local authorities is £162.75 million. This includes the grants in lieu of both domestic and agricultural rates.  In 1978 the first year after the abolition of domestic rates, the grant in lieu of domestic rates alone was £81 million.  Adjusted for inflation, that would now be worth £241 million or £80 million more that the combined domestic and agricultural rates grants together.  In 1977, the grant in lieu of agricultural rates that is for small farmers who did not have to pay rates, was £40 million.  Adjusted for inflation, that would now be worth £119 million.</P>
    <P>The up-dated figures for domestic and agricultural rates support grants would, therefore, be £360 million.  And when account is taken of the rates which big farmers would have paid and the fact that 250,000 new houses have been built since 1978, another £50 million at least can be added to the equation.  In other words, local authorities should be getting rate support grants totalling £410 million and <Col N="2263" /> not £160 million simply to keep pace with inflation since 1978.  As the Kildare county manager put it last October, when he was addressing the Foundation for Fiscal Studies annual conference;</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there is approximately a shortfall of £250m in the amount of rates foregone by local authorities on private dwelling and not made up through the Rate Support Grant for the financial year ended December 31st 1990.</P>
    <P>Or put another way, local authorities are getting only £4 out of every £10 to which they are properly entitled.  But the cut in the rates support grants has not been the only way that local authorities have been savaged by Government cuts.</P>
    <P>Since the last local elections, the total amount of non-discretionary grants paid to local authorities has been cut by 40 per cent.  Since the last local elections the capital expenditure of local authorities has been cut by over 30 per cent.  Since the last local elections, local authorities' staff have been cut by 10,000 through voluntary redundancy and natural wastage. A further 5,000 have been cut in the health services and yet another 5,000 have been lost in other local services, putting 20,000 on to the bulging unemployment figures.  Is it any wonder then that local services have deteriorated, that communities have been neglected and that the environment has been exploited so badly since the last local elections?</P>
    <P>The evidence is everywhere.  The potholes on the roads, 6,500 local authority houses with no bathrooms, and the public libraries with empty shelves because there is no money to replace the books.</P>
    <P>People at every level are affected.  The person in a wheelchair cannot travel because the footpaths have subsided, or perhaps do not exist at all, the unlit streets and substandard public lighting are facilitating the scourge of suburban crime, the quality of some drinking water is poor and local communities become frustrated when they cannot even get a reply to their letters, much less a solution to their problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2264" /> Meanwhile, the Government's professed initiatives on the environment simply cannot be implemented because there is no money to do so.  I will cite examples.  The Control of Dogs Act, 1986, has failed because the local authorities do not have the money to hire dog wardens.  There are six dog wardens to patrol the entire city and county of Dublin and three-quarters of the country's dog population is unlicenced.  Not a single local authority has yet complied their register of derelict sites under the new Derelict Sites Act because there are no resources or staff to carry out the inspections.  There is no staff or money provided to implement the new Water Pollution Act; to regulate environmental impact assessments, to regulate the quality of drinking water or for any of the new environmental legislation.</P>
    <P>You cannot protect the environment by sticking your head in the air and peering over the chimney pots of Dublin.  If you really want to see clearly, look at what is happening on the ground where environmental protection is all theory and no practice, because the Government who have made the rules have not provided the money to enforce them.  Yet the public have paid their money.  It is a fact that when domestic rates were abolished, PAYE tax was increased to make up the shortfall, but the increased tax has not been passed on to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In 1977, the year before the abolition of domestic rates, the total tax paid by PAYE workers amounted to £523 million. Last year it amounted to £2,738 million, an increase of 423 per cent in a period when inflation increased by about 200 per cent.  To put it another way, the State's take from the PAYE sector has increased since 1987 by 12 times the rate of change in the rate support grant for local authorities.</P>
    <P>The PAYE taxpayer has therefore been paying an increased amount for local services, but the taxpayer's money has not been passed to the local authorities whose job it is to provide the services. The PAYE taxpayer is, therefore, perfectly entitled to object to paying a <Col N="2265" /> second time for the services which should be provided from his or her income tax.</P>
    <P>The real solution to local government financing is for central Government to pay over an adequate sum to the local authorities.  If the £250 million shortfall, or even a significant portion of it, were available to councils, it would transform local services and enable councils to act as development agencies for local communities and contribute in a real way to reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Such an arrangement will never apply, as long as the funding for local authorities is at the discretion of the Minister for the Environment.  The funding of local authorities, and their entitlement to a fixed proportion of central funds, should be enshrined in legislation as promised by Fianna Fáil in 1985 and again in 1987. Some people argue that local authorities will only have real autonomy when they can raise their own funds, but experience elsewhere does not bear this out.  Already 44 per cent of all local authority funds here come from central Government grants.  In other countries the proportion is much higher.  In Italy and Holland, for example, it is as high as 80 per cent and 81 per cent respectively and those countries have healthy autonomous systems of local government.</P>
    <P>We are seeking in this motion to get Fianna Fáil to honour the commitment they gave in 1985 and repeated in 1987. We are seeking the repeal of the 1983 legislation which introduced water charges, as promised by Fianna Fáil.  They have reneged on that promise.  We are seeking the provision of a fixed-proportion of central funds for local government, just as Fianna Fáil promised in 1983.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore has outlined in some detail the run down of local government financing over the past few years and specifically the effect of the depression of the rate support grant.  The first casualty of this deterioration in local government financing has been jobs.  In a document which The Workers' Party published today we estimate that there is <Col N="2266" /> an inherent capacity in the local authorities to create about 10,000 new jobs. That must be put against the record which shows that since the last local elections in 1985, 10,000 jobs have been lost in local authorities, on the basis of voluntary redundancy and natural wastage.</P>
      <P>The debate on job creation which got underway at the beginning of the local elections campaign has concentrated on the performance of the public and the private sectors.  The predominant responsibility for job creation will rest with those sectors.  Our view is that local authorities can be a dynamic third force who can contribute substantially to the job creation exercise.  In the context of the current crisis, all sectors of the economy must be pressed to develop new and radical responses to the employment crisis in a major national effort to provide sufficient sustaining jobs for all who are available to work.  Reliance on the public and private sectors is a totally inadequate response, as we have seen.  More and more cutbacks are taking place in the public sector, while in the private sector there is a manifest inability to deliver on job targets.  All parties in this House are now agreed, as are the opposite sides of industry, that the private sector has not managed to deliver on the job creation targets set.</P>
      <P>For that reason we have come up with a new and radical proposal in our document today which would see a local levy imposed on the profits of companies and devolved to local authorities in terms of contributing to a fund that could provide the finance for job creation at local level. The fact that the Minister shakes his head at the possibility of job creation in this fashion surprises me since the record of debates in the sixties will show that it was the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, who put forward the idea of local authorities as development corporations.  We are suggesting in the document we published today that local authorities can effectively be used as community development agencies.  I cannot see any reason that this should not recommend itself to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a few years ago I had the pleasure <Col N="2267" /> of serving on Dublin County Council under the chairmanship of the present Minister for Justice, who was extraordinarily concerned in those years, 1985 to 1987, about the unemployment crisis &mdash; so much so that he caused Dublin County Council to establish local employment committees.  These committees did an enormous amount of research but unfortunately we were deprived of Deputy Burke just as their efforts were about to come to fruition.  He became a member of the Government in 1987 and an early impact of the cutbacks which affected Dublin County Council was the abolition of the local employment committees. We never had the opportunity to put the ideas into practice.</P>
    <P>Our view is that there is an enormous reservoir of ideas in the local community which should be released as a potent third force for job creation.  Expertise and funding are needed.  The expertise is available in the local authorities.  There is a great under-utilisation of professional and technical expertise.  The great bulk of the workers who were let go under the voluntary redundancy schemes were workers at the coal face, with the consequent run down of the environment, house maintenance, potholes in the roads and so on.  A great many of the professional and technical staff are still in place and their skills are under-utilised. They could be put at the disposal of local community organisations in the fashion that we recommended in our document.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, the recommendation that there ought to be a levy of 1 per cent imposed on company profits, which would be devoted to the councils for the purpose of job creation and which would be refundable in circumstances where the companies could be proved to have met their job targets, is an innovative idea which should recommend itself to the Government.  It has a wider significance.  The projection for company profits this year is just over £5 billion.  A levy of up to 1 per cent on those profits would provide a fund of the order of £50 million.  A great many community organisations and people involved in <Col N="2268" /> enterprise at local level could do a great deal with £50 million.  It serves a more useful purpose than that.  The Taoiseach, and the Minister for Labour, have agreed in this House that despite the unprecedented period of wage restraint under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> despite having concluded a new agreement under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> despite having achieved favourable economic indicators in a number of areas, the jobs simply have not come.  Our view is that there is a necessity for some trigger mechanism to cause these spiralling profits to be translated into jobs.  It is the height of folly for any Government to believe that private employers are going to produce additional jobs merely because of targets set in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and because employers are securing unprecedented profits at the moment.  Such job creation will not happen, it has not happened in the past, and we ought to have learned that lesson. What other country in Europe can claim to have had the climate and conditions we have experienced under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; most modest pay increases, favourable interest rates and unprecedented high profits, yet the jobs did not materialise.  I predict the same will happen, under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>It is generally accepted now by most economists that you can have the growth rate of the order projected by the Minister for Finance of 2, 2.25 or 2.5 per cent.  Anything less than 2 per cent in this economy, because of the impact of technology and the changing structure of the workforce does not necessarily anymore result in additional net job creation. Against that background there is a necessity to come up with new mechanisms that will encourage at least some of the enormous profit generating to be translated into hard net new jobs in this economy.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but he is straying somewhat from the local authority financing measure before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> Company profits and all these other matters are rather extraneous, to say the least.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I will accept your admonition except to say I am trying to explain why local authorities could be a productive source of job creation, having regard to the fact that the public and private sectors are an inadequate response in themselves.  Specifically I am trying to explain why the proposition of a 1 per cent levy on the profits of companies going to local authorities could be a productive fund to assist job creation at local level.  That is the significance of my point, and it knits in neatly with our inability to force these companies to produce jobs at home.  If the Ceann Comhairle wishes I will move on from that except to say that in my experience, and I think in that of most Members of this House, the very many good ideas at local level have faltered because of the absence of two essential ingredients: one is expertise and advice and the other is funding.  The Workers' Party suggest that this idea of a 1 per cent levy on profits is precisely the source of the funding that is necessary.</P>
      <P>In our view this local response to job creation should be a flexible and multifaceted one, assisting co-operatives, creating new joint ventures between public and private enterprise, developing local skills and projects with potential for becoming self-sustaining, improving the environment or upgrading tourist related facilities, expanding local services in the sport, leisure and fitness areas and generally assisting all forms of local enterprise and initiative.  It is an idea not 100 miles removed from the idea of the late Seán Lemass back in the fifties and sixties, but instead of going down that road this Government have cut jobs in local authorities by 10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies in the housing area. Apart from the consideration of the desperate social need to be met in that regard at the moment, there is the job creation aspect of housing.  My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, at the time of our party's ArdFheis predicted that the real figure on the housing list would emerge in the wake of <Col N="2270" /> the local elections to be closer to 30,000 than the 20,000 suggested at that time by the Minister.  That has turned out to be the case.  In addition the figure on the homeless list is well nigh 5,000 at this stage.  That must be set against a performance last year in the Twenty-six Counties of fewer than 1,000 new houses and of fewer than 800 in the previous year.  That is the scope of our housing crisis, the worst this country has seen since the sixties.  The Minister has produced a very well presented and attractive document containing all kinds of concepts, some of which I welcome but most of which are incomprehensible to the unfortunate people on the housing list who are waiting to have the document explained to them.  Even Fianna Fáil hopefuls in this election find the document beyond their capacity to understand. I recommend that the Minister ask his officials to prepare easily intelligible summaries of what is in the document for his local canvassers.  This would greatly free up the time of the rest of us even if it would make no serious impact on the housing situation.  In my local authority, Dublin County Council, there are 1,100 families on the housing list, some of them living in desperate conditions.  The arrival of Fine Gael to present themselves in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;perhaps to offer to contribute to the debate may mean I might cut my peroration short if they are ready to address the House on this subject.  If they are not, I want to say the 70 houses we plan to build in Dublin County Council this year will make very little impact on the 1,100 families waiting to be housed.  That is the extent of the crisis and of the jobs that could be created in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>House maintenance is an additional area that requires attention not only because of the tragic deterioration of the housing stock but again because of the jobs that could be created in this area.  In <Col N="2271" /> my constituency, especially in the Tallaght part of it, housing maintenance is an unmitigated disaster.  We have the largest homogeneous block of public sector housing in Western Europe.  One part of my constituency must have something in excess of 5,000 local authority houses.  I want to say to the Minister tonight and I am prepared to stand over this, that at least every second house of those 5,000 houses has a complaint the length of your arm about routine maintenance requirements. There is a depot in that enormous local authority housing area and if if it were in the Minister's constituency in Castlebar or in the Minister of State's constituency in Tuallmore or some other much smaller Irish town it would be laughed out of it for reasons of inadequacy and inadequate staffing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more appropriate to Ballindine because the number of people employed in the Tallaght depot is totally unsuited to the demand.  I have raised with the Minister previously the question of that responsibility being transferred to the new housing authority. I ask him again to repeat his comments on that when replying to this debate. Apart from the misery being inflicted on the tenants, it is a public waste that housing maintenance should be allowed run down to the present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the subject matters of this debate is the question of the Fianna Fáil turnabout on the question of water charges. It seems almost inexplicable that Fianna Fáil can treat Dublin differently from the way they treat the rest of the country.  The Workers' Party are very proud of how we have opposed, consistently, double taxation on the PAYE citizens of Dublin county and Dublin city, but we were at least matched house for house in our campaign by Fianna Fáil county councillors and city councillors. The same county councillors and city councillors who are members of the largest party in the State have doubled and otherwise increased these charges elsewhere <Col N="2272" /> throughout the country.  It is, indeed, reminiscent of the same kind of commitments that Fianna Fáil councillors and now the Minister of State have given to my constituents concerning the abolition of ground rents.  Some of my constituents in the Old Bawn area will be before the courts again next week on the question of ground rents.  The Minister of State promised he would work for the introduction of a referendum to have ground rents abolished contemporaneous with the holding of the poll on 27 June.</P>

      <P>In referring to the ground rents and the water charges at Old Bawn I am merely seeking to highlight the duplicity of Fianna Fáil in what they practice and what they preach.  The then director of elections, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, gave a clear and unequivocal commitment to ACRA but they have reneged on that commitment except where The Workers' Party have a significant presence in local government in Dublin city and Dublin county.  I regret that and I sincerely hope when responding to this debate, the Minister will offer some hope to the people who are currently before the courts for non-payment of water charges.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the positive achievements of the Government in relation to local government policies and the delivery of services and calls for the continued implementation of the policies and programmes being pursued by the Government in these important areas&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party motion seems to be unusually self-contradictory: it calls for better local services and the abolition of the means to pay for them; more local government but less local financing; and <Col N="2273" /> more local initiatives but paid for by the taxpayer nationally.</P>
    <P>Who do The Workers' Party think they are kidding?  They are like someone ordering every expensive item on the menu and just shrugging off the question of where the money is going to come from.  It must be marvellous to be so far from responsibility that, as a political party, you can play those kind of games. It must have seemed to The Workers' Party to be a good tactical move in their game to set up this Dáil debate in close proximity to the local elections and to seek to criticise the Government over their record in relation to local authority finances and related activities.</P>
    <P>Their tactics are badly flawed on this occasion.  What they have done gives me a welcome and timely opportunity to put on the record some of the positive achievements of the Government in relation to environment and local government. In the process, I will demolish The Workers' Party arguments and show up their motion of what it is, a cynical exercise in cheap political point scoring.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Deputies, who have put down this motion, leads one to wonder where they have been over the past number of years.  Surely they are aware of the extensive legislation I have promoted through the House since becoming Minister for the Environment, dealing with environmental, planning, housing and other matters and most recently, local government reform? Surely they know of the administrative reforms in the local authority financial area, which have improved the financial position of local authorities?  Can they not see the evidence of the major new programmes for infrastructural development and environmental improvement? The fact is, of course, that the present Dáil debate is prompted purely by party political motives and aims only to try to embarrass the Government but this debate will show how hollow The Workers' Party motion really is.</P>
    <P>This Government have been the first for many years to take action on local government reform instead of just talking <Col N="2274" /> about it.  The Government's reform programme will strengthen local democracy and enable local authorities to perform effectively on behalf of their communities and to provide the services they require, effectively, efficiently and economically. The Local Government Act, 1991, represents the first stage of that programme and it is a bit strange to see The Workers' Party calling for reform now, having regard to the position they adopted when the Bill was going through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1991 Act will remove outmoded, outdated and inappropriate controls.  It provides local authorities with a flexible framework in which to operate. The focus on the <i>ultra vires</i> principle, which local authorities over the years have pointed to as a constraint on their involvement in projects of benefit to local communities, is replaced by a broad general competence for local authority activity.  The Act specifically provides for the removal of controls, not for the imposition of new ones as was alleged recently in this House.  As the reform programme is progressively implemented in the period ahead, local authorities will find that their freedom to operate, coupled with their improved financial position, will provide a sound basis for development in co-operation with other public, private or community organisations.</P>
      <P>When I took up office as Minister for the Environment in March 1987, I was appalled at the state of the local finances. Local authority finances had been allowed to deteriorate to the point where there were accumulated deficits on day-to-day running costs of over £80 million. This meant that the authorities were living off costly overdrafts to run their current services and were paying interest to the banks instead of using the money to provide and improve their services to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Deputy Molloy not know that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2275" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This tailspin of deficits had to be reversed and I embarked upon a programme of financial restraint combined with administrative reforms to restore stability.  As a result, deficits were cut by half and better financial management was introduced, leading to better value for money.  This is real progress in an area where it matters.</P>
      <P>I put in place the arrangements needed to enable local authorities to go ahead with their annual estimates before the commencement of the financial year, not after the year had commenced as had been the practice previously.  The benefit of this reform alone was very significant in that local authorities were better able to plan their annual expenditure.</P>
      <P>Another major financial reform was the introduction of 100 per cent grants for capital works on housing and sanitary services as well as for libraries and fire stations.  In adopting this method of financing, the Government eliminated a huge merry-go-round of loans and subsidies between the Exchequer and local authorities.  This reform improved administrative efficiency in local authorities and it had the additional benefit of improved cash flow.  It also removed the burden of the local share of loan charges from the local authorities, releasing additional funds for their day-to-day services.</P>
      <P>On the capital side, the effect is even more direct.  In the past, important water and sewerage schemes and other major works could not be undertaken because their share of the loan charges simply could not be borne by some of the local authorities.  The needs of those local authorities could not be catered for and infrastructural development was restricted as a result.  This no longer applies. With the benefit of the 100 per cent capital grants, major schemes are now going ahead and are being planned in places where they were previously only a dream. Local authorities have widely welcomed this financial reform.  It shows that this Government do not just talk about reform but implement necessary change in critical areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory demands and levies <Col N="2276" /> made on them by other State agencies, over which they had no control, were a real and a serious burden to local authorities. Most of these demands have now been eliminated, thus freeing up more local resources to be spent on local services. For example, in 1988, the arrears owed for contributions to arterial drainage maintenance were written off.  The burden of VEC pensions was transferred to the Exchequer in 1990 and this year the cost of providing and maintaining courthouses is being transferred to the State.  Here again these reforms have been widely welcomed by local authorities.</P>
    <P>This Government are not content to sit on their achievements over the past four years in turning around the state of local financies and in making worthwhile changes. There have been more reforms in the financial area in the past four years than at any other time since the abolition of domestic rates in 1978 and more improvements are planned.  It is a common misconception, however, to claim that more fundamental financial reform must be a first priority in tackling local government reform.  This indicates a lamentable lack of understanding of local government.</P>
    <P>In addition to the significant improvements in local finances which I have touched on, the Government have been looking at the criteria on which the contribution from central funds to local authorities should be made.  International experts in the London Institute of Fiscal Studies were asked to examine the structure of State grants to local authorities and their report, which was published, indicated that our system of local authority funding is close to the average in international comparison, and our mix of grants is not out of the mainstream of comparison, given the mix of functions. It identified a potential for equalisation, primarily in relation to the rate support grant, with a view to achieving greater equalisation.  It also acknowledged the need for existing specific grants, which it felt were on the whole well designed.</P>
    <P>I have commissioned a second phase study by the institute to examine options <Col N="2277" /> for the distribution of the rate support grant with a view to achieving greater equalisation.  I expect this study will be completed later this year and will, I hope, lead to other practical reforms.</P>
    <P>On the issue of service charges, the first point which must be made is that it was the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition which introduced the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act in 1983 to provide a broad framework for allowing local authorities to charge for services. It is true that my party opposed this legislation at the time.  However, when the Government took up office in March 1987 and discovered the appalling state of our public finances, and the extent to which local authorities had overspent in the years previously, the question of repealing the 1983 legislation faded into insignificance in comparison with the huge financial problems facing us.  It certainly would have been popular to repeal the 1983 Act but the Government's first duty was to face up responsibly to the situation we inherited, no matter how unpopular it might be, and to straighten out our national and local finances.  We have achieved a considerable measure of success in both these areas.</P>
    <P>The Government's position is that domestic service charges will continue to be a matter for elected local councils.  It will be at the absolute discretion of local councils if they want to levy domestic service charges and to decide the amounts of any charges.  Any local authority are free to drop service charges if they so wish as long as sufficient finance is available to fund their services. Because of their concern to meet local needs, most local authorities value the income from service charges for funding local services.  This even applies where Opposition councillors have a majority. They have voted and continue to vote for charges.  Deciding whether to charge for services is a financial management decision for the elected members.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are trying to kid the public into believing that it is possible to have hugely improved local services without paying for them.  That would be <Col N="2278" /> great, if it were possible, but those of us who live in the real world know it is not possible.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party were in Coalition Government with Fine Gael, they were forced to be realistic about getting the money for the services of the local authorities.  In fact, service charges were introduced by the Labour Party leader, Deputy Spring and his deputy leader, Deputy Quinn, and enforced by Deputy Kavanagh in 1984-1986 at the time of a massive increase in taxation, direct and indirect.  The whole context has altered since Fianna Fáil came to office.  We have given back in cumulative tax reductions over £1 billion, both in income tax and VAT, or about ten times the amount raised in service charges.</P>
    <P>Given a choice between abolishing service charges, or major reductions in income tax and VAT, there is no doubt in my mind as to which is the priority.</P>
    <P>These figures have been challenged by Deputy Quinn.  I would point out that £800 million of the £1 billion pounds relates to income tax in the period 1988 to 1990, and is stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  That statement has been accepted and endorsed by the social partners, and the £1 billion figure is simply an extrapolation based on the net VAT reductions in the 1990 and 1991 budgets and the income tax reduction in the 1991 budget.  Of course, economic growth will lead to higher tax revenues, but that does not invalidate the point about the lightening of the tax burden on the individual.</P>
    <P>Labour as well as The Workers' Party now seek to abolish the old service charges legislation, but give revenue-raising powers to local authorities by way of local referenda.  That is simply a cop-out.  The elected representatives, who go before the people, can decide whether there should be local charges.  The Labour Party did not like having to live in the real world, so they have gone off into fantasy land too.  They are another party who are not being straight with the people about their policies.  Their full economic policy is contained in <i>Labour's Agenda &mdash; An Economic Programme for the 1990s,</i><Col N="2279" /> filled with formidable and draconian tax increases.  This was endorsed at the Labour Party Conference in 1989 and has never been retracted.  If Labour have their way, there will be a 2 per cent wealth tax, a land tax on farmers and a property tax on homes.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  Labour intend to restrict mortgage interest relief to the standard rate, and will ultimately abolish it altogether. In addition, the PRSI ceiling will be abolished on higher incomes.  The threshold for capital transfer tax will be reduced by two-thirds, with no relief for agricultural land or business assets.  So what we would have in place of service charges is one of the most draconian tax systems ever proposed in this country, which would totally impoverish anyone on middle incomes.  Understandably, the Labour Party are not playing up these proposals on the doorstep.</P>
    <P>What about Fine Gael?  Their record in Government over the last 20 years shows them to be the party of new taxes and higher taxes, even though in Opposition they make all sorts of attractive promises.  On the last occasion they introduced service charges, residential property tax and land tax.  A close reading of all their policy documents in the last few years shows that they too want to introduce a property tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton in his 1992 document of January 1989 stated:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also recognises that we will have a genuinely dynamic and highly representative system of local government only if Local Authorities have responsibility for raising a significant proportion of their own resources.</P>
    <P>This clearly involves some kind of property tax.  Deputy Michael Noonan in 1988, when he was seeking £660 million in income tax cuts, accepted that some of the money could be found through an extension of the tax base, through a property tax or by way of further cuts in expenditure.  It is my firm belief that Fine Gael share the agenda of these other <Col N="2280" /> Opposition parties and want a property tax introduced.</P>
    <P>This is the political background against which the debate on service charges should be seen.  If the Opposition want a property tax, they should put that proposal now to the people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's policy has been to reduce the burden of taxation, whether on individuals or ratepayers, to create a cost effective system of local government, and to pay for improved social services by stimulating economic growth.</P>

      <P>The reference in the motion to a general deterioration in the environment shows how far removed from reality and how unconcerned for the facts are the proposers of the motion. Never in the history of the State has a Minister for the Environment done more to improve the environment and to increase public awareness of it than has been done in the past four years.  This is clear from a few examples of the action taken: the Government's environmental action programme, published last year, committed one billion pounds over the decade towards solving many of the country's worst environmental problems; recent improvements in air and water pollution legislation have strengthened considerably the regulatory controls of local authorities; serious pollution of river channels has fallen from 7 per cent to 2 per cent and over 74 per cent are pollution free; and the smokey coal ban in Dublin has ensured that the perennial winter smog in the city has been brought to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are further examples: a licensing system for industrial plant has been brought into operation, ensuring effective controls on air emissions; unleaded petrol has been introduced, actively promoted, and encouraged by tax reductions, so that it is now available at 53 per cent of outlets and accounts for 23 per cent of sales; greater enforcement of water pollution control legislation by local authorities, combined with surveys <Col N="2281" /> of farms, environmental awareness campaigns and generous State grants for pollution prevention measures, have reduced the number of fish kills caused by farming from over 90 in 1987 to 23 in 1990.</P>

      <P>The quality of our bathing areas is reflected in the awarding of 66 blue flags this year, which is our highest number to date and compares more than favourably with other EC countries.</P>
      <P>A grants scheme to encourage new waste recycling projects has been operated since 1989.  Glass recycling has increased from 8 per cent to 17 per cent since 1986, and can recycling has risen to 10 per cent in the same period, from a position of virtually zero in 1986. The Government's commitment to combating the problem of litter is shown by a variety of policies ranging from the annual tidy towns and tidy districts competitions to grant assistance for environmental awareness schemes, local authority clean-up campaigns and environmental improvement works.  The proposed environment protection agency will allow environmental protection measures to be enforced in a consistent and cohesive way.</P>
      <P>The quality of our environment is generally very high and there is no basis for the allegation in the motion that there is a general deterioration.  The last four years have been marked by an unprecedented level of attention by the Government to environmental issues, at national level and internationally.  This is widely recognised and understood.  Our Presidency of the EC was a major success on the environment issue and action at national level has been stepped up quite dramatically.  The Workers' Party are out of step if they fail to recognise this.  They should ask some of their so-called erstwhile friends in Europe for a steer on environmental progress in this country.</P>

    <P>Turning now to roads matters, I want <Col N="2282" /> to reiterate the Government's determination that Ireland should have a top class road network appropriate to the needs of a modern economy, and I can assure the House that we intend to deliver on this commitment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary responsibility for funding works on non-national roads has always rested with the individual local authorities.  However, arising from concern about the deterioration of the network of county roads, the Government, at my initiative, provided significantly enhanced levels of road grants in the last few years to supplement local authority expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989, the Government made a commitment that £150 million would be provided over three years in discretionary grants to county councils for these roads. This has been more than fulfilled, in fact total grants over the three years will amount to £182.4 million.  The conditions governing expenditure of the grants were also changed at my direction in 1989 to give more discretion to county councils and to allow more funds to be spent on surface restoration.  This is a clear indication of the ability of the Government to focus on particular problems and to take concrete action quickly.  There is more to be done.  A new three year follow-up programme for the further improvement and maintenance of county and regional roads will therefore run <Col N="2284" /> from 1992 to 1994, with a continuing high level of State support.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing which was mentioned this evening, the motion refers to a deterioration of the existing housing stock.  Let me say quite clearly, there is no such deterioration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact the opposite is the case.  The preliminary results of the 1990 survey of the housing stock indicate a very significant improvement over the past ten years.  Deputies will be aware of the expansion of the remedial works scheme for improvements to substandard local authority dwellings, which I have extended considerably in my time in office.  In 1986, less than £1.6 million was spent on remedial works.  This year I allocated £16 million and work is in progress on 75 estates throughout the country.  An additional £2 million has been set aside for the new subprogramme to provide bathrooms in local authority dwellings still lacking these facilities.  This is real progress and I am at a loss to understand on what basis The Workers' Party informed themselves on the so-called deterioration in the housing stock.</P>
      <P>On taking office in 1987, the Government consciously set out to reverse a continuous eight year decline in annual housing output and succeeded in doing so.</P>

      <P>The plan for social housing will create additional demand for private housing through the shared ownership and mortgage allowance schemes.  There will be significant increases in voluntary housing output both under the existing voluntary housing scheme and the new rental subsidy scheme.  The plan envisages some 750 houses in progress at the end of this year under the new measures.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the number of local authority houses built in the mid to late eighties reflected the falling numbers on the waiting list.  In September 1989, local authorities carried out the first comprehensive assessment of local authority housing needs under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, a measure which I introduced as Minister for the Environment. This assessment, which for the first time in many areas included homeless persons and single individuals who were not elderly, showed an increase in the numbers on local authority waiting lists but with the overall levels still well below the figures of the early eighties. Following this increase, the Government increased the capital allocation for the provision of local authority housing by 52 per cent in 1990 and by a further 35 per cent in 1991.  Last year, there was just over 1,000 additional new local authority dwellings provided, this year, there will be 1,300 provided and a further 1,500 commenced.  Total lettings in the last two years were 10,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I directed local authorities to make a further assessment of needs as at 31 March last with a view to providing an up-to-date basis for planning the housing programme for the future.  The returns from all of the 87 local authorities involved have not yet been received in my Department, despite continuous reminders.  However, this has not prevented Deputy Spring, in the last ten days, from putting out mischievous statements suggesting that the returns <Col N="2286" /> from local authorities add up to a total need of 30,000.  It now seems that this figure was trumped up by the Labour Party's kitchen cabinet.  Deputy Spring is doing nobody any service by putting about &ldquo;guesstimates&rdquo; like this.</P>
    <P>What really concerns me, however, is Deputy Spring's allegation that a completed report on the assessments is sitting on my desk and is being withheld from publication until after the local elections. That is totally without foundation.  The fact is that my Department are still awaiting the returns from a significant number of local authorities and are in no position to complete an overall assessment at this stage.  That is the simple truth of the matter.</P>
    <P>In February of this year I introduced the Plan for Social Housing, under which a wide range of new housing options have been put in place for low income households. The plan represents an integrated approach catering for the full range of housing needs &mdash; from those on lowest incomes, who can avail of rental subsidy, to those on the margins of ownership, who can avail of shared ownership.  The plan contains many new ideas and represents progressive thinking in the social housing area.  When fully operational it will result in the provision of accommodation for some 5,000 households each year.  When added to existing programmes this means that we will be catering for the needs of over 10,000 households a year.  That contrasts sharply with the absence of any positive proposals from The Workers Party, from whom we hear only time-worn cliches.</P>

      <P>Deputies have just heard a tirade from the Minister for the Environment of the past four years. Local government has experienced its worst four years since the Second World War, no matter how one considers the record of the present Minister for the Environment and the present Government &mdash; whether one considers housing output, the state of the roads, sporting and recreational facilities, or discretion in local government.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the figures trotted out by the Minister in his speech just a few minutes ago.  I cannot say that the Minister deliberately misled the House, but the fact is that he in reply to my Parliamentary questions in the House, only ten day ago he admitted that in each of the past three years the lowest number of local authority houses was built since those of the three years immediately following the Second World War, and they were the worst years since 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that in today's <i>Irish Times,</i> according to a report by Joe Carroll, the Minister claimed that although the local authority housing effort was down &mdash; it is down dramatically to one sixth of what it was under the Fine Gael-Labour Government: 1,000 per year compared to 6,000 per year &mdash; private housing completions were up.  Of course, that statement is manifestly untrue.  Housing completions in the past four years are down compared to those of the preceding four years.  The Minister told me in the <Col N="2288" /> House that there were 65,000 completions in the four years just ended and 73,000 private housing completions in the preceding four years.  Whether one takes account of private sector housing or local authority housing, the output in each of the past four years is down, and employment is down with it.  In the past three months Ireland has had record unemployment. The Taoiseach acknowledged in his reply to me today that there was all-time record unemployment.  May 1991 was the worst May in our history and April 1991 saw the worst unemployment figures ever for any month of any year. One of the best employers is the construction industry.  It is also the industry that uses the most home-produced raw material, whether for building houses or building and repairing roads.  However, the Government have run down the house building programme in both the public and the private sectors.  This is not good enough.  It is below the standards that the House should expect for a Minister to give the opposite impression from what is the truth.</P>
    <P>Ireland has record unemployment because the Government have no strategy to beat unemployment.  Hundreds of millions of pounds is being spent on actually causing unemployment, and that is because of Government policy.  Every successive budget in the past four years has worsened the poverty trap and has made it less and less possible for people already badly off in receipt of social welfare to take up employment because by doing so they would be even worse off unless they managed to earn considerably more than the average industrial wage. That is why the record of the Government and the Minister in the Department of the Environment is rightly described by objective assessors as being the worst four years in the history of local Government.</P>
    <P>On the one hand the Government argues that the growth in unemployment has occurred because emigration has stopped; in other words, the population is increasing and the workforce is increasing. The workforce happens to coincide with the kind of people who are looking <Col N="2289" /> for housing, yet provision for housing is down dramatically.  The Minister then argues that there is no real increase in housing waiting lists.  That is playing with mirrors.  The Minister expects the public to believe that in the same way that he expects the public to believe the promise made in 1985 by the Fianna Fáil director of elections &mdash; now the Minister, Deputy Bobby Molloy of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; that local charges would be abolished. The same litmus test to the veracity of that promise can be applied to the veracity of the claims about housing output made by the Minister this evening. The Minister ought to be ashamed of himself.</P>

      <P>In housing the Minister's record is the worst since Mr. de Valera ran down house building in the immediate aftermath of the war.  Of course, there was scarcity after the war, which can excuse those three years.  I have the housing statistics bulletins from the Department itself, and the record is there for all to see.  The records show the output of each year going back to 1921 when the first Government made housing a key part of its programme to develop this fledgling State.  Since 1921 most Governments of all persuasions have looked after housing very well, and I think it can be rightly claimed, although it is not widely acknowledged, that Ireland as a nation probably has the best housing in the world.  That is not an overclaim or an exaggeration but one of the great social stabilisers that helps us as a society to survive without revolution during a period of and at a time of record unemployment when emigration has doubled &mdash; as it has in the past four years compared to the preceding four years.  The vast majority of our people live in good housing conditions, yet the Government have neglected housing as did no other Government before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago at Question Time I <Col N="2290" /> asked the Minister how many dwellings within a half mile of his office in the Custom House were without bathrooms. He did not know &mdash; he did not care. The Minister and the Government have managed to spend millions of pounds in renovating the Custom House.  That may well be justified expenditure but, by God, in ordering priorities it is just not good enough in the last decade of the 20th century, as we come into the 21st century, to know that 21,000 homes in this country are without bathrooms and that most of them do not have an indoor toilet either. The Minister's priority was to do up his own little place in the Custom House, in much the same way as the Taoiseach spent £17 million on his palace here in Merrion Street.  That shows some sense of priority.  That £17 million added to the bathroom building programme would have made a very big dent in the backlog of applications by people awaiting the provision of bathrooms.  Fine Gael want that backlog brought to a quick end.  We want to ensure that no family remains without a bathroom at the end of this century.  We want everyone to have a bathroom within the next five years and we want the Minister to agree that any dwelling without a bathroom after five years will be declared unfit for human habitation and that a policy will be implemented to ensure that none of the 6,000 local authority homes, and none of the 50,000 private homes, without bathrooms are still without them by the time the council about to be elected have completed their term of office.  However, under the Minister's programme, there will still be homes without bathrooms in 20 years time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also referred to potholes.  What sense is there in having so many roads that are almost impassable because of potholes when the raw materials to fix those potholes are all home produced and when record numbers of those people who could fix those <Col N="2291" /> potholes are on the dole?  Why can we not put some people to work using home produced raw materials to fix those roads?</P>
      <P>The Minister says we cannot afford it, that it will cost too much.  I say it would save money if we fixed the roads.  The damage to the roads is costing this economy hundreds of millions of pounds in damage to cars and in higher insurance costs because of higher insurance claims and, unlike the roads where all the materials are home produced, virtually every part of every car is imported.  The damage to cars as a result of those potholes is immense and it is costing the economy millions of pounds.  Not fixing the roads is false economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister has presided over the worst roads programme in living memory as well as the worst housebuilding programme. This is the Government who solemnly promised in 1985, and again in 1987 going into a general election, that they would abolish local charges.  Who could believe even the Lord's Prayer out of the mouth of the Minister or any of his colleagues?  This is not the only promise the Minister has not kept.</P>
      <P>I want to turn to the motion put down by The Workers' Party.  It is far too simplistic.</P>

The Workers' Party did not touch that, and so they produced a simplistic motion.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party, whose Minister and leader introduced the legislation, are now, for electoral purposes, campaigning to abolish it.

      <P>I am glad this motion was put before us tonight.  It brings back some pretty bad memories because it was at this time in 1985 that I, as a new candidate for the local authority elections, had to bear the brunt of the Fianna Fáil hypocrisy that was in vogue at that time where they campaigned on a particular platform, part of which was that they would abolish the local charges and when they got in to power, they would change the whole system.  What did they do when they got back to power?  They did a wonderful stylish U-turn.  I do not know <Col N="2294" /> whether it was the first U-turn or the 69th U-turn, but it was the kind of U-turn that the present Minister is able to do with a flourish, and he is quite used to it at this stage.  He should not attack The Workers' Party for their irresponsible attitude in Opposition because I have a funny feeling that The Workers' Party learned a lot of the tricks of the trade from the Minister and the members of his party.</P>
      <P>In truth the Fianna Fáil of 1985 who went around telling the people they would abolish the water charges were a most irresponsible bunch of politicians. They are the people who filled the Irish electorate with a wonderful cynicism, that is what I find when I am canvassing these days.  They remember the mid-seventies when Fianna Fáil in Opposition went around the place rabble rousing. When the country needed stability Fianna Fáil were not there to offer it. They urged every pressure group they could to create as much hassle as possible for the Government of the day.  This is in stark contrast with the position adopted by the Fine Gael Party of 1987 who could have brought Fianna Fáil to their knees any time they wanted between 1987 and 1989, but they decided to put the nation before party interests.  It cost us, and it is still costing us to some degree, but we are gradually pulling our way out of it again.  It cost us, because it seems that sometimes honesty does not pay.  It certainly does not pay for a while.  One is better in the short term to use sleight-of-hand and shady tactics.  It is probably a bit more exciting, it probably grabs more attention.  In the short term it probably pays, but it did not really pay for the Fianna Fáil Party of the mid-eighties, because twice they failed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to raise this disturbing case here tonight.  For the purpose of the debate I will call my client, <Col N="2295" /> Gerry.  Gerry is suffering from motor neurone disease or cerebellar ataxia.  This is a degeneration of the nerve cells in the spinal cord which affects muscular movements.  For the past three years Gerry has been residing in York House which is run by the Salvation Army.  I compliment the staff of York House for what they have done up to now for Gerry but the administration of York House would be the first to admit that it is not a hospital, that it is basically a direct access hostel for the homeless of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Gerry needs medical attention and this has been acknowledged by the staff of York House.  This is well known to his family and friends some of whom are here tonight listening to this debate.  In York House there are two care assistants during the day but there is no cover during the night with the exception of a night porter.  What would happen to Gerry if he required assistance during the night?  Gerry is getting progressively worse.  I have witnessed this over the past two years.  In recent weeks I went to York House to visit Gerry.  I look for Gerry in the care room and there he sits in the corner huddled on a chair.  He cannot speak and his only diversion is the television. Gerry needs a straw to feed; he cannot co-ordinate his movements; he cannot walk without an aid.  Imagine trying to get to the first or second floor dormitory in that condition.  Gerry has an active mind and the facilities in the hostel are totally unacceptable to him.  He requires occupational therapy and physical therapy if he is to retain any dignity in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years I have made repeated representations, as have his family, to the EHB and to the Minister to provide long term care for him.  Gerry needs a long term facility that will allow him to be active and in order to get medical care. I know there are many hundreds and perhaps thousands of people like Gerry <Col N="2296" /> in the country who need this care.  Caring members of his family and friends have tried everything to get long term care for Gerry.  They are here tonight to hear the Minister confirm that he acknowledges the problem and that there is a long term facility available so that a person like Gerry can have dignity for as long as he lives.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to give that confirmation tonight.  I ask the Minister, the Eastern Health Board and the Department to give this case the priority it deserves.  I hope the efforts of the people who are working on behalf of Gerry who cannot represent himself will come to something and that the Minister will provide a solution tonight.</P>

      <P>The admission of this person to long-stay accommodation is a matter for the Eastern Health Board. The position is that the person in question is being accommodated in a hostel at present and the hostel authorities have advised the health board that his needs are being adequately catered for at this stage.  However, the Eastern Health Board are monitoring his condition and have arranged for occupational therapy and other services through their community care programme.  The board are keeping his circumstances under regular review and if his condition should deteriorate to the extent that the hostel is unable to provide for his needs, the board will then ensure that he is moved to suitable long-stay accommodation.  The board are arranging for a further assessment of the person in question.</P>
      <P>I will ask that that assessment be completed as quickly as possible.  I will contact the Deputy on the outcome of the assessment and on whether further action is then warranted.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, discussions have been proceeding since October 1990 about the proposed sale of the B &amp; I to the Irish Continental Group.  In this context, there has been extensive consultation between my Department and the B &amp; I group of unions as well as with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I have met trade union representatives on three occasions.</P>
      <P>These discussions were fruitful.  On 5 April 1991, the B &amp; I group of unions joined with my Department in issuing a press release saying that they were prepared to positively co-operate with the sale of B &amp; I to ICG, provided they got adequate assurances on key conditions affecting their members.</P>
      <P>My Department had indicated both to ICG and the B &amp; I group of unions that I wished the negotiations to be concluded by 2 May 1991.  However, in response to a request from ICTU and because of the difficult issues to be addressed and the comprehensive nature of negotiations, I agreed to withdraw this deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that the deal with ICG <Col N="2108" /> would be well concluded by now. However, the wheels of industrial relations grind more slowly than I anticipated. Even allowing for this.  I must say that I am very disappointed with the slow rate of progress in these negotiations.  I have asked both sides to expendite matters and have been assured that they will attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House on 17 April last, the proposed sale to ICG is the best deal possible for the B &amp; I and the taxpayer. It offers a future for B &amp; I as part of an enlarged Irish company strong enough to meet competition.  I cannot guarantee the future of the B &amp; I if this sale is not completed.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House in reply to a Dáil Question on 8 May last, I have received <Col N="2109" /> a number of submissions favouring a change in current Government policy on the Shannon stop-over to allow transatlantic flights to fly direct into Dublin on the grounds that this would lead to a significant increase in tourist traffic from North America into Ireland.  I also mentioned that I had received a large number of submissions in support of the <i>status quo.</i></P>
      <P>I have given my view on the Shannon stop-over policy on a number of occasions recently and the position remains that there is no change in Government policy in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is essential to have the maximum level of viable access services available for overseas tourists interested in coming to Ireland and the North American market is no exception.  As I already informed the House on 8 May, I have been having extensive discussions with a number of major US airlines with a view to securing additional services on the North Atlantic route.  In the latter context, I have given commitments to the Fly Dublin Direct Committee and to the Shannon Status Committee, with whom I have had recent discussions about the Shannon stop-over policy, that in the event of concrete proposals being made to me by any US airline for significant new or expanded services to Ireland which would require a change in existing policy, I am prepared to discuss these proposals with them in full.</P>

      <P>I accept that, in general, transport costs in the Republic of Ireland are higher than those which apply in Northern Ireland. Some studies in recent years estimated a cost differential against Irish hauliers <i>vis-á-vis</i> their Northern Ireland counterparts of between 11 and 27 per cent.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The information in relation to first quarter results, 1987-91, is set out in the tabular statement, which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> There was a slight downturn in the first quarter of 1991 of 3.5 per cent on the same period in 1990.  This small drop, which was nowhere near as bad as has been originally feared, was due partly to economic recession in some of our main markets but chiefly to the adverse impact of the Gulf crisis on demand for international travel generally.  In response to these exceptional difficulties, the Government introduced a number of special initiatives aimed at minimising damage to our tourism performance this year and keeping the sector on line with Government targets set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government allocated an extra £1 million to Bord Fáil in the budget for additional marketing and promotion; arranged last March, immediately following cessation of hostilities in the Gulf, for a special conference of senior Board Fáilte officials and key representatives of the Irish tourism industry, which I chaired myself, to relaunch the 1991 tourism drive; and secured the agreement of the EC to make a further £1.25 million in ERDF funds available in 1991 to the Irish tourism industry for special marketing campaigns in the US, and in the British and continental markets later this year, at a special 75 per cent intervention rate.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures and the resurgence in international demand for holiday travel since March, I am convinced that with a determined effort from all involved in Irish tourism, 1991 will be another record year for the sector.</P>

In addition, I have taken this matter up directly with the Secretary of State for Transport and have informed him of our interest in the upgrading of the Holyhead-Crewe railway line and the development of through services to the Channel tunnel because of the significant economic benefit which this would have for this country.</P>

      <P>On 21 May 1991, the UN Security <Col N="2127" /> Council unanimously adopted Resolution 693 approving the establishment of a United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) on the basis of the report of the Secretary-General (S/22494) of 17 April 1991.</P>
      <P>The Secretary-General in his report adopted the recommendations of the preliminary UN mission mentioned by the Deputy that a human rights component be established &ldquo;at the earliest feasible moment in advance of an agreement of a cease-fire&rdquo;.  The Secretary-General also stated that the implementation of the second phase of ONUSAL would be dependent on the agreement and co-operation of both the Government of EI Salvador and the FMLN on the terms of a cease-fire.  The agreement of the two parties is awaited.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the ONUSAL mission in their efforts to bring about, and ensure the observance of, a peaceful reconciliation between the Government of EI Salvador and the FMLN.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Ireland, as one of the original signatories to the formation of the Council of Europe, is one of only five countries, namely: Ireland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the United Kingdom, from a total of 23 countries which has refused to contribute to the social development fund of the Council of Europe despite several requests to do so; if he will now reconsider the position with a view to having a contribution made to this fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The question of Irish participation in the social development fund of the Council of Europe has been reviewed from time to time.  It is considered that the purposes which the fund could serve in respect of Ireland are <Col N="2128" /> adequately catered for by other bodies of which Ireland is already a member.  The financial commitment which accession to the fund would entail would not be opportune in current budgetary circumstances.</P>

      <P>The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 690 on 26 April 1991 approving a report of the UN Secretary General on a referendum to be held concerning the self-determination of the Saharan people and deciding to establish, under their authority, a mission for the referendum (MINURSO).</P>
      <P>The member states of the European Community issued a statement on 17 May 1991 welcoming the adoption of the Resolution. They stated that this represented an important step towards a just and lasting settlement of the conflict in Western Sahara.</P>
      <P>Ireland supports the exercise by the people of the Western Sahara of their rights to self-determination and will be ready to play a part in MINURSO if called upon to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal has been issued by the UN Secretary General on behalf of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for funding the repatriation of refugees.  This matter is being considered at present, but it will be appreciated that there are very large demands on emergency funds this year due to the famine in <Col N="2129" /> Africa, the Bangladesh cyclone and the Kurdish refugee crisis.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer submitted a claim for a refund of tax around 3 May 1991.  However, as there was no P45 on file pertaining to his last employment details of pay had to be requested.  The necessary information was obtained on 29 May 1991 and a balancing statement prepared.  A cheque in the sum of £63.79 was issued to him on 13 June 1991.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> There has been a continuous surplus on our balance of trade since 1985.  The late eighties showed considerable export growth and while a decline in the value of exports took place in 1990 primarily as a result of severe economic difficulties in some of our major markets, export volume increased by 5 per cent for the year.  Irish exporters in 1991 will also be competing in a more difficult environment, but at this stage, exports are expected to approach £15 billion in value.</P>
    <P>The annual reports of Córas Tráchtála for all of the years concerned, except 1990, have been laid before the Oireachtas and each contains a detailed commentary on the export performance for the particular year.  CTT's annual report for 1990 will be published later in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently implemented the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991.  This Act extends the protection of a wide range of labour legislation to part-time workers who are normally expected to work for at least eight hours a week and who have completed 13 weeks service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young workers, including young workers in the retail business, are afforded further protection under the terms of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  This Act contains provisions about the minimum age for entry into employment, sets limits to the working hours of young people, provides for rest intervals and prohibits night work.  All complaints about infringements of this Act are investigated fully by my Department.  In addition, inspections are carried out on a routine <Col N="2150" /> basis by the labour inspectorate of my Department in establishments where young workers are employed to ensure compliance with protective legislation.</P>
    <P>On the question of pay levels, I should mention that the Labour Court has made an Establishment Order setting up a Joint Labour Committee for the Retail Grocery and Allied Trades.  The committee will draw up proposals for fixing rates of pay and conditions of employment and when these proposals have been ratified by the Labour Court through the making of an Employment Regulation Order, they will become statutory minimum rates of pay and statutory conditions of employment for the workers, including part-time workers, covered by the order.</P>
    <P>In addition, employers who come within the scope of the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Footwear, Drapery and Allied Trades Registered Employment Agreement are already required to pay a statutory minimum wage to their workers.</P>
    <P>My Department have power to enforce statutory minimum rates of pay under Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements and these rates of pay apply to both full-time and part-time workers.  When an Employment Regulation Order has been made in respect of the retail grocery and allied trades, the order will be enforced by my Department.</P>

There is as yet no clear evidence of any adverse effect from this kind of radiation, but the matter is receiving greater attention internationally.</P>
      <P>Section 9 (1) (c) of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, provides that the Minister for Energy may, by order, extend the powers and functions of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, to be established in the near future, to cover matters pertaining to non-ionising radiation as may be specified in the order.</P>

      <P>The principal aim of the board in paying supplements on a monthly basis is to reduce the frequency with which recipients are required to attend at health centres for payment.  The new arrangements have been generally welcomed by recipients.</P>
      <P>If in any particular instance, the payment of a rent supplement on a monthly basis creates difficulties for a recipient, the community welfare officer will discuss the options with him, including the possibility of a return to a weekly payment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>According to the records of my Department, the person concerned has not been employed since 1970.  Since that time he has made a variety of claims for unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and disability benefit.  He is not currently entitled to unemployment benefit as he has exhausted his entitlement and has not had any qualifying contributions paid since 1970.  He is not entitled to unemployment assistance as he has failed to fully disclose his means from land of which he is the beneficial occupant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has made several claims to disability benefit.  A claim made in March 1989 could not be allowed until February 1990.  According to the records of my Department, he did not have 260 paid contributions.  However, in December 1989 he supplied information concerning his employment in Great Britain.  The new information allowed his claim to be admitted up to 18 May 1989, on which date he was examined by a medical referee and was found to be capable of work.</P>
      <P>While the person concerned is known to be familiar with the procedures, I am prepared in the exceptional circumstances of this case to have credited contributions awarded for the period May 1989 to February 1990; i.e., while the position regarding the contributions was being clarified.  The effect of this decision will be to satisfy the contributions for a claim to disability benefit made on 11 June 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was examined <Col N="2153" /> by medical referees on three occasions in 1990 and was found to be capable of work.  He made an appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office and the appeals officer ruled in October 1990 that the person concerned is not entitled to disability beenfit.  In these circumstances, a further medical review is being arranged on an urgent basis and the question of entitlement will be decided when the results of the examination are available.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that, in addition to satisfying a means test, a claimant to unemployment assistance must also be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work to qualify for payment.  I am concerned that the conditions attaching to the unemployment assistance scheme should not discourage people from developing their skills with a view to their becoming self-supporting and I am reviewing these conditions to see what can be done in this regard.  The particular situation of full-time artists will be borne in mind in the context of this review.</P>

On occasions it can happen that claims submitted late in a month may not be included in the following month's payment.  However, the incidence of this is small and any claims not processed in time for inclusion in a particular month's payment would, of course, be paid the following month.</P>

      <P>The environment action programme stated the Government's decision to eliminate untreated discharges of sewage from major coastal towns by the year 2000 at a cost of up to £400 million.  A significant proportion of this investment will relate to Dublin Bay; relevant measures identified in the action programme and currently being planned are the provision of secondary treatment at Ringsend sewage treatment works, the ending of sewage sludge dumping by Dublin Corporation and the development of alternative sludge disposal arrangements.</P>
      <P>The operational programme: water, sanitary and other local services, 1989-1993, contains an indicative list of sewerage projects to be co-financed by the EC in that period.  The present estimated value of projects on this list which relate to Dublin Bay is some £65 million.</P>

    <P>Already the discharge of untreated effluent from the Dún Laoghaire outfall has been discontinued following the commissioning of the pumping station and <Col N="2166" /> submarine pipeline elements of the Dún Laoghaire main drainage scheme.  Water quality in this area of the bay has significantly improved as a result.  Proposals are at an advanced stage to discontinue the discharges from the Bulloch and Coliemore areas.  To date grants totalling £11.8 million have been approved and allocated to the Dún Laoghaire scheme for co-financing at a rate of 50 per cent by the EC.</P>

      <P>The reason the remains were detained was that the coroner for County Dublin directed early on Thursday, 2 May that a post mortem be carried out.  I have been informed by the hospital that this was originally scheduled for Friday, 3 May but, as the hospital's efforts throughout Thursday to phone three different numbers to advise the family of this failed, the family arrived to collect the remains on Thursday evening.  The post mortem was then carried out by special arrangement to facilitate the release of the <Col N="2171" /> remains that evening.  This resulted in delay to all involved and I have already conveyed my regrets to the family for the inconvenience caused by the hospital's inability to contact them.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the operation of the Clondalkin project, that the recent reports referred to by the Deputy are based on a misinterpretation of research findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent research has shown that intensive delivery of psychiatric services in the community, with domiciliary intervention, can substantially lighten the burden on families associated with severe psychiatric illness.  The Clondalkin project is a pilot project using these intervention techniques.  The work of the project is being evaluated to document the extent to which this new approach ameliorates the burden on families.  The extent of burden is being measured before and after the introduction of the new service.  The first phase of the project was concerned with evaluating the burden on families coping with illness which was being treated in the traditional way.  It is to the results of this phase that the reports raised by the Deputy refer. The new style of service has now commenced and, following its operation for a period of approximately three years, the <Col N="2173" /> burden on families with a relative who has a serious psychiatric illness will be reevaluated.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a pilot study and that my Department will be monitoring the results carefully.</P>

    <P>The incidence of tuberculosis in Ireland has decreased markedly over the past fifteen years from approximately <Col N="2174" /> 1,000 new cases to 600 new cases per annum.

Under the programmes, appropriate procedures are in place for prevention through BCG vaccination, for surveillance of the disease, treatment of infected persons, tracing of contacts and the provision of prophylaxis to contacts of infected persons, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>My Department have been in ongoing discussions with the authorities of the boys' and girls' national schools in St. John's Parish, Kilkenny, <Col N="2184" /> regarding suitable arrangements for the schools both from the educational and accommodation points of view.  It is proposed to provide an extension of two classrooms and ancillary accommodation to the boys' school and to upgrade and modernise the girls' and infants' school premises.  These proposals have been agreed with the schools' authorities.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the urgency in relation to these schools and I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to deal with the various stages of architectural planning expeditiously.  I will keep the Deputy fully advised on developments in this matter.</P>

      <Quest>if, in relation to Circular 15/91, she will outline the position (a) in the case where the board should decide not to appoint the choice of assessors if the decision of the school patron will have to be followed or whether the board members can point out that the patron cannot insist on the interviews being held, (b) in the case when the board decide not to make any appointment from the panel, she will outline the person who is empowered in the circumstances to make an appointment from the panel and (c) in the case where the only teacher on the panel is outside the 45 km limit, she will outline whether this teacher should be offered the post before any attempt is made to make a non-panel appointment.</Quest>

      <P>The position is that boards of management having fillable vacancies from September 1991 must fill these posts from the appropriate panel.  A panel teacher must accept the first offer he/she receives after 15 May 1991, unless an exemption can be claimed by the teacher on the grounds of maternity or that the 45 km limit, from school to school, is exceeded.  Failure to accept the offer will result in the teacher's name being removed from the panel and withdrawal of salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> When making a panel appointment, a board of management may select any teacher listed on the panel and make him/her a firm offer in writing.  If a teacher refuses an offer made after 15 May 1991, or does not reply within seven days, the board of management should inform my Department.  No further action should be taken by the board pending contact by my Department.</P>
    <P>An appointment from outside the panel can only be sanctioned where the appropriate panel is clear, or where the teachers remaining on the panel have refused an offer on the grounds that one of the exemptions previously referred to applies.</P>
    <P>If the only teacher remaining on the panel is outside the 45 km limit, the board of management should make a firm offer to the teacher who if he/she wishes may claim their exemption or indeed accept the offer.  It is not open to the board of management to refuse to offer a post to a teacher on the grounds of distance.</P>
