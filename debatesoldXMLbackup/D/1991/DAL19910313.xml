      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 11, 12 and 13.</P>

    <P>It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House that (1) Business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m., (2) the proceedings on Committee and remaining Stages of No. 11 and Report and Final Stages of No. 12, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., respectively, by one question, in each case, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by <Col N="798" /> the member of the Government in charge of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Private Member's Business which shall be No. 20 shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that business be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. this evening agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11 agreed? Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 12 agreed?</P>

      <P>In respect of No. 12, I referred to this matter on the Order of Business yesterday when I indicated I was very concerned that it was proposed to take Report Stage today. The Report Stage Bill was circulated only this morning.  It is quite impossible to give adequate consideration to a Bill which was circulated this morning and to which we are expected to have amendments in by 1.30 p.m. today.  It is on that basis that I am opposing the guillotine on this Bill. I do not believe it should be taken today.</P>
      <P>It is quite extraordinary that the Social Welfare Bill which, again, was circulated just this morning &mdash; 40 pages of proposals &mdash; is expected to be taken tomorrow.  I do not believe this House can reasonably expect to do justice either to the Sugar Bill or the Social Welfare Bill by putting them through in this way.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 12 be agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before proceeding further may I announce to the House that we have present with us this morning a very distinguished Member of the Canadian Parliament in the person of Mr. Noel Deignan.  I am sure Members and, indeed, his friends in the House would wish me to extend to him a most warm céad míle fáilte.

      <P>I should like to ask a question in respect of two items of promised legislation, namely, the provisions in the Finance Bill concerning the business expansion scheme and the suggested amendments to the family planning legislation.  In view of the fact that the Government seem to be changing their intentions on both these items almost daily, would they agree they are creating the impression that nobody is actually in charge of Government business and, to put it mildly, that the Government are quite simply incompetent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I seek some information from the Taoiseach in relation to the Finance Bill?  Will he tell us when the Finance Bill will be published?  Is it correct to assume that the Government will lose £15 million from the budget <Col N="801" /> estimates published by the Minister for Finance?  Will the Minister for Finance come to the House to clarify these matters?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach if he proposes or, indeed, if the Minister for Social Welfare proposes to make a statement to the House today with regard to the decision of the European Court of Justice which has found the State in breach of equality directives for social welfare recipients which, I understand, can cost the State up to £80 million?  It is a serious matter which needs to be addressed urgently.</P>

      <P>In the matter of Dáil business, Sir, would the Government agree that they are promoting disorder in this House if the House is treated with contempt?  Would they agree they are treating the House with contempt by failing to allow a debate on what stance the Government intend to take at the European summit in regard to economic and political union?  In this House we deserve to hear a democratic discussion on clearly stated Government proposals in regard to this very important matter. The Government's continuing silence on this matter is bringing the democratic process in this State into disrepute.</P>

    <Title>Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill, 1990: Committee and Final Stages:</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte has already mentioned, a number of amendments have been ruled out of order.  In anticipation of a query from Deputy Rabbitte and the other Deputies concerned, I will explain why these amendments have been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill, 1990, extends to certain part-time employees the benefits currently conferred on ordinary <Col N="811" /> employees by various enactments, including benefits payable from the social insurance and redundancy payments funds.  By seeking to extend these benefits to other types of part-time employees, the Deputies' amendments thus potentially impose additional charges on the Revenue.  That should be clear to all concerned. That is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to fully appreciate the import of your statement having regard to the fact that the purpose of the Bill is to afford the protection of various pieces of labour legislation to part-time workers.  In fact, one of the greatest problems we are confronted with in the Bill is the prospect of employers stepping outside the new Act in terms of avoiding its provisions in regard to part-time workers.  The amendments which have been adjudged to be out of order merely seek to ensure that those for whom the benefits of the Act were intended receive those benefits. Obviously, it is anticipated in the legislation that there will be a charge on the Exchequer in precisely the manner you suggest but it seems to contravene the very spirit of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Rabbitte, the Standing Orders of our House stipulate that in the event of additional charges being imposed on the Revenue, these amendments must be ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the amendments tabled in my name and some of those in Deputy Rabbitte's name go to the heart of ensuring that this legislation works.  I would draw your attention, Sir, to the fact that the legislation is designed to provide protection to workers who are expected to work for eight hours or more. The most substantial amendment which was ruled out of order is designed to ensure that employers do not seek to put themselves outside the legislation by, for example, employing someone one week for six hours and the next week for ten hours, in other words varying the hours <Col N="812" /> each week.  The amendment I tabled is to ensure that, where a worker is in continuous employment for 13 weeks and works for an average of eight hours per week in each of those weeks, that worker will get the protection intended by the Bill.  As the Bill is currently drafted employers who do not wish to provide protections have an easy mechanism to be permanently outside the Bill by employing part-time workers for different hours on a week to week basis. That would mean a coach and four could be driven through the Bill.</P>
      <P>The amendment imposes a charge on the Exchequer.  It is my understanding that it is the intention of the Minister for Labour to ensure that people who are in continuous employment and work on average eight hours per week will get protection under the Bill, but that protection is not in the Bill as it is currently drafted.  It seems that prior to this amendment being ruled out of order on the basis that it imposes a charge on the Exchequer, we should hear the Minister's view as to whether it was his intention &mdash; this may be a drafting error &mdash; that if someone worked on average eight hours per week for 13 weeks they would be excluded from the protections provided in the Bill because their hours varied from week to week and on occasion fell below the eight hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I help the Deputies by saying that the Chair has clearly and unambiguously ruled that while the amendments referred to seek to extend benefits to these part-time employees they clearly involve potential charges on the Revenue.  However there is nothing to prevent Members from discussing these aspects of the matter as we go through the Bill, as indeed Deputy Shatter has just done.  You may advert to that fact and hear the view of the appropriate Minister, but the fact remains, Deputies, that your amendments are out of order.  In accordance with the normal practice, precedent and rules of the House, and on the best advice of my office, I am quite satisfied that the amendments in question are out of order <Col N="813" /> for the reasons I have stated.  However, they can be discussed as we go along.  We must start on amendment No. 5 in the name of the Minister.  There is nothing to stop Deputies from expressing their feelings on this matter as regards the extension of benefits to these part-time workers and the implications thereof.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that you felt compelled to make this decision.  Nine of my amendments have been ruled out of order, and this does not help the Bill in any way.  While everybody in the House agreed in principle to the Bill on Second Stage, despite remarks from some of the Government backbenchers some reservations were expressed.  It is in an effort to strengthen the Bill that we put forward these amendments. You are now asking us to go through an exercise whereby we can refer to the amendments, but at the end of the day that is no good.  It is totally against the spirit of the discussions to date.  The introduction of this Bill was a very fruitful exercise and everybody was in favour of it.</P>
      <P>What I am concerned about is that the amendments involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  That does not specifically say there will be a charge on the Exchequer.  The people we are trying to include in this Bill are people who would make an insurance contribution.  Therefore there would be no liability; they would be contributors.  What we are trying to do is widen the net to bring in people who are making no contribution at present.  I realise the Minister cannot overrule your decision, a Cheann Comhairle, but this matter should be considered again.  It will be a rather futile exercise if many amendments are ruled out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make a general point in response to the Opposition spokesmen, who have been most helpful in this Bill, as I want to be in this debate. Many of the amendments that have been put down &mdash; and I have prepared my brief on the entire range of amendments &mdash; seek to grant to part-time workers rights over and above those which full-time workers enjoy under the relevant Acts.  I want to make it clear from the outset that in this Bill I am not in the business of trying to amend the main Acts which apply to full-time workers, and that was never my intention.</P>
      <P>A number of the amendments that are in order are related.  It is the intention in the Bill to provide <i>pro rata</i> benefits to part-time workers.  I made that commitment to the House and that is what I have been doing for many months.  The mechanism I employed in doing this is to treat in the same way as full-time workers all those part-time workers who have continuous service for not less than 13 weeks and are normally expected to work not less than eight hours a week.  I want to say to Deputy Shatter that I was asked about this matter on numerous occasions on Question Time and I made it clear that it was not my intention to go by the average hours because that would bring in all kinds of difficulties, as I already outlined and I will explain again if necessary.  Part-timers who are excluded from the various Acts such as the Unfair Dismissals Act, by virtue of the exclusion provision in those Acts, are generally identified by hours and sometimes by social insurance status.  That is what I am seeking to do in the Bill, and I want to make that clear from the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address the point the Minister has raised, that what he is seeking to do is to apply benefits <i>pro rata</i> to part-time workers and not to confer on them benefits that full-time workers do not have.  That fails to <Col N="816" /> recognise the unique position of part-time workers.  They are not in similar circumstances to full-time workers.  Secondly, it is contrary to the spirit of the EC draft directive on atypical workers which expressly recognises the role of agency workers.</P>
      <P>We are finally dealing with this welcome legislation so many years later than many of us would have liked, nonetheless we welcome the fact that it is before the House now, but it will be out of kilter with the EC Directive on atypical workers.  We have gone through the manner in which many part-time workers &mdash; the majority of whom are women &mdash; are exploited.  Many of them are agency workers and are employed through agencies.  By the very nature of the job they do and of the demand in the market place for part-time workers, that will continue to be the case even after the enactment of this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that an employer can evade his responsibilities under this Bill by continuing to employ people through an agency; therefore, a very special claim can be made in this regard.  Of all the decisions made in terms of ruling amendments out of order, the one relating to the definition of employer is most difficult to accept in the sense that it merely seeks to insert a definition of employer which is more in keeping with the practice on the ground.  The fact that there may be a potential charge on the Exchequer seems to be in conflict with the entire thrust of the Bill in being adjudged out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments I tabled and were ruled out of order were not designed to extend the application of the Bill to reforming general areas of labour or industrial law.  They deal with the workings of this Bill which will fail in its objective if the Minister does not take on board the amendments which were ruled out of order, particularly amendments Nos. 1 and 9.  For the good employer it does not matter whether the amendments are made because he will abide by the legislation; the bad employer now has an in-built basis in the legislation for avoiding all its provisions.  There is a major, <Col N="817" /> legal fundamental flaw in this legislation and I have no doubt that, if the Minister does not accept those two amendments, (1) the legislation will not work properly and (2) within two years the Minister will have to come back to this House to seek to make amendments to it along the lines proposed in amendments Nos. 1 and 9, to comply with the European Directive and ensure that the legislation has the domestic applicability intended.</P>
      <P>I will give a simple example: a woman worker employed by a cleaning firm on a contract basis to clean a block or blocks of offices can be told that she is in regular employment as follows: in the first week of every month she will work for ten hours, in the second week of the month she will work for four hours, in the third week of every month she will work for ten hours and in the fourth week of every month she will work for four hours and so on.  They can be her terms of employment, on an agency basis, in which case she is outside the scope of the Bill if she works on an eight hour basis.  She will not be someone falling within the terms of this legislation who is generally expected to work eight hours.</P>
      <P>If the intention is to provide protection to workers in circumstances where employers want to evade the provisions of this legislation, the in-built fatal flaw in the legislation means it will not work. I do not understand why there is a major difficulty in saying that someone in the continuous service of an employer for not less than 13 weeks and, in that context, they have worked an average of not less than eight hours per week for that employer &mdash; as I suggested in amendments Nos. 1 and 11 and is suggested in amendment No. 9 tabled by Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; should be protected under this legislation.  If someone has been in continuous employment for one year, two years or three years, working for the same employer for not less than an average of eight hours per week, surely the legislation should protect that employee?  I do not accept that legislation cannot be drafted to allow that to happen. If the Minister does not take this on board the Bill will not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> We are scheduled to complete all Stages of the Bill today but I invite the Minister to give further consideration to this amendment and, if necessary, agree across the floor of the House that the Bill should not be completed today.  This is a fundamentally crucial issue and it relates to the differentiation between full-time and part-time employment.</P>
    <P>The other matter, equally fundamental, is to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are not evaded in circumstances in which it is socially highly undesirable.  If someone is in regular, continuous employment with the same employer for one, two or three years, should that person not get protection even if the continuous employment is less than eight hours?  More often than not it is women who are exploited in this area. Why should the woman working for seven hours per week for the same employer for six months or a year not get protection under the Bill?  She is not a temporary worker, not someone recruited for three or four weeks to alleviate a temporary problem in a firm where there has been an unexpected increase in work which will not last.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in another amendment which was ruled out of order &mdash; but is relevant in response to the Minister &mdash; that where someone has been in the continuous service of an employer for not less than 26 weeks and for eight hours or less, by virtue of the continuity of service the protections provided in the Bill should apply.  I emphasise that these amendments were not tabled to embarrass the Minister or to try to hijack the Bill into providing protection it is not intended to provide; they were tabled to ensure that this Bill will work and that the broad intention &mdash; which is to provide protection for part-time workers in continuous employment who work a reasonable number of hours per week &mdash; will be there in reality.  Far too often in this House we pass legislation which gives and appearance of protection when, in reality, it does not provide any.  I say that as someone with a degree of experience in this area, who has consulted people who have specific experience in the <Col N="819" /> workings of all our labour laws at the practical level in the context of dealing with employees and employers.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of amendments Nos. 1 and 11 because they are essential to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 coincides with an amendment which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions also sought to be made to the Bill in their document circulated last January.  It is an amendment which will ultimately have to be made.  If this legislation is passed without the amendment the EC Directive will require it to be made.  I invite the Minister to give further consideration to these issues.  We should also agree across the floor of the House that all Stages of the Bill should not be completed so that further time could be given to that consideration.</P>

      <P>When we agreed that the Bill should conclude at 1.30 p.m. today nobody anticipated that so many amendments would have been ruled out of order.  I realise how important it is for the Minister to get this legislation through because, tomorrow, we will be discussing the Social Welfare Bill and it is desirable to finish our work on this Bill.  Section 1 (3) (b) states that the Minister may, by order, amend the definition of &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; so as to alter either or both the minimum number of weeks of continuous service and the minimum number of hours a week that a person is normally expected to work, and may so amend where that definition has been previously amended by virtue of this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister prepared to give an assurance to the House, as a means of making some progress in the debate, that if some abuses arise in the coming months he would be prepared to come back and make an order that would alter the threshold and the various definitions which we are now being deprived of an opportunity to put to a vote?  Deputies Rabbitte and Shatter in their amendments refer to the employer.  The Labour Party decided on the employee, and we are trying to achieve the same goal.  Is there some <Col N="820" /> means whereby we can address this problem? Contrary to some of the comments we have heard in the House, there is quite a degree of exploitation in the workplace. Jobs are in short supply and until we here, as legislators, do something to protect the workers' interests that exploitation will continue.  In his reply will the Minister give the House an assurance that, if need be, he will introduce the necessary order in this House within, say, the next six months if at all possible to overcome this present impasse?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express not just disappointment but sheer depression at what is in the Bill.  We all including the Minister, looked forward to this Bill, and we know his commitment to it.  The concept of part-time work is seen at European level as positive and it can be a productive way of dividing one's life between domestic responsibility and work outside the home.  That is the ideal we all are working to and we thought would be incorporated in the Bill, as it is in the EC directive.  We do not want to find once again that our legislation is faulty and we have to threaten to take it to Europe or waste the time of this Dáil in bringing it back for amendment and strengthening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is entitled The Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill, 1990 but as Deputy Shatter says, it provides no protection.  Even more alarming, the implementation of this Bill could mean that not alone would it not meet what we are trying to do but, it could defeat the intention of the measure.  We know there is manipulation and exploitation in the workplace, particularly of part-time workers who are the most vulnerable.  I have taken up Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan's point about having cases of abuse brought back to the House. Part-time workers, particularly women, are so vulnerable that they are the last to produce evidence of exploitation or put themselves forward to give such evidence because they know that when women part-time workers try to advance any kind of action for their protection or for improving their conditions of work they <Col N="821" /> are told there is a bus that can collect another group of women who do not wish to be organised or will not have to be organised in the way they wish to be organised.  I know the Minister is aware of that vulnerability and the exploitation of women workers particularly and their lack of voice and power due to not being organised.</P>
    <P>If these amendments are disallowed or not taken on board in some way by the Minister, the position of part-time workers could be worse than it is now. That is the last thing we want in this House and I ask that every effort be made in the time we have to see those amendments as fundamental to the Bill to provide the protection we seek.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  I would like him to clarify something. Part-time meter readers are employed by the ESB.  They are classed S.1 and they are paying some contribution in insurance to the ESB but the ESB are paying nothing for them.  They can be let go at any time.  Can some protection be introduced in this Bill for these ESB meter readers?  Some of them are concerned about their jobs.  They are part-time but on contract to the ESB.  My worry is that if these people become ill they may not be able to draw unemployment benefit and that is the reason I raise this matter.</P>

      <P>I was one of the people on this side who welcomed this Bill when it came before us.  It had been sought for a long time.  I am conscious that this is dealing with a group of people at the lowest level of the labour market, people who earn £25, £30 or £40 per week, working behind the counter in pubs or cleaning offices &mdash; indeed, some public offices &mdash; or banks, all areas of high productivity where proper payment should be made to workers.  Many of them had seen in this Bill a ray of hope that for the first time they would be treated with some dignity and justice and be brought into the ranks of normal workers.  I would regret if the Bill did not achieve that and <Col N="822" /> we will make every effort in this House to ensure that it does so.  The perception could be that it is only a token and it may have to go somewhere else, perhaps to Europe like the case that was resolved there this morning.  Again, we are talking about a majority of women.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage it was signalled from this side of the House that there was concern.  The Minister is very fairminded. He consults with people and I know he went to a great deal of trouble to ensure the Bill was right.  I ask him to have second thoughts about it.  If he sees the coalition of agreement and of concern that is here, I hope he will give more time to it and have a rethink about the matter. Every consideration and co-operation will be given to him in this connection from all of us here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I would like to repeat what previous Opposition speakers have said about this Bill.  It appears to be fatally flawed.  This is unfortunate because of the short time we have to try to finish Report and Final Stages by 1.30 p.m. today.  I do not know how that is going to be done because the Minister has not answered the Opposition reservations about the Bill.  It is very bad practice to take Committee and Report Stages of an important Bill like this one after the other.  Surely the whole point of Report Stage is to allow the Minister to consider the points and amendments brought forward by the Opposition on Committee Stage.  We did almost the same thing with the Sugar Bill when there has been only one day between Stages. Surely there should be at least a week between Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike some of the other parties, the Green Party are very much in favour of the concept of part-time work.  It is very important because, for example, it allows a normal sort of housewife-children-husband relationship where both parents can work part-time and can take responsibility for the children.  It is essential that adequate protection be available to part-time workers, but particularly to women who are extensively employed in the <Col N="823" /> cleaning trade and are notoriously exploited.  They are also exploited in the bar trade to some extent, although some bar keepers treat their staff well.  We will not think any the worse of the Minister if he withdraws this Bill or provides for the Report Stage to be taken next week or whenever he thinks appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">

      <P>I am a little concerned by what Deputy Garland said about his party's position on part-time workers.  That would be fine if there was the choice and there was full-time employment.  The Deputy is opposed to that and, indeed, took the Labour Party to task for indicating that they would like to see full employment.</P>
      <P>The reasons Deputy Garland's party are in favour of part-time work deserve some comment.  To improve the quality of family life, we should use family legislation and not this Bill which is to deal with an exploited section of the community. We should not endorse what is being offered to us here on the basis that it is good for the family.  A very small minority of people who are working part-time would not opt for full time employment if it was available.  The Deputy is losing sight of what we are trying to achieve here.  If there are family problems they should be addressed in a different way.  Here we are trying to stamp out the abuse of people in part time work and the Deputy's approach will not help in that area.</P>

      <P>There are some important amendments which will go a long way towards addressing what Deputy Shatter is trying to achieve, to help people who could be caught in the trap of being let go after a 12 week contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an effort to convince people that we have just discovered something new.  There is nothing new.  I have been dealing with this issue now for about two years and with the help of people from all parties we have made a <Col N="824" /> lot of progress.  This Bill is taking all our labour legislation and ensuring that it covers part-time workers who up to this have not been included in labour legislation. We are not trying to solve the problems of agency and contract workers.</P>
    <P>I gave a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that we would examine the whole area of contract work.  To date, we do not have enough research on contracts and on casual and agency work but after examination of the area we will, if necessary, legislate on that.  On the other hand substantial studies were done by Congress, political parties, unions and so on into what is wrong with part-time workers.  I am seeking to address the issue of part-time workers.</P>
    <P>I am more determined than most in this country to stop abuse of employees. I take the goodwill of the people who spoke here into account.  If I see abuses which we had not thought about in this legislation I will do something about it. With the help of the two debates we have had in this House, we have put a lot of effort and thought into this and we will stamp out abuses.  I am not seeking to give all kinds of casual workers protection under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand the motivation behind Deputy Shatter's amendments.  I am against them because we are not trying to deal with casual and agency workers in this Bill, although we intend to examine that area.  Regulation of casual and agency workers would not be appropriate under this legislation and it would probably be regarded as an inconvenience to both employer and employee.  People in RGDATA, in shops and in the bar trade, have confirmed that this would be an inconvenience.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment would extend cover to a more casual part-time worker who would accumulate 26 weeks' service on long hours over an extended period without having any significant attachment to the labour force or without depending on the work for their earnings. That would be wrong and it is not what I <Col N="825" /> am trying to do.  The Deputy's amendment, for example, would bring babysitters under the scope of the Bill and would establish a separate category of workers which would make the Bill unwieldy and make administration totally impossible.  The existing legislation is well worked out and has been amended in order to eliminate abuses.  If in the future an Agency Bill is required to cater for some of the people we have missed, rights for full-time workers will be applied in the part-time legislation and any future legislation.  Today we are doing a particular job and what might happen later will be linked to it.</P>
    <P>The last day, Deputy Shatter rightly pointed out that perhaps it is time to look at legislation in the labour area and to tidy it up.  This Bill does that in a simple way by referring to existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy mentioned an EC Directive on atypical work.  That deals with various kinds of workers including part-time, temporary, agency and a whole range of areas.  This Bill only deals with part-time workers.  I am not taking credit for a lot of things I am not doing.  In dealing with part-time workers we are including in this legislation approximately 92 per cent of the hours worked in this country by part-timers.  This is a massive undertaking.  I totally agree with Deputy Rabbitte that we should examine agency and contract work.  I am not trying to do it in this Bill but I give a commitment that now that I have other Bills out of the way, I will spend my energies doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is giving a commitment to tackle agency and contract work.  When The Workers' Party brought in their Bill on part-time workers the Minister gave a commitment to bring forward a Bill and he has done so.  I accept the Minister's good faith in this area, but it is fair to make the point, as Deputy Fennell said, that this side of the House clearly signalled reservations on Second Stage.  We have not, as the Minister put it, discovered something new this morning.  Some of the most serious exploitation takes place and women are <Col N="826" /> at their more vulnerable in the contract agency sector where the phenomenon of part-time work is so endemic.  The fact that the Minister has said that this Bill will not try to tackle the problems facing agency and contract workers will leave a great share of the marketplace untouched.  I hold the view that this sector will grow and that structures will be reorganised so that many of them will become part of the contract agency phenomenon. In preparing The Workers' Party Bill we carried out some considerable research on it.  I think the Minister has his ear sufficiently close to the ground to know that both this week and last week the employers discussed and framed new mechanisms in an effort to ensure that the provisions of this Bill would not apply in their situation.</P>
      <P>For example, one of the unions involved have brought to my attention the fact that it is now fairly common in the retail sector for women to be employed on five hour contracts and to be then told &ldquo;you are coming in on Saturday, I presume&rdquo;.  The fact that they might, as Deputy Shatter put it, work 12 or 13 hours is neither here not there as the contract states that they are employed for five hours and they are then asked to come in on Saturday.  They have no choice in the matter because if they fail to turn up they will lose the job that they so very badly need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that this Bill confers benefits on workers who have been disgracefully neglected in the past but the problem is that those rights will not be worth a great deal unless there are commensurate sanctions. That is one of the weaknesses in the Bill, and it encompasses what we are discussing here.  It seems the sanctions are inadequate in a situation where an employer goes out to deliberately frustrate the provisions of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to cast his mind back to the debate we had on the Industrial Relations Act during which we finally came up with a formula on the famous section 11 which states that one may picket a secondary employer who acts for the purpose of undermining the dispute.  There is a necessity, where an employer acts for the <Col N="827" /> purpose of undermining the provisions of this Bill, for some meaningful commensurate sanctions to apply.</P>
    <P>I do not know what attitude the Minister will take to my amendment, No. 38, which deals with this matter in a broad sense.  That amendment seeks to insert a new section which would read as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where an employee would have conferred on him rights under the provisions of this Act but for a deliberate act by an employer to frustrate the acquisition of such rights or where an employer acts for the purposes of avoiding the provisions of this Act in respect of either or both the minimum number of weeks of continuous service and the minimum number of hours, the employee or employees affected may refer the matter to the Tribunal for determination.</P>
    <P>(2)  Dismissal for the purposes of breaching continuity of service shall be an unfair dismissal.</P>
    <P>Without going into the area which the Ceann Comhairle said would be a potential charge on the Exchequer, I say this is a sanction which would apply where an employer seeks to avoid the requirement of a 13 week threshold where they say to an employee that they are giving them a fixed contract for three months, then let them go for a few weeks and bring them back on another three months contract.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have examined the points made by Deputy Rabbitte and others on Second Stage during the past few weeks.  The point was made that there is a danger that an employer might move to a figure less than eight hours but I have investigated this matter and checked with the trade unions and others who deal with this area, which covers supermarkets and publicans, and do not believe that there will be any attempt to make such a move to any great extent.  I would like to put on the record of the House that I have got an assurance from the supermarkets that they can live with the legislation.  They do not like it but <Col N="828" /> they have assured me that they will not seek to play games as they did when the figure stood at 21 hours, attempting to move to 20 hours, and when it was at 20 hours, attempting to move to 19 hours.  I asked for that assurance because otherwise we would have to reconsider what we are doing.  Naturally, we will monitor the implementation of this provision.</P>
      <P>I have taken the point made by Deputy Rabbitte and others that employers may seek to move from 14 weeks to 12 weeks and addressed it in an amendment similar to the one put forward by Deputy Rabbitte. Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Shatter have also put down amendments on this matter.  My amendment, amendment No. 26, states that whenever a person is dismissed by an employer and is then re-employed within a prescribed period, that person will have access to the tribunal who can then look at the work contract to see if the employer was taking advantage of the ten or 12 week period to ensure that someone would not be working continuously for 13 weeks within a 26 week period.  We do not want to make provision for those who do seasonal work but rather for the young person who is employed for ten weeks, who is then left off and taken back on within four weeks.  Under the original Act the tribunal did not have the power to act.  I have taken the points made on Second Stage into account and have addressed the matter satisfactorily in my amendment.</P>

      <P>May I take it that if there are abuses the Minister will come back into the House in six months' time to introduce the necessary measures to stamp them out?  There have already been reports of such abuses &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte referred to this earlier on &mdash; and we have all received telephone calls from various organisations.  It is for that reason that my amendment, amendment No. 36, which has been ruled out of order, proposes that the Bill should apply retrospectively from 18 December 1990, the date on which the Bill was circulated. Many people are already under attack from employers in an effort to get over <Col N="829" /> the threshold and it is for this reason that we are endeavouring to abolish it. Deputy Shatter has proposed that it be reduced to four hours but the only way to stamp out this abuse is to abolish the threshold.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asked should provision be made for babysitters.  A provision could be made for those involved in casual work for an hour or two such as a young person under a certain age acting as a babysitter, but as it stands the Bill is wide open to abuse.  If there is to be justice the Bill needs to be extended to cover those who are not covered under existing labour legislation.  I note the Minister's reference to the existing legislation and his statement that there is a need to tidy it up.  That is an admission that all is not well in the labour area.  We should be quite specific and do everything to ensure there is no further abuse.  This can be achieved by the abolition of the threshold and the inclusion of contract workers.  We are actually discriminating against legitimate employers and assisting people who operate in the black economy by employing contract workers.  Life is being made more difficult for people paying PRSI.  We are on the side of the cowboys, and that is regrettable.</P>

      <P>We seem to be ranging far and wide over the entire Bill.  Without providing for averaging of hours this Bill will run into major problems.  The Minister is of a different view and will not be convinced.  I have no doubt that some employers will act in good faith but there will be major problems.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that we should discuss amendments in an ordered way.  I have no objection to amendment No. 5 which, in theory, we are discussing.</P>
      <P>We have all made our point about continuity, the number of hours and our reservations. Our amendments have unfortunately been ruled out of order.  I hope the Minister will consider what has been said, particularly about the averaging issue.  That is the fundamental problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said on Second Stage that <Col N="830" /> his Department were reviewing the matter of contract workers.  I suppose it is logical to say that we do not want to extend to part-time contract workers rights that full-time contract workers do not have.  There is great concern that the concept of contract working is being used to evade commitments.  We need to tackle the overall problem of contract workers.  There are some trades in which people are only employed on contract. People who used to be covered by legislation covering unfair dismissals and so on are now outside it.  If the Minister is prepared to give a commitment that he will not merely examine that problem but will introduce legislation to bring within the protections of the labour law provisions contract workers who are in reality employees, I will be satisfied.</P>

I am concerned about agency workers, where there is evidence of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy O'Sullivan's comment on untidy legislation, I was not referring to this Bill as being untidy but rather the Acts referred to last week.  A lot has been changed since 1970.  Shortly I intend to change legislation on the payment of wages, the study of which goes back to the 1700s.  It is mind boggling.  It <Col N="831" /> includes the Truck Acts of 1830, 1850 and 1870.</P>

Full-time workers are operating from an organised level of power.  The people we are talking about are operating from an unorganised level of powerlessness.  I am referring to contract workers.

    <P>&ldquo;(f) (i)  the definition of `employee' <Col N="832" /> in section 2 (1) of the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, in so far as it has the effect of excluding employees from the application of that Act by virtue of the Social Welfare (Subsidiary Employments) Regulations, 1979, the Social Welfare (Employment of Inconsiderable Extent) Regulations, 1991, or any other regulations for the time being prescribed by the Minister under subsection (3) of this section, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  paragraph (a) of the definition of `employer' in section 2 (1) of that Act,</P>
    <P>or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is necessitated by the extension of social welfare insurability to persons earning over £40 per week, which will take effect from 6 April next.  Given the change in the social welfare provision, the current wording in the Bill would have excluded workers whom it was not the intention to exclude from the right to maternity leave.  That is basically those who work more than eight hours a week and have 13 weeks' service but earn less than £40 a week.  The effect of the proposed amendments is that there are now two excluding provisions, the provisions which exclude part-timers from the benefits of the relevant Act in so far as the Maternity Act is concerned and the 18 hours and the £40 per week.</P>

      <P>I am glad the problem is shared.  As I understand it where an employee is earning £40 or more &mdash; the limit was set at £60 in the budget the year before last &mdash; there is an onus on the <Col N="833" /> employer to pay the 17.5 per cent contribution in its entirety whereas if the employee was earning less than £40 per week, there is only a 0.5 per cent basic occupational injuries contribution. Therefore, there is a gap between the £40 and £60 rates.  There is a discrepancy between the threshold the Minister is establishing in this Bill and what I understand is in the social welfare legislation. How far does this amendment go in putting this matter line ball with the social welfare legislation?  The Minister will remember, that the Minister for Social Welfare in 1990 exempted employees who were earning £60 per week or less from paying social insurance.  In this legislation the Minister is setting a threshold of eight hours a week and at an hourly rate of £3.50 per hour which some of these people are earning, it falls a long way short of the new cut-off point.</P>

      <P>I am particularly interested in this amendment.  I would like it spelled out better because an employer has already been on to me asking what he should do because the provisions of this Bill would put an increased cost on him which he would not be able to pass on to his principals.  He indicated that he would have to think of ways in which he could ensure that his workers would fall below the threshold. Again, we are back to the issue of thresholds and I would imagine that this will be an area where we will have abuses. Will the Minister give us an example of how this will work?</P>

      <P>In the Social Welfare Bill, which the House will be debating tomorrow, the Minister is seeking also to assist part-time workers.  In my Bill, if I had not moved this amendment, women earning less than £40 per week &mdash; there are, unfortunately, many, particularly in the contract area &mdash; would be excluded from maternity protection irrespective of the hours worked.  The amendment brings in these workers.  If they work more than eight hours per week and have worked for more than 13 weeks but earn under £40 per week, they are entitled to <Col N="834" /> the benefits of the Bill.  They would have been excluded otherwise and people would have had to earn more than £40 before they would be entitled to the benefits in the Bill.  I did not want to have a money threshold to qualify for benefits; I wanted to keep it on an hours and weeks basis.</P>

I am not arguing on behalf of the employer who finds himself in this gap paying wages of between £40 and £60.  The Minister may well say this is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  We got this huge tome this morning, a 43 page Social Welfare Bill &mdash; it is not my area, and I do not really understand it and we are supposed to have a position on it for tomorrow.  The employer is now liable in total in the interregnum for social insurance whereas if the employee was earning £39, the employer would have a liability of only 0.5 per cent.</P>

I am sure that on the Second Stage of the Bill tomorrow it will be moved.  The Deputy is correct, in so far as I understand the situation.  Regardless of what was happening in the social welfare area I was anxious that I would not get tied into a position of the money value and that my Bill would not take on a third threshold.  There is an hours threshold of eight hours per week and a threshold on the number of weeks worked of 13, with the exceptions Deputy Rabbitte put forward, and I do not want to set a money threshold.  In this amendment I am avoiding getting into a money threshold. The issue of employers' contributions has been raised with me but it will not affect my Bill.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind what Deputy Fennell has said about an employer finding himself in difficulty, and the Minister's concern not to impose a financial threshold, that he wanted an hours threshold, are we now creating incentives for employers to bring the person below the eight hour threshold? If there is going to be an extra liability on an employer which he feels he cannot bear, are we giving him encouragement to employ a person for less than eight hours per week?  We are caught in a catch 22 situation which will be very difficult to resolve.</P>

An employer would have been able to say if I pay an employee under £40 he will not be covered by the provisions of this legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to establish if the scope of the amendment relates only to the maternity area.  The problem we are discussing arises from the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to extend social insurance on what the programme calls &ldquo;an appropriate basis&rdquo; to part-time workers.  In so doing it sets a threshold of £40 per week.  I agree with the Minister that we have enough thresholds without him introducing a money threshold.  We are setting this new threshold of £40 per week.  Workers were previously exempt from paying social insurance up to £60 per week after which they paid the normal 5.5 per cent and the employer paid the 12.2 per cent, or whatever it is.  However, in the gap now between £40 per week and £60 per week the employer will be liable for the total.  I am worried that, human nature being what it is &mdash; and some employers especially being what they are &mdash; they will manipulate that situation to cause the remuneration of the particular worker concerned to be brought below £40 so that they would not have the liability of the extra cost.  I am, therefore, concerned to know how exactly does the Minister's threshold of eight hours per week gel with that £40 in the legislation.</P>
      <P>To go back to the point about the JLC, I do not know what it is at the moment but I know that eight hours at £3.50 an hour is a good deal less than £40 a week. Whereas the Minister for Labour seems to confer benefits with his Act, the Minister for Social Welfare will leave an area there that is unprotected.  I accept that this may be directed more properly at the Minister for Social Welfare tomorrow, but we are concerned about it.</P>

      <P>The subsection we refer to here, subsection (3) (b) gives the Minister the power by order to amend the definition of regular part-time so as to alter either threshold, the 13 weeks' continuous service or the eight hours.  My amendment would seek to substitute &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; for &ldquo;alter&rdquo;.  In other words, the Minister has power in the new legislation, when enacted, to alter the thresholds.  While I am not imputing to this Minister any motives to alter the terms to the detriment of the workers concerned, I am nonetheless concerned that that is what will be on the Statute Book.  The Minister says he is already back at 1750 in terms of labour legislation.  I hope Dermot Morgan does not hear about it because, having regard to the man the Taoiseach was trying to put into the Department of Labour, if Dermot Morgan should hear he is dealing with 1750 legislation, I can see some scope for him in that area.  Let us imagine, for the sake of it, that we were to get a new Minister with such a disposition. He might want to alter the threshold upwards so that it would be worsened from the point of view of the workers concerned.  This is a power that the Minister has by order and which, as it stands at the moment, would not necessarily come before the House.  I am merely seeking a confirmation that he would not alter it to the detriment of workers.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy would want to copperfasten the situation so that the only way the thresholds can move is downwards.  That would be my intention in the foreseeable future and it is probably the direction in which they will move.  However, there are other checks in the system, particularly the powers given to the Oireachtas in section 1 (3) (c).  I would prefer to retain the flexibility inherent in the term &ldquo;alter&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> It is also important, as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out earlier, that we would have flexibility in the event of our having to act quickly in any circumstances.  The disadvantage in the last few years was that if I sought to make a change I did not have the powers to do so by order.  I appreciate the Deputy's point in regard to the future and none of us can predict what will happen in the future.  I think, however, the word &ldquo;alter&rdquo; does allow flexibility and I would ask the Deputy to leave it in at this stage.</P>

      <P>In agreeing to withdraw amendment No. 16, I have in mind that amendment No. 17 might give some protection.

    <P>I think it is eminently reasonable, especially in the context of this legislation, that the House would have the opportunity to see the content and shape of the order proposed by the Minister, and if it is approved by resolution of the House, so be it.  All joking aside, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that because of changes in the marketplace or a recession in a particular area, a campaign would be whipped up by a reasonably powerful lobbying body like the <Col N="840" /> Federation of Irish Employers and pressure put on the Minister to make an order to the detriment of what we all agree is the most vulnerable sector of the workforce.

      <P>This is an amendment that I tended to table on a regular basis when I was Fine Gael spokesperson on the Environment.  Basically I feel that if there is power to virtually amend the substantive Act, that should require a formal vote in this House so that Members have an opportunity to speak to that rather than having the negative vote that is normally passed.  I would support this amendment which is important in the context of this Bill, in particular because of the issues that were previously raised with regard to whether the Bill does provide protection to the part-time workers it is designed to protect. I do not want to labour the point, but it is open to employers to manipulate the Bill by employing a person one week for six hours, the next for 12 hours and the following week for six hours and so on, so that the employee has an average of eight hours per week.  That employee is not expected to work eight hours per week as the Bill envisages.  The Bill does allow the Minister to make amendments virtually by way of regulation.  Very soon after this Bill will have been passed we will have to address this issue, one that would be more properly dealt with by way of a substantive Act rather than by way of regulation.  But there is the possibility that the Minister could deal with this issue by way of regulation.  If there are problems in the way in which the Bill <Col N="841" /> is drafted that require regulations to be made that go to the substance of the Bill, as opposed simply to its administration, then it is correct that we amend the Bill in the way Deputy Rabbitte proposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is proposing is the affirmative procedure which gives more power to the Houses of the Oireachtas than the annulling procedure proposed in the Bill.  There are plenty of examples of the affirmative procedure in labour law.  I have no principled objection because I have actually inserted it in a number of other Acts in the past few years.  Having been in Opposition for a few years myself &mdash; having seen things go through and missed them in the Law Library &mdash; I can understand the difficulties involved.  The reason the annulling procedure was used in this instance was to accommodate not merely the orders under section 1 (3) (b) &mdash; relating to hours and continuous service &mdash; but also orders to be made under section 1 (3) (a).  If regulations were made by the Minister for Social Welfare which had the effect of changing the exclusion provisions for the Redundancy Payments Acts, for example, the Minister for Labour would need to change labour law in tandem with those regulations. Reliance on the affirmative procedure could cause delays if for example, the relevant social welfare changes were effected during a recess period, or there was difficulty in finding parliamentary time, but I am not greatly opposed to it. Therefore, if Deputy Rabbitte wishes me to push it, I will have another wording. The wording I would prefer to use would read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) Where an order is proposed to be made under this subsection, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>

I recently petitioned the House when I had a number of them on the Order Paper for some time and could not get the Whips to agree to allow me any time to move them.  They were related to women working in mines and women working at night.  I got them through only when the Leader of the Opposition, in an argument with the Taoiseach, quoted a number off the top of his head and asked what was the present position; the Taoiseach had to go rooting through the order book, and I was very pleased because that was the only way in which I could get through my orders.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having brought forward this Bill.  My experience of him is that he is a very practical man and is as much concerned about the difficulties facing part-time employees as are Members on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to express concern &mdash; I will put it no stronger &mdash; regarding the <Col N="843" /> period of 13 weeks.  It has been my experience that many people, on summer break from school or college, are employed by supermarkets, bowling alleys, different leisure facilities during the summer period.  Often such breaks &mdash; which can extend from eight to ten weeks but do not reach 13 weeks &mdash; count for nought.  Those people, because they are young, often are required to work long hours.  I note the reference to hours but the reference to 13 weeks does concern me because, from my reading of the section, it would exclude people on break from schools or colleges who may be working in order to put themselves through college or participate in advanced courses at school, indeed merely to make ends meet given the very difficult economic circumstances in which many families find themselves.  In that context I ask the Minister to consider whether 13 weeks is the appropriate period; whether some consideration might not be given to the plight of those people who work during the summer period in order to meet their economic needs and also meet those of employers. Perhaps he could examine whether it would be possible to facilitate them by reducing the 13 week period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to use the opportunity of speaking on the section to refer very briefly to a matter I raised on Second Stage and to perhaps cajole or push the Minister in the direction of doing something about it.  One of the Acts with which we are dealing in section 1 is the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  I made the point on Second Stage that the protections provided by way of maternity leave apply to the woman who has a baby by virtue of a pregnancy but that no such protections are provided to families when they adopt a child.  As an employee one pays the same social insurance contributions whether one has a family by virtue of the woman being able to conceive a baby herself or by virtue of adoption. In the context of this Bill the Minister rightly said that, we cannot effect general amendments to the labour <Col N="844" /> law applicable to part-time employees that would not extend to full-time employees.</P>
      <P>I have read through in great detail the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  The way that Act is drafted I contend that one simple amendment would not address this issue; it would require a number of substantive changes to be made to it.  It would seem to me that it is particularly anomalous that in the case of a couple who adopt a child, the mother in that adoptive family, is allowed no leave at all even for a week or two weeks following the adoption. There is no such provision in labour legislation, whereas such provision is made when a child is born to a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give the House a commitment that he will examine the 1981 Act with a view to bringing forward amending legislation providing for a leave period for adoptive parents. It is a provision that would be widely welcomed on all sides of the House and by the community generally, and I would not envisage employers having any major objection to it or that it would create any major or unique difficulties for them. Equally I hope it is a provision that will be supported by the trade union movement. It is a provision that will not be made unless we push for it in this House. It falls uniquely within the area of responsibility of the Minister but, of course, overlaps into the social welfare area as well; I realise that.  I ask the Minister to specifically bring forward legislation, at the first available opportunity, to allow some leave period for families when adoption takes place.  Such families should not be discriminated against in our laws.  I am suggesting this as someone who has considerable experience in this area.  If a family who adopted decided to bring a case with regard to the constitutionality of the 1981 Act, in circumstances in which the adoptive mother was in insurable employment and it was suggested that she was unfairly discriminated against by virtue of acquiring a child by adoption as opposed to conceiving one herself, I believe there is a very strong possibility that the High <Col N="845" /> Court or Supreme Court would find that the Act was unconstitutional in that area. Perhaps this is a reform we could address before the courts force us to do so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter is suggesting that, if the Bill is passed in its present form, it will discriminate against adoptive parents.  It is necessary to clarify whether, under the provisions of the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, maternity leave is granted for physical or health reasons or for social or family reasons.  Essentially I do not disagree with him in what he is endeavouring to achieve.  We have to establish under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act whether the leave is given.  That point should be clarified.</P>

      <P>I support the contention by my colleague, Deputy Shatter, that maternity leave should be extended to women who adopt a child because they have all the problems and difficulties of adjusting to a new baby in the house and to new timetables.  It is true to say that in many instances adoption agencies do not look very kindly on applicants who are in full-time employment.  If that measure is adopted it would make it easier and be more attractive for a mother to adopt a child.  So far as I am aware there is a recognition that adoption agencies do not like adoptive mothers to be the same as most mothers in society, some work and some do not.</P>
      <P>This is a matter about which several requests have been made and I received many submissions on it.  I ask the Minister to look fairly at this, examine the issue and see whether that facility can be extended to all mothers whether they are mothers who have their children or adopted them.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy <Col N="846" /> Mitchell, naturally enough under labour legislation generally I would be concerned with abuses, lack of rights or controls for workers, regardless of the type of work they do.  The Bill will not cover summer holidays.  If that was the case many difficulties could be encountered because there is a fair cost element in the Bill which, perhaps, I did not highlight during the course of the debate.  I did not think it was necessary.  These are rights people should have but there is a cost factor involved in regard to holidays and so on.  It would be a bit unfair to expect employers to cover all work with legislation costs; there would be a reaction from the point of view of summer jobs and difficulties would probably arise for people in casual summer jobs, night jobs or weekend jobs.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier a number of people work part-time under what would be considered funny arrangements.  Employers have their own reasons for not wanting to be linked in too tight into legislation. When I started work on this Bill I received a number of submissions as did Deputy Rabbitte.  One night Deputy Rabbitte read a list of abuses and it is amazing how different people interpret the abuses.  I mentioned a particular company in the House &mdash; which I should not have done; it was a mistake &mdash; and I learned afterwards that while on paper it appeared that the people were receiving low wages I was not aware that they received food vouchers which covered the weekend groceries.  The women involved were down on my head for opening up a hornet's nest.  In these areas one has always to be careful as there may be other arrangements.  Generally we are trying to cut out and eliminate abuses. At this stage it would be an unfair cost mechanism on employers to link it down to a zero rate on weeks.  That is not to say that I do not have some sympathy for having protections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will examine the point raised by Deputy Shatter in relation to maternity protection.  Quite frankly, I am not sure what is involved or the extent of the problem.  I am aware that Deputy Shatter has done much good work which has <Col N="847" /> received the support of all sides of the House, and the Government, which does not often happen to a private Bill.  I know he has put a great amount of effort and research into this.  I will not say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to him but I will consult my advisers to see what is involved on the labour and social welfare side and report back to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;This Act shall not apply to employment by an employer of an employee who is the father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, <Col N="848" /> brother, sister, halfbrother or halfsister of the employer.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that in circumstances where the immediate members of the family work from time to time part-time in a family business the provisions of this legislation should not impose on that family business the additional costing about which the Minister is anxious not to make too much reference. It is also suggested that for the immediate family legislation such as this is not always appropriate in the context of the protections because in a family business, where one is employing a son, daughter, wife or where a husband is involved, there is not always a reality in dealing with matters in the way legislation prescribes. The way in which a family business operates will very often depend on family relationships and whatever protections are necessary are in other areas of our law.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make matters difficult for the Minister but, perhaps, he will spell out the additional costs to an employer of applying this legislation.  There are many family businesses around the country that operate in a way that makes them only viable because all the family join in and are of help.  There are not always immediate financial rewards for that help in the context of direct wage payments.  Often it is a means of keeping the family business viable for the family.  It is important that the impositions that arise under the Bill and which by implication arise under the social welfare legislation, because of social insurance and other contributions, should not impose greater expense than is necessary on family businesses possibly creating some difficulties for businesses that just about keep their heads above water by the joint efforts of family members in circumstances where there may be only one major wage earner and one major salary drawn from the business.</P>
    <P>In proposing the amendment I can equally think of a number of good reasons why there should not be this exclusion.  I could argue both sides of this.  It was important to propose the amendment in <Col N="849" /> order to give the Minister an opportunity to respond to it and, secondly, because there are some parts of our labour legislation which do have similar exclusions. Indeed, some of the labour legislation that the Bill deals with has this exclusion in it.  I ask the Minister to put on the record of the House the circumstances in which this exclusion applies in the context of the various Acts listed in section 1, (a) to (g), where various legislative provisions to which an Act applies are generally listed.  I do not have very much more to say on this point and I should like to hear the Minister's response.  I ask him to bear in mind the cost provisions to which he referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland's amendment, which we have not yet reached, relates to the expenses incurred by small businesses which employ a small number of people. RGDATA referred to this point.  Many relatively good businesses employ non-family members on a regular part-time basis but I am not convinced of the argument made by RGDATA on this point. If it facilitates the House, I have no objection to taking Deputy Garland's amendment at this time.  It does not seem, from the point of view of time, that we will reach his amendment and to some extent extent the issues overlap.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Chair, Deputy Shatter and the other Members for facilitating me in this way. <Col N="850" /> I am not totally familiar with the procedures of the House and I probably did not approach this issue in the right way.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support Deputy Shatter's amendment as I believe we have to consider the other side of the coin.  As has been rightly said, small employers are the backbone of this country.  In many cases these businesses suffered from a form of self-exploitation.  Many people who own small businesses would love to earn a decent wage, but they have been forced to open small businesses because they cannot get jobs.  These people are trying to earn a wage and to do this they may employ other members of their families. Nothing whatever should be put in the way of people who employ immediate members of their families and no undue bureaucratic hindrance should be placed upon them.</P>
      <P>I go further in my amendment and propose &mdash; this follows the precedent in legislation introduced in Britain by a Labour Party Government &mdash; that a family business should be able to employ up to three additional employees without coming within the scope of labour legislation. The British legislation proposed that up to five members could be employed but I think three or fewer would be the appropriate figure here.  I commend this amendment to the Minister. Many small firms are being put to the pin of their collar trying to deal with the many bureaucratic impositions placed on them by way of VAT returns, PAYE and PRSI contributions.  At the end of the day many family firms simply close down because they cannot keep going.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister and other Members that employers are under no obligation to provide jobs for anyone: they are in business and cannot be forced to provide jobs.  Much of the bureaucracy imposed on very small businesses is so great they cannot employ even one person on a full-time or part-time basis. This cannot be good when we consider that approximately 250,000 people are unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty <Col N="851" /> with both amendments in that they shift the emphasis from the employee, whom we are trying to protect, to the employer. Both speakers have expressed concern about the position of employers.  Some of the greatest exploitation I have seen has been in family businesses.  I know of people who have been treated as little more than chattels by their fathers or grandfathers.</P>
      <P>When family firms go out of business the family member employed by his relative is left in a very vulnerable position. I know a man who worked all his life for his brother but when he became seriously ill he found he did not have sufficient contributions to claim benefit from the Department of Social Welfare.  As a result this man has been left in an extremely vulnerable position.  If the Minister accepts Deputy Shatter's amendment he will be opening the flood gates to abuse.  In the past the greatest exploitation occurred on farms where members of the family worked but did not receive any pay and had no entitlements. When the mother or father died other members of the family were pushed out by their relatives and they had little or no protection afforded to them by the State by way of benefit.</P>
      <P>While I accept the concerns expressed by Deputy Shatter, I do not dispute them, his proposal seems a little ridiculous.  It would be fine if we lived in an ideal world but disputes can arise in family firms and when two or more people are involved someone has to lose out.  These people are just cast aside and have nothing to turn to.  For that reason I cannot support Deputy Shatter's amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland referred to the British Labour Party.  Thankfully I am not subject to the British Labour Party Whip. We need to be very careful about this point because there is great potential for abuse.  For that reason I am opposed to this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have problems with these amendments.  I do not believe all family businesses are sailing close to the wind; many of them are thriving and <Col N="852" /> profitable.  Can the Minister say what protection, if any, there will be for relatives who have worked in family businesses for a number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Shatter asked me to explain the position rather than to say whether I am for or against the amendments.  With regard to amendment No. 18, the clear definition of the scope of the legislation is contained in the parent Act and not in this Bill.  Therefore, I am not proposing in this Bill to change the scope of those Acts.  The Deputy will be interested to know that close relatives are excluded from the scope of the Redundancy Payments Acts, section 4 (3) (b) of the 1967 Act; the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, section 3 (1) (b); the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, section 2 (1) (c); and in some cases the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, section 2 (1) (g).  Adoption of Deputy Shatter's amendment as it stands would exclude part-timers from the other enactments being amended and would leave them in a worse position than full-timers in relation to those Acts.  I know that is not what Deputy Shatter intends, and I cannot agree with that amendment.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Garland's point, as I have said, the exclusion from the scope of the legislation of enterprises employing three or fewer people would create several anomalies.  For example, full-time workers in such an establishment would have an entitlement to holidays but part-timers would not.  This is precisely the kind of distinction we want to terminate.  An employer of four part-timers would have statutory obligations as regards holidays but another employer of three part-timers would not. This would create great difficulties, particularly, as Deputy O'Sullivan outlined, when talking about small shops in the one block.  If one employer takes on full-timers and another takes on part-timers, there would be anomalies in that the full-time employer must pay entitlements while the person who employs part-timers must not.  That would be a disincentive against full-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has always been pressure to <Col N="853" /> introduce employment thresholds and to avoid imposing excessive burdens on small enterprises.  Throughout all the Acts over the last number of years, this argument has arisen and it has always been resisted by Ministers for Labour from whatever party, partly on the grounds that there may be a constitutional bar to this form of distinction and partly because there is no good economic or social argument all employees should not get the basic minimum rights contained in the Statutes.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have asked about the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  In answer to Deputies Fennell and Shatter, section 3 (1) (b) of that Act sets out that the Act shall not apply to &ldquo;employment by the employer of an employee who is the father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister, halfbrother or halfsister of the employer and who is a member of the employer's household and whose place of employment is a private dwellinghouse or a farm in or on which both the employee and the employer reside.&rdquo;  There are similar definitions in all the Acts.  These people are not covered; that answers Deputy Shatter's point.  Deputy Garland's point is more extensive and would create anomalies which I would have to reject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response.  I think I am right in saying that the effect of the adoption of my amendment would not be to exclude small firms from the totality of these regulations and Acts but merely to remove them from the scope of this Bill.  As I understand it, this Bill merely reduces the threshold from 18 to eight hours per week.  It could be argued, of course, that there is an anomaly there. Nevertheless I would put it to the Minister that the effect of leaving the threshold at 18 for these very small family <Col N="854" /> businesses would be of some assistance to them.  At present they may be outside the legislation because they are employing somebody for 12 hours.  Surely the Minister would agree it is quite logical to insist that the number of hours remain at 18.  I do not think this would create any problems.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;An employer shall not treat less favourably a regular part-time employee in respect of his working conditions and terms of employment, including remuneration, access to occupational schemes, overtime, lay-offs, redundancy, short time, transfers, dismissals, disciplinary measures, participation in bodies representing workers, access to training, promotion and other workplace facilities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new section.  With the utmost respect I submit that this is an important amendment.  The issue is equality.  The amendment seeks to enshrine in the Bill an affirmation of equal treatment for part-time workers. Because part-time workers are predominantly women &mdash; perhaps marginally over 70 per cent are women &mdash; there is the possibility that the legislation could be open to challenge in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it may constitute indirect discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are extremely concerned about this point since the threshold primarily affects women.  Having regard to the proportion of the part-time workforce they make up, there is the possibility at least of this challenge on the grounds of indirect discrimination. As regards the eight hour threshold I would like to hear the Minister give his opinion whether it is contrary to the EC directive on equal treatment, which applies to legislative requirements as well as to employment <Col N="855" /> contracts and collective agreements.  It is for that reason I have sought to frame an amendment that would incorporate in the Bill a positive statement, an affirmation of equal treatment because of the dimension of the equality issue involved.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I referred to a statement issued by the chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency at the time of the publication of the report on part-time work entitled &ldquo;Who Needs Flexibility&rdquo;.  Ms Catherine McGuinness, the chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency, said:</P>
    <P>This report highlights the fact that it is women who are principally affected by trends in part-time working; making up as they do 69 per cent of part-time workers, and this makes the issues of protection of part-time workers an equality issue.</P>
    <P>The report also showed that working mothers with three or more children made up 30.9 per cent of all women working part-time in 1988.  In the same year, 50 per cent of all married women part-time workers as against 9 per cent of married men part-time workers cited family responsibilities as their main reason for working part-time.</P>
    <P>Ms McGuinness concluded:</P>
    <P>These statistics highlight once again that it is women's working lives which are affected by a lack of a national policy on childcare and they emphasise the fact that equality between men and women in paid work will never be achieved until the childcare issue is addressed.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister to address that issue here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question. Because I think I know the answer: the Minister will tell me that the scope of the legislation does not extend to that.  If I may turn that argument on its head, it is precisely because in drafting this amendment, I am staying within the scope of <Col N="856" /> this legislation that the Minister should take it on board.  The facts of the matter are that, even where part-time workers are relatively favourably treated, they are still the poor relation in the employment environment and denied access to other conditions and participative structures and a range of areas, some of which I listed in my amendment.  They are still the poor relation notwithstanding their position in law: I refer, for example, to workers at present doing more than 18 hours who have the protection of the legislation which we seek to extend today but, even allowing for that, there was a celebrated case in my own constituency where, in spite of the workers' entitlements in law, they were discriminated against in the workforce.</P>
      <P>The Minister stressed at the beginning that he is seeking to do no more than to extend the protection of the legislation to regular part-time workers.  It is necessary that that should be accompanied by an affirmation which my amendment seeks to incorporate, to ensure that there is positive, equal treatment of all workers in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte's amendment and it would reflect the principle about which the Minister spoke earlier that the legislation he is introducing is only aimed at reflecting what is happening generally in the workforce. The kernel of the matter, particularly in relation to this Bill, is the problem of married women with children unable to get full-time jobs because of their responsibilities at home.  Of course that is not the whole problem but we know, from many studies, that women work part-time because they cannot combine full-time work with their role as mothers and home-makers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics show that, after the third child is born, the number of married women in the workforce falls dramatically, more dramatically here than in other EC countries; in other EC countries many women would not have three children.  We must try to encourage women to keep a foothold in the workforce and ensure that they are not there <Col N="857" /> just on sufferance.  They should not be second class workers but should be given every opportunity to maintain their position when they are part-time with a view to coming back as full-time workers when their home duties enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>This amendment is very important as it would give greater strength and rights to part-time women workers and ensure that they would not be unfairly treated in relation to overtime, remuneration or training.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment highlighted many aspects to which we should give further consideration. He listed many things which would be desirable, including remuneration. I said on Second Stage that if the Minister did not intend to introduce legislation in regard to a statutory minimum wage he should at least have given a commitment in that regard.  Recently there was an abuse of workers in River Valley Industries in Crumlin, where people were working for £1.40 per hour and, until something is done about this, there will be continued abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should also be access to training when people work for an extended period in a part-time capacity for a firm.  If there is an opportunity for promotion which requires training, such training is not extended to the part-time worker.  Many people have been with the same firm for many years in a part-time capacity and are passed over in favour of new applicants. It is essential that, where there are promotional outlets within the firm, the position of the part-time worker must be protected.  In some firms there are independent agreements between unions where people working on a seasonal basis establish rights on the basis that they were employed for two or three consecutive seasons at peak times.  If you can establish that you have worked for a firm for two or three summers &mdash; in the drinks industry in particular &mdash; you have entitlements. On the other hand, these firms sometimes employ people who are not protected by a union and who are often <Col N="858" /> ignored.  For that reason, the amendment is desirable and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted what Deputy Rabbitte said.  He made these points during the course of the broader Bill which The Workers' Party introduced some time ago.  However, it is a fundamental departure from the structure contained in the Bill and it is not within its scope.  The Bill was drafted after discussions regarding various aspects.  The amendment covers a range of areas which, perhaps, are all very desirable &mdash; I would not argue against them individually &mdash; but if accepted, I should have to spell out in the Bill how I would implement all these areas, including disciplinary measures, tranfers, lay-offs, occupational schemes and so on.</P>
      <P>I have a choice, as Deputies appreciate, between what I would term an anti-discrimination measure along the lines of the Deputy's proposal and a process which would extend our labour laws to categories hitherto excluded.  I opted for the latter approach and I am prepared to consider amendments in that context as I did this morning.  However, I cannot fundamentally go in the direction indicated in the amendment into areas which are not covered by any of the Acts.</P>
      <P>The important point is that the objectives towards which the Deputy is aiming will be achieved in my Bill in so far as it removes any different treatment between regular part-time and full-time workers in the matter of those rights which we have chosen to provide in our labour law.  It does that very successfully; it gives <i>pro rata</i> entitlements to all part-time workers of whom, as Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Fennell said, 70 per cent are women.  All this legislation has been built up since the foundation of the State and it has culminated in this Bill which, I hope, will be in force from 5 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stressed on Second Stage that the vast majority of part-time workers are women and, consequently, have access to the employment equality legislation and the institutions under it to pursue claims of direct or indirect discrimination they do <Col N="859" /> that all the time.  One of the courts is totally taken up with equality issues, which I welcome because a few years ago when I came into the Department of Labour, there had been an understanding by the previous Administration that one of the courts would close.  I rejected that on the basis that we should keep it for long, protracted equality cases which require time.  Until quite recently, the court was not free to handle such cases, but now a court deals with equality, which is a vast improvement.</P>
    <P>Even with the setting up of the Labour Relations Commission there was probably an internal consideration that if the cases were reduced by the commission the number of courts we have would not be needed.  I rejected that and said we should keep a court for equality issues, and it is being used by full-time and part-time workers and all kinds of categories, and I think they are doing a good job. they are changing the law on equality almost weekly, new decisions are being made and it is difficult to come to grips with where exactly that will end.  Therefore there is access to discrimination cases and employment equality in a very broad sense at present.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the merits of the other areas, to try to put them into a Bill in this form would not be possible as Deputy Rabbitte knows, but they can be looked at.  Workplace facilities, access to training, the use of the apprenticeship schemes, the right of women to the various training schemes, etc., all are areas in which I have made substantial movements subject to the financial limitations under which I have to operate in the various agencies under my control, but we have made substantial progress there in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I did not anticipate it.  This is a very important issue that goes to the heart of the Bill.  I have had representations from various women's groups and talked to my colleagues in the trade union movement, and in some cases they lay more store on <Col N="860" /> this affirmation than they do on some other areas of the Bill.  I do not understand the Minister's reasons for professing to be unable to take this on board. I think it is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the Bill, because this commitment to equal treatment is the heart of the Bill.  The Minister asks how he can guarantee, say, equality of access to training schemes or other employment based considerations.  I see no difficulty about that.  Once the Bill is enacted in law, employers will take on board the import of that as somebody said good employers are doing already.  Good employers are already negotiating this with the trade unions at plant level It would make a positive contribution to good industrial relations if this were taken on board.</P>
      <P>I referred to an inter-union problem that emerged between full-time and part-time workers that could have had very serious consequences for a very valuable plant in my constituency.  If this kind of affirmation of a commitment to equal treatment had force of law, it would only induce employers to ensure, as Deputy Fennell put it, that part-time workers are not there merely on sufferance or, as I put it, as the poor relation in the workplace.  I do not see any great obstacle to enshrining a commitment to women in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, since we have managed to conduct most of this debate on a consensus basis, I have to press this amendment. It is important to note the support of the other Opposition parties for the import of it and I have to ask that the amendment be put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can accept what the Minister said that already some of the areas mentioned are covered in existing legislation there is a certain void in the area of training, promotion and remuneration that will have to be addressed.  Rather than forcing the issue to a vote at this late stage, I ask the Minister to indicate that he is prepared at least to come back on Report Stage with some amendment.  What the Deputy is trying to achieve is quite reasonable. <Col N="861" /> we all recognise there are abuses, and that there are gaps in the legislation.  The Minister admitted earlier that, as suggested by Deputy Shatter, there was a need to tidy up legislation and his acknowledgment of the Deputy's remarks is a fair indication that all is not right.  For that reason he should consider accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I am misunderstood, let me say the principles Deputy Rabbitte is setting down are matters on which I have done a good deal to improve them in legislation, and to improve them in reality through various organisations.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, equality and anti-discrimination law has a completely different structure from labour law.  They are different laws and you cannot match them with this legislation. The Deputy is trying to extend protection and that is not the way to do it.  Anti-discrimination laws need to contain exemptions on objective grounds and I do not think that would be correct in this Bill.  Quite a number of the points the Deputy made are covered in the relevant legislation.  I am not saying the Deputy is totally wrong in putting forward his view, but to take issues that are in none of the Acts and place them in the middle of the Bill without specifying in other sections or other mechanisms how this would be implemented, is not what we are about in this Bill.  We are taking all our legislation, including the equality legislation, worker protection legislation, anti-discrimination legislation and all the relevant legislation and linking them to part-timers. Many of the issues Deputy Rabbitte is raising are in these Acts.  To take them in one composite motion and try to put that into the Bill does not make sense. The arguments for having these matters in our legislation make plenty of sense, but the Deputy is merely taking a section from a Private Members' Bill that was before the House and placing it in this Bill.  That does not make sense to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it has no relation to any other Acts.  That is the <Col N="862" /> whole point.  My amendment recognises the unique, distinctive, different position of part-time workers and the fact that they are predominantly women and seeks no more than to incorporate this affirmation. It requires employers not to treat these workers less favourably and gives that requirement the force of law.  That seems eminently reasonable.  As I have indicated, I think this is an equality issue and is worth pressing to a vote as I indicated earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte must address all the aspects.  Equality legislation is there, anti-discrimination is there, equal pay legislation is there. Where is the difficulty?  These issues are either in legislation or they are not.  If they are in, most of them are already the right of part-time workers.</P>

      <P>Sir, let me thank Deputy Shatter, Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Barnes and Deputy Fennell who joined in the debate this morning.  I have been trying since mid-December to get the Bill before the House.  We have discussed this Bill on three occasions but &mdash; and I have made this point several times &mdash; in labour legislation it is hard to get an order of priority.  If we can get the Bill through the Seanad next week it will be law by 5 April which is very important for the Department of Social Welfare.  That would not have been achieved without the Deputies' help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is familiar with the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in particular with Article 4 (b) which states that the policy of devolving certain powers to Northern Ireland is the policy of the UK Government and that the Irish Government support such a policy.  Does the Taoiseach still support the Anglo-Irish Agreement and does he accept it in its totality after his earlier misgivings?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that his attitude towards devolution of power in Northern Ireland is consistent with Article 4 (b) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has elaborated today on the statement of last week that from the discussions devolution does not recommend itself to the parties in Northern Ireland.  My understanding is that of the parties in Northern Ireland, the SDLP, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Official Unionist Party and the Alliance Party, the Official Unionist Party are the only party which have clearly signalled that they are not in <Col N="865" /> favour of devolution and are in fact quite hostile to the propect of devolution and favour integration with the UK.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate further on his understanding from the discussions he had with the parties in Northern Ireland as to which parties would or would not enter into discussions about devolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that that was my assessment from the statements that were made from time to time and the discussions I have had.  I would suggest to the Deputy that there is not a great benefit in pursuing this any further at this stage, because if the talks take place, as we hope they will, such a proposal will probably be one of the first items to be talked about.  When the talks take place than we will know where everybody stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from what the Taoiseach is saying that the Taoiseach and his Government, if talks commence, will enter into those talks with a totally open mind in relation to devolution, because the Taoiseach has been quite dismissive of the concept of devolved powers in Northern Ireland in the past when he referred to them?  Will the Taoiseach enter into those talks with an open mind in his approach to devolution and not just with a commitment to one option about which he has spoken, that of a unitary state.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not really have time go go into all the different aspects of it here, but I would go back to the report of the New Ireland Forum which clearly outlines my view and the view of the majority of Nationalists on the different areas.  With regard to the talks, I have already said that this Government will go into the talks with an open mind on any possible new arrangements that might be put in place to transcend the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

What statements have been made and where, by the SDLP, the Democratic Unionist Party and the Alliance Party, to suggest that they are opposed to devolution?  Will the Taoiseach please be specific.  Secondly, does the Taoiseach believe that there are three strands of talks and relationships here, including the internal strand between the two communities in Northern Ireland, what arrangements can be made for co-operation between the Nationalist and Unionist community in Northern Ireland with regard to Government and politics, that does not involve devolution?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that the only internal arrangement that can be reached for co-operative activity must involve devolution? Thirdly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to repeat what I have already said to Deputy Spring, that I do not really believe that there is any particular advantage in pursuing this question as to who is and who is not for or against devolution in view of the fact that something of that kind will almost certainly be an item which will be discussed in the talks if they take place. The whole value of the talks will be that everybody concerned will be able to clarify their positions.  I do not intend to go any further today than to again express the hope that these talks will take place and that this Government will come to those talks with an open mind on any possible new arrangements that may be put in place that will transcend the Anglo-Irish Agreement as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach says, as he has just said, that there is no point in pursuing here the issue of who is for or against devolution, why then did the Taoiseach last week make a statement to the effect that devolution does not recommend itself at this stage to most of <Col N="867" /> the parties in Northern Ireland?  Why was the Taoiseach so undiplomatic and indiscreet as to attempt to speak for parties in Northern Ireland rather than for himself and attempt to ascribe views to them which are not their views, and will the Taoiseach agree that last week his statement attributing views to the parties in Northern Ireland which are not their views, was highly unwise and not conducive to the success of the present initiative.</P>

Would the Taoiseach not now accept that that is the case and that opinion polls in Northern Ireland from all sides of the community have indicated that the people of Northern Ireland strongly favour devolution of some form?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach informed us that devolution did not recommend itself to the parties in Northern Ireland and, if I may say so, he has confused the issue somewhat today.  May I put it to him, given the very serious and strenuous efforts which have been made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during the past two years to bring the parties in Northern Ireland together to commence talks, that it would be of help to those parties who are reluctant to come to the table if he gave a firm commitment to support devolution of powers in Northern Ireland as a possibility?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the problem is that the Taoiseach is hanging on to the concept of the unitary state when this is neither practical nor possible, and he is not supporting the concept of devolution in Northern Ireland as a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Deputy's view, but I would go back again to the all-party agreement in the New Ireland Forum on that issue.  As far as I am concerned, all of those matters can be discussed at the inter-party talks when they take place.  The opportunity will then be viable to everybody to clarify his or her positions in regard to not just devolution, which itself has many different aspects and means different things to different people, but also in regard to all other aspects of some form of new arrangements for the better government of Northern Ireland, or a better arrangement to take the place of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is interested in this matter but the position is that it was initiated in 1985 and has been carried on by the French since then with a fair amount of success.  However, it has not really taken off here.  The view is that it is not a very feasible proposition because, in the French context, it is very much an outdoor event.  In our case, I am afraid that adverse weather conditions have affected the attractiveness of the proposal.  However, the director of the Dublin promotions company, who are in charge of the European City of Culture arrangements, assures me that a very full programme of music events for the summer of this year is planned.</P>

The concentration is on that aspect.  There is no suitable guide of the sort the Deputy is referring to, but three types of guides are planned.  One will be a short guide to the National Archives, the second will be a guide to the sources for local history available in the National Archives, and third will be sources for genealogy available in the National Archives.

      <P>With regard to bodies operating under the aegis of my Department these bodies would be required to seek appropriate professional advice in any case where the purchase of property would arise.

      <P>In relation to a recent purchase, the purchase of Carysfort College for £8 million by UCD, there was no independent valuation carried out to the knowledge of the Department by the college prior to this sale being agreed.  I believe this is a very dangerous departure and calls into question the whole accountability in regard to Exchequer moneys.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is specific and is not related to the question, but I would prefer to answer it.  The Deputy is incorrect.  I have said on television and in the newspapers, and I am glad to say it again in the House today, that the purchase price for that property was <Col N="888" /> negotiated by UCD using professional expertise on their own campus and among their own body.  What the Deputy said is quite incorrect.  This purchase followed normal practice in any such acquisitions by university authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer was specific and I want to address myself to that.  The Minister has admitted that there was no independent valuation carried out either by her Department or by UCD in terms of this particular purchase.  If that situation is allowed to continue it could lead to abuse of public funds.  I put it to the Minister quite frankly that that is what happened on this occasion.</P>

The practice followed in the purchase of this property was exactly the same as that followed by many other bodies operating under my Department or any other Department where there would be within the people employed in that body a spectrum of professional advice which would enable them to make their own professional decisions.  One cannot have the Department of Education interfering in every single matter when various agencies have autonomy to do their own business.</P>

      <P>My Department in conjunction with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, the management bodies and the National Parents' Council, are involved in discussions which, it is hoped, will shortly lead to agreed procedural guidelines which will be of assistance to teachers in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse.  Drawing on this experience, similar consultations are planned at post-primary level.</P>
      <P>When the guidelines are agreed, it is intended to make them available to all schools.  Following the issue of the guidelines, it is proposed to provide inservice training for teachers and also to enter into discussions with the authorities of the colleges of education regarding pre-service training.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  In view of the fact that the excellent Childline service dealt with 31,800 calls in 1990, that daily there are frightening revelations of the increase in child abuse at various levels, will the Minister agree that schools and teachers are an excellent front line immediate source of detection, that teachers, broadly speaking, find themselves ill-equipped and nervous in dealing with this problem and that there is a urgent need to expedite those deliberations which have been going on since 1989?</P>

      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments of Deputy Higgins.  We are, and have been for some time, in talks between the INTO, the parents and the management about this very important matter.  As the House will realise, confidentiality, discretion and sensitivity are the three fundamentals which will underpin the guidelines.  To elaborate, we have <Col N="890" /> been in touch with the Chief State Solicitor's Office and have sought legal advice on various matters which have arisen from the teachers side, the parent's side and the management side.  The question is delicate and the need is great but we must arrive at guidelines which are sustainable and under which everybody's rights will be preserved.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that in the interim child abuse is continuing on a daily basis, is the Minister aware of the existence of a discussion document for teachers on child abuse, issued by the ISPCC, which sets down valuable guidelines and procedures which might put in place some kind of interim arrangement on school policy until such time as the formal report comes from the various bodies?</P>

      <P>In relation to primary schools, there are 60 part-time teachers in special national schools for handicapped <Col N="891" /> children for practical subjects such as woodwork, PE and so on.  There are 1,575 temporary teachers employed in national schools, the great majority of whom are replacing teachers on career breaks which extend from one to five years.  The scheme was put forward by the teacher unions and we are glad to be able to continue with it.  In regard to post-primary education the actual number of part-time teachers is not available but is expressed in terms of whole-time teacher equivalents.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools my Department's records do not distinguish between temporary and permanent whole-time incremental posts.  There are 172 whole-time equivalent posts filled by part-time teachers.</P>

Surely the Minister will agree that this is totally unfair to the children whose education will suffer because they have a change of teacher every couple of weeks? Will she agree that it is also unfair to the teachers who are continuously looking over their shoulders wondering if they will be employed the following week?  Is the Minister aware that in some schools they are unable to fill the posts of responsibility because they do not have enough permanent teachers?  What is the Minister prepared to do about it?  Will she agree to impose a 10 per cent maximum on the number of part-time staff in any school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  What the Deputy is overlooking is that many of the teachers of whom he speaks are on the very excellent VPT courses in vocational schools.  But, as a general rule, the Department do not sanction permanent posts in respect of ESF-funded courses because such courses are subjected, from year to year, to scrutiny and allocation of moneys from Europe.  That is the reason we run the courses in that manner.  The Deputy has mentioned one scheme.  If he has details <Col N="892" /> of any particular schemes and will let me have them, I will be glad to have them examined and come back to him on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in her reply that the question of whether VPT courses could be implemented was dependent on finance forthcoming from Brussels.  Therefore is not the Minister saying that the 17,000 young people participating in ESF-funded courses are subject to the possibility of such courses being terminated at any time in Brussels if the requisite money is not available?</P>

      <P>That is what the Deputy said.  I did not go into those precise details.  What I said was, first, there are 24,000 young people participating in VPT courses, not 17,000.  Second, I said that was the way in which always these courses operated.  Indeed here I might pay tribute to my predecessor, former Deputy Hussey, because it was she who first went to Europe and obtained funding for those courses.  From their inception, it has been done in that fashion from year to year.  As I said, as a general rule, my Department do not sanction permanent posts in respect of ESF-funded courses because such courses are subject to change and are sanctioned on a year-to-year basis only.  That rule was not made by me; it was made in Europe.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>In February, following inquiries from schools to my Department, it became apparent that a large number of payable orders had not been received by the payees.  On ascertaining that the payable orders in question were issued on 30 January my Department alerted An Post to the position and investigations were initiated to trace the missing payable orders.  As a security precaution my Department cancelled all 225 payable orders issued on 30 January, including 195 relating to capitation grants.  The individual value of the capitation payable orders ranged from £4,500 to £46,000 and amounted in total to £3.85 million.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to identify the individual schools involved &mdash; because they would not wish it &mdash; and the amount of grant in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Banks Standing Committee were also informed of the cancelled orders and given the serial numbers involved.  None of the missing payable orders has been cashed.  Fresh payable <Col N="894" /> orders issued some time ago to the payees in question.</P>
    <P>My Department have remained in close consultation with An Post on this matter.  Inquiries to date have not traced the missing orders but they assure me they are continuing their investigation.</P>
    <P>My Department are considering the electronic transfer of cash to schools' bank accounts.  However, this would give rise to certain difficulties.  We are at present examining this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for agreeing the need to update and streamline general procedures by direct lodgments.  Is the Minister aware that capitation grants are supposed to be paid in January, April and October each year; that the October grants were not paid until November; that the January grants were not paid until end February &mdash; even though the Department knew about the missing cheques on 4 February &mdash; and that, by and large, this has become established procedure causing terrible hardship for schools leading to crippling overdrafts and interest payments?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite right.  We have been tardy in some instances in paying them, leaving aside the An Post matter, but in response to the Deputy's general question about capitation grants, there is now in place a very strict arrangement as to when these capital grants will be paid.  This procedure will be followed for the remainder of this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 137 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, and my Department are in constant communication with representatives of school management bodies and teachers' unions on inservice training and on matters affecting second level education generally. They have made me aware of dissatisfaction with some aspects of the recent one day junior certificate inservice <Col N="896" /> course, mainly of an organisational and presentational nature.</P>
    <P>To date four one day courses have been held.  While acknowledging that some difficulties affected the recent one day course, it is fair to say that these courses generally have been very successful.  I am confident that further discussion with these bodies will lead to a better approach.</P>
    <P>In regard to inservice training generally &mdash; the Deputy will be aware of this because I referred to it at a recent function he attended &mdash; the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, in conjunction with my Department has commissioned a consultancy report on inservice training whose interim report I expect to have in a matter of weeks and their final report perhaps in two months time.</P>
    <P>This report will deal with primary and post-primary education and will cover such areas as evaluation of current inservice education, identification of the nature and extent of future inservice education and the institutional arrangements and modes of delivery of inservice education.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> acknowledges the importance of inservice training and provides for additional funds of £500,000 in 1992 and £1 million in 1993 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Funding for inservice for 1991 is £750,000 million, three times the amount allocated in 1987.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme and the vocational education scholarship scheme provide that grants shall be tenable in respect of degree and other approved courses of higher education in Ireland.  The purpose of this requirement in the schemes is to give financial assistance to eligible students to help them to proceed to a university or other approved third-level course in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of students receiving grant aid in universities and other third level colleges in 1985-86 was 24,316 and in 1989-90, 34,518.  The payment of a higher education grant may be continued for one year in respect of attendance abroad where (i) the period of study abroad is shown to be an integral part of the student's course, (ii) the period of study abroad is a requirement of the course as laid down by college regulation <Col N="898" /> and (iii) the student continued to be registered at the home university or college. The procedures described above are broadly in line with the terms of the ERASMUS scheme, the purpose of which is to promote third-level student mobility between EC member states.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for replying to my question and, indeed, for replying to a whole lot of other questions I did not ask.  Is the Minister aware of a very strong campaign in recent years on the part of authorities of United Kingdom colleges to recruit students from this country who are eligible to participate in their courses?  Is she also aware of the many applications from Irish students to these colleges and that at present only those students whose parents can afford to pay for them can avail of places in UK colleges when they fail to get places in Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer the Deputy and I hope I do not give him too much information.  It is a long day since I heard a Deputy on any bench complain about getting too many answers, usually Deputies do not get enough.  The Deputy asked if I was aware that there is a strong lobby by colleges in the UK.  Yes, that has been going on for some time.  Over the last two years the numbers of young people availing of such offers in the UK has dropped considerably.  I am very glad of that because it means that the increasing number of places which both the universities and the VEC third level colleges have made available here have been taken up by our students.  I should also like to inform the House that under the PESP we have outlined 8,800 third level places in the various colleges in this country.  The new merger between Thomond and the Universidy of Limerick, talks between the training colleges, the opening of Tallaght Regional College and the expansion of the RTCs under the programme announced today, will result in more third level courses being made available for young people here and quite simply we have the best courses.  If we can get together all the places we need <Col N="899" /> there will be no need for anybody to go to the UK to get a better education, they will get it here.</P>

The position at present is that by and large there are far more applicants than there are places available in Irish third level colleges.

Secondly, would it not cost the Exchequer much less to actually extend the higher education grant to students who could avail of places in English colleges than to provide extra places in our already overcrowded universities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some courses are not available to our students in Ireland but are available either in the North or across the sea and at the very least in those instances the grants should be extended to allow students to pursue the course they want to pursue and cannot pursue it here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there are odd instances but they have become less frequent because the range and diversity of courses provided here, in all our universities and third level colleges, are assuming greater relevance.  If a young person requires a particular course he or she should search among the colleges here where, I am quite sure, if they do not find the stated course they will find a route to that course across a range of disciplines in any of our third level colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that parents throughout the country now wish to have slow learners educated in normal primary schools' special classes with adequate supports.  I am the first to admit that we are striving to provide those adequate supports.  At present the supports are not as good as we would wish them to be.  However, in regard to the particular school concerned a second major problem is that in this primary school in Galway we have one 19-year old, a number of 18-year olds and several 17-years olds.  In fact, there are only 16 pupils in the school who should be in a special primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a serious matter of concern to Department inspectors and psychologists and the Brothers of Charity, who are the trustees of the school, that this situation should continue.  I should also like to point out to Deputy McCormack that there are ten teachers in the school at present.  If we were to apply the normal pupil-teacher ratio, four of those teachers would have to leave the school immediately. In fact, four of those teachers will be on the panel next June.  Therefore, in line with all the recommendations from all the experts in the field of special education the intention is to integrate, the students as far as possible, into special classes and into normal schools, with additional resource teachers in the <Col N="904" /> Galway area.  This is in line with the policy now being pursued by the Minister and has been welcomed by parents throughout the country.  I want to add that any pupils in this school who are in need of continued special schooling will receive that special schooling in an alternative arrangement as a result of the new arrangements now being put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to base his contentions about this school on a report by the Brothers of Charity. Is the Minister aware that the parents of the children attending this school were not consulted in the preparation of that report?  He also bases his contentions on the declining numbers in the school.  Is the Minister aware that numbers are declining in that school because children are not being referred to it?  This is part of the Department's policy to deliberately run down the school.  Despite what the Minister has said, the parents of the children attending that school wish to keep the school open.  The Minister of State and I attended a public meeting in Renmore last Monday night week.  If he did not get the message from that meeting he is both deaf and blind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's comments on my question.  I suppose one should give credit where it is due.  While the primary school curriculum makes many positive statements there is one glaring misdirection.  While it recognises that physical education should make a valuable contribution to the aesthetic, emotional and moral development of people, unfortunately it contains such statements as that girls tend to choose light delicate movements and retain a longer love of fantasy whereas boys generally move with strength and tend to be more realistic.  I am glad the Minister does not need any more convincing in terms of strength and realism and is taking steps to have such statements removed from text books.  The sooner that statement is removed from the primary school curriculum the better.  In an age when we aspire to equality and the removal of sex bias this will be a step in the right direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to use all my skills in doing so.  In putting forward this amendment on Report Stage it was suggested to me that perhaps it would not be allowed by the Ceann Comhairle's office, but I am glad that was not the case. I put down an amendment on Committee <Col N="983" /> Stage proposing that the Minister hold 51 per cent of the shares in perpetuity for the State, thereby ensuring that control of the company on voting rights etc. would be held by the State and that the amount of the shares that would be available for sale on the Stock Exchange, the Minister would have in the region of 30 per cent.  The Minister has said he expects that his holding will commence at 45 per cent and that he will retain 10 per cent of the equity shares for the workers and the beet growers.  I am concerned about the Minister's statement that the 45 per cent of shares held by him could in the future be sold on the Stock Exchange or to private individuals.  That simply means that this company can be sold to the extent of 90 per cent of its share valuation.</P>
      <P>All through the debate the Minister has maintained very strongly that this company are not being privatised, that they are being part privatised.  Therefore, it is with some interest that a company union agreement which has been ratified by the Labour Court has as its draft heading &ldquo;Company-Union agreement concerning terms and conditions on privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company.&rdquo; This agreement does not refer to part privatisation; it refers to privatisation. We should establish quite clearly at this stage that this company are being privatised.</P>
      <P>My purpose in putting down this amendment is to ask the Minister, since I failed to persuade him to hold 51 per cent of the shares in perpetuity, to reconsider and give thought to the 45 per cent holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have argued our case for retaining the company in public ownership to the greatest extent possible.  I had argued on Second Stage and on Committee Stage that there should be no privatisation whatsoever but, accepting the reality of the situation in this House and the obvious co-operation between the two main parties, the Bill will be carried by a very large majority.  I am taking this last opportunity to ask the Minister to hold at least 45 per cent of the shares. <Col N="984" /> Obviously, if the workers and the beet growers held another 10 per cent of the company it would go, to some extent, towards controlling the company with the people who are directly interested in maintaining what has been a very successful company over the years.</P>
    <P>My proposition at (b) in the initial amendment asks the Minister to retain 10 per cent of the equity shares for beet growers and employees of the company. Perhaps we did not pursue the Minister in regard to retention of the shares for beet growers and workers; we should have questioned him about the rules he will lay down for the holding of these shares.  Will the beet grower, an employee or ex-employee of the company who holds the shares only be allowed to sell them to someone who grows beet for the company or will he be able, like anyone else who holds shares through the Stock Exchange, to sell them to anybody who is interested?  That point should be cleared up before we proceed.</P>
    <P>I maintain my position of opposing any kind of privatisation for this company; I would have preferred it to remain as it was.  However, having failed in that, I asked for a substantial holding of shares by the Minister so that the control would remain within the State, through the Minister. Having lost on both those counts, I ask the Minister to hold the 45 per cent shares and to maintain them in his hands &mdash; or in the hands of the Minister for Finance &mdash; for the country.  The 10 per cent share should be maintained by growers and employees and controlled by them.  That is the purpose of my amendment and I hope it commends itself to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any hang-ups about the retention by the Minister for Finance of 45 per cent of shares in the company.  On Committee Stage, the Minister told us that the Minister for Finance would retain 45 per cent for at least two years and that he would have the option thereafter to scale down his holding.  In addition, the beet growers and the employees of the company &mdash; at the <Col N="985" /> request of Deputy Lowry &mdash; were hoping that workers who had been made redundant by the company in recent years would be allowed a certain number of shares.  The Minister has not clarified what percentage of the shares will go to the workforce, to those who have been made redundant and the growers.  Will he give us a breakdown of the various percentages involved?</P>
      <P>I should also like to raise a point which was brought to my notice by a beet grower during the past week; he maintained that, if he bought shares in the company when they were offered to him, he would not be able to sell them for at least two years in line with what is being proposed by the Minister for Finance. Will the Minister say whether that is correct? It is a serious inhibition if people must hold on to those shares for at least two years, particularly when many of them will have to borrow the money to purchase them.  It may not be worth their while to buy shares which they will have to retain for at least two years.  That seems unfair, it does not make sense. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the situation for workers and beet growers.</P>
      <P>The other point I have been asked to raise in relation to the holding company is about the board which the Minister will initially set up.  I believe there will be nine directors.  How will they be selected? For what length is their term of office? Will it just be for one year until the first AGM of the new holding company? What arrangements are being made for the initial board?  Do the present board carry on for one year until the first AGM of the company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment although, as the House is aware, my party are opposed &mdash; as well as the vast majority of workers in the Irish Sugar Company &mdash; to privatisation.  There is no point in talking about privatisation in whole or in part; it is privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company, it is selling the State owned Irish Sugar Company and it is the first of the Government's major privatisation operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sugar manufacture is the principal <Col N="986" /> asset of the company and the regulations at present allow the company to produce and sell sugar at a higher rate than it costs on the world market.  We are now privatising the company and giving the majority shareholding to the financial institutions to whom we are selling it. What will be the motivation of the company then?  Profit, of course.  If they can import sugar more cheaply I am quite sure that they will, without any regard to the livelihood of the workforce.</P>
    <P>When we debated this issue earlier the Fine Gael Party referred to the question of capital investment.  However, the capital invested in the company was at the expense of the workers, there is no doubt about that, the capital was invested but the workforce were reduced from over 3,000 to 1,500.  I do not know if Deputy Deasy knows that the State investment from 1933 to 30 September 1982 amounted to £5.6 million.  Of course, the company had many subsidiaries and we are now talking about the 45 per cent shareholding.  The Leader of Fine Gael asked if that would restrict people who might be interested in investing their money, he was concerned that the Minister, acting on behalf of the State, could retain 45 per cent of the shares for two years.  I disagree with that point in the amendment because the 15 per cent given to the workers will be divided between the workers and the growers.  I am surprised that there has been no word, good, bad or indifferent, from the beet growers in this matter although I understand they are involved in talks with the company at present on the issue of the efficiency measures which were introduced in the sugar factory in Mallow where the ionised system was introduced.  That brought about a greater sugar extraction and, consequently the BGA wanted their share of that, maybe rightly.  When it comes to dealing with a finance company who will be the big shareholders in the sugar industry the door will not be so readily open to them and they ought to be very well aware of that.  Now we are talking about amendments to the Bill on Report Stage but the most frightening <Col N="987" /> thing that has come to light is the memorandum and articles of association of the holding company.  Why are Members who are interested in this not given a copy of the memorandum and articles of association?  Why is this not the subject of debate at this time?  There are regulations in that voluminous document.</P>

The amendment suggests that the Minister retain at all times the equity holding of the company, at least 45 per cent, and the Minister retain 10 per cent for growers and employees.  I understand the employees were told it would be 15 per cent.  Will the Minister in his reply tell us what is contained in the memorandum and articles of association relative to this section?  That might be the best way for us to get the required information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to indicate why I cannot accept the amendment and I hope when I explain why, Deputies will not only understand but support my reasons.  First, if I were to accept Deputy Kavanagh's amendment it would mean that as Minister for Agriculture and Food I would have no special share because the amendment provides that the Minister &mdash; meaning the Minister for Finance &mdash; shall at all times maintain his equity holding in the holding company of at least 45 per cent of the total equitable shares of that company.  That would mean that any share in excess of that would be excluded. The special share to which all of the crucial rights attach, and the protections for workers and sugar quota, and the protection of this vital national asset, could not be put in operation if Deputy Kavanagh's amendment were put in place. For that reason if for no other I will not accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other cogent reasons.  The second point is that he proposes that a 45 per cent holding be maintained by the State in the company.  Deputy Deasy is quite right.  I indicated on Committee Stage, and I want to confirm formally, that the Minister for Finance will maintain for at least two years the 45 per cent shareholding in the company.  The Minister for Finance will confirm that on the flotation which is the appropriate time to do so.  In that instance this is a clear signal to the markets.  It is very important that we do not tie ourselves down to a specific figure in legislation one way or the other.  That matter will be confirmed <Col N="989" /> on the flotation by the Minister for Finance, but if the flotation is to proceed successfully investors must be confident that the company can operate on a fully commercial basis and in accordance with the dictates of the financial market.  This is a vital element in the dynamic we want to see this company develop.</P>
    <P>The major concern which everyone will want to share is that the company would maximise their value to the benefit of the Exchequer which means, ultimately, the taxpayer and, of course, in the interests of the workers and the beet growers.  Securing a good price for the State's shares and enhancing the future of the company are the best means of ensuring value for the taxpayer.  Everyone is concerned for the taxpayer.  I do not think any Member, from whatever side of the ideological divide he comes, would say that what we should do here is heap extra cost on the taxpayer.  Rather, all of us are agreed that we should minimise the burden on the taxpayer.  Quite often the criticism in this House over the years has been that our taxpayers are too heavily penalised.  The taxpayer has contributed £66.5 million to Siúicre Éireann but £59 million of that was contributed in the eighties.  That was £59 million of workers' tax, employers' tax, general taxpayers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

      <P>I am telling the Deputy what was contributed during the eighties.  That is fact.  The Deputy can check the record and he will find that to be the case.  It is essential to get a return on this investment.  The taxpayer is entitled to that and the best means of doing so is through a sale of portion of the shareholding, which is what we are doing now.  If Deputy Sherlock wants to persist in the notion that the total shareholding is being disposed of he is free to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that the residual 45 per cent shareholding, provided the company are successful and eveyone's intention is that they will, with a new dynamic opportunity, yield not only profit to the company but profit to the taxpayer, the workers and the beet growers who will, of course, have their own equity in the company under this new arrangement. Of course, like other shares in any successful company, those shares will appreciate in value over time and a better dividend could be expected, which is really what we want to achieve for the workers, the beet growers and the company. Of course, we want a proper return for the first time for the taxpayer because no dividend has ever been paid to the taxpayer from this company.</P>

      <P>The regulations of the company prevent dividends being paid while the company are incurring a loss. It has been agreed in principle with the company to make a specific block of shares available to employees and beet growers.  On my recommendation the Government adopted the proposition <Col N="991" /> that in addition to the 45 per cent which the Minister for Finance will hold there would be an equity participation at preferential rates of 10 per cent for workers and beet growers.  An additional 5 per cent will be reserved, but not at a preferential rate, for beet growers if they wish to acquire them.  These shares are available either on a preferential basis or on the market in relation to the second 5 per cent.  I have neither the wish nor the right to force workers to take up equity at preferential prices if they do not wish to do so, but I am confident that they will.  I went through all of this the last day in relation to the loans being made available to the workers to acquire shares at discount rates.  Adding the shares which the Minister for Finance holds to the 10 per cent and the 5 per cent gives a total of 60 per cent.  In the light of that how can Deputy Sherlock say that the total shareholding here will be acquired by the private sector?</P>

      <P>I would not want to put a restraint on free sale but by holding the shares for two years the growers will not be charged on the discount rate of 20 per cent for tax.  That relates to tax law. It is not a condition laid down by me. If they do not wish to benefit from the discount rate they are free to sell the shares.  When people make their calculations they will find that they will benefit financially from holding the shares for two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Lowry referred to redundant workers and other former employees.  In consultation with <Col N="992" /> the unions the company concluded that it would not be acceptable or in the workers' interest to diminish their shareholding by making shares available to former employees whether on pension or on redundancy.  This issue is not relevant to this section but I am sure that the total number involved is of the order of 2,000. The number who would qualify under retirement or redundancy would be in excess of 4,000.  It would be more than those who would be entitled to the special placing and the preferential rates.  There are 1,000 former employees on pension, or with a vested pension and it is estimated that an additional 1,000 people have left and have effectively cashed in their pension entitlements.  I do not have the redundancy figures but they are considerable. Between redundancy and retirement the figure would be considerably in excess of the numbers currently employed with the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>With regard to putting a restriction on the sale of shares by either the workers or the growers, the Stock Exchange rules do not permit a restriction on the sale of shares.  The Minister must accept that, discipline himself and that is why he must make that statement in the prospectus at the time, so that the world at large and the markets are aware that the Ministerial shares will remain for at least two years at 45 per cent.  They have to be satisfied about that but we cannot restrict the fundamental right of workers to sell their shares.  Such a restriction would be contrary to the Constitution and it would be held to discriminate against workers where others are free to sell shares.  The same would be held in respect of the shares held by beet growers who are getting their shares now because of their right under current contributions and partnerships.  I would be amazed that anyone here would suggest that growers alone of all who might acquire shares with the new company should be prevented from disposing of them to their advantage.</P>
    <P>On the last day I undertook to consider the point in relation to former employees. When I get the figures at the end of this <Col N="993" /> discussion, the Deputies will see why it would not have been possible to accommodate them without diminishing the equity participation for the beet growers and the workers, which is something that nobody would wish.  Clearly former employees can apply for shares on the Stock Exchange and I would be happy to think that they would.  The indications on the market show that this will be a very profitable venture and nothing would make me happier than to see former employees sharing in that profit like everybody else.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Kavanagh's amendment which proposes that the Minister should maintain his equity holding at at least 45 per cent which would mean that the major portion of the equity would be held by the State.  We are talking here about a company which is capital intensive and needs substantial amounts of capital if it is to survive in the marketplace.  They have been returned to profitability in recent years and have substantially reduced their borrowings.  According to <Col N="994" /> the records for the five year period 1986-90, finance costs have been reduced by one third.  The figure for 1986 stood at £11.2 million while in 1990 it was reduced to £4.7 million.  This represented a significant breakthrough for the company, in terms of profits retained and injections of State equity.  As the Minister said, in 1982 £30 million in equity was injected into the company, while £20 million was injected in 1983 and £9 million in 1987 giving a total of £65.5 million.  There have been no further State injections of equity since then.</P>
      <P>Despite this the company have been returned to profitability through good and prudent financial management.  The company have also acquired share-holdings in other concerns in an effort to give the State a major stake in the food industry.  If the company are to grow they will have to move away from the domestic market and seek markets in the United Kingdom and Europe.  If they fail to do this I do not see a great future for them.</P>
      <P>I understand 10 per cent of the equity shares of the company will be made available to the workers and growers.  I do not know how this figure will be broken down.  Neither do I know at what price these shares will be issued, but I believe the institutions, which will acquire a significant bloc of shares will have a say on what the price should be on the day of issue.  I also do not know the value of the total share capital will be as this will be a matter for the markets.  Given the embargo on the sale of discounted shares, I am glad those who purchase these shares, namely the workers and growers, will be protected.  I am glad that the embargo will not apply in cases of hardship and that people will be able to dispose of their shares.  As I understand it, this equity will be held in trust by the trustees of Greencore to ensure protection for those who invest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with this, further shares will be issued and will be available to both workers and growers at a preferential price.  I would like to see both the workers and growers taking up as many of these shares as possible.  In recent years when co-operatives were <Col N="995" /> floated on the market farmer-suppliers did not take up their full allocation and it was left to the financial institutions and the people in other walks of life to take up the balance.  I foresee growth in investment and a substantial dividend being paid.  This augurs well for the future of the company.  We will, of course, also have the reserve share&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister three questions.  First, what is the defintion of &ldquo;professional share&rdquo; and how will the cost compare to the market price of the normal share?  Second, I was disappointed to hear the Minister say that former or redundant workers cannot be looked after.  It was never my intention that they would be looked after at the expense of existing workers, but I had hoped that an increased number of preferential shares would be made available to them by the company who I expected would have an interest in ensuring that their former workers, in particular those who were retired prematurely or who were made redundant, are looked after. Third, as I understand it, each worker will get shares to the value of £250.  Can the Minister tell the House if these shares will be taxable?  If they are, their value will be automatically reduced by approximately 50 per cent, or will it be the case that if they hold them for two years they will no longer be taxable?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, under Standing Orders the Minister is no different from anybody else and he has made his contribution.  Perhaps he should make his contribution when the other Deputies have concluded.  If the <Col N="996" /> House is agreeable once Deputy Kavanagh has concluded as an exception, and since Deputies did not understand fully the rules governing amendment on Report Stage, perhaps we could accept one specific question from Deputy Lowry to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought for one moment the Minister was going to kick Deputy O'Keeffe in the leg and tell him to stop making the case for me.  In his contribution Deputy O'Keeffe indicated what has happened in the company during the past few years and outlined the profits made and retained by them.  I agree with him.  I have never said from these benches that they are not a successful company.  Indeed, they are a wonderful company and will prosper in the future.  I have always maintained, however, that the company do not need to be privatised to be successful or to do all the things the Minister and the Deputy have told us can only be done if the company are privatised.  I want it clearly understood that the company have a very bright future.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not willing to accept my amendment because, first, a golden share would not be available and the maximum benefit will not be gained if the Minister for Finance is allowed to hold a certain proportion of the shares indefinitely. I do not accept that.  There are several reasons the company will be successfully floated.  The primary reason is that the company has a most valuable asset in the sugar quota, which will be of particular interest to investors.  The other reasons are the level of profit growth and sales growth.  As a result there will be capital growth in the shares and dividends will be available in the future.  The company will be attractive to the people who are putting great pressure on the Government to have this Bill put through the House with such great haste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had the Minister adopted my proposal, he or the Minister for Finance would have a special holding of 45 per cent of the shares.  That shareholding could not be attacked by private shareholders because institutional investors <Col N="997" /> cannot hold more than 15 per cent of the shares.  That would have been a far greater guarantee than the special shares in which the Minister puts so much trust. The Bill as it stood on Second Stage provided that this special share could be sold. The only major change we have achieved has been in securing the Minister's agreement not to allow his special share to be sold.  That was the great worry in special share operations in Great Britain.  Of course the Minister or one of his successors could in the future bring in a Bill to change the provision.  Nevertheless we have had some success.</P>
    <P>I put down an amendment providing that the growers and workers should have a 10 per cent shareholding.  I did not indicate whether I was referring to present workers, former workers or redundant workers.  I would hope that all those categories would be entitled to shares and would not be excluded simply because they were made redundant due to rationalisation at Thurles or Tuam. They are just as entitled as the current employees to purchase these preferential shares.  Many employers believe that 15 per cent of the equity is being retained for them rather than 10 per cent.  The Minister mentioned 10 per cent and I should not like to think he told the workers 15 per cent would be available and then changed the amount to 10 per cent.  My original amendment specified 15 per cent because I believed that was the amount being retained.</P>
    <P>I hope the arguments we have put forward will get through to the Minister. There are legitimate concerns about the memorandum and articles of association which are in draft form.  The Minister must look carefully at this matter.  The special share and the articles of association represent a means by which the Minister can retain some control of the company.  The Minister has not argued that 45 per cent of the shares will not allow him to have the same control as a 1 per cent special share.  I maintain that 45 per cent would be a far greater control. The 10 per cent of the equity held by the growers and employees would be an added control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> I hope we can specify the name of the company in the Bill.  A name was included on Second Stage which has had to be changed.  We should, however, know the name of the company we are talking about.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair.  The amendment refers to &ldquo;employees of the company&rdquo;.  The document on privatisation which issued to employees stated that details would be posted to &ldquo;each qualifying employee&rdquo;.  Will the Minister clarify the position of those who have retired or been made redundant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be able to reply to the points made.  As of now, £250 worth of shares will be made available to each employee.  That will be taxable. Some discussions are still going on and all I can say is that this is the least the workers will get.  It is possible there may be an improvement but I cannot give any firm undertaking.  The House will understand the reason.  The employees will have further shares up to 4 per cent of the company at a 20 per cent discount. Growers will have 6 per cent at a discount of 20 per cent, with the possibility of a right to acquire a further 5 per cent at no discount.  I hope I have made that clear and that there is no doubt at all at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to former employees, pensioners and others, let me confirm, in the first instance, because I was prepared to deal with this on Committee Stage, that the total number of current employees in <Col N="999" /> the Sugar Company is 1,756; the number of former employees, and this is not quite as precise a figure, is approximately 2,050.  The Stock Exchange are firmly opposed to giving preferential rights to anyone other than employees.  It was quite a major concession on the part of the Stock Exchange to extend the arrangements for preferential shares to growers.  The rules and practices of the Stock Exchange make it clear that they are not agreeable to extending preferential shares to former employers.  The Stock Exchange are basically opposed to issuing shares at different prices &mdash; this is the basis on which they operate &mdash; to people who are not directly employed in a company.  That has been the long established position of the Stock Exchange, and they do not wish to depart from it.</P>
    <P>I understand the reasons put forward by Deputy Lowry and I think he will understand from my response to his suggestions that I share his concern in <Col N="1000" /> respect of former employees and redundant workers, but we are all faced with that fact.  May I point out that any extension of preferential arrangements would, in the first instance, have to cater for current temporary employees, who are not included in the figure I gave for current employees of 1,756, who will have preferential treatment?</P>
    <P>Those included in the category of former employees are those who left on pension; those who voluntarily left the company and may be in receipt of a pension or may have a vested pension; those who were made redundant and who opted to retain a vested pension, and those who were made redundant and who opted not to have a vested pension.  The latter would be mainly manual employees.</P>
    <P>I think I have clarified the issue Deputy Lowry raised.  I hope this confirms the reasons why I cannot accept the amendment in Deputy Kavanagh's name.</P>

      <P>Let us now proceed to amendment No. 1 (a) in the name of Deputy Sherlock.  I observe that amendment No.2 in the name of Deputy Kavanagh is related.  I suggest we discuss amendments Nos. 1 (a) and 2 together. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Until such time as the scales of pay and the terms and conditions of employment and any other benefits, including rights and privileges, obligations and any other arrangement applying to employees so transferred are varied resultant from negotiations with the trade unions or staff associations concerned, the conditions which prior to the transfer had been negotiated on their behalf and applying at the time of the transfer, shall continue to apply to them save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with the trade unions or staff associations representing such employees.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking yesterday evening he quoted from a document which purported to be an agreement drawn up between the company and the unions.  I would like to point out the shortcomings in that agreement in as far as the likelihood is that this very evening this Bill will pass and the Irish Sugar Company will be no more.  The agreement referred to by the Minister stipulated: company union agreement concerning terms and conditions of privatisation of Irish Sugar cpt.  What can be the validity of that document in the future when the company that reached that agreement with the unions will not exist after this evening?  It was said that there would be no interruption in continuity of employment, that current rates of pay and conditions of employment would continue to apply and that the company would continue to recognise the existing trade unions.  May I ask which company will continue to recognise the existing trade unions?</P>
      <P>We are passing a Bill which will be enacted into law.  Based on the agreement reached in that document presented by the Minister we must now ask if it is worth the paper on which it is written?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> How can the Irish Sugar Company &mdash; that will no longer exist &mdash; stand over that agreement?  How can one legislate for conditions affecting the contracts of employment between the new holding company and their employees since each contract of employment is one entered into between each individual employee and the employer, in this case, Greencore and their employees?  What will happen will be that management and staff at all levels will be asked to accept a new contract of employment.  I hope it is understood that is precisely what will happen.</P>
    <P>Consequently it is most desirable that my amendment be inserted in the Bill as being the only way in which to give effect to the demands and desires of employees of the Irish Sugar Company.  Once inserted in the Bill it becomes law.  Then we can say to their employees, whether they be management, general workers or whoever that their rights are protected. If Members will read my amendment they will see that it stipulates nothing out of the ordinary, normal conditions that would apply in such cases.  Its insertion would also have the effect of allaying any fears at present existing in workers' minds.  As I said a few moments ago, they are &ldquo;quare&rdquo; times when Fianna Fáil decide to sell the Irish Sugar Company. Many people have said already that surely they are &ldquo;quare&rdquo; times when Fianna Fáil decide to sell the Irish Sugar Company.  In such circumstances, we must at least ensure that employee's rights, conditions of service, pay, and so on, are protected.</P>
    <P>One contentious matter referred to in the document was that of the redundancy terms.  I referred to this yesterday evening.  The document to which the Minister referred says that the current redundancy terms being paid by the company are those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conference.  It says the company acknowledges that this is the current position and has no plans to change those terms.  I would ask Members to listen to that terminology, because the Minister is pre-occupied and does not appear to be taking an interest <Col N="1004" /> in something on which he relied so heavily last evening for the purpose of ensuring the rights of employees in this matter.  The most contentious matter arising for employees is that of the redundancy terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>After very protracted negotiations in the 1981 period, an agreement was reached.  Then in 1988 and 1989 the company began to say that there was no such agreement.  Of course, the reason the company management were saying that there was no such agreement was that they saw somewhat further ahead than their employees at that time, since they were then drawing up plans for what is happening today, the privatisation of the company.  Therefore, it will readily be seen that it is very important that they be able to say to the new owners, &ldquo;Well, we do not have such a redundancy agreement that allows for 5 per cent-plus, or whatever, to employees of the company.&rdquo; This forms the major part of the employees' present argument.  Why did the company deny that such an agreement existed?  The Labour Court had a hand in it some time around 1986, agreeing that both parties should sit around the table, but did not say there was not an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may read this document again, what it says is that the current redundancy terms being paid by the company &mdash; those are the terms at present being paid by the Irish Sugar Company &mdash; are those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conference.  It goes on to say that the company acknowledges that this is the current position and has no plans to change those terms.  It is all very well for the Irish Sugar Company to say that, but that does not make any provision henceforth for the workers who will be employees of a new company.  Consequently, I am asking in this amendment that such provision be made, that it apply to the terms and conditions of employment and to any other benefits, including rights and privileges, obligations and any <Col N="1005" /> other arrangement applying to employees so transferred.  That makes good sense.  Furthermore, it is said that the company acknowledge that this is the current position and has no plans to change those terms.  Of course it has no plans to change those terms, but it will not be in existence to stand over what is stated in that document.  That is my main point because the company will have no right to make such provision in the future. But the Dáil has the right to do so.  It is the Dáil that is deciding to change the law and to privatise the company.  Consequently it can insert the desired protection in the Bill, which is very much part of the demand of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as will be seen from the document which they supplied to the Minister in January.</P>
    <P>I would be very critical of the fact that the Minister did not agree to insert his amendment to the Bill.  It was my understanding that if agreement were reached the only basis on which it could be reached was that the Minister had agreed to the demands of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>Another phrase used was that privatisation would not give rise to changes in continuous employment in subsidiary companies.  What a great farce to introduce a document of that nature, contending that there will be continuity of employment in subsidiary companies of the Sugar Company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>How can anybody predict what will be the position in a month or two months time?  It went on to say that the subsidiary companies ought adhere to existing procedures in determining the rates of pay and conditions of employment in those companies.  Who are those subsidiary companies?  There are very many subsidiary companies of the Sugar Company.  Without including this amendment in the Bill how can anybody say that the terms and conditions of employment are protected for those employees? Immediately following privatisation the <Col N="1006" /> financial institutions will be in the driving seat.  They will have the say and will determine what the conditions will be and will then start back into negotiations.</P>
      <P>I would make one very strong point, that section 45 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, made provision for the conditions of employees.  This document is all the Sugar Company workers have to rely on. Section 7 of the Labour Services Act, 1987, which provided for the setting up of FÁS, section 43 of the Forestry Act, 1988, and section 8 of the Agricultural Research and Training and Advice Act, 1988 &mdash; which provided for the setting up of Teagasc &mdash; included provisions to protect the conditions and rights of workers in those companies.  All we have for the Sugar Company is this document headed company/union agreement concerning terms and conditions of privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company.  I do not want to repeat myself but the company referred to herein will only be a subsidiary of the company.  I know what subsidiaries are.  As I mentioned previously, the quarries are subsidiaries of the Irish Sugar Company but they would not have any power to negotiate wages. They are the same employees of the Sugar Company but are merely subsidiary bodies and do not have any rights except to negotiate with the general body of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to call the Minister's bluff and I think I have already done so.  The document which the Minister relies on states that the company/ union agreement concerning terms and conditions of privatisation of Irish Sugar Company cpt will continue and so on. How can it continue if the Sugar Company are not there to stand over it?  The Sugar Company will only be a subsidiary. I have already made that point.  I am here to speak in the interests of the workers who are employed in the sugar industry. I want those conditions written into the Bill.  That is the only way those people who have made such a contribution to the building up of the Sugar Company over the years can be protected.  That is what we are debating here this evening. It is not what civil servants or others think; it is what the workers think, the people who worked on three shifts and at all hours to build up that company. These are the people I am concerned about.  It is no good for civil servants to laugh because, at least, the workers have a say here this evening and that is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital invested in the company in <Col N="1008" /> the mid-eighties went towards reducing the numbers employed from over 3,000 to 1,500.  I admit that that number increased somewhat when the company bought into Odlums and into the other companies.  That line of procedure was OK, the position being that the employees could come into the mainstream. We have a situation at present where in the late seventies some very cute people in the commercial world got the idea that they would set up a company called Sugar Distributors.  Sugar Distributors is a subsidiary of the Irish Sugar Company.  Because they were in existence at a certain time they had protection under EC regulations.  Consequently the Minister had to go into the High Court to regain 51 per cent of the shares in the company.  The company were able to give the advice to the growers.  The growers grew the beet, they took it into the factories where it was manufactured into sugar.  Immediately it went into the sugar silos the private enterprise said: `You dare not touch that sugar, that is ours, it is the property of Sugar Distributors Limited, an entirely new company&rdquo;.  The company had to go into the High Court and buy back their shares.  My experience of that subsidiary was that those people had no conditions of employment because they were not directly employed by the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sugar Company can be a very tough company to deal with when it comes to wages and conditions of employment.  It is true to say that they have reneged and that there have been protracted negotiations.  I would also make the point that the unions involved in the Irish sugar industry took a decision to take strike action in 1990 to get their rights under the proposed legislation which is now being enacted.  The vast majority of the employees in Carlow and in Mallow supported the call by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for strike action.  Why did workers decide to take action up to and including strike action which would possibly have meant one day stoppages and so forth?  They wanted to have conditions properly secured in the legislation that was being enacted.  This <Col N="1009" /> indicates just how strongly the workers feel about this issue.  I ask the Minister to deny, if he can, that such a decision was made.  Immediately the result of the strike ballot was known things began to change and negotiations took place between the Minister and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  These negotiations resulted in this document.  The workers in the Mallow sugar factory took the document home with them so that they could study it and they do not believe it is strong enough to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>What is required is a reasonable amendment to the legislation.  If an amendment can be made to section 27 of the Industrial Relations Act why can a similar amendment not be included in this Bill?  The capital required is only one aspect of the issue.  We should not forget that a good labour force are essential if a company are to be successful.  The labour force in the Irish Sugar Company are second to none.  I put down this amendment to ensure that their rights will be protected in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are some similarities between my amendment and Deputy Sherlock's amendment I have a difficulty with Deputy Sherlock's amendment in that he proposes to insert a new section 3.  Nevertheless, I support the proposal in his amendment, that is, to ensure that the rights and conditions of employees are protected when the company are taken over by the new holding company.  This is what we want to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister assured the House that an arrangement had been agreed between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the main union in the Sugar Company, SIPTU, and outlined the terms of that arrangement.  We were concerned about two aspects of this arrangement, the redundancy terms and the pension fund.  The Minister assured us that the redundancy terms would be the best available and that the pension fund had been secured so that there would be no interruption in employees' contributions as a result of privatising the <Col N="1010" /> company.  I accepted that the arrangement had been agreed and that the problems which had existed up to last week had been ironed out to the satisfaction of the various unions involved, their representatives on the shop floor and the Minister.  If the union of which I am a member have bona fide agreed to an arrangement which has been lodged with the Labour Court then I do not believe there will be any sleight of hand by anyone after the new arrangement is made.  The Sugar Company would not be able to prosper and survive after they are privatised if any effort was made to vary the terms and conditions of that arrangement.</P>
    <P>In order to be absolutely certain about this issue, I put down a reasonable amendment which I hope the Minister will accept.  If my amendment is accepted section 6 (1) will then provide that:</P>
    <P>Every person who immediately before the transfer date was an employee of the Company, shall, on the transfer date, enjoy the same rights (including rights under a pension or superannuation scheme of the Company and the terms and conditions of the Company/Union agreement registered with the Labour Court under section 27 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946)...</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment.  The Minister argued against the inclusion of an amendment I put down which contained all the various elements of these rights and conditions.  He said that this was not the way in which to approach this Bill.  However, I looked at the Telecommunications Act and other Acts and put down my amendment on the basis of what was included in them.  Companies like An Post and Telecom Éireann have been privatised and as the Sugar Company will be partly privatised I believe it is necessary to ensure that any agreement entered into with the old company will apply equally in the case of the new holding company, Greencore, and their subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>I will no longer flog this issue to death. We debated it at length yesterday and <Col N="1011" /> we got some concessions and guarantees from the Minister.  Nevertheless my amendment to section 6 would ensure that we would not have to go through every line of the agreement between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the company.  If there are any queries about the rights and conditions of workers in the future we could refer to this provision in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will accept my reasonable amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that on the operative date every employee shall have the same rights and obligations he had prior to the passing of this legislation. That is absolutely clear.  In order to put this issue beyond any doubt and to reassure the House, I indicated that I was prepared to formally convey to the House the terms of the agreement which had been entered into between the employers and the employees, the company and the unions.  I want to put it on the record that I have done this.  I will refer later to the proposal in each amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments are not acceptable because they are not necessary.  As I have made clear, if we were to incorporate into legislation every detail of every worker &mdash; union relationships and agreement between employers and employees, our legislation would be over-burdened with details of agreements, pensions, redundancy terms, recognition of trade unions and a whole range of issues which are not appropriate to legislation.  For instance, section 6 states that every person who, immediately before the transfer date, was an employee of the company shall, on the transfer date, enjoy the same rights &mdash; it specifically says &ldquo;rights&rdquo;, and that has a very clear legal meaning &mdash; including rights under a pension or superannuation scheme of the company and be subject to the same obligations as he enjoyed and was subject to immediately before the said date.  That section then elaborates on pensions and superannuation schemes.  That is as clear and unequivocal a statement of the law as you can get in any legislation, but because I wanted to reassure the House that the <Col N="1012" /> actual details of the agreement entered into between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Sugar Company would be a matter of record for the House, I informed the House that I was prepared to accept amendments.  Over and above that, I also wanted to have a formal involvement through notification to me of the details of that agreement.</P>
    <P>I told the House yesterday that the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission wrote to me at the end of last week formally indicating that following a series of conciliation conferences the parties have agreed to certain recommendations. Both parties also agreed to advise the Minister for Agriculture and Food of this agreement.  The agreement, signed on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Sugar Company and the Labour Relations Commission, sets out eight different points covering such points as no interruption in continuity of employment, current rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply, the company will continue to recognise the existing trade unions and existing procedures for determining rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply etc.  The current redundancy terms of the company are those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conferences.  The company acknowledge that this is the current position and they have no plans to change those terms.</P>
    <P>The agreement states specifically that privatisation will not give rise to changes in continuity of employment in subsidiary companies or to existing procedures for determining rates of pay or conditions of employment in those companies.  It then goes on to say that within 30 days of vesting day moneys will be transferred into the manual pension scheme to cover pre-1984 pensions as determined by the scheme's actuary.  Deputy Kavanagh has acknowledged the significance and extent of that.  It is a very major element and clearly one of considerable importance for the workforce.  The agreement says that pre-1984 service in the manual scheme will be funded on a phased basis over a five year period from 1991, in <Col N="1013" /> accordance with the advice of the scheme's actuary.  Deputy Sherlock, take note.  The Deputy seemed to imply yesterday that in this case there never had been a proper actuarial assessment.</P>

The commission of the Labour Court are requested by the parties, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the management of the Sugar Company, to be the guardians of this agreement. What Deputies are attempting to do here, particularly Deputy Sherlock &mdash; I want to specifically mention Deputy Sherlock &mdash; is to denigrate the agreement, to undermine it, to suggest that it does not represent what it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to quote Deputy Sherlock, who <Col N="1014" /> once again today is engaging in the big lie as he did yesterday, in his totally outrageous approach to this agreement.  He said that hereafter the Irish Sugar Company will not exist.  That is false.  It is as false as the allegation he made yesterday when he said this agreement is not worth the paper it is written on.  That is a false statement and should not be allowed to remain in the record of this House. Deputy Sherlock said he is here in the interests of the workers employed in this industry.</P>

They have achieved an agreement, on which I congratulate them.  I share their determination to protect the interests of their members.  I want to say again that I resent and reject the total distortion on the part of The Workers' Party who are practised in the big lie, but this big lie on the record of this House is not going to undermine the interests of the workers of this company.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock went on to say &mdash; and if you get into the big lie business it becomes a very profitable industry indeed, at least that is what The Workers' Party believe, and this again is an outrageous lie &mdash; that all employees will be asked to sign a new contract.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am not prepared to allow The Workers' Party representatives here to claim that were it not for them the interests of the workers employed in this industry would go unprotected.  That is not the case.  I am glad to say the Government, and indeed the other parties in this House, have been very concerned to ensure that the interests of those workers are protected. That is why I spent the last number of months with my colleague, the Minister for Labour, and my officials in consultation with the unions.  Very useful and fruitful consultations went on right up to this week because we are concerned for the interests of the workers.  We recognise the role of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions because they represent the interests of those workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been implied in this House that The Workers' Party are the only people who know the reality and that the rest of us are telling lies, that the union, the company and the Government cannot be <Col N="1016" /> relied upon, that the only people who can be relied upon are the ever-changing named The Workers' Party &mdash; I cannot remember what they used to be called.  If they can change their name so often they can also change tack.  The one thing they will not change of course is their capacity to distort.  For as long as they continue with that in this House I will show them the contempt they deserve.  They will not undermine a very solid agreement between unions and workers or create apprehension, distrust, animosity, division and tension &mdash; which is their stock in trade &mdash; between employees and employers.  They would wish that to happen but I have bad news for them, it will not happen.</P>
    <P>I am very much disposed to the views which Deputy Kavanagh expressed.  I appreciate and accept that his amendment is motivated by a desire to confirm the security of the workers in this employment. I hope Deputy Kavanagh will accept that it is not appropriate to write in details of this nature in legislation as the guarantee is already in the framework of the legislation as well as in the agreements. If the precise provisions in regard to all aspects of redundancy, pensions, recognition of unions, pay and conditions and notifications of termination were written into Bills our legislation would be cluttered.  It would mean that the normal process of agreement &mdash; and registering agreements &mdash; which exists between unions and employers, and is an established part of the rights of trade unions, would be taken over by this House.  It would mean we would say that those agreements did not really matter, that they were not significant and binding unless they were written into law.  I do not accept that.  Agreements entered into between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the company are very solid and I do not want to give the impression that they need to be written into legislation to ensure that they have solemnity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel compelled to intervene in this debate for a number of reasons.  Up to now the issues arising in the debate have been very competently <Col N="1017" /> dealt with by our spokesperson on Agriculture, Deputy Kavanagh.</P>
      <P>I am strongly in favour of Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.  As a Member of this House I represent the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and, in my 30 years here, I know of the very strong commitment of the workers, particularly in Carlow, to the development of the Carlow factory.  Unfortunately, it is not quite as successful now but that is history. If it was not for the workers who made sacrifices for the company we might not be here today talking about privatising the Sugar Company.  I am very familiar with the sacrifices &mdash; I deliberately use the word &mdash; of those people.  It is not an exaggeration to say that some workers gave their lives for the sugar factory because they worked hard in difficult days, under bad conditions and for long hours.  They are the prime part of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In objecting to Deputy Kavanagh's amendment, the Minister may be trying to make the Bill more acceptable to future investors.  However, we want to ensure that the Bill is as acceptable as we can make it to those people, and their families, who have given so much to building up the company and who have made it possible for us to be talking about privatisation and handing over some of the benefits to other people.  The least the House can do is to include in the section the amendment tabled by Deputy Kavanagh which does not spell out the details of the agreement, as the Minister said.  It is a very simply worded amendment, it seeks to insert the terms and conditions of the company-union agreement. We endorse the contribution the workers made to the success of this company and we are sending a clear message that, no matter what happens in the future, the House recognises that the rights of the workers should be fully protected. The Minister has gone three-quarters of the way towards accepting the amendment and I hope my words will influence him to go the remaining few steps required to accept the amendment. If he does we will be showing our concern <Col N="1018" /> for the workers.  The Bill would be considerably strengthened by the insertion of this amendment and the Minister should accept it to say a big thank you to the workers, their families and descendants of the workers for their efforts.  Many of the people who work in the Sugar Company today are sons and daughters of those who gave their life to the company. We owe it to them to insert Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister in relation to the agreement between the company and the Labour Relations Commission.  It is a new commission and I wish Kieran Mulvey every success in his position as chief executive.  The Government took an innovative approach in setting up the commission.</P>
      <P>Last year the Irish Sugar Company paid in the region of £33 million in wages, a major contribution to the economy and the workforce.  I have great admiration for the workers and the management of the company.  I worked very closely with them and I have no doubt that they do not have any fears.  I cannot understand why some Members say there will be no continuity; after all there will not be any great change apart from a change in the equity base to give it greater support and funding.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to subsidiary companies.  The balance sheet was prepared and signed by Coopers and Lybrand; Sugar Distributor Holdings and Sugar Exports Limited are 100 per cent owned by the company.  I do not see where the confusion arises.  The people who work in Sugar Distributors, a subsidiary of the Irish Sugar Company, will have the same management structure and will have greater security because there will be greater access to capital.  I fail to understand why there has been criticism from the Members who tabled amendments saying that they fear for the future of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Sugar Company are to continue there will have to be workers in the industry. In regard to the rationalisation programme that is taking place, I must say the <Col N="1019" /> workers and management have suffered over the last few years in that drive to streamline the company especially in the sugar division.  I hope that is all behind us now and that we can look forward to a very successful Sugar Company and that the employees in the factories in both Mallow and Carlow have safe employment for a number of years ahead.  I believe any disruption that takes place will not be the company's fault.</P>
    <P>The contribution that has been made for Mallow, which is my backyard and area, in terms of the economic wellbeing of the town and its hinterland, has been very significant.  I wish the workers well in the new company, Greencore.  I do not understand why people have to question the continuity of the company or even cast any doubts on it.  As we are well aware, the workforce are in place, and they are a good workforce.</P>

      <P>In amendment No. 1a, Deputy Sherlock is seeking, as he has done on behalf of The Workers' Party throughout this debate, to ensure that the optimum protection is given to the employees of the Sugar Company.  I sincerely trust the Minister is not going to leave because I came back into the House to reply to some of his earlier vituperation.</P>
      <P>From the very outset Deputy Sherlock as a former Sugar Company worker has sought to ensure the maximum protection for his colleagues still employed by the Sugar Company.  That, and that only, is the motivating factor behind this amendment.  I can bear out, as can Deputy Pattison, as former trade union officials, that it is all very well to say across the floor of this House, &ldquo;You need not worry about that, that is protected, there is a time honoured agreement and in this case it is even registered with the Labour Court; there is nothing to worry about&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all had experience over the last 20 years of take-overs, mergers and so on of various companies and the facts of commercial life are that the ball game changes entirely.  If the company do well <Col N="1020" />&mdash; in this I think they will &mdash; there will be fewer difficulties than there would otherwise be, but I can recall time out of number the occasions on which I have been called in by a company to say, &ldquo;that is all very well, but that is the agreement of yesteryear; however, the facts of the marketplace are different now and your members will have to face up to that&rdquo;, and nine times out of ten that happens. That is the reason Deputy Sherlock in amendment No. 1a is seeking to enshrine in this Bill protection, and not any of the outrageous reasons being imputed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am sorry his departure has coincided with my arrival because he made a right ass of himself in this debate last night when he started waffling about the positive right to strike as an explanation for an article from the memorandum and articles of association that I raised, and then he dug the hole deeper by claiming this positive right to strike was enshrined in the common law.  If it had been enshrined in common law, there would have been no need for the 1906 Act, and the terms and provisions of which have been repealed by the 1990 Act are a system of conferring immunities for actions that would otherwise be unlawful. I cannot understand why my party have to sit here and listen to this sanctimonious cant from this Minister.</P>
    <P>I spent the earlier part of today negotiating through the House from Committee through to Final Stages the Workers Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill and not one acerbic remark was made across the floor of the House between the Opposition spokespersons and the man who will probably turn out to be the Minister for Agriculture and Food's boss very soon.  It really is too much to have to sit by the monitor trying to deal with normal business and listen to this self-righteous Minister pouring out scorn about the motivation and purposes of The Workers' Party and Deputy Sherlock seeking to use the opportunity of this novel legislation to enshrine in the Bill the optimum protection that is feasible for the workers left in that company.  That seems to me a <Col N="1021" /> perfectly honourable and understandable motive.  It seems the most normal thing in the world that anybody, especially somebody who worked for the company as Deputy Sherlock did, should come in here and use the only opportunity we have to do that.  There will be no point coming back here next year because, in my view, the dynamics of the marketplace will take over and our shareholding in this company will diminish. There is no doubt about that.  That battle has been fought and lost here.  It seems entirely reasonable that Deputy Sherlock should come in here with an amendment and that Deputy Kavanagh should come in with a slightly different version of the same amendment.  I am bemused that Deputy Kavanagh's motive was not questioned by this very sensitive and self-righteous Minister while my party's were. I am sick of it and I am sorry the Minister had not the guts to stay in the House so I could deal with this matter face to face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised that the Minister made no reference to Statutory Instrument 306 of 1980, the EC safeguarding of employees' rights on transfer of undertakings regulations 1980 which gives certain rights to workers in the matter of take-overs and so forth.  In such circumstances, we are now told that this sheet of paper with eight items on it, registered under the Industrial Relations Act, is what the ICTU sought on behalf of the workers and that will be adequate and sufficient to protect the interests of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister continually called me a liar because I said the Sugar Company would be no more.  We are not fools. Once this legislation is enacted it will repeal the Act that set up the Irish Sugar Company; consequently once that Act is repealed the Irish Sugar Company will be no more but will later, of course, become a subsidiary of Greencore.  How many subsidiaries do the Sugar Company have? We have Interchem, Armour Salmon, Sugar Distributors, Premier Molasses and <Col N="1022" /> so forth, a number of companies, but they have no real impact when it comes to negotiating employees' conditions, wages and so forth.  They all belong to the same pool with the exception of Sugar Distributors.</P>
    <P>It was an awful state of affairs when the Sugar Company manufactured sugar and handed it over to private enterprise, as they did up to the late seventies.  Sugar distributors controlled the distribution of sugar in this country and made a profit and became very wealthy, especially from exports to Northern Ireland.  I know what I am talking about.  That was private enterprise and the Sugar Company had to go into the High Court and buy out that company at great cost.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking he constantly referred to this very desirable and highly recommended document from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the company.</P>
    <P>On 28 January 1991, when Congress wrote to the Minister they referred to their proposals for the amendment of the Sugar Company Bill, 1990 concerning the rights and benefits of employees of the Irish Sugar Company and said &mdash; it is a pity the Minister is not here to answer this &mdash; that on 18 December 1990 the private secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Food wrote to the general secretary of the congress, Mr. Peter Cassells, and said that the Minister intended to insert into the Sugar Company Bill, 1990, provisions to safeguard the interests of workers.  Did that happen without the Minister's knowledge?</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that, the provisions of the Labour Services Act, 1987, the Forestry Act, 1988, the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act (No. 18) 1988, and the Post and Telecommunications Act, 1983, protecting the rights and benefits of workers in respect of their employment, were brought to the attention of the officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the concerned people in the Department referred Congress to section 6 of the Irish Life Bill which relates to the same matters concerning the workers in that company.  How far have <Col N="1023" /> we gone from that position? I will tell the House how far we have gone.</P>
    <P>Congress said there was an important difference in style and in the content of the provisions outlined in the four Acts brought to the attention of the Department in the Irish Life Bill.  The Minister challenged me on this.  I said, and I stand over it, that each employee will now be making a new contract of employment with the new company.  The contract of employment is between the employee and the employer.  In this context, it will be Greencore.  The Bill states that an employee of the original company shall, on the said date, become an employee of the new company with the same rights and subject to the same obligations as applied under the old company.  Why does the Minister not comply with what was agreed at that stage with the Congress of Trade Unions?</P>
    <P>The four other Acts detail provisions relating to the continuity of employment, recognition of trade unions and staff associations and the continuity of terms and conditions of employment.  I submit that it is the view of the Congress of Trade Unions that if the shorter text in the Irish Life Bill means the same as the longer text in the four other Acts, then it is a positive advantage to both the Minister and the trade unions, with reference to explaining the legislation to employees of the company, to use the longer form which is more explicit.  If, on the other hand, the provisions in the Irish Life Bill do not mean the same as those in, for instance, the Labour Services Act, 1987, then the position of the workers of the Irish Sugar Company could not be guaranteed in relation to the items listed.</P>
    <P>What has been stated by the Minister in this document does not bear any relation to anything that is contained in the congress document and makes no reference to any of the legislation which, if complied with in this Act, would give safeguards to employees The Minister says that I am lying and so on.  I am sorry he is not here now to answer this question.  I am convinced beyond a shadow of doubt that it is intended to <Col N="1024" /> pull the wool over the workers' eyes, to present something to new employers as if the employees did not exist and did not have conditions of employment.  The company are too eager to present this to the big financiers who will come in to buy out that company which is partly owned by the workers, as it was built on the sweat of the workers, in a way which will attract them.  I am grossly disappointed. I feel strongly on the point for the reasons stated and we will press my amendment.</P>

      <P>During Second Stage debate there was no reference in the Bill to rights and conditions of employees.  It was only after the discussion on Second Stage that the Minister promised to introduce an amendment which would assure the rights of employees in relation to conditions of employment and so on in the new company.  We have argued as to what is appropriate in the Bill.  I put down a lengthy amendment based on earlier legislation which would have adequately met the needs.  When the Minister was disposed to resist Deputy Sherlock's amendment and my amendment and came forward with this agreement that had been entered into by the unions, we found that the agreement was inadequate in its wording and we pressed the Minister for explanations on various matters like redundancy and about other areas where the document was deficient.  Since then, negotiations have been going on over the last weekend and the unions and the company, according to the Minister, have reached finality on an agreement in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having failed on Committee Stage to get an appropriate amendment accepted, I have on Report Stage simply tried to tie down the Minister into putting into the Bill the fact that agreement had been arrived at between the company and the unions and that it had been registered in the Labour Court.  That is the minimum the Minister could do, as Deputy Pattison has said, to assure the workers who have given tremendous service to the company that their conditions and rights had at least been registered in the Labour Court and there was a document there which <Col N="1025" /> could be inspected if a dispute arose.  The Minister rejected that.  I fail to see how he can do that.  The reason he gave is that it is not appropriate to write into an Act the details of an agreement, but I have to tell him that that is not so.  I have before me a copy of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, sections 45 and 46 of which run to about two pages and list the conditions of service for the employees of the two companies concerned. This was done at a time when they were still part of the Civil Service. Section 45 deals with the provisions applicable to staff transferred to companies; section 46 with superannuation and section 47 with the provision of certain welfare funds.  Therefore, there is a precedent for doing what at least two parties on this side of the House tried to do yesterday.</P>
    <P>All our proposals have been rejected and we are now down to the minimum of two lines contained in brackets, but the Minister has told us that it is not appropriate to enter the details of an agreement in an Act.  The amendment would not enter the details in the Bill; all I am doing here is referring to a document which contains some detail.  I am not referring to the negotiations which have taken place or outlining each of the eight points on which any competent trade union official would make sure he had agreement.  My amendment simply refers to the agreement being registered in the Labour Court.  The Minister has said he cannot accept it, even though the sections dealing with the rights and conditions of service of workers in An Post and Telecom Éireann run to approximately 100 lines.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that the reason the Minister is resisting this amendment so strongly and the reason he is rushing this Bill through the House and will rush it through the Seanad tomorrow and on Friday, is that he wants to ensure that nothing in the Bill will <Col N="1026" /> offend people in the Stock Exchange, the institutional or private investors, who are screaming for the Bill to be put through the House so that the company can be floated at the earliest possible date.  When I collected these Acts in the Library I happened to meet a Senator who has a connection with the Stock Exchange.  I asked him if the inclusion of an amendment such as this would have an effect and he replied that those who invest in companies do not like to see agreements with the unions written in.  That underlines the point I am making.</P>
    <P>The Minister is so anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit will be gained from the flotation of the company that he cannot even look after the workers who have contributed so much to the success of the company.  Deputy O'Keeffe has outlined the profits which have been made in recent years by the company, yet the Minister cannot even do this much.</P>
    <P>I should point out, and I am sure you are aware of this, Acting Chairman, that the Act which established the FII, a big company in County Wicklow, who have their own problems, contains sections dealing with the conditions of service.  I fail to see, except for the reason I am giving now, how the Minister can resist including this minimal amendment.  He has rejected all others.  It is an affront to everyone who has contributed to the success of the Sugar Company not to make that small concession to the company's workers.  I will be pressing this amendment to a vote.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1b:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 4, after &ldquo;Company&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than the special share&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Every share of the Holding Company which is to be allotted or transferred to the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food or their nominees shall be allotted or transferred either, as the particular Minister shall direct, to the Minister concerned or to a person (in this section referred to as a nominee) nominated in that behalf by the relevant Minister, and different persons may be so nominated in respect of different shares.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> The following provisions shall apply and have effect in respect of all shares of the Holding Company which are for the time being standing in the name of a nominee for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food, that is to say:</P>
    <P>I wish to amend this and have inserted:</P>
    <P>The following provisions shall apply and have effect in respect of all shares of the Holding Company other than the special share...</P>
    <P>Emphasis must be placed on the special share.  We are told that it is the special share which will protect the interests of growers and a great number of other people, in other words, the sugar quota. I have heard no argument to convince me that a new holding company cannot import sugar.  Of course, they can.  The only thing stopping them importing sugar at present is that we have a sugar quota; and even though the price of sugar is higher here than on the world market, it is protected by the fact that we have a sugar quota, but that may not always be the case.  Any new holding company which would see it to their advantage to import sugar could very well do so.  They could reduce in the initial stages the amount of sugar to be produced in Ireland and import the balance.  There are plenty of instances where that almost happened.  I made the point last evening that it almost went to that point a couple of years ago.  Consequently there is a need for protection.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister relying so much on the golden share?  There is no evidence that the golden share can be used to protect a company in other EC countries in the event of take-overs, whether in Britain or in France or in any other country.  We had the examples of Britoil and Jaguar in Britain, and the congress of trade unions recognised at an early stage that the golden share was not applied.  The legal implications of the special share, whether it is legal in the EC context, have never been spelled out and would need to be clarified.  If the Minister can dispose of the shares that <Col N="1030" /> will be allocated to him we should at least have a provision in the Bill for disposing of such shares in the holding company other than the special share.</P>
    <P>This would give us confidence because we would have an Act on which to rely and to defend our rights.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions say that the provision is specially made in the Sugar Bill allowing the Minister to dispose of the special share in the new company.  This runs directly counter to the assurance given to them and that is the reason the Minister moved his amendment which states that the Minister may not dispose of the special share.  We all know how easy it is to drive a coach and four through legislation that has been enacted from time to time.  We want to close off the loopholes.  There is no point in the Minister having an amendment which states there will be a special share which he shall not dispose of if he allows section 4 (2) to stand.  For that reason I propose an amendment to section 4 (2), to insert the words &ldquo;other than the special share&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;Holding Company&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are quite happy that the Minister's amendment meets the case in question.  I do not see any likelihood of the company or their quota being swallowed up by foreign interests.  I might point out to Deputy Sherlock, with your permission a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that even today there is no guarantee that the sugar issue can be controlled internally.  Every member of the EC is entitled to sell sugar in this country under the rules of the Treaty of Rome.  A number of them have been selling sugar in this country in recent years, and were it not for the sterling performance of the Sugar Company, under the chairmanship of Mr. Bernie Cahill and the genius of the chief executive, Mr. Comerford, we could be in a really dangerous situation at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had sugar imports in the middle eighties and for a considerable time they threatened the very existence of the Sugar Company.  That should be borne in mind by everybody.  The Sugar Company <Col N="1031" /> was put on such a competitive and effective footing by the people to whom I referred and by the board generally that we were able to combat the threat posed by those sugar imports.  One is never totally safe, whether a company is State owned or is a public company.  One has always to bear in mind that we are dealing in an open market and we have to compete with other concerns because if we are not efficient, our sugar industry will be devastated.  This legislation is moving in the right direction to ensure that our position is further strengthened.  We need a very strong sugar sector to take on the competition.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister about the composition of the new holding company, he did not reply but intimated that at a future stage in the debate he would reply to my query as to the initial constitution of the board of the new company, Greencore.  Members of the House are entitled to know how the new board will be constituted, whether it will be a continuation of the present board, an entirely new board or a combination of a partially new board and an old board.  We would also like to know how long the new board will be in existence before there is a public meeting of the shareholders and a constitutionally elected board is formed.  We are all entitled to know that.  It is a very basic thing.  I would be totally opposed to any system where a public company was run by a group of political hacks, and it happens repeatedly.  I would like to see a very much above board set of directors nominated, because initially they will not be elected.  Until such time as the company are fully in motion and we have annual general meetings and people are democratically elected, I would like to know how the board will be selected so that we can have some confidence in their operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sugar Company get a very brief mention in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There are assurances to the country in general that the special share will be the protector of the sugar quota <Col N="1032" /> and the sugar industry in this country.  It was only because of our insistence on Second and on Committee Stages that the Minister brought in an amendment to say he would not dispose of that share. Up to then it was possible for the Government's share to be disposed of by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Deputy Sherlock's amendment is to leave no doubt that this share cannot be sold under any other sections of the Bill.  Even though the amendment was to section 2, and Deputy Sherlock's amendment is to section 4, I have the same concern.  I consulted the Bills Office and they told me that this section did not apply to the special share and that it was unnecessary to put in an amendment.  That is why I did not put down an amendment on the same basis. Quite honestly, however, listening to discussions here today, I wish I had gone ahead and put down an amendment.  At least there will be an opportunity to put in an amendment in the Seanad in this area if nothing is done here.  It seems to be totally appropriate and that is why I consulted with the Bills Office about this amendment which says that the following provisions shall apply and have effect in respect of all shares of the holding company.</P>
      <P>All that is being asked in this amendment is to except the special share from all those shares.  I do not think it is too much to ask that we have total clarity in this area so that we are not saying in one section that we cannot sell the share and then in another section saying that we can sell all the shares.  The Minister assured us yesterday in the House that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has only one share, and that is the Government share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 (2) (a) says that the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food may transfer all or any of the said shares to another person selected by the Minister concerned to hold as his nominee shares so transferred.  Maybe the golden share can be given to somebody else in the Department, for example, the secretary. However, the Minister said he was going to hold it.  These little changes should be underlined and we should <Col N="1033" /> know exactly where we are going with this share because now it is certainly the only item in this Bill, the only thing being held out by Fianna Fáil in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as a safeguard of our quota of sugar, of the industry in general, the consumers, the employees and the growers.  We are now down to depending on this particular share.  It is most important that there be no doubt left in this Bill that anything can be done to transfer this share out of the Department of Agriculture and Food into anybody else's hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate yesterday the Minister promised that he would have the Attorney General's Office examine the wording of this subsection to ensure that it represented exactly what is intended and that there was no possibility that the special share could be disposed of to the secretary of the Department or to anybody else.  I now want to assure the House that the Attorney General's Office have examined this subsection and have confirmed that they are satisfied that the wording as now printed in the Bill should stand.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand the reasoning behind Deputy Sherlock's amendment.  The whole purpose of this section of the Bill is to empower the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food to appoint nominees and to transfer shares to such nominees to act on their behalf.  The section sets out the rights and duties of nominees and the power of the respective Ministers to issue directions.  I want to stress that Ministers cannot, of course, do everything themselves, even though we try to from time to time.  It is only right and proper that they should be able to appoint nominees to hold shares for them and to act on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Sherlock's amendment was accepted then the Minister for Agriculture and Food would not be permitted to transfer his special share to a nominee to act on his behalf.  I want to stress again that this is the only share the Minister for Agriculture and Food will have.  This <Col N="1034" /> amendment is unacceptable, given that the section clearly provides that the nominee must act, in all respects, in accordance with the directions of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There may be some confusion in relation to this section because section 4 (2) (a) (ii) provides that it shall be lawful for the Minister for Finance to direct a nominee to sell or dispose of all or any of the shares vested in him.  There is, however, no similar provision in relation to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his nominee.  Indeed, the amendment the Minister introduced on Committee Stage, and which is now in section (2) (9), clearly provides that the Minister for Agriculture and Food shall not dispose of the special share.  The Attorney General's Office confirmed this morning that this section stands alone.  It expressly forbids the disposal of the share and no other provision in the Bill can be construed as permitting the disposal of the special share.  I want to give this solemn assurance to this House that if any Minister for Agriculture and Food in the future wishes to dispose of the special share he cannot do so without this legislation being amended.</P>

      <P>The special share is the real safeguard.  We are talking about protection of the sugar quota and of growers and employees.  The market is quite vulnerable to the importation of foreign sugar.  We are all aware that there is some foreign sugar being used here to the disadvantage of our native industry. If we do not agree on this we will make our industry totally uncompetitive.  The special share is the protection.  Because of that the company cannot be wound up and the Minister and the Department has a function in it.  There is full protection.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to contribute to this important debate.  I congratulate the Labour Party, as has been done by Deputy Gilmore on behalf of my party, on having initiated this Bill to entitle to some extent those members of our community, who have been forced through economic disadvantage and Government mismanagement to live abroad, to have a say and involvement in our electoral processes here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important and timely that this House address for the first time, in the context of a Bill, the right &mdash; as is extended to citizens of most other European countries &mdash; to participate in elections at home.  Indeed it was one of the first matters raised in correspondence with me when I was first elected to this House in 1987.  A constituent of mine, now living near Birmingham, wrote wondering why it was the City Hall there had been used as a polling station for the elections then being held in Italy in order that Italian emigrants could vote and have their voices heard.  That emigrant wondered why he, an Irish citizen, living in the same city, could not be accommodated though there would be greater numbers of Irish citizens living there.  It <Col N="1036" /> brought home graphically the fact that so many Irish citizens live abroad through no choice of theirs but rather out of economic necessity and have a strong desire to be linked to our democratic processes here.  Yet we do nothing to accommodate them.</P>
    <P>In approaching this issue it is important to lay down some basic principles.  The first obvious one is that citizens of this country should not be disenfranchised simply because they have been forced to live abroad, temporarily or otherwise, through no fault of theirs but rather out of economic necessity.  Any approach to a real democratic process should involve people in the process of elections rather than arbitrarily exclude them.  Consequently, the premise of voting in any elections here should be based, first, on one's residence here as a citizen or, alternatively, based on that citizenship and temporary residence abroad.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have partially addressed this principle in a recently published Bill by their spokesperson in this area, Deputy McGinley.  They have not gone the distance I believe they should but at least have recognised the principle that emigrants, or citizens who live abroad, should be directly involved in some way in the electoral process, be recorded and recognised as such.  To that extent that party also must be congratulated on what they sought to institute. Certainly what must be subjected to the strongest criticism on the part of anyone concerned with the democratic process in this House is the attitude of the Government parties &mdash; Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; their rejection of it, as a Government, represented here by the Minister for the Environment last week, which is a disgrace to the concept of open, working democracy.</P>
    <P>It is worth while to examine briefly the reasons the Minister contended the Government parties could not support the concept in principle of allowing emigrants to vote.  In the first instance the Minister worried about the numbers, the probability, in some instances, that a <Col N="1037" /> combined vote of all emigrants in a constituency could elect a Deputy there.  On the Minister's figures alone my constituency of Dublin North-East is one which could return, on an average of 7,000 emigrants per constituency, a Deputy to this House.  Let me say that I would wholeheartedly welcome that simply because there are too many of my constituents forced to live abroad, seeking jobs not through any choice of theirs but rather out of necessity to fend for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>That scenario alone should force this House to seriously address the issue of emigration.  Despite all the plausible rhetoric of the Minister for the Environment in the House last week I do not believe the Government have seriously examined the issue of emigrants' welfare. The first requirement &mdash; looking at that issue of the welfare of our emigrants &mdash; is not to go hawking around the chambers and corridors of Washington or elsewhere seeking extra visas or endeavouring to legalise those who are described as illegal immigrants there.  The first requirement is to look at our economy, our job creation programmes, and ascertain what can be done to facilitate the early return of the vast majority of those who wish to remain at home and who should be facilitated here with the requisite job opportunities.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we will ever be able to focus on that issue in a single-minded way until people are elected by those living abroad to stand in this House to argue their case.  If so many of them are forced to leave Dublin North-East, or any other constituency, then let those constituencies return Members directly to this Chamber who will argue their cause forcibly.  From the time I was elected to this House the Dublin North-East constituency has been represented by a Government Minister and one other member of Fianna Fáil.  Throughout that period I never heard any Government representative in that constituency argue the emigrants' case or for a serious jobs creation programme that would facilitate their return to their constituency to make a livelihood there.  Experience has shown <Col N="1038" /> that the words of the Minister for the Environment, expressing concerns for our emigrants, really do not carry any weight when one examines the record of this House and, indeed, within the constituencies about which he is so worried.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister was worried about the constitutional issue: why cut off eligibility at 15 years as is proposed in the Bill?  For example, what about the emigrant who is 15 years and a day abroad?  If that is a matter of serious concern to the Minister it is one for debate here on Second Stage.  If we accept the principle and are prepared to examine the Bill, let us examine what is an acceptable cut-off point.  The Minister worried about taxation, about the contribution that might not be made to the State by an emigrant and wanted to link voting rights to taxation payments: in other words, an Irish version of the poll tax.  My argument is this: if emigration is a voluntary act on the part of an emigrant, so be it.  Perhaps then there is an argument for maintaining that the right to vote does not exist.  But there is no basis for arguing that, when people are forced to leave this country through economic necessity, they have no right to vote simply because they pay their taxes elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister worried about the inability of the emigrant to apply the proportional representation system or to understand it, contending that in other countries where emigrants have the vote it is based on a single preference vote.  In my view this represents another veiled attack by Fianna Fáil, in Government, on the whole concept of proportional representation. As has been said by other Members on this side of the House, it is an insult to the intelligence of our emigrant voters but, more particularly, is a repetition of the often-voiced attacks of Fianna Fáil over the years on the proportional representation system itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to postal voting and said it could not work.  I would remind him that it has worked in many other instances in order to facilitate those members of our community &mdash; soldiers, <Col N="1039" /> members of the Garda Síochána and the disabled &mdash; who exercised their vote in that manner.  I see no reason it cannot be extended, with ingenuity, to enfranchise our emigrants.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill has served one useful purpose, it has exposed the double-talk, double-thinking and double-dealing of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government on this important issue.  They have opposed it not on the basis that it is unworkable but rather because they are opposed in principle to the idea of giving our emigrants voting rights here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree entirely with the latter comments of Deputy McCartan, especially in regard to the position of my own party. Since the foundation of the Progressive Democrats five years ago, we have been extremely concerned about the plight of Irish people who have been forced through economic circumstances to emigrate, and seek a living overseas &mdash; in Britain, the United States, Australia and continental European countries.</P>
      <P>We are also aware, of course, that some of the emigration in recent years is not entirely involuntary arising from the lack of employment opportunities here at home.  Indeed, many younger people in particular, with good education and relatively good prospects in Ireland, have nonetheless decided to emigrate, particularly to Britain, because they see there the opportunity to make a better living for themselves because of the punitive income tax system in this country.</P>
      <P>The social and economic policies of the Progressive Democrats are aimed at addressing the plight of both the voluntary and the involuntary emigrants. The whole thrust of our economic policies are to ensure that by getting Government spending under control, and bringing our industrial costs down to internationally competitive levels, we can revitalise the Irish economy, boost Irish exports and thereby create many extra employment opportunities here at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the pace of economic recovery <Col N="1040" /> arising from the adoption of Progressive Democrats economic policies over the past couple of years is still not adequate, it is nevertheless worth pointing out that over the past three years a net 40,000 jobs have been created here, and all of those have arisen in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Moreover, a further priority of our economic policies is to radically transform our tax system so that it will encourage enterprise, risk-taking and reward hard work.  This Government have taken significant steps along that road, by bringing the standard rate of income tax down to 29 per cent and the upper rate to 52 per cent, and our goal, of course, is to reach 25 per cent and a single higher rate of income tax over the next two budgets in this Government.</P>
    <P>Of course, merely realising these income tax rates of themselves will not be sufficient to boost enterprise and reward effort; in particular, the standard income tax rate of 25 per cent must apply to the broad band of income up to, and including, the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, giant steps have been taken over the past few years to revitalise the Irish economy, and that recovery stems primarily from the adoption of our party's policies.  Given the scale of our unemployment crisis, this does not go nearly far enough and we must redouble our efforts to make our economy ever more competitive and export orientated.</P>
    <P>Sadly, it is inevitable, therefore, that many Irish people will continue to emigrate in search of a better way of life because of the scale of unemployment at home, and the needs of these emigrants are also reflected in our policies.  The Progressive Democrats were particularly concerned, for instance, that Governments here were not lending any financial support to emigrant welfare in the United States, along the lines of the support given to Irish emigrant welfare centres in Britain.</P>
    <P>We brought this concern of ours to the negotiations with our partners on the formation of the present Government in July 1989, and a specific commitment was <Col N="1041" /> agreed in the Programme for Government that financial support would be provided to immigrant groups in the United States, to be channelled through the consulates in consultation with the immigration working committees.</P>
    <P>We were delighted therefore when the Government commenced that policy and agreed in the 1990 budget to provide £200,000 to support groups in the United States which are helping Irish immigrants with advice and assistance in finding work and accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats also support the principle of according voting rights to recently departed emigrants. This proposition was also considered in the negotiations on the formation of the present Government, but it was not possible for the two parties to agree that voting rights should be accorded because of the many complex issues which first needed to be examined and resolved, but it was agreed that the present Government would &ldquo;examine the feasibility of granting voting rights to recent emigrants&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A detailed Government study of the feasibility of according rights has not yet been concluded and, therefore, it has not yet been possible for the Government collectively to consider all the issues involved.  I, and my party, fully accept that this is an extraordinarily complex question, and one which touches on such fundamental matters as the constitutional rights of Irish citizens and the importance of avoiding discrimination as between different citizens; huge logistical problems in ensuring that any emigrant voting system would be operable in an efficient manner, and would also preclude the possibility of electoral abuse.</P>
    <P>Many of these difficulties were outlined in detail by my Government colleague the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, in his contribution to this debate last week and certainly the various difficulties which he outlined have to be taken into consideration by the Government and by this House when attempting to formulate a definitive attitude to this question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> For our part, the Progressive Democrats, when in Opposition, carried out detailed research on the feasibility of according voting rights to recent emigrants and we completed a study of the situation prevailing in the other member states of the Community.</P>
    <P>As many people have already referred to in this debate, the situation is that emigrants from seven member states of the Community &mdash; Britain, France, Portugal, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain &mdash; do accord voting rights to emigrants on varying terms, while such a right is not yet available in Greece, Belgium, Denmark, Italy and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Two of the seven countries which give votes to emigrants limit the privilege by time.  In Britain the limit is 20 years, and in Germany it is ten years from the time of emigrating, but the other five countries have no restrictions based on how long it is since their emigrants have departed, or indeed if such citizens have ever even lived in the country.</P>
    <P>Of course, voting entitlement for emigrants in those countries also varies in many other details.  In France, for instance, there is no time limit for expatriate French citizens voting in the presidential election or in referenda, but there is no voting right for the national assembly.  The place of voting is at the country's embassy, either directly or by proxy.</P>
    <P>The situation in Spain is that all Spanish citizens living abroad are entitled to vote in all elections there, and it is not necessary to have previously lived in the country.  All embassies of that country hold a register of electors which is updated on a yearly basis.  In Luxembourg voters need to have a valid passport of that country, but previous residence in the country is not required.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from a brief perusal of the rules in the EC states which accord voting rights to emigrants that the qualification regulations vary widely.  We also need to secure further information on how the emigrant voting provision has worked in elections in those countries.  It would be interesting for instance, to <Col N="1043" /> know what percentage of the overall national electorate in recent elections has been emigrant voters, what approximate percentage of emigrants from these various countries exercise the franchise from overseas, and, whether the provision has run into any constitutional difficulties in any of these countries.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe nonetheless that the principle of according a right to vote in general elections here at home to recently departed emigrants is a valid aspiration, and one which all parties in this House should strive to facilitate by working to resolve the various logistical and other obstacles that undoubtedly exist, rather than simply putting the shutters up on this proposal.</P>
    <P>Many fundamental matters have to be resolved.  For instance, the constitutional provision of equal rights for all citizens, and how any voting rights accorded to our emigrants could affect their voting entitlements in their country of residence, need to be studied further.  I know, too, that there is not any great consensus on how the parties in this House might give effect to the provision of votes for emigrants and that the Fine Gael Party have published a Bill suggesting the principle could be addressed by creating three additional seats in the Seanad for emigrant electors.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Bill before us would suggest that emigrants departed this country for up to 15 years would have votes in every constituency in this country, and certainly before taking this proposition on board it would be important that all parties in the House would give wider consideration to the electoral impact of such access to all 41 constituencies.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion which our party briefly considered is the possibility of allocating a seat in the Dáil to our emigrants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we have also considered various proposals within our own party as to the appropriate eligibility rules <Col N="1044" /> governing emigrant votes &mdash; whether it would be a five years or a ten years qualification or periods greater than this.</P>
      <P>With a matter as complex as this and with so many fundamental implications, it is not simply enough to agree the principle therefore.  We must also flesh out a reasonably workable legislative proposal before we can give serious consideration to changing the electoral system to accommodate emigrants.  This is why the Progressive Democrats are voting against this Bill; it is far too inadequate in detail, and the fundamental changes it could bring to our electoral system have clearly not been thought through, nor has the sheer complexity of the issue been tackled in any detail.</P>
      <P>Consideration of this issue should not ignore either the quickening pace of European integration, embodied in the 1992 programme for the creation of a Single Europe with free movement of people, goods, capital and services.  In the process of deepening the integration of the Community, the issue of a &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; of the present European Parliament will have to be addressed and, as citizens of a United Europe, the relationship between domestic legislatures and the European Parliament will obviously go through further significant and far-reaching change.</P>
      <P>In Government, the Progressive Democrats will continue to press for a detailed scrutiny of this proposition with a view to reaching agreement on a set of practicable, workable and constitutional proposals, which, on the one hand will not offend the integrity of our electoral system, but at the same time will meet the principle in a meaningful way of according a presence in our democratic process to our recently departed emigrants. The Progressive Democrats believe this is a worth while and desirable goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thankfully many of our recent emigrants have been able to maintain close contacts with their homeland, made possible in particular by the availability of cheap and accessible air travel.  Many of these people, too, are acquiring skills and talents overseas which will be invaluable <Col N="1045" /> to the further development of this country.  The maintenance of as many links as possible, therefore, is of value to both the emigrant community and also to this country.  Direct links for our emigrants right into this Dáil Chamber would help ensure that our recently departed emigrants would continue to have a role, a voice and an influence on social and economic affairs in their native country.</P>
    <P>That is a laudable aim and, notwithstanding the many weighty and complex obstacles which do lie in the way of realising it, it should not be beyond the ingenuity of our political system to accommodate this goal, and the Progressive Democrats will continue to strive to achieve that.  We believe this is an area on which all-party consensus should be sought prior to the submission of a Bill, particularly as this Bill would not work.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Michael Barrett and Deputy Jacob.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I believe I am qualified to speak on any aspect of emigration and the plight of Irish emigrants as I emigrated to England in 1954 and worked there for ten years before returning to Ireland in 1964.</P>
      <P>I left Ireland at a time when the first Coalition Government had taken office. There was vast emigration from Ireland at that time.  Therefore, this Government cannot be blamed for the problem of emigration, it existed long before that. The parties on the opposite side of the House also had the opportunity to rectify this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have lived up to their responsibilities to the Irish people who have emigrated.  I am aware that special measures have been adopted to deal with the difficulties being experienced by Irish emigrants.  The Government are committed to the provision of assistance and back-up services to emigrants to ensure their welfare needs are safeguarded.  The Irish Embassy in London has been charged with monitoring the problems facing Irish emigrants in England.  They liaise with the various welfare and advice <Col N="1046" /> centres there to ensure that financial assistance is provided to Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>This is a vast change to the forties, fifties and sixties when Irish people who went to England had to find their own way and had nowhere to turn to.  At that time the Irish centres in London and Birmingham helped Irish emigrants by putting them up in accommodation on a temporary basis until such time as they could obtain permanent accommodation. The county associations in Britain have done a tremendous job for Irish emigrants, as have the many Irish chaplains who went to London during those years to work with Irish emigrants.  I am referring in particular to Bishop Eamon Casey, the Bishop of Galway, who did tremendous work in London for Irish emigrants by setting up a housing agency where Irish emigrants could get advice on how to purchase houses.  Father Michael Cleary, who is very well known to people in this country, was sent to London to meet Irish emigrants at stations and find accommodation for them.  He did a very good job in that regard.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to give Irish emigrants the right to vote in all elections in this country.  I agree with the Minister that the Bill is not workable due to its constitutional implications, which he outlined in great detail.  The present position is that, with the exception of the parts where there are Irish communities, there is no direct Irish news media in most parts of England and the United States.  A limited number of newsagencies in certain areas of London stock an English edition of the Irish daily newspapers and Sunday newspapers.  Many Irish people who have been living in England for a few years have adapted to life in that country and have voting rights there.  I have never heard any Irish person say they were concerned because they did not have the right to vote in Irish elections.</P>
    <P>Having heard most of the contributions by Members on the Opposition benches, I have come to the conclusion that many of them have little or no knowledge of the plight of Irish emigrants in England.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;made an interesting contribution last night.  Deputy Gerry Reynolds said he had spent a short while there.  However, anyone who went to London during the time about which I am speaking was said to have gone to London to get the correct time.  Most Deputies have probably had occasion to visit England but I do not believe they have sufficient knowledge of emigration. I have lived there and I know what it is all about.  The Government have provided finance to ensure that there is adequate information and welfare services for Irish emigrants.  This is an indication of the Government's concern for Irish people who have emigrated.</P>
      <P>While some emigrants never settled down in the countries to which they emigrated a large percentage of Irish emigrants have done very well for themselves in their adopted countries.  I know many Irish people who were unskilled when they emigrated but they learned trades and in some cases set up their own businesses.  Many other Irish emigrants furthered their education in England.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes that Irish people who have emigrated within the past 15 years should have the right to be registered to vote in all elections other than local elections held in this country.  It also proposes that voting should be by way of postal vote.  The Bill makes no reference to the implications of this proposal.  All these issues are ignored and no reference is made to the safeguarding of elections. All these safeguards and implications should have been referred to in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious reservations have been expressed about the postal voting system. It has been established that if this system were to be used in the future additional <Col N="1048" /> safeguards would have to be provided.  It is difficult to know the thinking behind this Bill in so far as the compilation of a register of voters for Irish emigrants is concerned.  I say this because I am aware that some Irish emigrants move around on a frequent basis.  Some of them can work in as many as ten different cities and towns in one year.  I am referring in particular to Irishmen who work for construction companies.  These people could be registered for voting purposes in many cities and towns.  This means that these persons' votes could be used by other people unless safeguards are included in the Bill.  There are no safeguards in this Bill to cover any abuses which might arise in this area.  If a postal voting system is devised for Irish emigrants it would be important that the ballot paper get to the person it is intended for, and that person should be able to vote in secret and should be free from any influence or undue pressure.</P>
    <P>From my experience and knowledge of emigration, I find it difficult to understand how a person who has left Ireland for, say, five years would have an up to date knowledge of the political situation here.  The position would be even worse for people who left Ireland 15 years ago. Irish people who have lived in England for a number of years are entitled to vote there.  Up to some years ago Irish people living in England did not have the right to vote in elections there.  For quite a while an influential lobby there considered that the granting of voting rights to foreigners was inappropriate.  Thankfully this has changed and all people resident in England for a certain period are entitled to vote in elections there.  I would be interested to know how many Irish people living outside Ireland would like to have voting rights in two countries.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the problem of emigration has existed for many years under successive Governments.  It is a very difficult problem to resolve.  It is very sad for parents who rear and educate their children to see them emigrate as there are not sufficient jobs for them in Ireland.  This Government have done more than any other Government to <Col N="1049" /> resolve this problem.  A number of new jobs have been created &mdash; I think a figure of 40,000 was mentioned by the Minister &mdash; but many of these have been cancelled out by an increase in the number of redundancies.  The recent lay-offs and threat of redundancies in factories in Ballyhaunis and Kiltimagh are clearly due to factors outside the control of Irish Government.  These are English-based industries and due to the bad economic situation in England the parent company there directed what action was to be taken by the management in this country. In conclusion, I agree with the Minister in what he said about the Bill, that is that the homework has not been done.  There are very serious and complex issues which have not been taken on board and for that reason the Bill is not workable in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1991, which proposes to provide for the registration of certain emigrants as postal voters is, I am certain, a genuine expression of concern for Irish emigrants.  In focusing on the issue of emigration, it naturally arouses a variety of emotions and concerns related to the fact of emigration, on the one hand, and concern for the well-being of Irish citizens abroad on the other hand.  I accept the underlying concern for emigrants which stimulated the drafting of this Bill. I also believe it is a very important and significant issue with which we have wrestled and which we have considered for quite some time and I very much welcome the opportunity we have now to debate openly this issue and to consider all the ramifications and practicalities related to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Sunday week last I placed on a plane at Dublin Airport one of my six children who went to join her sister who is one year older and who had to leave her native country to take up employment in continental Europe.  Having been one of the young Irish people who was involved in the wave of emigration in the late fifties and early sixties, I hope passionately that, as I and thousands like me, were able to return home and make a life for <Col N="1050" /> ourselves in Ireland, with the uplift in the Irish economy during the great Lemass era, my children and their contemporaries will also be able to return in similar circumstances and take back home with them the valuable experience which they will hopefully glean in their foreign workplace.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I spent the day in London, together with three colleagues from this House, where we met with British Members of Parliament and the British Minister for Social Services for the purpose of endeavouring to improve the lot of our people who have emigrated to Britain, both those who departed recently and those who left these shores many years ago.  In so far as emigration and the welfare of emigrants is concerned, I truly believe that these are live issues within our current electoral system.  Our emigrants are well represented by their families who remain resident here.  I certainly believe they are part of my constituency and I will continue to represent them to the best of my ability on all those issues.</P>
    <P>For me one of the great disappointments of the magnificent economic improvements which has been effected in the past few years is that it has not had the effect of creating jobs on the scale that is required at this time.  The Bill seeks to extend the electoral register for all elections other than local elections to Irish citizens who were ordinarily resident in Ireland within a period of 15 years prior to the relevant election.  This is a very short Bill and in essence it is a Bill about a Bill, in that it imposes upon the Minister for the Environment the obligation to devise and produce to the House a series of regulations and other legislative requirements to give effect to the specific intention described earlier.  It is, as the Minister has indicated, a Bill dealing only with the issue of principle and does not concern itself with the minutiae of implementation.  While I would not deny that the House is entitled to deal with this issue in this way, I think it is only in the small details of implementation that one can fully comprehend the <Col N="1051" /> practicalities upon which the issue of principle can be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government addressed this issue of principle and the feasibility of extending voting rights to recent emigrants.  Rightly, it called for an examination of the issues involved and, as the Minister has said, this examination has been undertaken.  Leaving aside emotional aspirations which we all feel, it is only when one considers how they might be achieved that a complete picture emerges.  I also have thought carefully on this matter.</P>
    <P>There are a number of fairly obvious major questions involved: the practical difficulties, for example, of establishing a register of emigrant voters and ensuring that each is a legitimate person entitled to be registered.  If the principle of equal treatment for citizens underlies this Bill then we must face the reality that while it might be relatively easier to provide for large groupings of qualified persons under the Bill, as in the United Kingdom, or even some areas within the United States it is a daunting task to consider applying the provisions equally and fairly to other Irish citizens spread throughout the far reaches of the world.  The task of receiving, vetting and providing for the voting rights of what the Minister judged to be at least 250,000 people, but which I believe must surely be many times more than this, would be enormous.</P>
    <P>The tremendous complexity of providing a secure system to ensure that all votes received are legitimate must surely be conceded by all Members of this House.  Equally, the effect which such votes could have on the outcome of elections in all constituencies, given the proportional representation system, must concern us if we were even slightly concerned that some votes were not validly cast.  While we may be assured that our system, and its regulation, is well managed, we are not so foolish as to think that it is foolproof and incapable of manipulation by those who put their minds to it.  We can deal with those situations at home but how can we seriously believe that any postal voting system or, <Col N="1052" /> indeed, any other system which the Bill allows the Minister to introduce, could be so securely established?  This is not a small matter of detail but rather a matter of great import, affecting the credibility and integrity of our electoral system.</P>
    <P>I know also that there are question marks over the constitutionality of the implied definition in this Bill of citizen or enfranchised person which may be the subject of challenge.  If the franchise is offered to others as per the formula applied by the United States, then we might well have a situation where the number of the electorate living abroad exceeded that of those living at home.  I am certain that the supporters of this Bill would cringe from any such situation, and in that I cite the example and danger of dealing with the principle without due consideration for the widespread implications of these proposals.</P>
    <P>This difficulty could equally surface from a constitutional challenge to the threshold for eligibility defined under this Bill, with some people eligible by one day and others ineligible by one day.  The arbitrary nature of the cut-off point, which has no particular logic over any other threshold, opens doors to such challenges and accusations in regard to, simply, poor or ill-conceived legislation. I am very concerned about these matters.</P>
    <P>It is very appropriate that this House should have the opportunity to examine this issue.  The House should consider the ramifications and implications of operating an external voting register for emigrants. I am glad to have had the opportunity of contributing to this debate and comprehending some of the myriad of issues which result from it.  Overall, it is a Bill about a principle which defies practical application and also, I believe, it is suspect in its appropriateness within our democratic electoral system.</P>
    <P>It is clearly evident that the proposers have not had the capacity to foresee those practicalities or implications which this debate has shown up.  When they are exposed to examination, they clearly point to the impracticality of the proposals. When, on top of the points I have <Col N="1053" /> already referred to, one imposes the complexity of our proportional representation system of election, with many candidates with a variety of different perspectives, and representing many different stances on issues, the complexity of the problem, and the implications for our home electorate and taxpayers, it makes the proposals unacceptable.</P>

The Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy who has now left the House, went on at length to in some way validate the position of the Progressive Democrats.  He said the Progressive Democrats believe, nonetheless, that the principle of according a right to vote in general elections at home to recently departed emigrants is a valid aspiration.  The Bill does that, it is about principles and that is how our legislation operates.  The Second Stage of a Bill is simply a declaration of principle.  We have had disagreements before in relation to minutiae in the judicial separation Act and the Child Care Bill but, ultimately, we arrived at a civilised arrangement of putting such matters of agreed principle into special committees to iron out the legislative difficulties. Deputy Jacob said that this was a Bill without a principle.  This Bill has a fundamental principle of giving the franchise to people who have recently emigrated.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Bill, it is good legislation and if people were freed from the strictures of a party Whip everybody would agree with it.  However, it is fraught with difficulties and dangers for the Government.  I listened to Deputy <Col N="1055" /> Michael Barrett who was very creative in regard to mathematics.  He said that no Government had done more for jobs than his and he cited the <i>Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the programme for national development. He mentioned the creation of 40,000 new jobs but what good are they when there are as many jobs lost?  There were 11,000 more people out of work last week than when Fianna Fáil took office in 1987.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Barrett referred to my county, he knows it well as he comes from an adjacent county.  He rightly instances the example of Farah in Ballyhaunis and in Kiltimagh where jobs were lost.  Every job lost is a family lost to the community and the country.  That is not the end of it for Mayo.  In the last three weeks alone 1,000 people have been put on short time and these enterprises are teetering on the brink, unfortunately I am not optimistic about their long term survival.</P>
      <P>Collectively, Members of the House should sit down in a depoliticised atmosphere and put this Bill into a special committee to examine its logistics.  Surely, if Deputy Molloy was able to do the circuit of Europe and give examples of where this has worked, the necessary expertise and back-up should be there, by way of private back-up to the Progressive Democrats, in Government Departments or, collectively, to put all resources together and come up with a system which will work, even on an experimental basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three weeks ago I sat with a neighbour of mine and his wife who had, that day, taken a taxi to Knock Airport.  They had said goodbye to the last of their five children; as the man said: &ldquo;In Mayo we buy three suits for the three &ldquo;ations&rdquo;&mdash; confirmation, graduation and emigration&rdquo;. One must see the look of disbelief and emptiness on the faces of people who have said goodbye to their last child to appreciate the full impact of emigration.  The &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme that night was about the merits of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government side <Col N="1056" /> fleshed out the merits of the business expansion scheme and the other initiatives which were put in place and designed to put this country on a sound economic footing.  Unfortunately, I could see that behind the benign expressions on their faces there was deep anger and resentment on their faces.  In Mayo, over the last five years, as Archbishop Cassidy, Bishop Casey and Bishop Finnegan said, the county has been bled white by emigration. Tonight in the Visitors Gallery there are people from County Offaly, a county that won several All Irelands in hurling and football but now cannot field a decent county team.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the pattern in Offaly, Mayo, Laois, Cork and Kerry.  In view of the fact that we could not provide people with a job, a home or a decent measure of social welfare to live in dignity here we should at least give them some positive tie with home.  We are asking that these people be given the right to vote in general elections.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt &mdash; it has been acknowledged on all sides of the House &mdash; that one of the features of the Irish emigrant, in comparison with his counterpart in other countries, is an expectation that, some day, as Deputy Jacob said, that person will return.  Their roots in foreign soil are tentative, put there in the hope and expectation &mdash; maybe a vainglorious hope &mdash; that some day they will come back.  However, there is an unwillingness and inflexibility on the part of the Government to keep that flicker of hope alive because they are fundamentally afraid that, by acknowledging the right of emigrants to vote, we will have to establish their numbers which, in itself, is an admission of failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, has been asked time and again about the number of people who emigrated over the previous six months.  He answers by giving a ridiculous inflow and outflow which is not a gauge or an accurate estimate, it is just a guess in relation <Col N="1057" /> to how many people departed these shores.  We know that, conservatively over the last four or five years, at least 250,000 people have gone.  They are the finest generation we have ever bred, they are not like the young uncut nuggets of years ago.  They have AnCO, FAS and third level qualifications.  They are trained, have top level skills and could be the future leaders of society here; yet they are plying their trades in other countries.  They want to come back and retain ties.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach, as a gesture in relation to establishing accuracy, whether they would add one question to the census form asking how many people had left the household since the last census was taken in 1986.  I was told that it would not be possible because of difficulty of memory recall.  Obviously, the Government think the the head of a house hold suffers from that same affliction which affects members of the Government from time to time.  We are asking that the Government face reality and do not run away from the backlash because that is, fundamentally, what they are afraid of.</P>
    <P>Tonight members of the Government expressed the view that we could end up with more Deputies elected by Irish people outside the State than within the State.  So what?  Those people were born here and they feel they have the right to live here.  We have failed them economically and socially and we are not prepared now to give them the fundamental right to say who should be running this country or to fulfil their aspirations to return here some day.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill; it is a good Bill.  I see nothing wrong with giving a husband in London the right to vote here, particularly when his wife and family are domiciled here, to establish how he feels about fundamental policies being undertaken by the Government or offered as alternatives by the Opposition.  I am surprised that the Minister, Deputy Flynn, who comes from the same county as Deputy Kenny and I, a county that has been devastated by emigration, cannot see his way to making a gesture at least <Col N="1058" /> to accept this Bill on Second Stage and send it to an all-party committee to examine in detail.  If we cannot reach agreement on its feasibility and practicality let us at least acknowledge that. Where there is a will there is a way; it can be done but, unfortunately, the will is not there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy O'Sullivan on behalf of the Labour Party. I congratulate him on his initiative.  I have always supported the principle of giving our emigrants a greater say in running this country.  From my travels as a footballer and following that as a politician I have met many emigrants in England, Australia and America.  They all had one thing in common, they felt they were not recognised in their own country and when they had left our shores they were forgotten. Some of them remarked, &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;.  They want to play a role in our country.  They want some say in how their country is run.  We have never given them the recognition or the opportunity to do that.  The Bill in principle provides them with an opportunity to have a say in how their country is run.</P>
      <P>The Bill should not be dismissed because a very important principle is involved.  Our emigrants have the potential to make a major contribution to our country.  As Deputy Higgins said, many of them have been very successful in the various countries to which they emigrated and made contributions in different ways to life in those countries.  By attracting their interest, giving them recognition and a feeling they have a role to play and a contribution to make in our country, we can only enhance our reputation as a caring nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy on the other side of the House, I do not know who, said these people would not know who to vote for or how to vote because they are not well enough informed.  Let me point out to the Minister, and his Deputies, that our people in America, England and other countries are better informed about what goes on in their local parishes than we <Col N="1059" /> are.  If one wants to know who won last Sunday's local championship game one has only to ring up somebody in America because that person will know while a local individual may not.  Our emigrants keep in touch through the provincial papers from here.  One can judge that by the sale of local papers in places like the Bronx in New York.  These people are well tuned in.  They are looking at us tonight waiting for the result of this debate, and Fianna Fáil, who always claim to be the emigrants' party, the party concerned about their welfare, will let them down after the vote.</P>
    <P>Our record as regards emigrant welfare has been very bad.  Apart from the Catholic Church, the county associations and Irish societies throughout the world, no one has taken any real interest in the welfare of Irish emigrants up to quite recently.  Successive Governments have ignored our emigrants and, I am sure, were only too glad to see people leaving this country because that served as a safety valve.  Governments would not have to pay them social welfare, or spend money on educating them or on health and other services.</P>
    <P>A start was made in the 1983-87 period when the DÍON committee were established in England by Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  The committee allocate grants to organisations involved in emigrant welfare. While the present allocation of £500,000 is welcome it is grossly inadequate to meet the needs of the many young emigrants who require shelter and other outreach services as do some of our adult emigrants who went to England in the forties and fifties.  As the Minister is aware, DÍON cannot provide accommodation and accommodation is the major problem facing many emigrants.</P>
    <P>The Government recognised the need to provide finance for emigrants in America last year and I welcome the grant that was made available.  It was welcomed by the Catholic charities in New York who have a very successful outreach programme. The Minister referred to a major question in America, immigration reform.  since 1982 an estimated 100,000 <Col N="1060" /> to 150,000 Irish emigrants have gone illegally to America.  Immigration reform has been on the agenda there since November 1986 when Congressman Brian Donnelly introduced a special amendment to the 1986 Emigration Reform and Control Act which made so many visas available to the 35 countries that were adversely affected by the 1965 Act and which included Ireland.  Ireland fared well out of that programme. However, one thing the programme proved was that there was a major problem in America regarding undocumented Irish immigrants.  Over one million people applied for those visas, presented a bureaucratic nightmare and proved there was need for further reform.  I am glad to say the Government persevered and Deputy Peter Barry and the Fine Gael immigration committee travelled to America to lobby.  With groups like the IIRM and the Catholic charities in New York we succeeded in getting reform in November 1990 through the Morrison Bill which will provide 48,000 visas over the next three years for undocumented Irish.  This should help solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made about voting rights for emigrants in other EC countries. Citizens of Spain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK who are living abroad may vote in different ways. Greek and Italian citizens living abroad must return home to vote.  The Italian State provides financial assistance for its emigrants to do this.  Portuguese citizens living abroad may vote by post for candidates who specifically represent them. There are four representatives for Portuguese emigrants in the Portuguese Parliament. Denmark and Belgium have comparatively restrictive voting practices in parliamentary elections, Belgium more so than Denmark which gives the vote to such categories as non-resident citizens such as students and people abroad for health reasons.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the only country which does not allow its emigrants to vote in the European Parliament elections. Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal allow <Col N="1061" /> their emigrants to vote by post.  Denmark, Greece and Italy allow their emigrants to vote through their embassy in the country of residence and the Netherlands and UK allow their emigrants to vote by proxy.  Therefore, we are away behind other European countries in the provision of a voting right to our emigrants.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposal tonight may not satisfy organisations like Glór an Deoraí, the IIRM, the Episcopal Council or the action group for Irish youth in England.  Our proposal is a recognition of the principle of giving the vote to emigrants. By giving three Seanad seats to our emigrants they could have a permanent voice in the Oireachtas so that they could air their views and highlight their problems.  We could have a seat for England, one for mainland Europe and one for the US.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that it is still not too late to establish a special commission or a special interparliamentary committee to examine the principle and to face up to some of the problems introduced as obstacles to this Bill by speakers on the other side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Constitution promises to cherish the children of the nation equally. That is not the case and has never been the case.</P>
      <P>I noted that during the recent Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis they purported to be the party of change to meet the changing structures of the nineties and to make way for a modern Ireland in the next century.  I know there are pragmatic people on the Government benches, including members of the Progressive Democrats.  There is no reason that pragmatism cannot be brought to bear on this problem in the context of the change the party purport to have gone through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I examined the Bill in some detail and the net point is whether we, as elected legislators, agree that those who leave the country or are forced to leave should have the right to vote in elections here. There are aspects of the Bill proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan which would cause <Col N="1062" /> administrative difficulties.  I am not sure whether this Bill resulted from a Labour Party internal discussion during which Deputy Spring as Leader might have said &ldquo;what should we produce that might be topical in the context of the local elections?&rdquo; In other words, this is a vote catching Bill.  It is a long ball on the backline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support it, although there are administrative difficulties in it.  I do not want to see the Minister, Deputy Flynn, flying over Alice Springs in the Government jet where he has other Deputies canvassing for support all over the world.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that. For 50 years Fianna Fáil have allowed people in the hidden Ireland to emigrate. They even had them trained to the extent that they departed railway stations all over the country and threw their caps in the air and shouted &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo;.  Now the Minister, Deputy Flynn, in his pragmatism and in his authority as Minister for the Environment is entitled to say on behalf of the Government that they accept the Second Stage of this Bill.  Why not accept it and form an all-party committee on the lines proposed by Deputy Spring and Deputy O'Sullivan and examine all the systems in operation in other countries in Europe and elsewhere, call in any specialists necessary and come back in 18 months or two years with an agreed formula, an agreed trial system where those who have left or have been forced to leave will have the right to vote here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the lady with the perfect Connemara accent who talks on the television about Máire thall i San Francisco be able to ring her up and say: &ldquo;Tá súil agam go ngabhfaidh tú amach agus go dtabharfaidh tú do vóta do Fhine Gael&rdquo; nó rud éigin mar sin.  I hope that happens.  In <Col N="1063" /> the context of the rebuilding of Kuwait, American firms are ringing skilled foremen and skilled workers who were forced to leave this country to learn their trade. They are now being offered any wage they like to take on major contracts in Kuwait.  It is a pity that when these emigrants return here they will be taxed on their money instead of being allowed to bring it in for business purposes which would benefit our economy.</P>
    <P>Prior to the 1987 election I met an elderly voter outside a rural polling station who told me that he had voted for something like 50 years and that he was a supporter of Fianna Fáil.  As he was telling me this, a young person passed and I asked him if he was going to vote and he replied &ldquo;To hell with that crowd&rdquo;. If young people are central to the democratic system it is imperative that the Government of the day see to it that they become part of the system and that they will be able to vote here even when they are forced to leave, or leave for experience, or better jobs or because of lack of economic progress at home.  They should have the right inherent in the principle of this Labour Party Bill.  There should be some system where such people can exercise the democratic right they are supposed to have under a Constitution which is supposed to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  Are they the children of the nation only when they are at home?</P>
    <P>Emigration today is different to what it was in the fifties.  No longer does one see the signs &ldquo;No Irish, no Blacks, no dogs&rdquo; but in Cricklewood, Kilburn and so on, one sees umpteen young people queueing for work with sub-contractors. Many of them are going to building sites without any experience and without public liability insurance cover, with all the inherent dangers involved.  We owe it to these people to give them the right to cast a vote here.  If the Government accept the Second Stage of this Bill it will be possible to form an all-party committee. The Fine Gael Party proposed in Deputy McGinley's Bill a system whereby three elected Senators from the emigrant constituencies would be <Col N="1064" /> returned to the Seanad with a distinct and unequivocal voice for emigrants.  That would do away with many difficulties that might arise in terms of people getting here for voting purposes, in terms of keeping a Government alive in crucial votes, and so on.  If Fianna Fáil are big enough, open enough and generous enough, they should in their pragmatism, in their drive towards the nineties, in their drive towards the next century&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no intention of joining you.  They should say in the words of the President &ldquo;Come dance with me in Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Come vote with us in Ireland&rdquo;.  The Minister should give them that chance and we will see how they like him for having sent them away.  The Minister in his pragmatism should be open enough and generous enough to accept the Second Stage of the Bill and allow an all party committee to be set up to deal with the intricacies and complexities the Minister has pointed out.  If that happens it would be for the good of everybody and for the country.  In that context I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment said that this Bill at best purports to deal with the issue of principle, that all the essential arrangements had been ignored, that the implications of the arrangement were ignored and that on a matter as serious as this we cannot divorce a principle from the practicalities. We should talk about the practicalities of the Bill and not about the horrors of emigration about which we all know.  The Minister listed a range of issues which have been addressed in considering this or any proposal to extend voting rights to persons permanently resident outside the State.  The Minister invited supporters of the Bill to spell out exactly how these issues will be dealt with.  The questions asked by the Minister included the numbers involved, what cut off point, if any, could be safely adopted, what is the real attitude of immigrants <Col N="1065" /> particularly those in the UK who already possess the right to vote in British elections, the one man one vote issue in relation to immigrants in Britain, the question of taxation and representation, the constitutional question and, particularly, equal treatment for different categories of citizens.  The implications for our particular and rather unique electoral system are great.</P>
      <P>Let us take, for instance, an area of Boston with, say, 100 voters who would be voting for people all over Ireland. What would we do if it was proved that something had gone wrong at the polling station?  With the PR system a couple of votes can change the outcome of an election and we would have no control over the system in such areas?  The question of the administrative arrangements, having regard to the short timescale which applies in the case of Dáil elections, also needs to be addressed.  If the Government were to fall today there would be an election within three weeks. How would we get around that problem? The integrity of elections must be preserved and of how any abuse which might arise abroad could be prevented and remedied must also be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are serious questions on which there should be informed and constructive debate but, unfortunately, the Opposition have come up with no answers.  There has been much talk about the great arrangements other EC countries have made to allow their emigrants to vote but we are indebted to Deputy Browne for putting the facts on the record.  It is clear that the arrangements they have made are neither marvellous nor widespread despite what has been said on the other side of the House. Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece and Italy have made no arrangements to allow their citizens abroad to vote in parliamentary elections.  The arrangements made by Germany cater for 0.07 per cent of the total electorate; while the figure stands at 1 per cent in Luxembourg; 0.2 per cent in the Netherlands; 2 per cent in Portugal; 0.5 per cent in Spain, and 0.03 per cent in the United <Col N="1066" /> Kingdom.  In contrasting the arrangements proposed in the Bill would cater for 10 per cent of the electorate in our case.  It is interesting to note that if we were to combine the figures for benefit under the arrangements made by all other EC countries, the total number involved would not be significantly higher than the number who would be catered for under the arrangements proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the attitude of the Fine Gael Party to this Bill.  Some of their speakers have made a convincing and comprehensive case against acceptance of the Bill.  Clearly, they regard it as impractical, flawed and unworkable. They themselves have proposed that we adopt a different approach, yet they propose to support the Bill.  This is yet another great example of Fine Gael trying to have it both ways.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been accused of misrepresenting the position of the Federation of Irish Societies on the matter of votes for our emigrants.  We have been told that they did not reject <Col N="1067" /> such a proposal at their conference in 1989 but rather deferred discussion on the matter.  However, a report of the meeting indicates that the motion was defeated.  Semantics apart, no matter what way one looks at it, it does not denote a burning ambition for voting rights for our people abroad.  It should be noted that it is the emigrants themselves, and not the Minister, who have expressed apprehension about this proposal.</P>
      <P>In conclusion it is clear that the Labour Party did not do their homework on the Bill and, as it stands, it is little more than a declaration of principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Spring and the House for affording me this opportunity to comment on the Bill. I am sure Deputy Stafford is correct when he says that the number of emigrants who would be entitled to vote on foot of this Bill would represent about 10 per cent of the total electorate.  Indeed, that may even be an understatement.  I think the point he was trying to make in comparing this percentage with the figures in other countries was that the matter is much easier to control when numbers are small. I accept that but is this not an indication of the bankruptcy of thought among his party who have been in Government for the bulk of the last 70 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;during which time a <Col N="1068" /> huge percentage of our people have been forced to emigrate?  However all other parties in the House, with the exception of one, have contributed to this problem as they formed part of Governments who were unable to stem the flow of emigration.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I support the Bill which may need to be amended.  The figure of 15 years is a little too high and ten years might be more appropriate. Having listened to the Minister's response I must say that I found it most inadequate.  He offered every conceivable excuse for not accepting the Bill. Indeed, the Government have a long history of rejecting Private Members' Bills. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill has still not reached this House even though the Fine Gael Bill was rejected in December 1989.  The same will probably happen in this case despite the Minister's promise to do something.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonably good Bill and deserves the support of the House.  It can always be amended on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to conclude this debate.  It would appear from the numbers in the House that this Bill will be defeated when we go through the lobbies in some ten or 12 minutes time but I believe that it is only a matter of time before the House reconsiders the question of voting rights for our emigrants.  I have no doubt whether it is brought in by the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil that on the next occasion there will be a decision to grant voting rights to our emigrants.  I am very confident of this and wish to compliment my colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, for the work he has done in preparing the legislation and for bringing it before the House.  I believe that in due course he will be recognised as the man who pioneered the cause of voting rights for our emigrants.  Despite the inevitable defeat tonight for this Bill I am convinced &mdash; it may well not be the present Minister for the Environment or the Taoiseach who will be responsible &mdash; that the tide <Col N="1069" /> is now unstoppable in relation to the granting of voting rights to our emigrants.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the contribution of the Minister for the Environment to this Bill was disappointing and insensitive to the rights of Irish people living abroad.  The Minister will be remembered by our emigrants as the person who was not even prepared to look at the question of voting rights for them.  Not only were Members of this House disappointed but the many Irish communities in London, Birmingham and in the United States were just as disappointed with the attitude he took to this Bill last Tuesday night week. They had looked for some signal &mdash; if we are to believe what the Taoiseach had to say over the weekend &mdash; that the Fianna Fáil Party were prepared to look at the question of modernising our social structures. I would suggest that we start with the people who have emigrated, most of whom have left through no choice of their own.  Unfortunately, there is no good news for them in this debate tonight other than the fact that the debate has now begun in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>I hope this matter will be before the House again in the not too distant future and that there will be a majority on that occasion in favour of granting voting rights to our citizens abroad.  Many Fianna Fáil Members are themselves returned emigrants and while they were obviously whipped into line, many of them would love to support this Bill tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment stated in his contribution that the cause of involuntary emigration was the lack of job opportunities in this country.  We would all agree.  He stated that the only solution to involuntary emigration lay in the pursuit of vigorous policies which would turn the economy around and thus remove the root cause.  Obviously we accept that.  The Minister, however, will have to accept that no improvement has taken place in the quality of life or in national confidence since 1987 and the rate of emigration has been increasing substantially.  There has also been a drastic rise in the number of unemployed.  It must be accepted that the problem of <Col N="1070" /> emigration will remain for the foreseeable future at the rate of about 15,000 people per annum.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party tried in this Bill to address in a serious manner an issue which is of concern to emigrant groups in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in their Programme for Government committed themselves to examining the feasibility of granting voting rights to recent emigrants.  The Minister for the Environment in his speech last Tuesday stated that the Programme for Government indicated that the feasibility of granting voting rights to recent emigrants would be examined and that this has been done.  This evening the Minister for Energy said that a detailed Government study of the feasibility of according rights has not yet been concluded and, therefore, it has not yet been possible for the Government collectively to consider all of the issues involved.</P>

      <P>Let us not get any more confused.  I will have to ask the Taoiseach at the earliest opportunity to put the record straight on behalf of the Government and to tell us if the study has been completed and what is happening.  Considering the week the Government have had, perhaps we are expecting too much in seeking clarity on matters like this. The Minister for Energy, speaking on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, seemed in 90 per cent of his speech to support the principle of this Bill but because of obvious constraints within Government, his party cannot support it. I would ask some Government spokesperson to clarify at an early opportunity what exactly has been happening since this commitment.  I assume the commitment was freely entered into by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats, although I have the distinct impression that the Progressive Democrats were a little more serious about the contents of the Programme for Government than Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> The Minister for the Environment felt that the Government were already helping emigrants in a practical manner by funding in Britain and the United States. Tremendous work is being done by the DÍON committee and others.  It is ironic that when Deputy Ruairí Quinn, then Minister for Labour, proposed in the mid-eighties supporting our emigrants, the Fianna Fáil Party derided the idea on the basis that it would be paying people to leave this country and was totally unnecessary.  It has turned out to be one of the more imaginative and well thought out schemes by any Government and that support is much appreciated by emigrants. They would like more than the £500,000 which is being given.  This House would support any increase in the allocation to the DÍON committee to assist in their tremendous work.  That work is not getting any easier.</P>
    <P>On a visit to London last October with the then President elect, Mrs. Robinson, we visited some of the centres and the accommodation in which some of our young emigrants are living.  People would be appalled at the lack of facilities and the sub-human conditions in which these people are living in North London and elsewhere.  All of us should be embarrassed at the condition of the squats where these people are living.  In some cases they are considered to be the lucky ones; others do not have a roof over their heads in that country.  If increased funding can be provided, this should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister also claimed that there was no great lobby among emigrant organisations to extend the voting system.  That is not the message which members of my party have received.  I would ask the Minister to reflect on this matter when he makes contact with emigrant groups.  They see it as a way of staying in touch with this country.  The Minister mentioned the old adage &ldquo;no taxation without representation&rdquo;.  I am surprised that a Minister from the west should ignore the fact that so much unsolicited money has been sent back there by emigrants over the past 50 or 60 years. <Col N="1072" /> This fact should be recognised by the Minister.  He should also recognise that emigration has been a safety net in relation to the Government's failures.</P>
    <P>The question of numbers has been used by the Minister as a defence against the introduction of this legislation.  That is a matter which can be overcome.  Many countries are able to organise voting abroad and I do not see why the Minister and his able officials should not be able to introduce a suitable system.</P>
    <P>The Minister also believes that PR is not suitable as a voting system for our emigrants.  His comments were insulting to the intellect of our emigrants, especially the comment that the lower preference votes are unlikely to be cast with the same consideration and care.  Ironically the Minister forgets that all the emigrants who have left Ireland since 1986 are still included in the 1986 census figures on which the recent Dáil constituency revision is based.  If the revision had taken account of the scale of emigration in that time there would be six fewer seats in this House.  The Minister's arguments fails completely.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party regret the Minister's attitude and his dismissal of the basic right of the citizen.  The Government have lost a unique opportunity to do something constructive and worthwhile for thousands of our citizens who have been forced to live outside this country through no fault of their own.  The Government will regret the loss of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>In bringing this Bill before the Dáil the Labour Party decided to take a constructive and courageous step with regard to our emigrants living abroad.  Emigration, especially the forced emigration which has been a feature of Irish economic and social life for the last few years, is an uprooting and alienating process. Many of our emigrants end up stateless people unable to vote in the country of which they are citizens, and unable to vote in the country in which they are resident.  We in the Labour Party see no reason Irish citizens should be deprived of one of the most basic rights of any <Col N="1073" /> citizen simply because they have been forced to live abroad.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the few remaining countries in the European Community which disenfranchises its emigrants.  If the Government accept our Bill, this will bring Ireland into line with our EC partners who have provided voting rights for their emigrants in some or all of their elections.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies are familiar with the principal features of this Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Party are missing a glorious opportunity to correct a weakness in our voting system in relation to citizens who have been forced to emigrate.  We have been <Col N="1074" /> alerted to the possibility of a constitutional challenge.  I do not believe we should be intimidated.  We are legislators with the right to legislate.  I believe that many Fianna Fáil people who spoke against the Bill support the principle in it and most of their constituents would support that principle.  The Minister for the Environment will regret this rejection which he is leading on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  It is a sad day for our emigrants but at least we can tell them that their battle is being fought in the Irish Parliament.  I believe it will be won in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Private Members' time we were debating the necessity for this amendment.  The Minister of State questioned Deputy Sherlock's tabling this amendment.  I would remind the Minister that it was on the insistence of Deputies Kavanagh and Sherlock that the Minister put in an amendment to section 2 which gives the Minister statutory obligation to acquire this special share.  In the meantime the Minister had to get an opinion from the Attorney General on whether it was necessary to amend section 4, as Deputy Sherlock is proposing.  There should, therefore, be no dispute about the legitimacy of accepting this amendment or any question of Deputy O'Keeffe rubbishing the idea of it being necessary.  The implication seems to be that we pass this Bill immediately because the Stock Exchange are waiting out there for all sorts of great things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in my constituency there is little interest in the Sugar Company following the Government's decision to close the sugar factory in Thurles.  My constituents have given up hope in Fianna Fáil's commitment to the concept of the public service developing the sugar industry or any of the allied agricultural/food industries.  The Government have managed to get through this House so far the principle of the privatisation of what was a very successful and efficient semi-State body which protected the sugar industry.  After long debate it was agreed that this special provision, which was agreed in principle and is in the memorandum and articles of association, would be written into the legislation and that the Minister would <Col N="1077" /> have this golden share to protect not just the sugar industry but the whole concept of the sugar quota.  Having achieved consensus on that we now want to ensure that the Minister cannot legally dispose of this share.  We are delighted that the Minister has this share.  It is the only redeeming feature in the privatisation of the Sugar Company.  Having given the Minister the opportunity to acquire this share we want to make sure that legally he cannot dispose of it.  The Minister wants us to accept the section giving him legal power to sell that special share again.  The Attorney General may well have advised the Minister that that is not in accordance with the provisions of section 2.  If the Minister is to honour his commitment with regard to the special share he should accept this reasonable amendment of Deputy Sherlock which will mean he cannot dispose of that share on behalf of the nation, something we almost had to force the Minister to put into law to ensure he could acquire it.</P>
    <P>This is the only redeeming section of the Bill that will have any credibility with the Houses of the Oireachtas, the public whom we represent, the trade union movement and with Congress, indeed with the social partners.  They have insisted that we retain some legal obligation on behalf of the State to protect our quota, something for which we fought dearly in our negotiations for accession to the European Community in 1973.  It is a very special privilege but does not protect us from competition.  As has been said correctly, we have been subjected to extensive competition over the years.</P>

I understand the advice given the Minister is not in line with this amendment which is a reasonable one to ensure that of all the privileges the Minister will have, this golden share on behalf of the <Col N="1078" /> State will be retained and cannot be disposed of except by legislation.  Certainly the wording of section 4 (2) as it stands could be interpreted by anybody as giving the Minister power to dispose of that share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, when answering for the Minister earlier the Minister of State said that, as the Minister had agreed last evening, he would consult with the Attorney General.  I am surprised my colleague from Cork has not read out what the Attorney General recommended.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 1b. merely refers to the special share which the Minister, in his amendment, had inserted in section 2.  If it is lawful for the Minister to insert an amendment in section 2 to provide for the special share then why is it not agreeable to accept in section 4 (2) the words:</P>
      <P>The following provisions shall apply and have effect in respect of all shares of the Holding Company, other than the special share, which are for the time being standing in the name of a nominee for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food...</P>
      <P>That is a reasonable proposal.</P>
      <P>We are merely seeking to strengthen the Bill as much as possible in the interests of the State, growers, hauliers and workers.  Throughout this debate there appears a great urgency on the part of the Minister and on behalf of the Government, to have this Bill passed as quickly as possible without there being embodied therein conditions such as the proviso that the Minister would not dispose of the special share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a further remark when replying to which it would be more appropriate to refer on my next <Col N="1079" /> amendment.  The case has been well advanced that if the special share is to play the meaningful role purported then there is no good reason it should not be inserted by way of amendment of section 4 (2).</P>
    <P>I will be pressing my amendment.  I must repeat how important it is since we are within perhaps one and a half hours of privatising the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> We have no control over the memorandum and articles of assocation of the holding company.  We have control only over, and will be answerable for, the legislation we enact here.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider accepting my amendment, to come some way to meeting our demands, those of the workers and all concerned on this important issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1c:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 12 to 15.</P>
      <P>On a previous amendment we discussed the inclusion of a provision which would ensure that the Minister could not dispose of his special share in the company.  Section 4 (2) provides that:</P>
      <P>(a)  it shall be lawful&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food to transfer all or any of the said shares to another person selected by the Minister concerned to hold as his nominee the shares transferred;</P>
      <P>Section 4 (2) (a) (ii), which is the most contentious provision, provides that it shall be lawful:</P>
      <P>(ii)  for the Minister to direct a nominee to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares of the Holding Company for the time being vested in him as such nominee;</P>
      <P>When he was replying, the Minister of State said that the reference to the Minister was just a technical point.  We do not want any loopholes in the Bill due to our failure to deal with technical points. As section 4 (2) (a) (i) provides that it shall be lawful for the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture and Food to transfer all or any of the said shares to another person selected by the Minister concerned to hold as his nominee the shares so transferred, it is imperative that we strengthen the legislation by deleting section 4 (2) (a) (ii).</P>
      <P>I do not want to be presumptuous but if the legislation is challenged in the future there are loopholes in it which could be exploited.  We want to enact watertight legislation.  The majority of the shares in the company &mdash; 55 per cent &mdash; will be held by private interests.  I have every reason to believe that these shares will be an attractive proposition for investors. This could give rise to the possibility of further shares being disposed of in the future, meaning that the State would lose control of the company.</P>

      <P>This amendment is not acceptable as it would take away the power of the Minister for Finance to direct his nominee to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares of the holding company.  This is a flexibility which the Minister for Finance wishes to retain.  The Minister for Finance has given an undertaking in his prospectus that he will not dispose of further shares for at least two years.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's statement that my amendment would take away the power of the Minister for Finance to dispose of all the shares in the company only strengthens my argument. We want to enact legislation which will <Col N="1083" /> ensure that there will be as much State involvement as possible in this company. We are talking about important issues such as our sugar quota and the jobs of workers in the sugar industry, the food industry and the other subsidiary industries we have spoken about.  The Minister may at some time in the future have to seek the Attorney General's advice on the issues referred to in our amendments. He made no case for not accepting my amendment which proposes the deletion of section 2 (4) (a) (ii).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1d:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1)  The Holding Company shall reserve three positions of the non-Executive Directorship on the Board of Directors for the purpose of the election of employees to fill the reserved positions.  The aforesaid election shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures specified in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>(2)  The election shall be by secret ballot and shall be conducted in the manner which applied heretofore within Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. and in accordance with the terms of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, as amended, save as herein provided.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is different from the amendment I put down on Committee Stage.  We were all delighted when legislation was enacted some years ago which gave workers the right to sit on the boards of semi-State bodies.  I do not know how <Col N="1084" /> many members are entitled to sit on such boards but they have been very effective. Have the worker directors on the board of the Irish Sugar Company done any harm?  They have not.  They did a lot of good work in their dealings with the board, the supreme governing body, management and the workforce at local level.  This is what is meant by worker participation.  For far too long workers on the factory floor were denied such representation.  Clearly they will ask the question: did their contribution mean anything to the employers?</P>
    <P>The election of worker directors to the boards of companies meant that workers had an immediate platform through which they could make their case.  They felt that whatever proposals, sometimes very good proposals, and new ideas they had for the company would be taken on board.  That certainly has been the experience of worker directors.  Why then should it not be acceptable to have worker directors on the board of the new holding company?</P>
    <P>We should remember that what we are talking about is floating the shares of the Irish Sugar Company on the stock market, and that the majority shareholding be held by private enterprise. That certainly is the bottom line on this question.  It is very desirable that the democratic rights of workers to be elected to the board be provided for in the legislation.  Unless that is done we might as well throw our hat at it.  Once this legislation is enacted there will be no structure for participation by workers.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company were a great example of this because even at local level there were many committees that were active and played a meaningful role in the interests of workers.  That is very much part of the whole structure and I am sure that was the motive behind the introduction of such legislation in the first instance.  There was a need for it and when it was seen to be effective it was extended to other companies.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment.  We <Col N="1085" /> thought out this matter and are proposing that there be three worker directors in the company.  The factories in Carlow and Mallow are the mainstay of the company.  There is the food division in Thurles and other subsidiaries which are linked with the main company.  There is also the staff association, whether it be at national level or in the different divisions, and consideration should be given to whether the staff association are also entitled to representation.  This is why in the amendment we seek to reserve three positions on the non-executive directorship, and that is quite reasonable.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to be afraid to be flexible.  There should be no fear that if worker director participation is introduced in this legislation prospective investors will shy away.  Why should they? The new concept is to have more involvement by workers.  After all they are the people on whom the employer must rely. The present management of the Sugar Company will say they have had the benefit of that concept.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.  It would at least go some way towards reassuring the workers, and others, that they will have a say at board level.  The Minister should reserve at least three positions on the board for worker directors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We proposed that there be four worker directors on the board and that there be two worker directors. Fine Gael proposed that there be one, and I have to give Deputy Sherlock every credit for now proposing that there be three.  In the absence of the Minister I am sure his instructions to the two Ministers of State were very clear, that they must not stray one line, one syllable or one comma from what has been agreed already.  Therefore, it is more in hope than expectation that I rise to support the proposal that there be three worker directors in this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless this gives me the opportunity to say that I was proud to be a <Col N="1086" /> member of a party in a Government that introduced the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  That was one of the greatest movements in the Dáil towards worker democracy and it saddens me to see it being reversed to some extent in this Bill.  In the course of the next year or so there will be other Bills which will privatise semi-State companies on whose boards worker directors have been consistent in their high performance. The only companies that will come before us for privatisation are those measured by profit rather than by loss, irrespective of the social improvements and social commitments in other companies that may not make profits, companies such as Bord na Móna or CIE.</P>
    <P>There has been no move to introduce a Bill such as this to privatise B &amp; I.  They are being sold off like something that is worn out and sent to the scrap yard.  They do not rate getting into the auction as is happening with this company.  Instead of having more worker directors in the future there will be fewer under the Government.  No attempt has been made by the Department of Labour to encourage worker directors at any level in private enterprise.  That was one of the matters considered in 1983, 1984 and later, but that idea seems to have died. The idea of a worker director on the board of a private company seems now to spell disaster for that company as far as stocks and shares are concerned.  One of the reasons Deputy Sherlock's and my amendments, as well as an earlier amendment from Deputy Sherlock, are not acceptable is simply that flotation of this company will not allow shares to be retained by worker directors or members of trade unions.  That will not happen under this Bill.  It is very sad that even at this stage not one concession of significance is being given to the workers in this company.  In a last desperate stand, we support this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is an extraordinarily important Bill when one looks at it from <Col N="1087" /> the economic or the political angle.  Ideologically there are major divisions in this House between the parties of the left, the parties of the centre and the parties of the right, and that is as politics should be.  What annoys me very intensely is that the Minister is not in the House for the concluding Stages of this debate.  As I have said, this is very important legislation. It is a watershed in that this is the first time a State company are being passed into private ownership.  As everybody in the House knows I have no inhibitions about the use of the word privatised.  The Minister is fudging and fiddling with the words &ldquo;semi-private&rdquo; and all sorts of terminology but the word should be &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;.  This is a major issue and a major break.</P>
      <P>There is only one reason for excusing the Minister for not attending the House, that is, if he was in Europe negotiating a price package or involved in the reform of CAP or the GATT negotiations.  I have seen the Minister walk in here every 20 minutes or so to vote, so he is in the precincts of the House.  He should be here now because it is a massively important Bill and I do not think any Member of the Opposition parties should be ignored to this extent.  Their points of view are valid even if the Minister does not agree with them.  Because of the importance of this legislation the Minister should be here to answer questions. If he cannot accede to the requests of Deputies he should at least explain why. I do not mean to offend the Ministers of State, Deputy Walsh or Deputy Kirk, they are two fine people, but I am sure they take the point.  It is gross discourtesy which should not be tolerated.  I should like to have my remarks conveyed to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will conclude in an hour.  I asked a simple question today to which I did not get a reply.  I asked how the board which will take over &mdash; if this Bill is passed &mdash; will be constituted.  From whom will those people be chosen?  I did not get an <Col N="1088" /> answer.  I wanted to know if the present board will continue for a certain fixed period, will some of the present board continue for a period or will additional people be nominated to the board by the Minister.  It is a very simple question and we are entitled to the answer.  I do not want to see a crowd of political hacks running the company for an initial period of one year or more.  I should like the Minister to come in here to tell us who will run the company until such time as the shareholders have an AGM and democratically decide who they would like to run it.  In the interim it obviously has to be people who will be nominated by the Government, most likely by the Minister.  Will the Ministers of State ask the Minister to come in here to try to answer that simple question?  It is shockingly discourteous of the Minister not to be here for the concluding Stages of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I listened very carefully to Deputy Deasy and, while I do not want to take away from the important points he made, I am most disappointed that he did not address the amendment, which is not about the total constitution of the board of directors, but about whether there should be worker directors on the board of this company.  That is what we are talking about and it is a very important matter.</P>
      <P>We know, from Committee Stage of the Bill, that Deputy Deasy put down an amendment suggesting one worker director; Deputy Kavanagh proposed two worker directors and Deputy Sherlock proposed four.  I assume that, as Deputy Deasy will not get another opportunity to speak on this amendment, he will support it because he clearly supports the principle of worker directors on the boards of quoted companies, privately owned companies, which is a very good thing.  It might represent a breakthrough in the way we do things in regard to companies; it is a very progressive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The massive Companies Bill went <Col N="1089" /> through the Dáil recently but it did not redress a major problem which arises in all company legislation; even though the Bill was very long there was nothing in it to protect the rights of the workers. Company law is totally geared to protecting the rights of the shareholders but there is nothing about protecting the rights of the workers or indeed the consumers &mdash; this is a great defect in our company law &mdash; nor are there provisions in our company law for the appointment of worker directors to large privately or publicly owned companies, their size is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>We now have an opportunity for the State to have the right to call the shots. This was a State company which it is now proposed to privatise.  This is a unique opportunity for the State to set down the parameters of the type of company which it would like to have and which could be a model for all large, privately owned companies.  There is a terribly important principle here.  Perhaps the Minister could compromise and allow for two worker directors.  Let us have a little give in this regard; I am sure Deputy Sherlock would be quite happy with two worker directors.  I know Deputy Kavanagh would be happy with two and I am sure the same applies to Deputy Deasy.  I would also be happy, we would all be happy, except the Government Party. Will the Minister give serious consideration to accepting this amendment with the possible exception of putting in &ldquo;two&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;three&rdquo; worker directors?</P>

      <P>The Irish Sugar Company will have worker directors as we have seen in NET.  The holding company will be a private one on the stock market. There was a lot of exaggerated comment about what I said about the Stock Exchange this evening by Deputy Ferris. The stock market gives the public the right to participate and is an even-handed way of making an investment.  Every citizen has the right to purchase shares in the company because they will be on offer to the public.  It is the fairest and most even-handed way of giving our citizens the right to invest in that very successful company which will be more successful in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The workers are being granted something in the region of 4 per cent of the equity.  They have also got a further concession, I will quote from the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of last week in that regard:</P>
      <P>The company's employee offer includes the free share offer of £250 in addition to discounted shares at 20 per cent of the offer price, at a rate of one share per £9 of pensionable earnings on April 5, 1990 or a maximum number of 500 shares.  Employees will also be able to benefit from a 10 per cent interest rate finance scheme to purchase the shares, payable over 10 years.  Employees will also have an option to purchase excess shares allocated to employees but not taken up, but employees will have to finance these shares independently.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I would like to refer to the remuneration of directors which is very relevant.  I am convinced that directors of companies are not properly remunerated for the time they give.  We are looking for the best in a highly technological world where big finance is involved.  I have sat on the boards of companies when Deputy Sherlock was a trade union representative on the other side.  Directors are not properly remunerated and many semi-State boards have failed for that reason.  The job of a company director is very difficult especially in the context of the new Companies Act. Major responsibility falls on the shoulders of directors today.  They can be responsible and liable for decisions they may not understand fully.  They have to have their briefs properly compiled and they should be properly compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to see a good mix of directors on this new board, and I have no doubt that will be so &mdash; business people, people who have an interest in the workforce, people in the financial world and people from the company management.  In recent years there has been a new scene &mdash; chief executives and executive chairmen on the boards.  I hope this is a change <Col N="1092" /> for the better.  Quite a wide selection of people are capable and competent to serve on the board of any company in the private and semi-State sectors.  In recent times this Government have taken an initiative in appointing many of those very successful business people to the boards of semi-State companies.  It is the right of the shareholders at the annual general meeting to nominate directors to a private company.  That has been the precedent under company law.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Members on the other side not to push this amendment or to exaggerate as they are doing.  I have no fear for the workforce of the Sugar Company in the new situation.  The right is there to purchase the shares on the stock market and every citizen, worker and grower can do that and I hope they will take up their allocation.  In the past, allocations have been on offer to workers and farmers but have not been taken up. I have no problem with this amendment and I have no doubt that my Minister is in full agreement with what I am saying, and has as much sympathy for the workers as Deputies on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see Deputy Deasy's contribution had the desired result of enticing the Minister <Col N="1093" /> back into the House.  During the Minister's very entertaining contributions in the past two days I was interested to hear him berate Deputy Sherlock for allegedly in some way being at odds with the trade union movement.  I was also interested to hear the Minister representing himself as being hand in glove with the trade union movement and a friend of the worker.  His position on this amendment does not appear to square with that.</P>
      <P>The principle of worker participation has been established in this State for quite some time.  Employees in the Sugar Company have had the right to elect directors for the past 13 years.  There has been a great deal of talk at Government level about extending the worker participation idea in the public sector and tentative suggestions of it being extended into the private sector.  Many years ago the Irish Productivity Centre were commissioned to produce ideas on how the principle of worker participation could be extended into the private sector.  Here, as Deputy Deasy correctly identified, we have legislation to privatise the Sugar Company and part and parcel of that legislation is effectively to abolish the right that employees had to a say on the board who make the decisions that affect them.</P>
      <P>I am curious as to how the Minister is going to square this with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has been vaunted and greatly praised in this House when it was debated here a short time ago.  On pages 84 and 85 of that document are very interesting comments on the principle of worker participation. I quote:</P>
      <P>Employee participation is of benefit to both the enterprise and its employees.</P>
      <P>Indeed it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main ingredient in the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been the co-operative and partnership approach of the participating bodies.  It is important that this social <Col N="1094" /> consensus at national level is translated into industrial relations practices and procedures at company level.</P>
    <P>There is no sign of this social consensus in this legislation or of any attempt at social consensus on the board of this new holding company.  The programme goes on to talk about worker participation legislation being extended to the rest of the public sector and even about discussions having been held between Congress and the FIE under the Employer-Labour Conference on the question of the development of worker participation in the private sector and anticipates a joint declaration on employee involvement in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Many companies in the private sector have already taken on board the idea of employees' involvement on their boards of directors and in many other respects. I suggest that the Government's position on this matter is out of step both with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and with good practice in the private sector.  Here was an opportunity for the Government to legislate for worker participation in what will now become the privatised Sugar Company. There would have been nothing wrong with that.  It would have been extending rights which workers have already enjoyed.</P>
    <P>If workers in this company are to be denied the right to elect directors on to the board of the holding company, I would like the Minister to square that with section 6 of the Bill before us which provides that: &ldquo;Every person who immediately before the transfer date was an employee of the Company, shall, on the transfer date, enjoy the same rights...&rdquo; as had previously been enjoyed.  Have workers not the right to vote in worker director elections, to elect directors on to the board who make the effective decisions? There rights have been enjoyed by workers since 1978 and it appears these rights are now to be set aside.  The Minister expressed himself as a defender of the <Col N="1095" /> rights of workers and made great play of it in this House.  What is this fear of allowing workers on to the board of directors? It is a principle long established which has worked very well.  Some of the best private sector companies are beginning to take the idea on board.  I cannot see where the difficulty is.</P>

I would not have been a Member of the Oireachtas for 26 years without the support, which I greatly appreciate, of the workers in my constituency.  I still enjoy their support which I appreciate perhaps more than that from any other sector, with the possible exception of the small farmers in the same constituency.  The former leader of the Deputy's party, Deputy Mac Giolla, will probably confirm that the basis of the support I have enjoyed over 26 years is trust, understanding and respect for workers at every level.</P>

      <P>It will continue to exist and worker-directors will still be elected to Siúicre Éireann as they have been up to this moment.  Whether or not people accept that is not an issue for me. My business is to state the facts and I have no trouble in reconciling that fact with the question I was asked, because the workers will enjoy precisely the same rights.</P>
      <P>We have been told that there is inconsistency on the part of the Government who have put together with the social partners the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> following on the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The workers, through their trade union representatives, have made a vital contribution to that programme and to the success we have enjoyed since.  It was not easy to take difficult decisions to prevent the economy getting into further financial difficulties, to control borrowing and reduce Government expenditure.  It was not easy for employers, the Government and trade unionists.  A degree of courage and conviction emerged from the trade union movement; they have been the pivot of what has happened in the development of this economy over the last few years.  I am glad that the partnership which is a feature of what has emerged over the last four years will be reflected in Siúicre Éireann and on the board of the holding company.</P>
      <P>If I appeared impatient during the course of this debate it was because of the implication that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were not adequately representing the interests of the workers, that the agreement they entered into was null and void and not worth the paper it was written on.  That is over now.  I have made my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked about the general composition of the board.  It will be a board based on partnership, a partnership of the interests that have built up this company, and with the confidence to build up a new dynamic in the future, in the markets, competing with the best and <Col N="1097" /> beating the best.  That was not a feature because the company were not trading internationally in the way we would like to see them trading.  Now the opportunity has been given to them to trade internationally. The holding board will be a nine member board.  There will be a chairman, three executives, one representative of the interests of the workers, one representative of the interests of beet growers and three others.  The House will appreciate they will have to be seen to be people of outstanding ability and professional qualification in this competitive international environment.  The board will be based on partnership and that will be the kernel of the programme they will pursue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, not the Minister for Agriculture and Food, will appoint the first board.  The role of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, amongst other things, will be to hold the golden share and protect the assets of the company, particularly the core asset, the quota.  The Minister for Finance and I are satisfied with the arrangements for appointing the board.  We are conscious of the need for a strong and experienced board and of the weight given by investing institutions to a good well balanced board.  In appointing the initial board due account will be taken of the indications given to me.  The correct signals needed to run the company commercially will be given internationally and nationally to institutions and investors, private and otherwise, through the composition of the board.  The board, after their first appointment by the Minister for Finance, will be subject to the normal procedures for re-election and reappointment that apply to any other company.</P>
    <P>The memorandum and articles of association about which some play was made last night, are standard articles of association, the sort that can be drawn at any time from the Companies Office. The only difference relates to the amount of equity which varies from company to <Col N="1098" /> company and matters like that.  The chairman, and the managing director, are the only people who will not be subject to retirement by rotation.  It was suggested that I was trying to conceal from the House the memorandum and articles of association.  I did nothing of the kind.  I pointed out clearly that because the legal framework would not be in place until this Bill was passed into law, the articles of association did not have binding legal effect and that all we have at this point are draft articles of association that have no binding effect.  It has not been the practice to accompany any legislation with something that is not legally binding. I agreed, without reservation, for the information of the House, to make the memorandum and articles of association available in the Library.  Despite that Deputy Sherlock today tried to make some play of the articles of association, but I honestly do not know what he was trying to imply.  The memorandum and articles of association are available for everybody to see and the Deputy had a copy in front of him while trying to imply that we were somehow holding back information which was available by virtue of the arrangement I made in response to requests from the House.  What else could one do?  I hope I have made it clear that nothing has been concealed and that the board will be representative, dynamic and capable of realising their full potential.</P>
    <P>I do not think the management or workers of the Sugar Company or the beet growers wanted to see the pattern of recent years continue given that they found themselves constrained by virtue of the fact that they were totally dependent on the State.  As a result, levels of employment fell in Thurles, Tuam and so on.  Who wanted to see this trend continue? I recall when I first discussed this issue with the unions about two years ago &mdash; and there was a good deal of straight talking &mdash; I asked which would be better for workers to maintain the old structures at the expense of employment or to put a new, dynamic and vigorous structure in <Col N="1099" /> place which could lead to an increase in employment.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of this, the Sugar Company have taken the acquisitions trail &mdash; they have acquired groups such as Odlums and got involved in areas in which I was very anxious to see them long ago.  It is obvious that they have the determination and I hope the board will direct a very dynamic policy and, when we review the progress made five years from now we will be able to report that the situation has changed dramatically and employment has increased rather than decreased which is what has been happening in recent years. I also hope we will be able to report on new developments in new outlets.  That is the reason I am satisfied about the composition of the board although others may not be so satisfied.  I do not know if they came into the House with an open mind but I doubt if they can be satisfied.</P>

It is the holding company which will have the power and they will be able to decide what to do &mdash; to create new subsidiaries or to eliminate existing subsidiaries.  They could also decide to set up a sugar production company to take all the existing powers from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.

      <P>I am coming to it. The reason the Minister has denied that he is privatising the company is that he wants to ensure that there are no worker directors on the board.  He is of the opinion that there should be no worker directors on the board of any privatised company, otherwise no one would invest in the company.  The Minister tried to reject the suggestion that this represents full privatisation by stating that 45 per cent of the equity shares will be retained by the Minister, but it has since transpired that these may all be sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in touch with many of those subsidiary companies and it is clear that they have no say.  It is the board, located at Earlsfort Terrace, who make the decision, at least until the new holding company are established &mdash; I do not know where their headquarters will be located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Deasy raised the constitution of the board the Minister seemed to give the information in bits and pieces.  Why does he not come out and say that they have already decided who will be on the board, having regard to the fact that he has already stated that they will be a good board and that he has the utmost confidence in them?  It should be remembered that the Minister and the Government are denying workers the <Col N="1103" /> right to a seat on the board which they were granted under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister has ignored every plea to strengthen the legislation in the interests of all concerned, I certainly will be pressing this matter to a vote and I hope we will be given the <Col N="1104" /> opportunity to test the Minister.  I do not know if Deputy Kavanagh intends pressing his amendment but I would be very interested to know if the Minister will be prepared to insert the details of the agreement &mdash; which he has relied upon so much &mdash; reached with the unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister this evening.  No doubt the Minister will say that an environmental impact study has been carried out. I would draw his attention to the question I have put, which is, an environmental impact assessment study on the effects on the people of Collins Avenue-Ballymun-Glasnevin areas of Dublin of the Sillogue Interchange.</P>
      <P>This problem has arisen primarily because of a decision by Dublin Corporation last summer to allow Dublin County Council to deal with all matters on behalf of the corporation, relating to the Sillogue Interchange and the Ballymun Road and Mobhi Road feeder. Indeed, the councillors for the area admitted to local community organisations recently that they were unaware of the plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite simply, 99 per cent of the people <Col N="1111" /> living in the Ballymun-Glasnevin and Collins Avenue area did not give county council notices about the interchange a second glance because they knew they were living in the corporation administrative area and assumed that the county council notices had nothing to do with them.  When they realised the situation in November 1990 they contacted a local representative who wrote to the county council complaining that residents had not been consulted.  To date, so far as I am aware, the county council have not responded to that letter.  A total of 80,000 people will be affected by the increased traffic which this interchange will generate on the Ballymun Road, Mobhi Road, and adjacent link roads.</P>
    <P>None of them was consulted by the associations or tenants associations was notified by the county council.  These are the facts and the Minister can raise his eyebrows if he wishes but the county council did not write to any of the residents associations or tenants associations. I would remind the Minister that I am a member of one of the associations and know this for a fact.</P>
    <P>The five schools on the main Ballymun-Mobhi Roads were not consulted.  The junior comprehensive school, the senior comprehensive school, Our Lady of Victories School, Scoil Chaitríona, Scoil an tSeachtar Laoch and the Dublin City University all indicate that they were not contacted by the county council on the impact which this might have on them and on the 8,000 students who use the road on a daily basis going to and from those schools.</P>
    <P>The school principals have expressed amazement in letters written to the Minister and the county council that an impact study could have been completed without consultation.  One of the strange aspects of this is that it appears that an environmental impact study was carried out in March 1990 on a related link road but a question by a city councillor to the Dublin City Manager drew the reply that <Col N="1112" /> no road works were planned for at least five years.  This in turn led to a further sense of complacency by those who have subsequently found themselves to be affected.</P>
    <P>The householders and the school principals are now concerned that on 28 February the Minister published his approval for the interchange and the improvements on the Ballymun-Mobhi Roads to cater for the increased traffic without those living there having been consulted. The only appeal mechanism they now have is to seek a review of the decision by the High Court.  Local people, obviously, do not have the money to take such costly course of action.  The alternative option they have is to make a formal complaint to the European Commission that the Minister and the county council have been negligent with regard to the carrying out of an environmental impact study and that the proposed scheme does not, therefore, qualify for EC funding on which this scheme is dependent.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has an opportunity to redress the wrong done in this case before such action is taken by setting aside his approval and allow time for a proper and comprehensive environmental impact study to be carried out. This would give the people of the area affected an opportunity to make submissions and address their concerns, particularly in relation to the safety of their children going to and from the five schools and Dublin City University.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would refer the Deputy to my statement of 20 February 1991 announcing my decision to approve, with modifications, Dublin County Council's motorway scheme for the proposed northern cross route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The northern cross route is the northern leg of the Dublin Ring Road and is a continuation of the Western Parkway Motorway.  It will run between the N3 Navan Road at Blanchardstown and the N1 Belfast Road at Turnapin.  There are <Col N="1113" /> also ancillary roads including an extension from Turnapin along the line of Turnapin Lane-Belcamp Lane to the Malahide Road, and the re-alignment of the Ballymun Road where it intersects with the proposed motorway.  The new road will be 10.1 kilometres long with a dual two lane facility.</P>
    <P>Interchanges are proposed at four locations &mdash; Navan Road, Ashbourne Road, Ballymun Road and at Turnapin on the new Airport Road.</P>
    <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the proposed interchange of the northern cross route with the Ballymun Road.</P>
    <P>The motorway scheme for the northern cross route was prepared by Dublin County Council acting on their own behalf and on behalf of Dublin Corporation in so far as sections of the proposed scheme lie in the administrative area of the corporation.</P>
    <P>The county council also prepared an environmental impact study for the scheme in accordance with the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Motorways) Regulations of 1988 which give effect to the requirements of the EC Directive on environmental impact assessment in so far as motorways are concerned.</P>
    <P>These regulations require that, before making a motorway scheme under section 4 of the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, a road authority must have regard to the preservation of scenic and natural amenities and must prepare an environmental impact study of the proposed motorway which must identify, describe and assess the direct and indirect environmental effects of the construction of the proposed motorway on human beings, fauna and flora, on soil, water, air, climate and the landscape; on material assets, and on the cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>The regulations lay down the type of information which must be provided in an environmental impact study.  This includes a description of the likely significant effects of the proposed motorway <Col N="1114" /> on the environment, including the data required to identify and assess the main effects and information as to the emission of pollutants and the creation of nuisance; a description of the measures envisaged in order to avoid, reduce and, if possible, remedy significant adverse environmental effects of a proposed motorway: and an outline of the main alternative motorway alignments, if any, studied and an indication of the main reasons for selecting the proposed alignment, taking into account the environmental effects.</P>
    <P>On 2 April 1990, Dublin County Council gave public notice of the making of the motorway scheme.  The notice advised the general public of the availability for inspection of maps, plans and the environmental impact study relating to the scheme.  It also advised the general public of the fact that a public inquiry would be held into all matters relating to the scheme and that the Minister, before approving a scheme, would consider the report of the person who conducted the inquiry and any objections which had been made to him and which had not been withdrawn.  Notice of the motorway scheme and the environmental impact study was sent individually to persons directly affected by the scheme and to prescribed bodies such as the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and An Taisce.</P>
    <P>On 19 June 1990, public notice was given of the holding of a public inquiry into the motorway scheme, including the environmental impact of the proposed motorway, and objections which had been received against its approval.  Persons directly affected by the scheme and those who had lodged objections were notified individually of the arrangement. The inquiry was held over three full days from Tuesday 26 June to Thursday 28 June 1990.  A total of 39 submissions were lodged with me before the inquiry and a further five submissions were made by members of the public at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>After considering the evidence taken <Col N="1115" /> at the public inquiry, the report of the inspector who conducted the inquiry, and the environmental impact study, I approved the motorway scheme, subject to modifications, on 7 February 1991. Public notice of the making of my order was given on 28 February 1991.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy that the situation following the publication of notice of the approval of a motorway scheme is that persons aggrieved may, not later than 21 days after publication of the notice, apply to the High Court questioning the validity of the motorway scheme as confirmed.  In the circumstances, I believe it would be singularly inappropriate for me to comment on specific aspects of the scheme at this time lest in any way it should prove prejudicial to the rights of any person who may wish to challenge the validity of the scheme as confirmed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very serious matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The haemophiliacs affected by the HIV virus rightly believe the Minister is playing a cat and mouse game with them. These people tragically became infected with the HIV virus through blood which had been imported through official channels. Everyone in this House must recognise that these 103 victims have a moral right to compensation and that it would be shameful for the Minister to continue to contest that legal right.  Already 18 of these victims have died and at least the same number will have died before a court case can be concluded.  A legal case could be strung out for years and would cost millions of pounds.  However, more to the point, these people cannot wait. They face death as an imminent possibility at any stage and must be given <Col N="1116" /> compensation now so that they can make the best of their lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that further delays by the Government will rightly be seen as a cynical act.  Not only will it deny these people the right to some comfort during this stressful time but it will significantly reduce the possibility of compensation being awarded to the families of those people who have died.  The Minister must clearly demonstrate to the House that he is not making such a callous calculation as the potential for savings to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister met the Irish Haemophilia Society in December about the possibility of a settlement, five compensatable victims have died.  The Haemophilia Society made a submission in January in good time for the budget outlining how a settlement could be reached, but the budget came and went without any word of a settlement.  The Minister failed to respond to that submission within the expected time.  I believe the Government know there are precedents for the payment of such compensation. They have looked generously on cases like this in the past, particularly the Stardust case which affected people in my constituency.  Settlements were fixed outside the court on that occasion, and this procedure must be repeated in this case.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that there are other defendants and that their insurers should carry some of the costs.  While I agree with that suggestion I want to refer to the facts.  It is almost two years since this claim was initiated and since then the Minister has had plenty of time to work out a share out of costs with the other parties who have been cited as defendants but that has not happened.  All the omens are that it will not be easy to work out such a shared agreement.  Above all, the Minister must not set as a pre-condition for a settlement offer that he has an agreed share out with the others.  If he could sit down tomorrow and reach an agreement with them that would be fine, <Col N="1117" /> but the expectation must be that they will not agree without going to court.  That is the nature of insurance companies and that is the way they look at such matters. The Minister, as the public representative of a caring community in Ireland, must settle this claim now and, if necessary, pursue the other parties for their rightful share.</P>
    <P>The British Tory Government, who are not renowned for either their flexibility or generosity, have cut through the legal maze and offered sums of up to £100,000 per victim.  Our Government should at least do the same and not add to the suffering of these tragic victims.  I believe the Minister has met the victims and has seen how their lives have been blighted by this terrible disease.  I hope he will look positively on these people because an act of generosity of spirit by the Minister is called for now.  I hope he can tell us tonight that that is the direction in which he will move so that he can put an offer on the table within weeks rather than months or years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the tragic position of haemophiliacs who have been infected with HIV.  I am very glad Deputy Bruton has raised this matter on the Adjournment tonight as it gives me the opportunity to inform the House and to put the record straight about the present position regarding recent contacts between the parties involved in the current legal proceedings relating to haemophiliacs infected with HIV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that legal proceedings are under way in relation to this matter and that I, as Minister for Health, am a defendant in the action.  As he will also be aware, there are I think six other defendants in the action.  I wish to place on the record that my statement to the House is being made without prejudice to those proceedings.  I also welcome the opportunity of placing on the record once again, my concern for all the people infected with the HIV virus and my wish <Col N="1118" /> to have the position of the haemophiliacs so infected resolved if possible as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that at no time did the Haemophiliac Society ask to see me about a settlement of their court proceedings. The first I knew of any proposals they had in this regard was on 21 December, 1990 when I read in the media a report about a public meeting which had taken place on the previous day, at which the Irish Haemophiliac Society sought support for a negotiated rather than a legal settlement to the legal case. The society also wrote at this time to representatives of all the political parties in the Dáil seeking their agreement to certain initiatives towards achieving a negotiated settlement.  This was the first time the issue of haemophiliacs infected with HIV was raised at a political level since mid-1989 when the Government provided a sum of £1 million for the relief of suffering and distress for the haemophiliacs and their families.</P>
    <P>On 21 December 1990, my Department contacted the society and informed them that I would be available at any time to meet with them.  As a result of this contact I met the society on 9 January 1991.  At the conclusion of that meeting I invited them to make a written submission to me in relation to the issues which they had raised.  I assured them that such a submission would be treated as a matter of urgency.  Following a number of requests from my Department to the society to expedite the submission, the document was received by me on 22 January 1991.</P>
    <P>I indicated to the society at the meeting on 9 January 1991 that, as there were a number of defendants to the legal proceedings, I would be obliged to consult with them in relation to any possible negotiated settlement of the cases.  On receipt of their submission which I might add, seeks a settlement which is approximately double the <i>pro rata</i> English settlement, I immediately obtained legal <Col N="1119" /> advice and, on the basis of this, it emerged that a number of matters required detailed consideration.  I was not, therefore, in a position to respond to the society by 24 February 1991, the date by which they had asked for a response.  I advised the society of this on 15 February 1991 and assured them that I was taking all possible steps to ensure a speedy response and that I would be in touch with them in the near future.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which emerged as a result of the legal advice obtained by me was the need to obtain the permission of the society to release their submission to the other defendants.  My Department sought this permission but to my surprise the solicitors acting on behalf of the society refused to allow this.  Following discussion and correspondence between the office of the Chief State Solicitor and the society's solicitors, they finally agreed to the circulation of a resume of the submission to the other defendants.  It is worth noting that Deputy Mervyn Taylor is one of the principals in the firm of solicitors acting for the society.  It is sailing very close to a mix between politics and law in this instance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should wait to hear what I have to say.  The society have today instructed Deputy Taylor to allow the circulation of the full submission. If this had been done when originally requested we would be further on in this matter.  I am also concerned that extracts of internal documents on this very sensitive issue, which only passed between the offices of the Chief State Solicitor and the society's solicitors, have appeared in the media.</P>
      <P>I might also say that I was surprised at the tone of a leading article in one of this morning's newspapers.  To suggest that the taxpayer should meet the full cost of any settlement is most surprising.  It ignores the fact that the State is only one of the many defendants in this case and that responsibility, if proven, and consequent liability could be apportioned over a number of defendants, including a multinational company.  In such circumstances, it must be accepted that it is incumbent on me to seek the views of the other defendants and, indeed, to seek a contribution from them to possible settlement terms before any decision is made by the Government on the society's submission.</P>

I want to assure the House that since the meeting with the society on 9 January 1991 the Department of Health, the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Chief State Solicitor have been actively pursuing this matter.

The Minister said in reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had inquiries made with the <Col N="1122" /> Southern Health Board in connection with this case.  The board have no record of this case.  I would suggest that the person concerned or his general practitioner should make contact immediately with an orthopaedic surgeon. I am, of course, aware of the waiting list referred to by the Deputy. However, I should explain that the admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case.  Patients are given priority in accordance with medical criteria and their position on the waiting list, and it is open to general practitioners to stress the urgency of an individual case to the consultant concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply suggests he has been misinformed.  If that is not the case he is trying to mislead the House in stating that the Southern Health Board have no record of this case.  I have in my possession a letter of acknowledgment from the Southern Health Board, dated 25 February 1991, to the person concerned stating that the waiting list for outpatient appointments is now more than one year long.  They said they would be more than pleased to furnish a copy of the letter to the Minister for his information, in the hope that he would clarify his position <i>vis-á-vis</i> this case.  I have the letter if the Minister wishes to see it.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested in his reply that the person concerned or his general practitioner should make contact with the orthopaedic surgeon, and he has done this.  The letter from the Southern Health Board acknowledges his request to make an appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon and states that such an appointment will not be possible for at least a year. The inconsistencies between the Minister's reply and what is actually happening in our health service illustrates the Minister's isolation from reality and, indeed, his inability to realise the full responsibilities of his very important brief.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The Minister also stated that an admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case.  This remark suggests that the Minister is passing the buck by inferring that the consultant does not consider this person to be sufficiently ill to warrant hospital treatment.  I regret to say that this person has not even got as far as seeing the orthopaedic surgeon because of the unacceptable waiting list.  The Minister's remark also begs the question, exactly where does he fit into the health service?  His reply suggests that he is merely an innocent bystander in the midst of all this chaos.  As Minister for Health he has failed to acknowledge his responsibility for the health service.  He is not prepared to do anything to reduce the waiting time.  In response to my question the Minister acknowledges the existence of unacceptable waiting lists in the Southern Health Board area and in all the health board areas throughout the country.  This acceptance is totally contradictory to recent statements made by him in this House that our health service is in satisfactory order.  He disputed claims made by the Labour Party that a crisis exists in the health service.</P>
    <P>This case involves an elderly man of 70 years of age.  To expect a person of this age to wait a year for an appointment to see a consultant is intolerable, but then to expect him to wait at least a further year for hospital treatment or surgery is, indeed, a poor reflection not only on the Minister for Health but on the health service over which he presides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for allowing me to comment on the elective orthopaedic surgery situation. It is true to say that waiting lists are a feature of health services around the world.  In Northern Ireland there were 800 people on the waiting list for hip replacements.  Extra money was provided and the waiting list was eliminated, but three months later there were 800 people on the waiting list again.  This is the nature of health services worldwide.</P>
      <P>In regard to joint replacements in this country &mdash; I do not hear the Labour Party giving us any credit for this &mdash; public patients can have elbow and knee replacements, a service that was not readily available when I became Minister. It is also true that the development of modern techniques has contributed to this situation.  In elective orthopaedics, for example, hip replacement surgery has improved the quality of life for many patients.  This procedure was not available in the past.  We also have a growing elderly population with increasing health demands.  I am glad older people can now avail of hip replacements whereas that was not the case a few short years ago.</P>
      <P>With regard to Cork, I would like to briefly outline how elective orthopaedic services are organised.  Inpatient orthopaedic services for Cork are provided at St. Mary's Hospital, Guarranebraher, with outpatient services being provided at the Regional Hospital and, to a limited extent, at Mallow General Hospital.  I want to state in reply to the Deputy that the Southern Health Board have no record on the waiting lists of the patient he mentioned.  I would be very glad to take the letter and to pursue the matter again, but the information I have from the Southern Health Board is that they have no such record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some patients are <Col N="1125" /> experiencing delays in receiving out-patient orthopaedic appointments at Cork Regional Hospital.  However, I should explain that the provision of out-patient appointments is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case. Patients are given priority in accordance with medical criteria and their position on the waiting lists.  It is, of course, open to general practitioners to stress the urgency of an individual case to the consultant concerned.</P>
    <P>Because of my concern about waiting times for orthopaedic surgery, additional resources were made available to the Southern Health Board in 1989 to increase the throughput of orthopaedic patients.  This was part of the Government's urgent action programme aimed at increasing the capacity of acute hospitals to cater for the demands being made upon them and reducing waiting times in areas such as orthopaedics, with particular regard to hip replacement operations.  I am pleased to be able to report that the waiting list for hip replacement surgery nationally has decreased by about 12 per cent since April 1990, of which the Deputy seems to be unaware.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also will be pleased to know that admissions to St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital have increased in recent years; in 1988, 2,880 patients were admitted to the hospital and in 1990 the number of admissions rose to 3,087 &mdash; an increase in admissions of nearly 7 per cent.</P>

      <P>I have already expressed my concern about waiting lists. As I already pointed out, they are a feature of all health services around the world.  I am determined that no patient should experience undue delays in receiving treatment.  In this regard, I should like to make it clear that the level of activity approved for 1990 will be maintained throughout 1991.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom buíochas a thabhairt duit, a Cheann Comhairle, as deis a thabhairt dom an cheist thábhachtach seo a thógail ar an Athló.  Carrickfin Airport is situated in the Donegal Gaeltacht on the Atlantic coast and for several years there were regular flights, almost on a daily basis, from Carrickfin to Glasgow operated initially by Malinair and latterly by Loganair.</P>
      <P>Last May Ryanair commenced twice weekly flights to Luton, indeed the Minister, Deputy Brennan, was there for the inaugural flight and witnessed the excitement and optimism of all who attended on that occasion for the future development of Carrickfin Airport.  Last January Ryanair suspended all their flights to Carrickfin and, since last month, all flights by Loganair were suspended pending further notice.  At present there is no passenger service to or from Carrickfin.  Not alone is this a setback for the airport and its hard working board of directors, it is also a severe blow to the future development of industry, tourism and commercial life throughout Donegal which is one of the most peripheral regions in the country with an inadequate roads network, particularly to the west, and does not have a railway line.</P>
      <P>I request the Minister to take immediate steps to have regular flights from Carrickfin to Glasgow and London and to examine the feasibility of having internal flights, perhaps from Carrickfin to Dublin, for which there would be a demand.</P>

      <P>I understand that Loganair suspended services on the Glasgow-Carrickfin route on 22 February 1991 as part of a series of cutbacks in the company in response to the general downturn in aviation as a result of the Gulf crisis.  We have been in touch with the company and I am pleased to inform the Deputy and the House that the company will resume services with effect from 27 March on the basis of a twice weekly service which will increase to five times weekly in the peak summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of the airport are also looking at proposals for additional air services to and from the airport which, I hope, will come to fruition in the coming <Col N="1128" /> months.  As part of their plan for the future expansion and development of the airport facilities, the board have recently submitted proposals to my Department for upgrading the terminal building, taxiways and navigational aids at a cost of up to £2 million.  These proposals are being considered for financial assistance under the EC operational programme on peripherality. Under this programme up to 50 per cent of funds required may be available from the ERDF sources.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the importance of the regional airports to the economic and social development of the regions and to tourism in particular.  In support of this it is hoped to make a decision shortly on the funds to be allocated to Carrickfin and other regional airports.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 March 1991.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was designed specifically for the long term unemployed. It was on this basis that it was presented and approved for support under the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible, therefore, to extend this particular scheme to other categories of social welfare recipients such as those in receipt of disabled person's allowances within the current term of the scheme, i.e. up to end 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am deeply conscious of the need for appropriate training for all categories of social welfare recipients.  It is in this context that discussions have <Col N="917" /> been taking place between my Department and the Department of Social Welfare.

      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the higher education grants scheme will be re-examined in the context particularly of increasing the income eligibility limits for families with more than one child attending third level; assessing income eligibility of mature students who are not dependent on their parents, on the basis of their own and, if married, that of their spouses' incomes; the development of more equitable income assessment criteria for all applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will further facilitate access of those most in need.  The Deputy may be aware that there are at present over 50 per cent of students in third level in receipt of grant aid.  In the VEC colleges the figures is in <Col N="919" /> the order of 90 per cent.  These figures indicate the extent to which third level access is already being facilitated by the various schemes of financial assistance to students.</P>

      <P>Based on indices provided by the Central Statistics Office, the consumer price index increased by 74.2 per cent between 1981 and 1990.  Between 1981 and 1990 the value of a higher education grant payable at the maximum rate increased by £1,476 from £1,592 to £3,063.  This represents an increase of 92.7 per cent.  In the same period total expenditure on higher education grants increased from £3.4 million to £27.2 million, that is to say an increase of the order of 700 per cent.  In the case of a family with one or two dependent children, the income limits in order to qualify for the maximum rate of grant have been increased by 31.4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test tables are so framed as to give greater financial assistance to students from low-income families.  The real value of a higher education grant has been maintained at a level of approximately 18 per cent ahead of the consumer price index in the period in question.  Moreover, income eligibility limits have been increased in line with the CPI each year since 1985.  In addition, I wish to point out that in the Programme for Government 1989 to 1993, the Government gave a commitment that <Col N="921" /> income eligibility limits will continue to be index-linked.</P>
    <P>All students qualifying for a maintenance grant automatically qualify for payment of full course fees.  The fees payable under the scheme have increased in line with fee increases generally and so grantholders are unaffected by the fee increases during the full period of their third level courses.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy regarding the proportion of pupils accommodated in prefabricated classrooms is not available.</P>
      <P>Prefabricated buildings are intended to meet a short term temporary need and those grant aided or provided by my Department are designed to ensure a satisfactory standard of accommodation for this purpose.  The recently agreed <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contains a commitment that extra funding will be available from 1992 to 1997 to upgrade or replace all sub-standard buildings at primary and second level.  A substantial amount of this will be devoted to the replacement of pre-fabricated facilities which are no longer considered satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I am aware of, and have examined, the data referred to by the Deputy which relate to new entrants in 1986.  The percentage of students sitting the leaving certificate who transfer to third level education has increased significantly from 35 per cent in 1986 to approximately 45 per cent at present. This increase must reflect higher participation rates in all counties in the interim, including those counties with the lowest participation in 1986.  This process will continue under the various measures to generally increase the number of third level places under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>The advent of the new regional technical college in Tallaght should be of particular assistance in redressing the problem of lower than average participation in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Retention at second level has been identified as one of the more significant predictors of third level participation rates.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> my Department will also be bringing forward specific measures under which disadvantaged second level schools will be targeted for special action designed to develop supportive linkages with third level in an effort to motivate and facilitate pupils of suitable ability to proceed to third level education.  Arrangements will also be made to allocate third level places for students from disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to monitor the rates of participation by county and to that end are taking steps to have the data corresponding to that provided in the Clancy report of 1988 updated as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>For the school year 1988-89 the number of post-primary schools providing instruction in at least two modern languages was 364, which represents an increase of more than 65 per cent over the position in 1985-86.  I believe these figures reflect both the importance which I have attached to meeting the demand for the provision of modern languages in our schools and the resources which I have made available to meet that <Col N="937" /> demand.  Given the particular importance surrounding the provision of modern languages in the context of European integration and the approach of 1992, I am, of course, committed to the continuing and improved provision of resources for these subjects.  I am confident that, when data regarding modern languages are available for the school years subsequent to 1988-89, they will show a further improvement in the already favourable situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 to 90, inclusive, together.  Sewage sludge from the Dublin Corporation treatment plant at Ringsend is dumped at sea in accordance with a permit granted by the Minister for the Marine under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  The terms and conditions of the permit govern dumping and monitoring and are reviewed annually by my Department.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this month the authorised dump site was relocated from its previous location two miles off Howth Head to a new site further offshore.  It is intended that the new site, which is located some ten miles from the nearest coast, will receive about 300,000 tonnes of sewage sludge per annum until the dumping of sewage sludge at sea is phased out completely by 1998 in accordance with the Government's environment action programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old and new dump sites have been carefully monitored and studied.  The report of a study of the dump site off Howth Head, published by my Department in 1989, revealed a degree of localised fauna enrichment in the vicinity of the site but indicated that conditions on the sea floor had not deteriorated since 1983 when the last study was undertaken. The new site was chosen as the most <Col N="941" /> suitable of a number of sites following extensive scientific studies.  The report of the first phase of a four phase study to select a new site was published last year and I understand that the phases 2 and 3 reports will be made available shortly. All studies were undertaken on behalf of my Department and funded by Dublin Corporation.  In addition, the sludge itself has been and continues to be subject to regular and detailed analyses to ensure the protection of the marine environment in the vicinities of the dump sites.</P>

      <P>An Irish passport is a valuable document relating to the holder's Irish citizenship and identity.  To preserve its integrity and international acceptability it is important to ensure that Irish passports are granted only to those properly entitled to hold them.</P>
      <P>To ensure that applications are entertained only from those who are eligible for a passport, each adult applicant is required to produce to the Passport Office a completed application form and two photographs which have been certified by a garda, together with a birth certificate and any other proof of identity or citizenship as may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the requirement for a birth certificate has in the past caused problems for applicants who have acquired Irish citizenship other than by <Col N="943" /> birth in this country.  The Passport Office are prepared to examine all such applications sympathetically and accept substitute documentation in cases where it is established that birth certificates are not available from the country of birth of the applicant.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to (1) the scale of the continuing conflict in Cambodia and (2) the fact that the UN currently holds $48.5 million for development in Cambodia; the steps which are being taken to alleviate the plight of the people there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply conscious of the continuing conflict in Cambodia and the human cost which the hostilities are exacting from the Cambodian people. Deputies will be aware that I have repeatedly called on the Cambodian parties to cease hostilities, most recently in my statements of 31 October and 6 December 1990 to the Dáil.  Such a ceasefire would, in my view, greatly facilitate the successful implementation of the UN plan for a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict.  I urge the Cambodian parties to demonstrate flexibility and compromise in order that the UN plan can be implemented at the earliest possible time.  The Cambodian people have suffered for too long and must be given the opportunity to live their lives in peace, free from the spectre of appalling violence and terror.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the United Nations Development Programme has accumulated funds for development in Cambodia. The UNDP can co-operate only with governments recognised by the United Nations.  The administration in Phnom Penh, which was installed by the occupying Vietnamese, is not so recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to a similar question on 30 January last, both the UN <Col N="944" /> and the EC continue to provide humanitarian aid to the Cambodian people.  The UN aid is mainly concentrated on refugees from the conflict and channelled through UNBRO, the United Nations Border Relief Operation.  This agency receives about $60 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The latest figures on Community aid show that in 1990, 8.82 MECU was given in humanitarian aid for refugees on the Thai-Cambodian border.  In addition, 2.67 MECU was provided to non-governmental organisations for emergency relief within the country (1.3 ECU = £1 approximately).</P>
    <P>In September 1990, Ireland provided £25,000 to OXFAM for purchase of shelter kits for use by people displaced by fighting within Cambodia.  In November 1989, £50,000 was given to CONCERN for emergency aid supplies.  These contributions were designed to assist in alleviating the immediate plight of the Cambodian people.</P>
    <P>The European Community has indicated its willingness, on the achievement of a political settlement, to contribute to the reconstruction and development of Cambodia.  I can again assure Deputies that such assistance will have the full support of the Government.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme on Peripherality &mdash; which has been approved by the European Commission &mdash; contains details of planned co-financed expenditure on roads and other transport infrastructure in the period to 31 December 1993.  These details are in the form of tabular statements which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The tables also contain details of Regional <Col N="945" /> Fund assistance committed in respect of road development measures.</P>
      <P>The global annual commitment for each year under the programme is drawn down in three advances as follows:</P>

    <P>1st advance of 50 per cent on commencement of implementation of the <Col N="946" /> measures planned for the year in question.</P>
    <P>2nd advance of 30 per cent on expenditure of at least half of the first advance.</P>

      <P>All the major engineering field investigations of a drainage scheme for the Dunkellin catchment have been completed although some updating of field survey data is required.  Considerable progress has been made on the design of a scheme but it will be some time yet before this is complete.  Any decision to proceed with works must await completion of the design and the outcome of the environmental impact assessment, which is now statutorily required, and the cost benefit analysis.  In this connection, while certain aspects of <Col N="954" /> the environmental impact assessment have been completed, much still remains to be done and, in the circumstanmces, it is not possible to say when a decision will be made.</P>
      <P>The Dunkellin drainage district, maintainable by Galway County Council, consists of the Dunkellin River to Ballykeeran Bridge, the Raford River to Kiltullagh Bridge, the Agard River to Lacken, the St. Clerin's River to Loughrea railway station and the Kilconieron River to Dartfield as well as various tributary drains.</P>

Participation in a training course is acceptable as an alternative for part but not all of the 13 weeks; and (ii) applicants must be able to satisfy FÁS as to the viability of the business proposed and that they have the necessary skill to undertake it.</P>
      <P>In the case of applicants who do not qualify under the present conditions, I am at present considering how progress can be made in implementing the recommendation included at paragraph 124 of section V of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which provides that the live register requirements should be relaxed to facilitate women who wish to return to the workforce.</P>

      <P>To say when, exactly, a particular proposal of this kind was first mooted &mdash; if indeed it would be possible to extract such information at all from available records &mdash; would require commitment of an excessive amount of staff time.  I am sure the Deputy will agree, in any event, that what is important is that the provision of a new station for Doneraile forms part of the Garda building programme and that the necessary preliminary steps are being taken in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.  It is widely acknowledged that considerable progress has been made on the implementation of this programme in recent years, with projects being undertaken by reference to their agreed level of priority and availability of resources, and while I cannot say when Doneraile will have its new Garda station, the Deputy can be assured that there will be no avoidable delay.</P>

      <Quest>the reason persons over 70 years of age are compelled to apply for a driving licence and submit two photographs and a certificate of fitness at a total cost of £20 each year, while people under the age of 70 years can get a ten year licence for £20; if, in view of this anomaly he will now consider allowing people over 70 years the same privilege of applying for a ten year licence for £20 and only make it mandatory for them to submit a certificate of fitness each year during that ten year period to their respective licensing authority or to his Department.</Quest>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic (Licensing and Drivers) Regulations, 1989, a person over 70 years of age is entitled to <Col N="968" /> a three year driving licence, which costs £12, provided such person's fitness to drive is certified by a medical doctor for a three year period.  Only if such person's medical certification is limited to one year is that person's entitlement reduced to a one year licence, which costs £4.  I consider these provisions to be reasonable and I have no proposals to change them.</P>

    <P>*Statistical returns in respect of the 1990-91 academic year are in the process of collection at the moment and, consequently, corresponding data in respect of the current academic year are not yet available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" />&dagger;In order to provide an accurate picture of enrolment trends in the main 3rd level institutions and to maintain consistency with the format in which data are published in my Department's Annual Statistical Report, data have been provided in respect of other HEA institutions.  With regard to vocational technological colleges, while the majority of students returned under this heading are enrolled in the DIT, a number of other 3rd level vocational colleges, eg, Limerick CoACT, Cork College of Art &amp; Design, are included under this classification.</P>
    <P>&Dagger;The National Institutes for Higher Education in Dublin and Limerick were granted university status in June 1989, and for statistical purposes are treated as universities from the 1988-89 Academic Year onwards.  Prior to 1988-89, the National Institutes for Higher Education were returned under the heading &ldquo;Other HEA&rdquo;.  From 1988-89 onwards, Dún Laoghaire College of Art &amp; Design, previously classified under 2nd level vocational technological, has been re-classified under 3rd level vocational technological.</P>
    <P>** Data in respect of the 1989-90 academic year are provisional and may be subject to minor adjustment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will note that the percentage increases in enrolment between 1980-81 and 1989-90 are 41 per cent, 157 per cent and 101 per cent for the HEA, RTC and vocational technological sectors, respectively.  I believe the figures reflect my commitment towards meeting the increasing demand for 3rd level education and that they further reflect my concern that a wide variety of options should be available to students across the various 3rd level sectors.  I am, of course, committed to increasing the number of student places available in 3rd level education and am hopeful that data for 1990-91, when available, will show a further increase in 3rd level enrolments.</P>

      <P>In the case of primary schools, Department organised in-service courses are provided free of charge and teachers are not paid expenses to attend such courses or other in-service courses.  Teachers who attend in-service summer courses are entitled to up to three days extra personal vacation in the following school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of second level teachers revised rates of expenses for attendance <Col N="978" /> at in-service courses organised by my Department were introduced with effect from 1 January 1991.  The new rates are as follows:</P>
    <P>Subsistence allowance per night:</P>
    <P>Block release courses in Remedial Education: £19.91; Other courses: £12.07.</P>
    <P>Travel allowance</P>
    <P>Payable at the lowest bus or train rate. If public transport is not available, 21p per mile is payable as a car allowance.  In addition, teachers attending the one-day junior certificate courses are provided with a midday meal.</P>
    <P>A circular announcing the new travel and subsistence rates is being issued to schools at present and I am arranging for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
