      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I went to Deputy Bruton with specific proposals he would say I was pre-empting the whole thing and not having all party agreement.  I think it would be much wiser for us to meet to have a discussion about it to see if there is any possibility of making progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I will be celebrating St. Patrick's Day in this country and while it is too early to give precise details, I expect that the majority of Ministers and Ministers of State will be doing likewise.  There are, however, many requests from around the world for the presence of Ministers at St. Patrick's Day ceremonies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> The guidelines for such visits, as with other ministerial travel plans, provide for them to be carefully co-ordinated so as to ensure the maximum benefit to the State.  The number of persons involved, including spouses and officials, and the associated costs, are kept to a minimum. Sometimes certain expenses associated with visits are met by the host organisation. Where they are not otherwise provided for, the expenses of Ministers and the official party are met by the State, in accordance with long standing practice and regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I hope the Taoiseach has a very pleasant St. Patrick's Day; there is nothing in the question which would suggest that we would not like to see wives accompanying their husbands or husbands accompanying their wives.  It would appear, however, that the second part of the question has not been answered.  How many Ministers will be staying at home?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of persons appointed by him to boards, committees and State companies since 1987; the breakdown as between female and male; the number of persons whose CVs are currently retained in his Department for consideration for appointment to such boards and committees; and if he will outline whether it is desirable that a person, other than an official, serve on more than two such bodies at any one time.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report the numerical details requested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since late 1986, my Department have maintained a register of candidates for <Col N="517" /> appointment to State-sponsored bodies generally.  It was compiled following consultation with other Government Departments, the Consultative Group of Chief Executives of State Organisations, the Social Partners, the National Youth Council, the Council for the Status of Women and the Boardroom Centre of the Irish Mangement Institute.  The register, <Col N="518" /> which has been made available to all Ministers, contains the names of over 500 persons.  The number of bodies on which a person serves at any one time is something that has to be taken into account at the time of appointment to those bodies in the light of the commitment the individual can make and his or her special qualifications or experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no particular criteria.  First, we have a general wish to secure more suitable women for appointment and, second, each appointment is considered on its merits having regard to the nature of the appointment, the type of State company involved and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that party political considerations should not be taken into account in making these appointments and that the State sector has not been well served by the chopping and changing of directors of State companies purely because of political considerations?  Would he agree that this is something we should strive to achieve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully and I hope the Deputy will give some credit for the fact that the Government, and their predecessor, retained a number of good people on boards who had been appointed by our predecessors, and we would like to continue that as often as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to give the Taoiseach credit for that point.  However, unfortunately it was not widespread enough as in, for instance, the case of RTE.  Will he agree that the State sector can be more successful if there is some sort of continuity in boards and that chopping and changing of boards after changes of Government should be a thing of the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are a number of aspects of it of course.  First, it is not desirable to leave people on boards for too long, no matter which Government appoint them.  People are inclined to become institutionalised and it is important that from time to time fresh faces appear round the boardroom table.  Apart from that, there is a great deal to be said for continuity and there is nothing in the system that prevents that.</P>

Will he take any action in the case of Ministers who tend not to select or propose women for appointments?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of these appointments, practically all of them, are made by the Minister in consultation with the Government and there is a standing incentive by the Government to find suitable women for appointment.  I assure the Deputy that is the case.  Sometimes we are accused of delays in making appointments to boards, and the reason for it is we are searching for suitable women. I know the Deputy will agree with me that there is no point in appointing a woman to a board unless she has the qualifications for it, the same as male appointments.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that this would be an appropriate study to ask the National Economic and Social Council to carry out in view of the time-scale involved in the discussion of the agricultural reform proposals now being mooted in the Community.  Studies undertaken by the NESC are normally studies requiring a long period of research and discussion.</P>
      <P>Provision is made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for discussions by the Government with the farming organisations in the light of the developing situation in the Community.

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Commissioner MacSharry has indicated that he does not expect his CAP reform proposals to be accepted for approximately a year?  If that is so, will the Taoiseach agree that there would be sufficient time in the year for a serious study to be done on the impact on the Irish economy in these major cutbacks in agricultural production?  Will the Taoiseach further agree that Ireland will lose disproportionately from any cutbacks of <Col N="521" /> this kind, that the PAYE sector in Ireland supplying the agricultural industry and buying from it will suffer job losses with no compensation of the kind being offered to farmers under the proposals? Will he agree, therefore, that it makes a great deal of sense for Ireland to commission a serious, independent economic study and analysis, using the macro-economic model that is available in the ESRI, on the potential loss to Ireland of this proposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy totally, but we must not assume anything about the outcome at this stage.  It will be a matter for determined and skilful negotiation by the Government to make sure that any losses to Irish agriculture or to the Irish economy are minimal and that in so far as there are any we seek compensation for them.  Apart from that, I certainly agree that the more information we have on the implications the better, but I believe we can within the Government's service make an excellent study of those implications and the effect any changes would have.  The proposals are at a very formative stage yet and there are long political battles to be fought before they are finalised.  I do not think NESC would be appropriate but I will talk about it to the people in NESC to see if they can offer us any assistance.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that if we wait until the proposals are in a fixed form it will be too late to do a study of this kind?  Is he aware that when similar proposals involving the imposition of a super-levy were mooted in the early eighties the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, armed himself with an economic analysis of the disproportionate effect of these proposals on Ireland and took the trouble to go and see every Prime Minister in Europe with a view to impressing upon them, on the basis of that analysis, the serious effect for the entire Irish economy, including those living in towns, of proposals of this kind?  Would the Taoiseach be prepared <Col N="522" /> to do a similar exercise in the circumstances?</P>

      <P>I must repeat that the proposals are still at the initial stages and we cannot really judge any effects or implications they may have until we know precisely their extent and what compensatory measures will be made available to this country in particular.  As regards the implications of major disruption of the existing CAP arrangements, these are well known.  We do not have to carry out any study in depth to know, and we have stated again and again, the importance of agriculture both from the point of view of farm incomes and the stability of the rural economy and, indeed, from the point of view of the overall economy.</P>

      <P>Twice in his reply to supplementary questions from Deputy Bruton the Taoiseach referred to our receiving compensatory amounts from the Commission in lieu of, I presume, production and price reductions.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two different things are involved here.  One is the GATT negotiations and the reform of the CAP in that context, and there is the more long term restructuring of the CAP.  It is in that context that we will be seeking compensation for any changes which would involve losses to Irish farmers.  In <Col N="523" /> particular, as the Deputy knows, there is new thinking about the way in which farm incomes can be supplemented in the light of any changes that may be detrimental. The farm price package for 1991, of course, is a different matter and we will have to deal with that as a separate matter and see, as we always do, how the best interests of our farmers can be protected in regard to that price package.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Two formal meetings have taken place between the National Economic and Social Council and members of the Government in the last five years and two occurred in the previous five years.</P>
      <P>I met the council on 11 June 1987, at their suggestion, for a general exchange of views on economic and social policy issues arising from their report &ldquo;A Strategy for Development 1986-1990&rdquo; published in November 1986.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment met the council on 17 July 1987 at the council's request to discuss their views as outlined in their report &ldquo;The Financing of Local Authorities&rdquo; published in May, 1985.</P>
      <P>In 1985 the then Taoiseach and Tánaiste and, separately, the then Minister for Labour met the council to discuss taxation matters and manpower policy respectively.</P>
      <P>The constitution of the NESC provides specifically for such meetings between members of the Government and the council and, in my view, such meetings should take place when this is considered desirable by either party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance attached to social partnership, can the Taoiseach say why there has not been any meeting between any member of the Government and the NESC in the past two-and-a-half years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly there has been no request from the NESC for any Minister to come before them or discuss any particular issue with them.  As far as the Government are concerned, we are quite satisfied with the NESC reports we have received.  We never saw any need to discuss them further with the NESC but if the NESC wish to have discussions with any Minister on any issue that opportunity is always readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that rather than waiting for <Col N="526" /> others to come to him, as seems to be his attitude in regard to agriculture as well, he might find it worthwhile to ask his Government Ministers to initiate discussions with the NESC in order that the ongoing implementation of the NESC proposals are monitored in a constructive, face-to-face fashion by Government Ministers and their members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy need try to create some confrontation where none exists: the relationship between the NESC and the Government is absolutely satisfactory. As the Deputy may recall, in order to strengthen the NESC approach to our economy I arranged for a person nominated by the European Commission to sit in with the NESC as an observer so that we could co-ordinate our economic thinking and planning with the Commission. There is no particular need at present, nor has there been, for any further elaboration or discussion between Ministers and the NESC.  The initiative here would lie primarily with the NESC. If at any time the NESC want any Minister of this Government or myself to come before them on any issue, that will be done immediately.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question No. 15 and written Question No. 116 together.</P>
      <P>I have always supported the idea of a suitable memorial to the Stardust victims and a courtyard in Beaumont Hospital has been dedicated to their memory.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last, 14 February, I met with the Stardust committee who presented me with proposals for a memorial garden at Glin Road, Coolock.  I indicated my support for a suitable memorial but on a greatly reduced scale.</P>

      <P>It would be most inappropriate for the Deputy to start meddling in this way or to attempt to create any form of &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; about this matter.  I have the best possible relations with the Stardust committee and have had over the years.  I met them frequently and between us we were instrumental in having a memorial which is at present in Beaumont Hospital.  There has always been a proposal for some other memorial. I met the Stardust Committee from time to time and have always explained to them that some of the ideas put forward for a very extravagantly priced memorial were not suitable.  That is the state of affairs.  If the Deputy just leaves it to me and the Stardust committee we will resolve the matter satisfactorily. While I am at it, here, I wish to pay tribute to the previous Attorney General who tackled very generously the principal <Col N="532" /> matter of concern to the Stardust families and relatives, that is, the question of compensation.</P>

      <P>I have to say on behalf of the committee that they would be somewhat bemused by the Taoiseach's suggestion that they are being extravagant in view of the fact that they had to picket outside the Taoiseach's offices in the last week to draw the Taoiseach's attention to their needs.  Does the Taoiseach appreciate that the efforts of the committee now are to ensure that there is some lasting memorial, of use in particular to the youth of the area which this tragedy most affected?  Will the Taoiseach accept that since the committee first met him on this matter they substantially scaled down their proposals to the extent that they have almost cut by two thirds what they originally suggested? At this stage the committee have met the Taoiseach's representations in the matter and are seeking no more than an indication as to when work might commence.</P>

I just said that the proposals put forward originally, and as they still exist, are of a nature that we could not contemplate from the point of view of expenditure.  I explained that to them and the representatives from the Stardust committee are quite prepared to consider any alternative reduced proposals.  I cannot give <Col N="534" /> the Deputy a precise date but we will get on with it as quickly as we can.</P>

    <P>Of this amount £14,350 has been allocated to the National Library, £9,350 of which is in respect of engaging a consultant to develop a five year strategic <Col N="539" /> plan and £5,000 in respect of a training consultant; £2,000 has been allocated to the National Museum in respect of 1916 commemorations; and £384 has been paid in respect of a survey on the title of State lakes begun in 1990.  No decision has been made on the allocation of remaining funds.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council have decided to spend £2,700 of the funds allocated to them on such services.  The sum represents outstanding payments due in respect of a survey of heritage education facilities carried out in 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 28, 40, 43, 52, 59, 64, 68, 69, 73, 84 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that Stage 1 of Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 July 1990.  That stage involves principally the completion of the internal market and closer Community co-ordination of economic and monetary policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inter-Governmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union, which is to prepare the Treaty amendments necessary to allow the final stages of that union to come into effect, was formally convened on 15 December last. The conference opened against a background where a considerable amount of preparatory work had already been done and where a large majority of member <Col N="545" /> states had reached broad agreement on a range of key issues.  Already it is clear that this agreement is proving helpful to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the conference meetings are taking place at two levels.  Under the timetable drawn up by the Luxembourg Presidency, Finance Ministers are scheduled to meet at least once a month until the end of June.  These meetings at ministerial level are being prepared by a group of personal representatives drawn primarily from Finance Ministries but also including officials from Departments of Foreign Affairs.  Representatives from the central banks of member states also participate in an observer capacity.</P>
    <P>The papers tabled by both Spain and France are but two of the several proposals for Treaty amendments which have been tabled by conference participants. Early last December, the Committee of Central Bank Governors made available the text of a draft Statute for a European System of Central Banks. Subsequently, the Commission produced a working document which contains comprehensive proposals for the Treaty revisions necessary to accomplish EMU. The UK have also tabled their proposals for the &ldquo;Hard&rdquo; ECU in a specific Treaty amendment format.  Both the Spanish and UK papers are directed exclusively to the possible content of Stage 2 of Economic Monetary Union and do not, in so far as amendments are concerned, deal with the likely structure of the final stage.</P>
    <P>In early January, Ireland tabled a paper which outlined our general position on a wide range of issues and which contained specific proposals for amendments to the cohesion provisions in the existing Treaty.  Those amendments have also been tabled in the context of the political union conference.  A copy of that paper will be placed in the Oireachtas Library so that Deputies may avail of the opportunity to examine it themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that I am constrained in my comments by the need to preserve the confidential nature of the conference discussions.  However, I will <Col N="546" /> say that all proposals for Treaty amendments do not take the form of completed Treaty texts.  Many delegations, including ourselves, also avail of the option to propose specific amendments in the relevant areas of economic and monetary policy as the proceedings advance.  Any proposals relating to the European Central Bank, a topic which has yet to be discussed by the conference, are likely to be made in that context.</P>
    <P>All proposals which have been submitted to date will be considered at the appropriate time by the conference.  To this end, the Presidency have adopted a very orderly method of approach which involves consideration of relevant Articles of the Treaty on a consecutive basis. This approach will, I feel sure, yield positive and tangible results.</P>

      <Quest>whether he proposes to include the proceeds from the sale of shares in State-owned companies in calculating (a) the current budget deficit and (b) the Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1991; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy, as I have previously informed the House, is that the sale of State assets will be used to reduce borrowing, and thus to help ease the burden of the national debt and of debt-servicing costs.</P>
      <P>The accounting practice adopted is to treat the proceeds of such sales, whether of shares in State-owned companies or of other assets, as &lsquo;Exchequer capital receipts&rsquo; which enter the calculation of the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement (EBR).  This is entirely consistent with the Government's stated objective.  As far as this objective is concerned, it makes no difference whether these proceeds are applied directly to debt-redemption, or used to keep borrowing lower than would otherwise be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This accounting treatment means that the proceeds of sales of shares, like those of other assets, do not directly affect the current budget deficit; of course, to the <Col N="548" /> extent that borrowing for capital purposes is kept down, subsequent servicing costs, which appear in the current budget, are thereby reduced.</P>
    <P>The Irish Life share flotation has been the subject of some comment.  The proceeds of this flotation, which is planned to take place this year, will be dealt with in precisely the same way as those of other asset-sales &mdash; as I made clear in my financial statement.  The absence of a specific provision in the budgetary arithmetic was motivated solely by considerations of prudence, particularly in view of its unique scale.  However, when the flotation takes place, the proceeds will accrue as &lsquo;Exchequer capital receipts&rsquo;, and thus clearly reduce both borrowing and debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On budget day, I <Col N="550" /> announced my projection for real GNP growth of around 2¼ per cent in 1991. Details of this together with an assessment of the outlook for the year were published in, &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget, 1991&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister persisting with his prediction, having regard to the fact that virtually all independent forecasters predict a figure of about half of that, or 1½ per cent?  Specifically, is the Minister persisting with his prediction in the light of last night's trade figures which showed a reduction in our trade figures of exports over imports of the order of £450 million against a budget forecast of an increase of 5½ per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform the Deputy, and the House, that I stick with my projections at this stage.  I made it clear that GNP growth in 1991 is expected to slow to 2¼ per cent compared with the 1990 growth of 5 per cent.  The slow down derives primarily from international developments which are adversely affecting our main export markets.  Apart from the Gulf conflict, the anticipated slow down in the UK and the US was likely to lead to substantially reduced growth overseas.  The Gulf conflict, and the attendant uncertainty, worsens the outlook further, at least in the short term. Substantially lower growth will obviously have implications for employment and income growth and consequent knockon effects in the domestic economy.  We have taken these into account in framing the budget.  I would also like to emphasise that the need to maintain competitiveness is the single most important aspect of economic policy that we should be pursuing because even in depressed markets it does not follow that any particular exporter has to lose his share of the market, he can hold his share and increase it if he is competitive enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Rabbitte I would like to say that in looking at the list of independent commentators, it is not true, as he has said, that we are the only one out of line.  It is a new development to be accused of being on <Col N="551" /> the optimistic side.  I would refer the Deputy to the forecasts of the EC, the ESRI which came out on the same day as the budget, and of the Central Bank which came out in November.  We have taken into consideration all the developments up to that.  Finally, our budget started off on the basis of the EC projections in relation to world trade and the price of a barrel of oil at $29 a barrel.  We subsequently reduced that figure to $25 a barrel but I would remind the Deputy and the House that today's price is less than $18 for a barrel of North Sea Brent oil and, from the Gulf area &mdash; I would imagine it is difficult enough to get oil out of there &mdash; it is about $12 a barrel.  They are the basic calculations involved in the budget.  We are taking the middle of the road, and not the top or the bottom projections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister did not reply to the one aspect that is not a forecast, last night's trade figures.  How can he persist in his prediction against those figures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister about a different dimension that affects the growth rate, the rate of net factor outflows which were in excess of £2 billion last year?  Does the Minister intend to take any measures to cause at least some of those funds to be retained in the domestic economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says in relation to outflows is certainly true as a component of making up the GNP.  However, I suggest to the Deputy that the GDP is more relevant in this situation in that the GDP reflects what is happening in the real economy here.  If <Col N="552" /> one looks at what the economic commentators are saying about GDP, one will see that their projections are very close to what we are saying, some are slightly above and some are slightly below.  We are taking a middle of the road course and that is what affects the real economy.</P>
      <P>Profit repatriation or capital outflows, or as the Deputy calls them, factor outflows, are a factor of GNP but do not really impact on what happens within the real economy, which is GDP.  Nobody is too far off our figure.  Many are around 2 per cent, 2.25 per cent, with maybe one forecasts or two below it.  As I said, we got our figures right for the past four years and why should the people not have confidence in us to get them right for a fifth time?  We are going to do what Kerry could not do, that is win five in a row.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that certain companies operating under the rules which apply to the International Financial Services Centre are merely brass plate companies whose primary purpose is tax avoidance; if his attention has further been drawn to the damage the activities of these companies will do to the reputation of the financial services industry in Ireland; if he has satisfied himself that he has allocated adequate resources within his Department to police activities of International Financial Services Centre companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that there is no question of so-called &ldquo;brass plate&rdquo; operation being allowed in the International Financial Services Centre for tax avoidance purposes. Companies with no real presence in the location, whose only presence is a post-box or address, would not be welcome in Dublin and indeed would be counterproductive in the longer-term. The emphasis is on having significant functional operations located in the centre.</P>
      <P>The high reputation and standards of companies operating in the centre is our strongest selling-point internationally in promoting the centre in the highly-competitive financial markets of the world, and I would reject most emphatically any suggestion that this reputation is being eroded by the presence in the International Financial Services Centre of unsuitable companies.</P>
      <P>New applicants for the centre are very carefully screened by the Industrial Development Authority and also by the regulatory bodies concerned, among them my own Department and the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>We have been fortunate in attracting some of the leading international companies in banking, insurance and other financial services areas to the centre to join our own top native companies who are present there.  The centre is a highquality location and it would be totally unfair that any negative reflection should be cast upon its operation.</P>
      <P>Moreover, every company proposing to enter the centre has to meet stringent employment criteria &mdash; an added guarantee of real presence and the major aim of the centre overall, which is to provide high-quality employment for highlyqualified specialists in financial services.</P>
      <P>The centre is moreover overseen by a high-level body of officials and representatives of the financial services industry which meets regularly and maintains careful surveillance over the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> I am satisfied that all the arrangements I have mentioned, including those in my Department, for dealing with the centre are adequate to the task but the Deputy can rest assured that these are kept under review and will be added to as necessary to ensure a continuing high standard of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> With respect may I suggest to the Minister that he is out of touch with what is happening? Is the Minister aware that his Department have effectively lost control of the issuing of licences in so far as operating licences are issued to principal certificate holders in the first instance but they are authorised to form special purpose companies which have exactly the same rights as the licence holder?  While the Minister is correct in saying that the most stringent regulations apply to the issue of licences in the first instance, the secondary issuing of licences to special purpose companies is not effectively monitored by his Department.  The three officials who have responsibility for policing the responsibility of the International Financial Services Centre are not in a position to monitor these special purpose companies which are now involved in widespread tax avoidance activities and are &ldquo;brass plate&rdquo; operations bringing the financial services industry here into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has any specific information, which I do not have, I would be glad to have it and I will have the matter investigated.  The point the Deputy is making is in relation to special purpose companies which are involved in funding operations.  Funds, whose resources are being adminmistered by fund or investment management companies, and captive assurance and reinsurance companies, are special types of companies that are operating in the International Financial Services Centre.  These companies cannot be judged in isolation but only in the context of their sponsoring company, in which the required employment occurs.  Even in these circumstances there <Col N="555" /> is no question of them avoiding Irish tax law, although the commercial attraction of these structures hinges in large measure on tax foregone in foreign jurisdictions. This is not done in any covert way and comes well within the terms of reference of effective international planning.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any further evidence, let him present it to me.  However, I would like to give him this assurance, I have available to me the authority to revoke any licence which we find is not conforming with the conditions attached to the licence.  I will be glad to do that to preserve the good name of the centre, but I have to reject some of the Deputy's innuendo.</P>

      <P>I am aware that certain companies, for their own commercial reasons, continuously make complaints about the operations of others.  I am also aware that references have been made to the renegotiation of double taxation agreements.  Double taxation agreements govern the application and payment of <Col N="556" /> tax in this jurisdiction and in the German jurisdiction.  These agreements can only be restructured not in an arbitrary fashion but with the consent of both parties.  We are not aware of any serious developments at this stage but if such serious developments should arise in relation to any of the companies there, the House and the Deputy can be assured that the appropriate action will be taken by me and the Government.</P>

One recommendation in the report that seeks the involvement of my Department in the development of Arigna is that concerning urban renewal on the lines of the incentives available for areas designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  The report also recommended the designation, under the urban renewal programme, of areas in the towns of Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon.  The urban renewal tax incentives, which include capital allowances for commercial premises, double rent allowance for traders and owner-occupier residential allowance are, however, specific to the rundown and derelict parts of certain towns and cities, and are primarily aimed at construction and reconstruction of buildings.

The ESB have donated £1 million towards an enterprise fund and the Minister's Department would be involved in funding or part funding an enterprise fund.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="559" /> would comment on the attitude of his Department towards the funds going into the enterprise fund, which is the essential finding of the Arigna task force.</P>

      <P>I understand that my colleague the Minister for Energy was in Arigna recently and set up the trustees to manage the enterprise fund which is being contributed to, in the first instance, by the ESB.  The involvement of my Department for community and local development would be through the country development teams and the central development committee.  I do not have funds available to me on the basis suggested by the Deputy.  The estimate would not allow for that type of investment into an enterprise fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the Private Notice questions together.</P>
      <P>Desmond Ellis was extradited to Britain on foot of orders of the District Court which were upheld on appeal by the High Court and by the Supreme Court.  It was established to the satisfaction of the courts, in the course of those proceedings, that the request for extradition had been properly made, that the requirements of Irish law had been fully met and that the English courts had jurisdiction to try Desmond Ellis for the two offences specified in the warrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the decision of the magistrates in London last Thursday, the Irish authorities have informed the British authorities that no additional charges can <Col N="561" /> be proceeded with against Desmond Ellis without their consent.  They expect the British prosecuting authorities, in order to adhere to the existing agreement between the two Governments, based on the &ldquo;rule of specialty&rdquo; and to the considerations relating to that rule which have been enunciated in the Supreme Court, to challenge the decision of the magistrate in a higher court.  I understand they intend to do this.  The Irish authorities will await the outcome of those proceedings and in view of this I do not propose to comment any further on the magistrate's decision.</P>
    <P>As has been indicated to the House previously, there is an administrative agreement between the British and Irish Governments whereby, following a person's extradition to the United Kingdom, only the charges on foot of which he has been extradited may be proceeded with, save with the consent of the Irish authorities.  That arrangement has operated satisfactorily until these recent events.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in section 3 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, whereby an order may be made applying those provisions in Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, which relate the Rule of Specialty to the arrangements we operate under Part III of that Act with Britain and Northern Ireland.  Were such an order to be made now in the absence of reciprocal provisions in United Kingdom law, it would mean that extradition could not take place to that jurisdiction for any offence.  I am sure Deputies would agree that this would be undesirable.  Clearly I will be keeping the question of making such an order under review in the light of developments in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, will he indicate the steps he proposes to take in relation to this matter? In view of the number of mistakes made in regard to extradition cases, all of which have been on the British side, does he agree that this matter needs to be reviewed urgently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Part III of <Col N="562" /> the Act, this matter has been examined on a number of occasions at Anglo-Irish meetings.  In fact, the relevant working group of the Anglo-Irish Conference who are looking at the whole question of extradition, referred specifically to the issue of specialty in their report of September last.  This matter has received considerable attention.  I share the Deputy's concern that all the mistakes have been made in the past have been on the British side.  However, we live in civilised societies and we must ensure as far as possible that the arrangements are worked properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the development in this case vindicates the concern expressed by many people in this country at the operation of the extradition Act between Ireland and Great Britain?  In view of the fact that a British court has now accepted that there was never any evidence that Mr. Ellis was in Britain and, consequently, the British do not have jurisdiction to proceed with the two charges for which Mr. Ellis was extradited, will the Minister state why the Government are still not prepared to speak out openly and call for Mr. Ellis's release?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said, this case is to be appealed on the basis of the two charges on which Mr. Ellis was extradited.  That matter is before the court at present and it would be improper for me to comment on it.  The extradition of Mr. Ellis and the details of the case were considered by the District Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court of the land.  The Government acted on the basis of the decision of our Supreme Court, which is right and proper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify, for the benefit of the House, the basis on which he or the Government communicated with the British authorities to tell them that they could not proceed on fresh charges against Desmond Ellis without the consent of the Government in the absence of any specialty requirement in our extradition <Col N="563" /> procedures?  Is the Supreme Court now the legislative authority in regard to the rules which should apply to extradition? The Minister made some passing reference to the Supreme Court as the basis upon which the specialty agreement, whatever it is, exists.</P>
      <P>Secondly, does the Minister recognise that he needs to take speedy action to reestablish on a firm and proper basis the extradition procedures which exist between Ireland and Britain so that we can continue to rely upon extradition in our fight against terrorism?  Does the Minister agree that his statement that all the mistakes exist on one side does not help the process in terms of co-operation and development?  Finally, would the Minister accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the arrangements under which contact was made between our authorities and the British authorities, there is an agreement between the Irish and British Governments which has, until this case, worked well.  It was on the basis of that agreement that the contact was made.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of speedy action, I do not see what speedy action is required on my part in relation to this issue.  The appeal has to be made by the British authorities and not the Irish authorities against the decision of the magistrate there.  The magistrate brought forward two new charges without the agreement of the Irish Government, which can only have breached under the arrangement we have with the British authorities.  With regard to the need to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, this issue has been debated at great length in this House in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister two questions.  Will he discuss with the UK authorities the establishment of a working party of UK and Irish officials and legal experts to iron out the administrative, technical and legal obstacles which are blocking effective extradition arrangements at present? Secondly, if he is prepared to accept that proposal, does the Minister agree it is all the more relevant and important in the context of the open borders which will exist post-1992 that we have such effective extradition procedures between our two jurisdictions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as a review of extradition arrangements is concerned, I believe these arrangements have been working satisfactorily.  We cannot have slot machine type extradition arrangements. The extradition of a citizen of one country to a foreign country involves serious issues of legal and constitutional rights which must be dealt with in accordance with the due process of law.  This is the way we have approached the issue. There has been no blockage.  There are a number of cases before the courts and they will decide on these cases in due course.</P>
      <P>So far as a review is concerned this matter has been considered at the Anglo-Irish Conference on a number of occasions.  If the British authorities were to bring in a specialty requirement under their legislation this would enable me to sign an order under section (3) of the 1987 Act which would put the specialty arrangements on a statutory footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of those who supports extradition and regards it as a vital part in combating international terrorism, may I ask the Minister if he would accept that what has happened in the past week has put a great strain on the process and that it is vital that this difficulty be resolved speedily?  Secondly, would he accept that to some degree this puts a substantial question mark over whether this gentlemen's agreement &mdash; as it was referred to in one paper &mdash; or <Col N="565" /> administrative procedure &mdash; as the Minister described it &mdash; is proving strong enough to deal with the current problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the last part of the Deputy's question when I said it would be preferable if there was a specialty provision in the UK legislation so that we could bring it in here.  If we bring in such a requirement on our own it will mean there will be no further extradition from this country in regard to a whole range of criminal activities.  I do not think anyone would want that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the strain put on extradition arrangements and the need for a speedy resolution of the problem, the speedy resolution is in the hands of the British authorities and not in my hands in regard to any appeal they must bring forward against the decision of their magistrate to add two further charges without our agreement.</P>

The operation has been excellent.

Last week, subsequent to the publication of the A and B legislative programme list of the Government, the Minister for the Environment, grouping 40 separate parliamentary questions together, said that most of their content would be the subject of a Housing Bill which he proposed to introduce shortly to the House.  The following day, in the Custom House, he released an expansively printed document outlining the contents of that Bill.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
      <P>The Dáil debate on the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides all parties in the House with the opportunity of approving the broad thrust of economic and social policy as set out in the programme for this decade.</P>
      <P>I urge approval of the programme by the House because it builds on the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and maintains the consensus approach to economic and social planning, it provides the basis for continued social progress throughout this difficult decade and its economic and social provisions will transform Irish society into a more prosperous, more equitable and more enterprising society.</P>
      <P>The achievements of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are clear to all. The country was rescued, just in time, from economic and financial crisis which threatened our economic viability.  The national debt has doubled in four years, employment was rapidly decreasing, taxation was growing unsutainably, investment was steadily declining, business confidence was at a low ebb, and capital was leaving the country at a rate which undermined the stability of our exchange rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years later we can clearly see the benefits of the consensus approach adopted in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The national debt has been held at £25 billion, the debt/GNP ratio has been reduced by 20 percentage points since 1987 and the Exchequer borrowing requirement by almost 11 percentage points as compared with 1986.  Economic growth of an annual average rate of 4 per cent was achieved compared with GNP growth of less than 1 per cent in the preceding three years.  Unemployment fell by 20,000 but, more importantly, there was a net increase of 40,000 in <Col N="722" /> employment including a net increase of 70,000 in the private non-agricultural sector.  Income tax was reduced, the standard and top rates by 5 per centage points in each case, personal and PAYE allowances increased, the standard and 48 per cent bands extended and tax exemption limits raised.  Social welfare recipients, particularly the long term unemployed, received substantial increases in real terms.</P>
    <P>The biggest achievement of the programme was that it created a low inflation competitive economy which is essential for economic progress and is the only basis on which we can increase employment and reduce unemployment and emigration.  All this was possible due to the willingness of the major economic and social interests in our society to establish an agreement on the policies necessary to restore the public finances and secure economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>The success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been hailed internationally. I have already drawn the attention of the House to the judgement of the EC Commission in their Annual Economic Report that &ldquo;the most spectacular results were achieved in Ireland&rdquo;. <i>The Guardian</i> has also recently referred to &ldquo;the continuing Irish economic miracle&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the approach to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the success it achieved because it is that success which encouraged the Government and the social partners to embark on a new programme to succeed it and to negotiate this <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which I now commend to this House for approval. Naturally there were some who were sceptical of the merits of the first programme when it was debated here over three years ago.  I would hope that its proven success will encourage the House generally to take a constructive and approving view of this successor programme.</P>
    <P>The second reason I commend this new programme to the House is that it continues the spirit of consensus and social harmony established by the preceding <Col N="723" /> programme.  A small open internationally trading economy like ours can best advance in prosperity if the main economic and social interests recognise and accept the benefits of a united approach.  We all want the best possible education for our children, job opportunities to match their skills and abilities, a growing standard of living, an end to involuntary emigration, satisfactory access to a high standard of modern health care and adequate social welfare provision for those who become disadvantaged or deprived.  All this is possible through greater economic growth which, in turn, means that all interests in the economy must combine together to make Ireland a low cost competitive and efficient economy.</P>
    <P>It is surely welcome and encouraging that our trade unions, employers and farmers united in both these programmes to make Ireland, by their common efforts in co-operation with the Government, a more prosperous and more just society.  I am optimistic that Deputies will respond positively to what has been achieved and consider that the new programme deserves every support and success.  Our history has been too often marked by disunity of effort and purpose.  In these two programmes we have turned away from aggressive confrontation and look forward to a decade of common purpose and concerted effort to make Ireland a much better place for us all.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the content of the new programme, I would like to comment on the fact that a number of Deputies in recent discussions in the House have expressed concern that these types of programme represent a diminution of the functions of the Oireachtas.  I think that the concern of Deputies in this regard is entirely unjustified.  In the first place, it is and always has been the function of Government to draw up programmes for economic and social progress.  Economic and social planning has for many years been an accepted instrument of Government here and in almost every other Western European parliamentary democracy.  In this country <Col N="724" /> it has been adopted by successive governments, some I may say with more success than others.  It is now a well recognised, normal procedure for Governments in the course of drawing up such plans or programmes to consult with the different interests and groups in our society.</P>
    <P>Essentially the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and this programme do not differ from previous plans or programmes in that they are drawn up by Government in an approach of consulting with major economic and social interests. Without that such plans and programmes would have little hope of success.  In return for the commitments made by Government in this programme in economic and social policy areas the social partners have themselves made a number of vital, realistic commitments on key issues.</P>
    <P>The prerogatives of the Oireachtas are not impinged upon or infringed by this programme any more than they were under previous programmes.  To give effect to many of the commitments under the programme the Government will require financial and legislative approval by the Oireachtas.  I do not delude myself that, if the House gives overall approval to this programme when we come before the House in due course for financial or legislative approval for individual items, we will not be subjected to criticism, scrutiny and the rigours of parliamentary debate.  We can, in principle, be prevented by Parliament from giving effect to provisions in the programme when we come for specific parliamentary approval to individual provisions.  It has been said that some of the provisions extend beyond the lifetime of the Government. It is normal for Governments to make financial and legislative proposals which extend beyond the lifetime of a Government. Any succeeding Government are free to propose amending proposals and would in such cases enter into the necessary negotiations with the social partners to vary the programme.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no infringement or diminution of the prerogatives of the Oireachtas by the negotiations of the last <Col N="725" /> two programmes or by any of their predecessors. In fact, it could be argued that if, as some Deputies have urged, the political parties should become involved in the negotiations outside this House that would in effect transfer outside this House the political debate which is properly the function of Parliament.  It would require the Oireachtas to rubber-stamp economic and social policies which the political parties would have already agreed in another forum outside the House.  That would really diminish the status and function of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Finally, on this topic, let me point out that there is no certainty that the social partners would be prepared to enter into negotiations involving representatives of political parties as distinct from the Government.  In fact, I understand that the National Economic and Social Council have indicated that council members are of view that the council should remain as currently constituted and that they should not have participation, whether by membership or observer status, by representatives of political parties.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Opposition Deputies are impressed by a procedure whereby the Government and the social partners are able to agree on an agenda to transform Irish society in this decade.  Their role is the political role, the prerogative of Parliaments is to assess Government proposals, policies and agreements negotiated and to approve, amend or reject them.</P>
    <P>I would like in this context to deal also with the amendments to the motion put down by the Opposition parties proposing, <i>inter alia</i>, that an economic and social affairs committee of the Oireachtas or a Dáil review mechanism be established in order, in the words of the Labour Party amendment, &ldquo;to complement the important work of the social partners with a clear and representative democratic mandate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot accept these amendments.  The programme is now before the House for approval.  Such approval gives the ultimate democratic mandate to the programme.  The specific <Col N="726" /> legislative, financial and administrative provisions of the programme will come in due course before the House for discussion and decision in the ordinary course of parliamentary procedure.  Furthermore, the central Review Committee under the programme will publish periodic progress reports.  I am prepared to undertake to have these reports debated in the House whenever there is a request to do so.  Furthermore, Deputies can through the democratic process of the parliamentary question seek information from members of the Government on an ongoing basis about developments as regards specific provisions in the programme. I see no practical value, therefore, in duplicating what can be dealt with in the ordinary course of business in this House by establishing the suggested economic and social affairs committee or Dáil review mechanism.</P>
    <P>I reject the implication in the Labour Party amendment that a programme of this nature, if approved by the House and with all the other parliamentary processes that individual provisions must undergo, could lack a clear and representative democratic mandate.  The direct opposite is the case.  There can be nothing with a greater representative democratic mandate than a programme approved by the Government and, hopefully, by all the representative organisations who are party to it and by this House.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the principal provisions of the programme.</P>
    <P>Essential to the growth of our economy is that we maintain firm control of our public finances so that there is a steady reduction in the ratio of national debt to GNP.  That was an objective which the Government and the social partners agreed on and achieved under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and which is now continued in this programme. Specific targets have been established of reducing the debt-GNP ratio to about 100 per cent by 1993 and, as part of this, to achieve a broad balance on the Exchequer current account.  No other course will ensure the lowest possible interest rates and inflation, two essential conditions for enterprise and investment <Col N="727" /> to grow.  I am sure that there are few, if any, Deputies in the House who would not approve of these objectives of the programme having regard to the havoc wrought upon our economy by uncontrolled public expenditure and a spiralling national debt of former years.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear that throughout the programme there can be no weakening of that firm fiscal framework.  Without it, we risk rising interest and inflation rates, lower real incomes, declining standards of living and collapse of the investment needed to create and sustain jobs.</P>
    <P>To support the policy of macro-economic stability, the programme provides for restraint on pay for the coming three years.  Everyone now recognises that the pay restraint of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> contributed greatly to the lowering of inflation which, together with the income tax reductions under that programme, significantly increased real take-home pay and thereby directly improved living standards.  There is no benefit for anyone in high nominal pay increases which are outpaced by inflation. We see examples of that in other economies. I think that one of our most satisfactory achievements in the past three and a half years has been to have broken out of that spiral of rising prices which so harassed and angered housewives trying to manage family budgets which were being constantly undermined by rising prices.</P>
    <P>The pay increases provided for in the programme are fair and reasonable in that they will maintain our competitive costs in relation to our trading partners while ensuring that employees can expect, with the further income tax reductions provided for in the programme, a significant improvement in their living standards.  A special feature of the pay provisions &mdash; as it was in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; is that those on low incomes will receive proportionately higher pay increases than those on higher incomes.  These higher pay increases for those on low incomes will be further increased by the bigger family income supplement payments <Col N="728" /> which were such a socially-important innovation in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the reductions in income tax provided for in the programme.  This continues the process we began in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> under which more than £800 million in income tax reliefs were provided mainly by reducing the standard rate from 35 per cent to 30 per cent and the top rate from 58 per cent to 53 per cent.  This process will now be continued so that by 1993 the standard rate will be 25 per cent and there will be a single higher rate of 48 per cent.  This and related reforms will reduce income tax further by £400 million in current terms in a full year.</P>
    <P>This reform &mdash; and there is no greater reform in tax matters than to reduce the burden &mdash; is revolutionary as compared with the long history of increasing income taxation in the years prior to 1987.  It has been possible only because of the consensus approach which controlled public expenditure, restrained pay and caused the rebirth of growth in what had been a stagnant economy.  Lower taxation lowers inflation, improves standards of living and generates confidence and enterprise.  That is our objective in the income tax provisions of this programme, as in its predecessor.  I commend that part of it strongly to the House.</P>
    <P>The programme also envisages continuation of the process already begun of harmonisation of indirect taxation with our Community partners.  The eventual form the harmonised structure of indirect taxation will take is not yet clear.  The programme makes clear that we will approach the community discussions with a view to ensuring that the burden of adjustment is not borne disproportionately by member states which have traditionally, and for wider social and economic reasons, relied upon indirect tax revenues.  The programme also envisages an increased contribution from capital taxes, continued improvement in our already very successful programme of improving tax administration, <Col N="729" /> collection and enforcement and sustained pressure on the black economy.</P>
    <P>It is our intention that the social reform provisions of the programme will profoundly change the equity and quality of our society and I believe they will. Successive Governments have built up our social services which, given the resources of our economy, compare well with those in other comparable economies. But, in too many respects, our social services have deficiencies, inequities and imperfections which we are now committed in this programme to eliminate.</P>
    <P>Our education system must provide the opportunity for all to develop their potential to the full.  Only the highest standards in educational instruction and facilities can satisfy us.  All children must be given equal opportunity.  Only as a highly educated and skilled people can we achieve the standard of living to which we rightfully aspire.</P>
    <P>The programme, therefore, contains a comprehensive series of measures which we have worked out with the teacher unions which will greatly enhance the quality of our educational system.  The principal measures will ensure: improving pupil-teacher ratios; greater resources to remedy disadvantage in education; extra vice-principal and guidance posts in post-primary schools; a sixyear cycle of post-primary education; in-service training of teachers; expansion of caretaking and clerical services in primary and post-primary schools; provision of an extra 8,800 third-level places to respond to rightful additional demand for higher education; upgrading or replacement by 1997 of all substandard school buildings; expansion of continuing and adult education and measures to improve access to third-level education particularly by those from disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>A Green Paper on Education will be issued by the summer of this year to be followed by a White Paper early in 1992 and then by an Education Act.  Youth services will be kept under review in consultation with the social partners and youth organisations.  The role of parents <Col N="730" /> is recognised and their involvement will be promoted.</P>
    <P>These measures represent a coherent and comprehensive set of measures which, pursued throughout the decade, will ensure we have an educational system second to none, geared to the needs and opportunities of the modern world and, most important of all, accessible to all.</P>
    <P>We have similarly decided to overhaul radically and reorient the health services so that they are comprehensive, equitable and efficient and so that the patients' interests are central.  The principal measures include: development of community-based medicine which will develop and expand services for the elderly, the physically and mentally handicapped or disabled and children, and will establish local health centres and expand the dental services.  This programme will be developed over seven years commencing with the provision of £8 million made in this year's budget; reforming eligibility for hospital services so that all inequity of access to hospital treatment is removed; continued support for Voluntary Health Insurance; uniformity and consistency in assessment for medical cards; rationalisation of the administration and management of the health services; improvement of women's health services; a charter of patients' rights; better and more comprehensive health promotion and controlling the cost of drugs by price reduction and changes in prescribing practices.</P>
    <P>This programme of reform which takes account of various studies and reports on the health services will ensure that our standards of medical care are organised and oriented equitably and efficiently towards the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare services are already highly developed.  This has been our response over the years to an economic and social structure characterised by relatively low incomes, exceptionally high dependency ratios, large families and high unemployment.  Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, we set out to make significant real increases in <Col N="731" /> our social welfare rates.  Long-term benefits were increased in three years by 27 per cent.  As a society, we already devote a higher proportion of our resources to social welfare than the OECD average. This reflects our fundamental commitment as a caring society.  We recognise, however, that those forced to live on social welfare benefits particularly those with large families deserve, as our economy grows, to share in the rising living standards of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The programme, therefore, contains a Government commitment for the first time to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  By 1993, all benefit rates will be brought up to the priority rates recommended by the commission and the full rates recommended by the commission will, thereafter, be applied as the resources of the economy grow.  This will represent a major improvement over time in the living standards of those in receipt of social welfare benefit.  The full improvement cannot be made overnight as the cost in 1990 would be £327 million but it will be made steadily as a priority claim on our growing economy.</P>
    <P>We will make other improvements in our social welfare system under the programme. These include extension of social insurance to part-time workers, improved child income support and the major improvement in family income supplement announced in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>There is a major debate in our society about the incidence of poverty.  We are not among the wealthy societies but we already devote a higher proportion of our resources to social welfare than betteroff countries.  Our record as a society in this matter is not one to be decried or denigrated.  The Government under this programme are giving priority in the allocation of resources to making a new major contribution to reducing the incidence of poverty.</P>
    <P>Decent accommodation is a major necessity of life.  We have a record in social housing which is second to none in the world.  As an independent State, we <Col N="732" /> were left a fearful economic and social legacy in what were among the worst slums in Europe.  We have successfully eliminated that major social evil.</P>
    <P>In the programme, we have now outlined a housing policy for the nineties which will ensure every household a dwelling suitable to its needs.  Increased funding for local authority housing and new forms of social housing are part of that policy.  We will eliminate homelessness and ensure that the accommodation needs of the travelling people are met.  We will also ensure that reasonable safeguards are introduced to protect tenants in the private rented sector while encouraging continued investment in that sector.</P>
    <P>On employment, the programme continues and expands the successful policies of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which reversed the downward trend in employment.  The approach is twofold. First, to create the low-inflation economic conditions which stimulate investment and enterprise and make us competitive in our trading markets. Secondly, to develop, by special measures and incentives the sectors with potential for increasing employment. Our exports have been growing at a rate unprecedented in our history so that we have had a balance of payments surplus for the past four years.  This has not only increased employment in our exporting industries but the balance of payments surplus has supported the stability of our exchange rate, itself a significant positive aid to our trading enterprises.</P>
    <P>Our sectoral approach has been highly successful.  Tourism, financial services, forestry, construction are all sectors in which the policies continued in this programme are giving increased employment.</P>
    <P>In the manufacturing sector the programme will continue to generate 20,000 new jobs annually as the previous programme did.  Here again, the low-cost low-inflation competitive conditions created by the programme will enable us to continue to attract overseas investors at the high rate of the past four years. <Col N="733" /> The development of indigenous exporting industry will be a firm priority under the programme.  The objective of industrial policy is to increase by 100 over the decade the number of Irish manufacturing companies having an annual turnover greater than £5 million in real terms.</P>
    <P>We cannot be complacent about our employment targets.  We suffer very high unemployment by comparison with many other countries because our labour force has a natural annual increase of 1.8 per cent as compared with 1.0 per cent for Community countries generally.  In most other Community countries now, the population has stabilised and the number leaving the labour force on retirement and death is roughly equalled by those entering it.  We have, therefore, a formidable task to create new employment at a rate which will absorb our exceptionally rapid growth in the labour force. We cannot solve it by increasing public expenditure specifically to create jobs. We have learned that lesson.  We can only do so by the policies contained in this programme.</P>
    <P>Our response to the long term unemployed may well come to be recognised as the most fundamental change brought about by this programme.  We are establishing a new integrated partnership between the local community and public agencies to remedy the social deprivation that exists in many black spot areas and to increase the job chances of those who are long term unemployed or who are in danger of becoming so.  The new strategy spelled out in the programme will enable the public agencies, the social partners and local communities to band together in local companies which will tackle in a comprehensive way the social and employment problems of their local communities.</P>
    <P>For people who are unfortunate enough to find themselves with a disability, we have set down a series of significant positive and constructive measures to improve the quality of life and the possibility of obtaining employment. The Government will examine, in consultation with the ICTU and the <Col N="734" /> organisations representing people with disabilities, how best the right of the disabled individual can be promoted.</P>
    <P>In the area of equality we have a series of positive measures that can be implemented now.  The work of the Second Commission on the Status of Women will provide a positive and constructive input to improving the position of women in our society.</P>
    <P>The programme also sets out objectives for the development of agriculture and the maintenance of farm viability.  The agriculture and food industry continue to be of central importance to the Irish economy.  I want to reiterate that.  I have given that assurance to the farmers.  They require reasonably favourable economic conditions especially with regard to inflation and interest rates, if they are to compete in a more difficult and challenging external environment and cope with the changes that are likely to emerge from present developments. The programme recognises the importance of negotiating compensatory arrangements in the form of increased EC-funded income supports orientated towards the family farm, as well as the need to promote structural reforms.  Our overriding shared objective is to maintain as many farm families in the countryside as possible with acceptable income levels, recognising that family income in many cases will not come exclusively from farming, while at the same time promoting an Irish food industry of high quality and efficiency.  It is very important at this time of uncertainty to maintain confidence and motivation among farmers, and the best way to do this is undoubtedly full participation in the national programme, so that problems, anticipated or unforeseen, can be dealt with in a mutually supportive framework operating at the very highest level.</P>
    <P>In debating this programme in the House, I hope all will acknowledge the gratitude we own to the trade unions, employer bodies and farming organisations for coming together with Government to negotiate this programme. It was not easy for them.  In such negotiations, there are always gains <Col N="735" /> and losses to be weighed.  In the case of the trade unions, and the employers, their memberships will be meeting later this week to consider ratifying the programme. I understand that the FIE have already approved the programme.</P>
    <P>It has been an historic development that the social partners have reached such a comprehensive, radical and beneficial consensus in regard to the direction and content of our economic and social policies. Let us recognise that in this House. In doing so, we should also recognise that the National Economic and Social Council by its painstaking research and its process of free discussion between the social partners laid the foundations for this programme and its predecessor.  We should, therefore, in this debate also express our thanks and appreciation for the work of the members and staff of the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by emphasising to the House the importance of the decision we will make by approving this programme. It will continue the stability of the public finances and the economy in the face of challenging world trends.  It will give us a competitive base from which to expand our output and increase employment.  It will enable our economy to grow &mdash; the only way in which we can improve our living standards.  It will enable us to become a more just and equitable society sharing fairly the fruits of our increasing prosperity.  It will, above all, enable us to face the challenges and opportunities of a changing world, united in our policies and objectives at all levels of society This is the essential principle that a small nation, confident of its abilities, should adopt and this programme is the embodiment of that principle.</P>

      <P>Dáil Éireann is being asked to approve the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  This programme was approved, finalised and printed over a month ago.  The Dáil had no part whatever in its preparation but is now being asked to accept it lock, stock and barrel just the same.  The Dáil is not being given the opportunity in this debate <Col N="736" /> to amend even a comma or a full stop; we are being asked by the Government simply to say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to the document.</P>
      <P>Apart from the issue of public sector pay and pay in general, this programme is no longer even a matter of public debate.  It was subsumed in the debate on the Government's 1991 budget and given the relatively neutral character of that budget the public debate on it lasted about 24 hours.  At this late stage, when the debate was concluded almost everywhere else, Dáil Éireann, the elected assembly of the Irish people, is finally being asked to discuss and approve, without amendment, a programme that was negotiated elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I believe that in a democracy legitimacy stems from one place only, that is, the ballot box on polling day.  I believe that the job of Dáil Éireann goes beyond simply meeting after an election to appoint a Government and taking no constructive part in public affairs thereafter, apart from occasional carping and criticism after the event about what the Government are doing.  Unfortunately, this Government see the role of Dáil Éireann as no more than that.  Once they put in the Government it is for that Government to agree things with everybody else and present these agreements for the unamended approval of this House.  It is because the present Government have this very limited view of the role of Dáil Éireann that Fianna Fáil in particular have never shown any interest at all in attempting to reform Dáil Éireann.  It is also because of this very limited view of the constructive function of Dáil Éireann that the Government have presented to us today for unamended approval, long after the event, a programme which they agreed with others outside this House, whose mandate, however valid, does not stem from the ballot box.</P>
      <P>Referring to the role of Deputies, the Taoiseach in his speech today stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their role is the political role, the prerogative of Parliaments is to assess Government proposals, policies and <Col N="737" /> agreements negotiated and to approve, amend or reject them.</P>
    <P>A debate of this kind which consists of a series of monologues, each Member speaking to increasingly empty benches, each speech broadly unrelated to the previous one, does not provide the type of forum we need for any kind of assessment of something put forward by the Government. If we want an assessment we should have a committee where there could be discussion between one side and the other, where Government could be questioned and give answers in regard to particular provisions in the programme. This debate with its series of monologues does not provide a means for assessment &mdash; to use the Taoiseach's own word &mdash; of the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the role of Parliaments is to approve, amend or reject proposals.  Certainly we can approve or reject these proposals but there is no provision in this debate for Dáil Éireann to amend the proposals in any way.  Even taking the Taoiseach's own limited conception of the role of Parliament in this matter, this debate does not live up to that because we do not have the capacity either to assess the proposals in a realistic way or to amend them.  We must either accept <i>in toto</i> or reject <i>in toto</i>.</P>
    <P>From a political point of view, one of the interesting things about today's proceedings, and perhaps the only element of news, is the position being adopted by the third party in the State &mdash; the Labour Party.  The Labour Party have decided in their addendum to the Government motion that they will back Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in their <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>In that regard, will Deputy Bruton please avail of the opportunity to move his own amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to do so, if it is in order.  It fits into the structure of my speech.  The Labour Party accept the <Col N="738" /> Government motion <i>in toto</i> and seem to accept in full the words proposed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to the effect that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann approved the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress&rdquo;</i>.  The Labour Party merely wish to tag on to the Government motion the establishment of a Dáil committee to monitor how Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will implement their policies on this matter. This is quite a change from the attitude of the Labour Party during the period 1987-89 and their often virulent condemnations of the Tallaght strategy. Roles, perhaps, have changed.</P>
      <P>Let me tell this House why I and my party are not prepared to accept this programme lock, stock and barrel, as are Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats: we do not accept that the programme necessarily meets all the problems faced by this country.  We say that quite clearly in our amendment which I will now move.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notes that the Government has concluded an agreement with the social partners on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
      <P>Notes the Fine Gael proposal of January 1989 for a National Forum for 1992 involving all the Oireachtas political parties together with the social partners long term economic and social planning.</P>
      <P>Affirms its support for the concept of social partnership as a means of promoting long term economic and social development.</P>
      <P>Congratulates the social partners on reaching agreement on pay levels over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrets that the current programme was drafted without any involvement of Oireachtas Éireann or of elected representatives generally, apart from some members of the Cabinet, and that many interests in society, notably <Col N="739" /> young people, dependent spouses, the homeless, the unemployed and the non-agricultural self-employed, were not represented in direct discussions on the programme.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the provisions in the programme in regard to the health service will have the effect of increasing the pressure on hospital beds and of lengthening queues for services.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the Government's 1991 Budget is not consistent with the achievement of the fiscal targets set in the programme, and that the programme omits essential information as to how the spending and tax commitments contained in it are to be reconciled with the target of broad balance on the current budget.</P>
    <P>Stresses its alarm that the economic projections in the programme, and the policies of the Government as expressed in the programme, will not lead to any reduction in the level of unemployment or emigration, and may well increase both, and that the industrial policies in the programme are not the ones best suited to establishing research-intensive autonomous industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the particular income tax proposals in the programme make no provision at all to widen the tax bands and thereby to reduce the excessively high marginal tax rates facing low and middle income workers.</P>
    <P>Regrets that the programme contains no commitment to long term structural reform, with a view to creating employment, in areas such as tax policy, food and agricultural policy, the public service, education and social welfare,</P>
    <P>and in view of the foregoing, directs the Government to establish an Economic and Social Committee of Oireachtas Éireann, involving members of all recognised groups, which would:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> 1.  review the content of the programme;</P>
    <P>2.  put forward remedies for its deficiencies;</P>
    <P>3.  nominate representatives of Oireachtas Éireann to sit on the National Economic and Social Council;</P>
    <P>4.  discuss how the programme ought to be adjusted in the event of the assumptions for growth and tax revenue underlying it not being reached;</P>
    <P>5.  participate, on behalf of Oireachtas Éireann, in the consultations leading to the drafting of any future programmes for economic and social progress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While we accept parts of the programme, we do not accept other parts of it.  As the main Opposition party in this House, we will not agree to accept the programme lock, stock and barrel and in view of this we propose that Dáil Éireann should direct the Government to establish an economic and social committee of Oireachta Éireann involving members of all recognised groups which would perform the five functions listed in the amendment on behalf of Dáil and Seanad.  It is fair to say that the assumptions in regard to growth and tax revenue are extremely optimistic and may well not be reached and, therefore, it would be appropriate that the Dáil should have an opportunity to participate in any discussion on adjustments that may have to be made if these optimistic assumptions are not reached.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a need for an amendment such as this to be supported.  I do not accept that we must take everything in this programme as a package.  One cannot accept the spending proposals in a programme like this, as three of the other parties in the House seem to do, without also accepting the implied cuts and the implied extra taxes that will have to be imposed, if the Taoiseach's words at the press conference are true, to pay for these specific proposals.  There are very specific proposals for reductions in <Col N="741" /> tax, very specific proposals for increases in expenditure and a very specific statement from the Taoiseach that money will have to be found to pay for these, and the budget will have to be balanced by 1993, but no information whatever about how the money will be found to bridge that gap.  Those who vote for this programme are also voting for the increases in taxes and the cuts in spending that will have to take place in order to pay for the commitments that are being entered into in this programme.  They are voting for it and they are accepting those parameters, and I will ensure that they are reminded of their decision in that regard.</P>
    <P>On various occasions, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats have all expressed deep anxiety about the problem of unemployment.  I have not the slightest doubt that these anxieties were and are entirely sincere. Yet, the programme which all these three political parties are prepared to approve tomorrow night lock, stock and barrel, actually accept that unemployment and emigration will be as high in three years time as they are today.  The National Economic and Social Council estimates that even economic growth over the next three years is almost twice as much as the Government themselves project for this year and there will still be emigration of 19,000 a year in three years time and unemployment in 1994 at the same level as today.  That is the reality, what will actually happen under the programme which many seem to be rushing to approve.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> supported by Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party produces no coherent strategy to overcome the unemployment problem.  The National Economic and Social Council expressed the view that there should be a strong attack on unemployment black spots through a system of area based job creation.  What does the programme suggest in that regard? All the programme produces is a few underfinanced and tepid pilot schemes in section 7 of the document.  These <Col N="742" /> schemes will probably not be up and running 12 months from now and they are likely to make little or no impact on the overall unemployment problem.  Yet, for that small commitment to unemployment, the three parties in this House are prepared to endorse the programme as being sufficient in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>In my view this programme is not sufficient in regard to the problem of unemployment. This programme is not sufficient in regard to the problem of emigration.  It is not good enough, and it is not true, as the Taoiseach said today, that there is no alternative.  There seem to be echoes of the former British Prime Minister who was known as &ldquo;Tina&rdquo;&mdash; there is no alternative.  He said there was no alternative to his policy because in regard to unemployment he says that we can only deal with the problem by the policies contained in this programme. The Taoiseach is saying there is no other possibility, no other approach to the problem of unemployment, other than the one contained in this programme. That, as we know, was the attitude of the former British Prime Minister.  It did not solve unemployment in Britain and I do not believe this proclaimed exclusivity of knowledge in regard to policy which now seems to unite 93 Deputies in this House behind this programme will actually solve the problems of unemployment and emigration. The complacency in this House about unemployment and emigration, where those who are already in employment are endorsing a programme that would certainly be beneficial to them, will not solve the problem of the excluded in our society.  As far as I am concerned, Fine Gael will continue to speak from the Opposition benches for those who are excluded from the benefits of the current consensus that seem to unite so many others in the ark in front of me.</P>
    <P>If one accepts this programme one must accept it in its entirely.  This programme says that the aim of fiscal policy will be &ldquo;to achieve broad balance on the current budget in 1993&rdquo;.  In other words, there will be no borrowing for current <Col N="743" /> purposes.  Now, as Deputy Garret FitzGerald illustrated in the Dáil last Thursday, the true current budget deficit for 1991 is actually £350 million or 1.5 per cent of GNP, and we have to eliminate that by 1993, according to the programme. I compliment Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats on their commitment to eliminating all borrowing for current purposes by 1993 because that is what they are doing if they endorse this programme.  Unfortunately, however, the programme fails to tell us how this is to be done.  It tells us indeed that expenditure and borrowing is to be increased, but it does not tell us how it is to be reduced.  Yet, that is what the programme commits itself to do.  It tells us nothing at all about where the cuts and tax increases are to be made.</P>
    <P>If that fiscal target of eliminating current budget borrowing by 1993 is to be achieved two things must be done.  First, the existing borrowing for this year of £350 million must be eliminated.  Second, money has to be found to pay for £550 million worth of tax reductions and expenditure increases contained in this programme.  There is not a single measure in this programme to contribute towards the cost of those two commitments. Let me add them up &mdash; £350 million is this year's deficit plus £550 million which is the commitment to expenditure or tax reductions contained in the programme.  That adds up to £900 million.  This programme, if it accepts the concept of a current balanced budget in 1993, is accepting that there has to be either £900 million worth of tax increases between now and 1993 or £900 million worth of expenditure cuts between now and 1993, or a combination of the two, and we are not told in this debate where a penny of that is to be found.  Yet, approval for that proposition is something which unites Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party.  I do not believe it is appropriate that the House should accept such a one-sided presentation, where all the goodies are up front and none of the costs is revealed at all.  If this House approves <Col N="744" /> this programme, it is implicity approving cuts or tax increases of a magnitude of £900 million between now and 1993 and I hope that the parties who are now so keen to bask in the reflected approval of the trade unions, the farmers and the employers, as expressed in this programme, realise what they are agreeing to.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no developmental vision in this programme and there is no attempt to mobilise the imagination or the creativity of the Irish people to overcome the problem of unemployment. There is no attempt, for example, to change the climate of Irish industrial relations by aggressively promoting workers' shareholding and profit sharing. There is no attempt to remove the complex poverty traps in the means testing system for health services, differential rents, PRSI payments, for income tax and family income supplement, which makes it pointless for many families to try to work that bit harder.  There is no attempt in this programme to introduce a system of training such as exists in Germany where there is a systematic programme of apprenticeships for entry to all trades.  In fact, we are to continue on with the limited and narrow system of apprenticeship which we have had for many years.  There is no imagination in this programme.</P>
    <P>This programme is not a plan for the development and expansion of Ireland plc.  This programme is an essay in entropy, a study in statis, a document which says do not bother.  Ireland plc is not to be managed, not to be led, not to be expanded and energised &mdash; it is to be left alone.  All critics outside Dáil Éireann are to be brought off.  We are to have a cobbled-up consensus which does not stretch the imagination, or the productive resources, of any of the social partners. It is based on the lackadaisical principle that if you cannot do the economy a good turn, do not do it a bad turn &mdash; the do nothing, say nothing, let sleeping dogs lie economic policy of Fianna Fáil.  That is the policy which two other parties in the Dáil are tomorrow night prepared to endorse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> As I have said, this is a programme designed to let economic sleeping dogs lie.  Sleeping dogs on Irish roads frequently get run over.  Sleeping dogs should be asked to get up and run.</P>
    <P>Economics is not about saving money, it is about using money.  There is nothing in this programme which represents a creative vision about how our capital, our money, our labour, and our land, could be used better to achieve more.  The low level of activity that has been endemic in this country and insufficient for the employment of our people for 20 years is quite simply accepted, and it now appears to be endorsed not only by the social partners but by three of the five political parties in this House.</P>
    <P>As the Fine Gael amendment to this motion says, we support the concept of social partnership.  We believe that the pay terms in this programme are good and reasonable from the point of view of the commercial sector of our economy. The pay terms for the public service are also reasonable, and the special pay increases which have been postponed up to now must be paid.  We do feel, however, that the Government ought to have taken the opportunity of re-examining the present arbitration arrangements in the public service.  These arbitration arrangements create a succession of leap-frogging special pay claims.  These claims are approved by arbitrators, whose terms of reference presently exclude any consideration of the state of the public finances or the overall fiscal targets of the Government. I acknowledge that in this programme there is an overall cap on these increases for the next three years but I would have expected that the Government would have sought to re-examine the underlying terms of reference of the arbitrator, in return for immediate pay increases.  I think that this, from a long term point of view, would have been a very good deal, and money well spent, because it would have made a permanent structural change rather than effecting simply a temporary patching-up operation.</P>
    <P>The economic assumptions underlying the programme are vulnerable on a <Col N="746" /> number of fronts: as is the 1991 budget, this programme is based on very optimistic projections for economic growth. If these projections are not realised the tax receipts projected in the programme will be lower and the expenditure provisions higher than projected and the economy will descend into a vortex.</P>
    <P>The programme takes no account of the prospective extra costs to the economy arising from higher international interest rates, nor does it take adequate account of the almost certain dramatic cut in the value of Irish food exports as a result of the EC Commission proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The industrial policy which underlies this programme is, in my view, a mistake. It is based on the idea of tax incentives designed to encourage foreign industrialists to establish assembly-type plants here in Ireland.  That policy has quite simply not worked as far as employment is concerned.  It is a policy which encourages high output and high repatriated profits but low employment.</P>
    <P>I wonder do people realise that between 1980 and 1990 Ireland had the highest rate of growth in manufacturing output of all OECD countries?  Manufacturing output over that decade rose by 98.4 per cent.  The next highest increase for manufacturing output in the OECD countries in the 1980s was for Portugal which had barely a 49 per cent increase as against our 98.4 per cent increase.  All other OECD countries achieved even less &mdash; Austria 34 per cent, the Netherlands 30 per cent, Belgium 24 per cent, Britain 22 per cent, Germany 22 per cent, down to 10 per cent in France and 4 per cent in Greece.  This compares with our 98 per cent increase in output. Yet despite this huge increase in output over the 1980s, we still have the highest rate of unemployment in Europe.  That industrial policy simply has not worked as a means of solving the unemployment problem, and this programme accepts that this policy will continue until the year 2010.  The output is being produced, the profits are being made, the profits are being exported, but the jobs created here are insufficient.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> This is a direct result of a single central mistake in industrial policy.  This mistake is one of guaranteeing a low corporate tax rate of 10 per cent up to the year 2010.  The Fianna Fáil policy of guaranteeing that corporation profits tax on manufacturing will not exceed 10 per cent up to the year 2010 is quite simply perverse from the point of view of a country which needs employment, not high profits and high output.  We should instead have a tax policy that would encourage foreign companies to locate labour or brain-intensive parts of their business here in Ireland, rather than output and profit-intensive parts as is encouraged by the 10 per cent tax policy.</P>
    <P>If we want foreign firms to create really permanent jobs in Ireland, we must get them to set up their research and their marketing operations here.  It is only if the brain-based part of the business is in Ireland, that jobs will be really secure. But a 10 per cent tax policy actually discourages the location of labour or brain-intensive parts of a business in Ireland. This is because marketing and research cost money.  Things that cost money can be set off against tax, so the lower the tax rate the less of anything that costs money will be located here.  The last place where a company will want to locate its research and development facilities is in a country where it has its lowest tax rate in its overall multinational operation. Likewise the last place that a company would want to locate its marketing, which is a cost centre in a business, is where it has its lowest corporate tax rate; it will certainly locate its manufacturing plant here, which generates high profits and low costs, but it will not locate the central strategic part of the business, research and development, marketing, the brain-based rather than the brawn-based part of the business, here.</P>
    <P>I believe it was a mistake on the part of Fianna Fáil to say that the 10 per cent corporate tax regime would be extended to the year 2010.  Certainly a commitment had been given up to the year 2000 and that commitment was and would have been adhered to by any Government <Col N="748" /> taking office in the intervening period, but it was an unnecessary mistake and a repetition of a central mistake in industrial policy which gave us high output and low employment to have extended that provision to the year 2010.  I am in favour of giving tax incentives to industry and I would not reduce the total value of tax incentives being given but I question the form in which they are being given. Foreign companies should be given direct incentives to invest in research and development, in marketing and in employment-intensive parts of their business rather than in the high output, high profit parts of their business.  This would make far more sense as an industrial policy for a country with high unemployment problems such as we have. Those who endorse this programme are endorsing a mistaken industrial policy.</P>
    <P>They are also endorsing a mistaken tax policy which is contained in the programme. The programme commits the Government explicitly to reductions in the rates of taxation and to increases in the exemption limits but there is no commitment whatever in it to widen the tax bands or to raise tax allowances. Clearly all the effort will be put into reducing the rates and no effort will be put into widening the tax bands or increasing the allowances.  The rate reduction will absorb all the available resources but the effect of that policy will be that many people will find they are moving from a lower tax rate into a higher tax rate when their income increases because the allowances and the bands will not have been indexed.  Lower and middle income workers under this tax policy will find that they will be paying more tax proportionately in three years' time than they pay now.  Obviously those already on the top rate of tax will benefit all the way under this tax policy because their rate of tax will come down and they will not be affected by the fact that tax bands and allowances are not being indexed.</P>
    <P>Those on higher incomes will do well as a result of this tax policy which three of the parties in the House are prepared to approve.  In many cases those on low or <Col N="749" /> middle incomes &mdash; the typical industrial worker &mdash; will lose under this tax policy. That is another reason why the Fine Gael Party &mdash; and I am glad to say another party in Opposition, represented by Deputy Sherlock &mdash; are not prepared to accept the tax policy proposed in this programme.  However, it would appear that 93 Deputies have actually accepted the tax policy of six Deputies.  The Progressive Democrats' tax policy has been enshrined in this document and is now accepted by Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.  It is a tax policy which, by concentrating all the improvements on reducing the rates and doing nothing about increasing the allowances or widening the tax bands, gives disproportionate benefits to the better off and gives little or no benefit to those on middle or lower incomes.  That is the policy which has been mistakenly endorsed by 93 Deputies but is not endorsed, I am proud to say, by the Fine Gael Party.  What time have I left?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the fact that the Government have accepted the Irish Congress of Trade Union's proposal to adopt a long term strategy for the development of this country over the next decade.  The ICTU proposal, which was supported by employer and farming organisations, indicates the emerging consensus in our <Col N="750" /> society for the need to manage our affairs efficiently and effectively within agreed parameters and constraints.  It is the Labour Party view that the over-riding priority of such a strategy should be the creation of an efficient and modern social market economy which would provide every individual in our society with the opportunity for personal growth and development.  Economic benefits derived from such a strategy must be shared, on an equitable basis, and no section of our society must be left behind as we move forward, together, in the last decade of this century.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> recently negotiated between the Government and the social partners covers a three year period from 1991 to 1993 inclusive.  For the vast majority of employers and employees &mdash; unlike some people in this House &mdash; it is essentially a national pay agreement which provides for pay increases not exceeding 4 per cent in 1991, 3 per cent in 1992 and 3.75 per cent in 1993.  There are special provisions for lower paid workers which would allow for basic increases of up to £15 per week over the three years.  In addition, to the national pay increases, employers and trade unions may agree to additional pay increases up to a ceiling of 3 per cent.  In the first appendix to the programme there is a draft agreement on pay and conditions between the ICTU and the employer organisations.  It is to the small print of this appendix that most workers have paid attention and it is on those pay and conditions that the delegate conference of the ICTU which will take place in Dublin on Thursday 21 February will be most concentrated.</P>
      <P>There are a number of additional proposals which directly or indirectly affect the pay and conditions for workers as set out in this programme over the next three years.  These include the improvements in the family income supplement and personal income tax reforms some of which have been given partial effect to in this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> The context within which the programme was negotiated and the pay component agreed was the international economic situation in which this country finds itself.  Following the major work undertaken by the NESC during the difficult period of the seventies and the eighties a major report entitled.  &ldquo;A Strategy for Development 1986-1990&rdquo;, Report No. 83 was published in November 1986. This report which followed many months of discussion between the social partners formed the basis for an agreed analysis of the opportunities and constraints which face the Irish economy in an increasingly competitive world.</P>
    <P>There is now a general recognition, on all sides, that we, as a nation, will have to earn our own prosperity.  To do so, we must, as a small open economy trading in a competitive world, produce goods and services which have a competitive advantage in terms of quality and cost. This realisation documented at length in the NESC report No. 83, and followed up in NESC's sequel report of 1989 a strategy for the nineties, lies at the core of the acceptance of the framework of financial constraint by the trade union movement as presented in the PESP.</P>
    <P>However &mdash; and I say this in the absence of the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; it should be stated quite clearly that not all sections of the trade union movement accept these constraints.  They believe that the individual worker, or group of workers, is entitled to the maximum return on the value of their labour, a view shared by many capitalists. They do not believe, and in many cases have reasons to substantiate this, that the restraint exercised by them will result in an improved performance by the company for which they work and ultimately, leading to them sharing in the enhanced benefits at some future date.  They do not believe that the Government have the social commitment to bring about the changes in the political sphere to which reference is made in the PESP.  For that reason they will remain sceptical of the programme if not completely opposed to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> A major justification for further scepticism is the massive failure of the PESP to significantly deal with the problem of long term unemployment.  In a document of over 90 pages less than four are devoted exclusively to the questions of employment and training.  The dramatic failure of the 1991 budget to focus on the issues of unemployment and in particular long term unemployment has been widely commented upon across the political spectrum.  Scepticism will remain if the Government continue to fail to deliver on the non pay elements of this programme.</P>
    <P>As I have said before in this House, there are approximately 66 measures listed and identified in the programme which involve the Oireachtas directly or indirectly for their delivery.  These include commitments to introduce new legislation and undertakings by the Government to make representations to the EC Commission for example, to carry out a rigorous examination of State aided schemes throughout the European Community which have an effect of hindering the work of the IDA here in Ireland.  All of these 66 measures and many more matters related to the economic and social policies of the Government over the next three years are ultimately the responsibility of the Oireachtas.  It is for that reason the Labour Party have proposed the establishment of an Oireachtas economic and social affairs committee which would compliment the work of the social partners in general and advance in particular, the non-pay elements of the present programme.</P>
    <P>Only the Oireachtas has the democratic mandate to undertake such a task. The attitude of the Government is putting seriously at risk the present economic and social consensus that exists between the social partners.  In view of the experiences of the late seventies and early eighties the Labour Party believe it is essential that we do not allow that consensus to be replaced by confrontation because of the Government's refusal to allow the Oireachtas to assume its full, legitimate and democratic role in this process.</P>
    <P>We believe an Oireachtas economic and social affairs committee should be <Col N="753" /> representative of all parties and serviced with a permanent staff.  The various organisations that go to make up the social partnership could, from time to time, make formal presentations to them and those sessions would be open to the media in the normal way.  For example, the different concerns of the social partners to the proposal that a statutory minimum wage be established could be articulated by those organisations directly to the Oireachtas legislators who will have the ultimate responsibility of deciding whether such social protective legislation is desirable or not.  Those discussions and points of view should be articulated in a democratic forum that is ultimately accountable to the electorate.</P>
    <P>The present practice &mdash; and I know because I have been a party to this &mdash; is that secret discussions take place between the social partners and representatives of the Ministers concerned behind closed doors and away from any democratic scrutiny.  The final product of these smoke-filled rooms is then presented by the Minister to the Oireachtas and no amendments of any significance can be considered because it is claimed that they have been agreed in private discussions.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on this aspect of our amendment because in many respects since we were not a party to the negotiation of the national programme it is not up to us at this time to go into it in detail line by line.  I want to focus on our amendment and to answer some of the mistaken fears which the Taoiseach has in regard to the role of the committee as put forward by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Leader of Fine Gael, we do not believe that such a committee should have a role in negotiating any programme with the social partners.  We do not believe it is the function of passengers on an airline to crowd the cabin occupied by the pilot.  We believe it is the prerogative of Government to negotiate unequivocally and it is the right and necessity of the Oireachtas to agree or disagree.  We are not seeking to be at the negotiating table, nor are we trying to suggest that the political parties should be represented in the NESC &mdash; I accept <Col N="754" /> the recommendations of the NESC in that regard &mdash; but what we are looking for is a correct and effective forum where points of view can be expressed in a manner which will make sense and consolidate the existing consensus.</P>
    <P>In regard to the legislation which will be brought to the floor of this House over the next three years as a result of the commitments in this programme, Ministers will say in private across the floor of the House or during the time between votes that while they basically agree with some of the points put forward they cannot be accommodated because the employers, trade unions or agriculture interests have a particular point of view. I do not believe that is healthy any longer. We are extremely fortunate that this country was turned around in the eighties not by one Government but by a series of Governments.  We are fortunate that a consensus now exists which is understood, respected and intellectually agreed upon by a wide spectrum of the social partnership.  If that consensus and framework of consensus intellectually is to be maintained and be subject to rigorous examination over the next number of years it is absolutely essential that there is a constructive role for the Oireachtas to participate in it.  A series of statements like this is not the most effective way of doing this.  We need a committee structure or committee-type debate to do this.</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach has a certain reluctance with regard to the establishment of Oireachtas committees. Having regard to the way in which the Leader of the Fine Gael Party articulated his vision of a committee I can understand the opposition of the Government to such a committee &mdash; it seems to confuse the legitimate role of the Executive with that of the Oireachtas.  If, as will be the case, this House is going to have to agree and process sections of legislation and administrative components of Government policy, some of which are in the programme and some of which will emerge from time to time, we will not be adequately equipped to deal with this as we regulate our affairs at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> Underlying all of this is the recognition that there are constraints on this economy and that, if anything, the parameters which were agreed in October and November when the non-pay elements of this programme were being discussed with the social partners have become more difficult and pessimistic than was the case then.  It is possible that the growth forecasts for the Irish economy are probably less than what the Minister for Finance put on the record of the House in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of the Labour Party &mdash; it is certainly not my intention &mdash; to attempt to talk down the Irish economy or anticipate doom and gloom in a difficult and uncertain situation.  That would not be in the interests of the people I represent or working people.  Nevertheless, those constraints, and new constraints which may be imposed upon the Irish economy, will need the forebearance of all of us in society, including elected representatives.  If there is not an effective framework within which the consequences of those constraints can be teased out in a non-confrontational format, which I suggest the committee structure is, then the Taoiseach, perhaps unconsciously but certainly inevitably, is putting at risk a social-political consensus which many of us have striven to achieve over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton said, there are many elements in the programme and we could be here for a long time talking about them but we will have to wait until the programme is finally ratified by those people who are parties to its agreement before we can go into the detail of the programme.  However, there is an element in the programme which some Government speakers should clarify between now and Thursday.  I refer to the proposals on pages 58 and 59 in regard to the role of commercial companies and the ultimate destination of the proceeds of privatisation.</P>
    <P>Earlier today the Minister for Finance stated clearly that as far as he was concerned the proceeds from the sale of State assets, including shares in their entirety <Col N="756" /> or in part from commercial companies, would be used to reduce the capital sum of this country's debt.  That is what I understood him to say.  When I asked the Minister in colloquial terms if it would come off the mortgage or whether we would get two or three free months payment he said quite clearly that it would come off the mortgage.  Yet, paragraph 89.2 (b) (ii) of the programme under the heading &ldquo;Funding&rdquo; provides that private involvement could consist of:</P>
    <P>sales of shares in a State company to the private sector where this will enable the company to survive, to make a better contribution to the economy, to protect or increase employment, or is desirable on policy grounds,</P>
    <P>Those are the basis upon which such sales would be acceptable to the social partners. Further on in that paragraph it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Government have no ideological position in this.  The approach should be a practical one of enabling State companies to improve their contribution to the economy and to employment.</P>
    <P>On Thursday afternoon delegates representing many workers in State companies will vote on this programme.  As we saw last week, many of those workers have accepted restraint in the operation of their companies and have foregone wage increases to which they are entitled in the belief that this was in the best interests of their companies and that in the short term it was the only option open to them. If the harvest of their restraint, the benefits of the additional wealth which will be created in State companies, whether it be the Sugar Company, Aer Lingus or whatever, is cashed in by the Government and set off not to create new employment but simply to reduce the total debt, in other words the State mortgage, they will have been betrayed, their commitment to further flexibility will be undermined and there will be no motivation for them to co-operate with management as they have done in the past.  I would urge the Taoiseach and successive <Col N="757" /> Government speakers to clarify this point because it is precisely for this reason that many of the delegates are opposed to parts of the programme.</P>
    <P>There is a need to use scarce capital resources for the growth of Irish companies and to increase employment. Nearly 8 per cent of the entire workforce work in State companies which are under Irish control and whose headquarters are based in this country.  It is those companies which should be getting the capital and should be encouraged to grow.  For example, Bord na Móna &mdash; a classic company that have turned themselves around and transformed their internal culture in a manner that is a marvel to anybody who has a knowledge of industrial relations or company strategies &mdash; are still crippled with a mountain of debt and are deprived of any State aid to which they are legitimately entitled.  The creative efforts and contributions of the workforce of that company have not been recognised in the formal commitment given by the Minister for Finance in reply to my priority question earlier today.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of this programme to which one could refer in some detail, and I am sure many speakers will do so.  As to what is in Ireland's best interests as regards our relationship to the European Community, within which our future is inextricably linked, I will quote the following statement from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i></P>
    <P>The parties to this programme have, therefore, agreed that Ireland must continue to pursue a clear national strategy directed to promoting full and balanced European integration in the economic, monetary and social spheres, in the framework of an evolving Political Union and on the basis that essential to this process must be a Community commitment, backed by practical and strengthened action, to ensure major progress towards the achievement of economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>That is lovely, but it would be nicer if we knew what this clear national strategy is. <Col N="758" /> Notwithstanding repeated requests in this House in the last two years to have debates in which we actually talk to rather than at each other, we have not been told what the clear national strategy of the Government is.  In response to a question from a number of Deputies today the Minister for Finance finally made available in the Oireachtas Library the paper on economic and monetary union which was submitted to the EC in January.</P>
    <P>We are simply being excluded from the detailed formulation of much of what is essential to the maintanance of a consensus in our society, which is necessary if we are to survive in an open and increasingly competitive world where the barriers which protected us in the past have, by agreement, been removed.  It is simply wrong parliamentary strategy for any Government that occupy that side of the House to revert to what I would describe as Westminster style imperial traditions of parliamentary confrontation. The concept of social consensus is a continental one and the continental parliamentary tradition is one of the national assembly consensus.</P>
    <P>Professor Joe Lee in his work on the performance of the Irish State since independence &mdash; a large volume of approximately 700 pages based on primary research, including his own experience as a former official of the Department of Finance &mdash; asks why Ireland, with a similar <i>per capita</i> income and wealth to Denmark, Finland, Austria and perhaps one or two similarly sized European countries, has lagged so far behind that we have virtually half their <i>per capita</i> income.  Professor Lee analysed the failures in the performance of this State and identified many factors over which we had exclusive control &mdash; one is this House, another is the way Departments do business, the way legislation is formulated and the slow response to economic realities.</P>
    <P>It has taken 15 years through long, patient, private negotiation in the rooms of the NESC to come to an agreed analysis as to why we had to change our policies in a whole range of areas.  It is <Col N="759" /> frequently proclaimed by trade unionists, farmers and employers' organisations that that process has been successful and yet the Oireachtas has been excluded from it.  Our legislative record in keeping pace with the commitments in the PNR, and now in the PESP, is abysmal.  Our legislative performance in terms of the programme of this Government and indeed of previous Governments of which I was a member is appalling.  There is a log jam called the parliamentary draftsman's office which is effectively preventing a large volume of legislation that is vital to the operation of this economy from coming onto the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>Something that concerns all of us, particularly the Labour Party, is the protective social legislation for a statutory minimum wage, to which reference is made in the programme.  The ICTU stated their position in favour of it while the FIE stated their opposition to it.  The arguments which both sides articulate in favour or against such legislation should properly be put directly to legislators from all sides of the House by way of a committee.  The concerns &mdash; in many cases legitimate &mdash; of the FIE should be considered by those of us who hold the view that you can have statutory minimum wage legislation while not endangering prospects for employment. That is a view I hold but others on the employer side would argue with it.  Doing business in private rooms in the Department of Labour or the Department of the Taoiseach, having delays in the drafting of legislation and queueing up to speak on these matters on the floor of the House, is not the proper procedure.  These matters should be discussed in different committees.</P>
    <P>The consensus that is represented in the programme is something we welcome. It is part of a ten year strategy first formulated by NESC and then formally put on the table by the ICTU at the commencement of the negotiations for this programme, but it will last for only three years and no longer.  The failure of <Col N="760" /> the Government to deliver on the non-pay elements of the programme will critically determine whether in the last seven years there will be the same degree of consensus as appears to be in the first three years, notwithstanding Deputy Bruton's contribution. If all the Members of the Oireachtas, including the Government backbenchers, do not have a legitimate role in this area, the foundations upon which this new confidence has been built, to which frequent reference is made by Ministers &mdash; will be endangered.  The Taoiseach referred to an annual report from the Commission and made complimentary comments on the performance of the Irish economy.  If that new confidence is undermined, it will not be in the interests of the Government and it certainly will not be in our interests. As I have said, the programme is fundamentally a pay deal negotiated, as is right and proper, by those who are party to a pay deal and outside the sphere of this Assembly.  In so far as the non-pay elements helped to bring about that pay deal &mdash; I believe they did &mdash; and in so far as they are legitimately the concern of this democratic assembly, the role that is envisaged for us &mdash; the Taoiseach, effectively promised more of the same &mdash; is not enough.  Our exclusion from participation in such a consensus approach will, over time, erode the confidence that brought about that consensus in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I say with all due formality to the Minister of State representing the Government, notwithstanding the taunts from the Fine Gael party in respect of a cheap debating point in relation to this, that they should seriously consider &mdash; as they did last week in respect of the foreign adoption legislation &mdash; the potential benefits of such an Oireachtas committee and proceed to discuss with all the representatives in this House the details of such a committee and how it might function. May I move the amendment in the name of the Labour Party?</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party support the concept of centralised negotiations between the Government and the principal economic and social interests on a programme which will not just provide for wage and salary increases but which will lay the basis for broad economic and social development.</P>
      <P>Despite what has been implied on a number of occasions in this House by Government representatives, The Workers' Party did not oppose the previous <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> when it was negotiated in October 1987. In a statement issued on 11 October 1987, the then President of The Workers' Party, Tomás Mac Giolla, said that the trade unions were to be complimented for trying to broaden the concept of collective bargaining to include social and economic planning, especially the plight of those on social welfare.  At the same time we expressed doubt about the willingness of the Government to deliver on many of the promises contained in the programme &mdash; a doubt that subsequent events proved to be well founded.</P>
      <P>The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> covers a long and detailed agenda from a national medium to long term strategy in the nineties to specific industrial agreements for particular sectors of industry.  In a few areas it is quite specific and detailed but in others it is more aspirational than precise. While the pay element has naturally received most of the attention, the document has to be viewed in its totality &mdash; as a social wage bargain rather than a traditional pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> The value of that &ldquo;social wage&rdquo;&mdash; that is the value of all the package, both pay and non-pay elements &mdash; is more difficult to evaluate but it is just as real, and can sometimes be of more lasting value than a straightforward pay increase.  The programme does not provide a comprehensive economic or social plan, but it does set down an agenda for social and economic progress.  That agenda will not be translated into significant advances for our people unless there is determined pressure from the trade unions and general public and unless the Dáil is given a formal role in monitoring the Government commitments in the programme.</P>
    <P>This is a highly political document but it is not the property of any one Government. It proposes a strategy for the nineties and &mdash; if accepted &mdash; will be the responsibility of whoever are in Government during that period.  The Taoiseach pointed out today that it is normal for Governments to make financial and legislative proposals which extend beyond the lifetime of a Government, that any succeeding Government are free to put forward amending proposals and would, in such a case, enter into the necessary negotiations with the social partners to vary that programme.  While I accept the principle that a future Government cannot be absolutely bound by an agreement made by a previous Government, particularly if the incoming Government are one of a different complexion, nevertheless the social interests which have negotiated this agreement have done so in the context of a ten year strategy. I wonder what their attitude is to the Taoiseach's statement today and whether they were told in advance of the Government's attitude.  In theory, in any event, it links together all the major social interest groups in a strategy to accelerate economic and social progress and is built on a form of class bargaining which is more akin to the European model than the more traditional Irish or British approach.</P>
    <P>One of the merits of the programme is that it places social and economic planning firmly on the agenda, and quite rightly rejects the approach advocated by <Col N="763" /> the British Tory Party, and the Progressive Democrats in this country, that all these areas are best left to the mercy of market forces.  It has allowed the trade union movement to make a positive input on a wide range of subjects, many of which are far removed from the traditional union areas of interest.</P>
    <P>It would be hard to fault the key objectives of the strategy, set out in section 1.6 of the programme &mdash; sustained economic growth and the generation of greater income; a substantial increase in employment; a major assault on long term unemployment; the development of greater social rights within our health, education, social welfare and housing services; the promotion of collective and individual social responsibility in relation to the discharge of tax liabilities and the development of worker participation, women's rights and consumer's rights. These are all objectives that The Workers' Party wholeheartedly endorse.</P>
    <P>It is, however, when we come to look at the detail &mdash; or rather the lack of it &mdash; of how these objectives are to be achieved, and when we examine the record of the Government in regard to the promises contained in the previous <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> that we have cause for concern.  As we point out in our amendment, many of the commitments given by the Government are vague, conditional and imprecise, and in some instances, merely aspirational.</P>
    <P>For many workers the main area of interest, and the issue which will largely determine how they vote in their unions on the programme, will be the wage increases.  The wage increases are generally in line with the expected level of inflation, so they will leave most workers no better off than before.  If inflation is higher than expected &mdash; a prospect which many economists feel is increasingly likely, especially against the background of the Gulf conflict &mdash; workers will suffer and their living standards will decline.  In this situation the absence of an &ldquo;escalator&rdquo; clause, which would have allowed for higher increases if inflation jumped, is a major omission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> It is by no means certain that all workers will even get these increases. The programme says quite clearly that these increases will have to be &ldquo;negotiated through normal industrial relations machinery, due regard being had to the economic and commercial circumstances of the particular firm, employment or industry&rdquo;.  This will provide a major loophole which will, no doubt, be exploited to the full by unscrupulous employers.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the extra 3 per cent allowed for through local bargaining, which may be paid not before the second year of the agreement.  Again it is by no means certain that this will be paid to the majority of workers.  A whole series of employers quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 January last, make it clear that this increase will not be automatically paid.</P>
    <P>It is in its treatment of the low paid that the agreement is most disappointing. Increases for the low paid are set at £5 per week for the first year, £4.25 for the second, and £5.75 for the third.  While the principle of providing a specific amount &mdash; rather than a percentage &mdash; for the low paid is a good one, the amounts specified are far too small to make any real impact on the problem of low pay.  In addition the qualification I quoted above, regarding the &ldquo;economic and commercial circumstances of the firm&rdquo; apply even to these miserable increases, so there is no guarantee that they will be paid.  Many of the low paid are in firms or industries with a relatively low level of union organisation, or none at all, and may not have the industrial muscle to force their employers to deliver, regardless of whether the firm are prosperous.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made much in his budget speech of the proposed removal of some 18,000 low paid from the tax net through an increase in tax exemption levels.  However, many of those who get the increases specified for the low paid will find that this has brought them back into the tax net, thus snaring them once again in the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>Many workers will note that while they are once again being asked to accept very <Col N="765" /> modest pay increases, no such restrictions are being imposed on profits, dividends or professional fees.  Under the last programme workers were told that restricting wage increases would create extra jobs.  All it created was vast profits for the employers.  Between 1986 and 1989, the national wage bill rose from £10 billion to £11.5 billion, an increase of 15 per cent.  In the same period profits rose from £4.3 billion to £6.1 billion, an increase of 45 per cent.  Most top companies, during the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> reported profits of between ten and 20 times the level of wage increases allowed under the programme.  The share of national income going to labour is declining and that going to profits increasing.  In 1980, for every £1 in wages there was 35p going to profits.  By 1989, for every £1 in wages the income going to profits went up to 53p.</P>
    <P>A major gap in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is the failure to extract any commitment from the employers to reinvest profits towards job creation.  This is especially true in regard to the multi-national sector, which continues to export huge sums out of the country.  Annual profit repatriations by foreign companies amounted to £3 billion last year, well in excess of the total tax take on all income.  The workers in this country are producing wealth but it is flowing out at a massive uncontrolled rate.  As I said in the budget debate, we cannot afford to endure this massive financial haemorrhage.  Virtually every worker and unemployed person in this country has been asked to make sacrifices to get the economy in order, to accept lower wage increases and to endure inadequate social welfare levels.  Why are the profit takers not asked to make similar sacrifices?  When we get an agreement which not just restricts the level of wage increases for workers, but also restricts the right of foreign multi-nationals to export profits and sets specific targets for the investment of profits in job creation, we will have a national programme which will make a real contribution to economic and social development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> Many people will experience a sense of déjà vu when they read the section in the programme on job creation.  In 1987, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> (PNR) said that &ldquo;the objectives of policy in manufacturing industry involve creating approximately 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years, the actual provision accelerating as the programme policies take effect&rdquo;.  Three years later the aim of this programme, we are told, is to &ldquo;create 20,000 new jobs each year of the programme in manufacturing and international services&rdquo;. Many workers believe that they were conned by the Government in regard to the job creation promises in the PNR. Most reasonable people believed that extra jobs meant additional jobs over and above those already in existence. However, the Government continued to claim that they had met the targets of the PNR once 20,000 new jobs had been created, irrespective of the number of jobs lost or the sector in which they were created.</P>
    <P>The real failure of the PNR to make any significant dent on our unemployment problem is clear from a look at the numbers on the live register.  In October 1987, when negotiations on the PNR were concluded, there were 238,000 on the live register.  In January 1991, when negotiations on this new programme were concluded there were 241,000 on the live register.  Three years of sacrifices by workers and three years of profit taking by the employers has left us with an additional 3,000 people on the dole queues.  In the same three year period well in excess of 100,000 of our people emigrated.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment in the programme to the &ldquo;maintenance of a viable and commercial semi-State sector&rdquo; sounds impressive, but how seriously can this be taken, when there is currently legislation before the Dáil which provides for the selling off of one of our most successful semi-State companies, the Irish Sugar Company.  The Sugar Company is a commercial State company which has hauled itself back from the brink, largely as a result of efforts made <Col N="767" /> by both management and employees. Losses of £22 million in 1982 have been transformed into profits of £22 million in 1990.  It clearly has the potential for further expansion and development, yet it is being sold off.</P>
    <P>Despite the statements in the programme, it is clear that the Government are embarking on a major programme of ideologically motivated privatisation. The legislation to facilitate the privatisation of Irish Life was passed by the Dáil last year, and other candidates include B &amp; I, the ICC and, possibly, the ACC.  The decision to appoint Minister Brennan, widely considered to be the Minister for privatisation, to the Communications portfolio, where he has responsibility for two of our biggest commercial State companies &mdash; Telecom Éireann and An Post &mdash; has been viewed with understablable concern by workers in these companies.</P>
    <P>Failure by the Government to honour the commitments given in regard to the health services casts grave doubt on the seriousness of the commitments made in other areas of the programme, and there is already a breach of the Government's commitment under the programme to provide a &ldquo;comprehensive, equitable and efficient health care system&rdquo;, as is shown by the chaos now facing a number of health boards because of inadequate funding from central Government.</P>
    <P>Exactly a year ago the chaos in the hospitals was being blamed on the flu' epidemic.  This year there is no epidemic, but patients face cutbacks and a seriously reduced level of service.  Several health boards have made it clear that, far from moving towards the type of comprehensive service promised in the programme, they cannot even maintain existing services at their present levels because of inadequate Government funding.  This will mean even longer waiting lists, beds in corridors, the early discharge of patients, longer closures of wards and beds during holiday periods, a worsening of the plight of the physically and mentally handicapped and even less <Col N="768" /> money for child care services and facilities for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The fact is the health services have never recovered from the severe cutbacks imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 and 1988 and still require significant additional funding even to allow services to be restored to the levels operating in the mid-eighties.  An indication of the seriousness of the situation is given in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times,</i> which quotes a confidential memorandum as saying that patients at the Mater Hospital's accident and emergency departments are inadequately supervised, left unattended on trollies and subjected to humiliating overcrowding.  A similarly bleak picture can be found in many other hospitals around the country. I saw the conditions for myself when I visited St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny last Friday, which has up to 12 beds in a corridor and inadequate facilities in the children's ward.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to state that we will not be going into the lobbies with Fianna Fáil in support of the programme and regret that the programme which has been negotiated is totally inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a card carrying trade unionist for over 30 years, I will be quite happy to recommend very strongly acceptance of this proposed agreement and have no doubts about its potential. While a number of issues will have to be discussed and commitments delivered on, I support its contents and was glad to see Deputy De Rossa welcome the concept of long term agreements.  Deputy Bruton made a fairly vicious attack on the programme and I will deal with that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in the preamble to the agreement, we are a very small community and have a very high dependency rate. Figures, published recently, indicate that there will be approximately 400,000 people aged 65 and over by the end of the year.  This figure, taken in conjunction with the number of young people, will create certain problems for us as a small community.  However, the Taoiseach was positive in opening the <Col N="769" /> debate and pointed out that this programme builds on the achievements of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and represents the logical step forward. He also pointed out, quite correctly, that different Governments have had varying degrees of success in their approaches to the social partners.  Indeed, in this context, there may have been an element of petty political jealousy in Deputy Bruton's contribution.  If I recall correctly &mdash; I was not a Member of the House then &mdash; at the time of his historic failure to put his budget through Dáil Éireann, mainly because of his proposal to put tax on children shoes, the social partners refused to enter into talks on an agreement.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous political opportunism for Deputy Bruton to take a particular stance on this proposal merely to wrong foot the Labour Party and he seems to be heading down that road today.  If he is doing this merely to build his own power base or his vote base regardless of the damage he could inflict on the consensus approach he should think again.  In that context, as the Taoiseach said at the beginning of his contribution, under Deputy Bruton and his colleagues the national debt had doubled in four years. That was the scene we faced, and prior to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we had run up a debt of £25.5 billion which simply cannot be dealt with properly by this small community.  It is a burden on us and we must work our way out of it and the only way to do that is by all the social partners pulling together and working together.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was quite fair in pointing out that there will be pluses and minuses for almost everybody in this agreement but, again, Deputy Bruton described a whole range of sectors who, he said, will not be included in this programme, who are not catered for in it or who are not participants in the talks, such as young people, dependent spouses, the homeless and the unemployed.  I do not think he has even read the programme. As Deputy De Rossa pointed out there are many aspects in it apart from the pay element which are difficult to evaluate but which will be a greater contribution <Col N="770" /> to the community sector in the years to come than the pay element.  The programme includes many innovative moves which will benefit the young, the homeless and the unemployed.  It is incorrect to state that such sectors are not included and that suggestion will be of no help to us.  I said at the outset that different people have different levels of success because of the factors of credibility and confidence.  Those two factors drew the social partners to this agreement and got the proposal from the ICTU of a ten year programme.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to separate this programme and these discussions from the budget debate, and recent budgets must all be considered as well as those that will be presented in the next few years. Indicators should be given of what is intended in years to come in areas like taxation.  I take Deputy De Rossa's point that if there is a change of Government all agreements are null and void and may be renegotiated.  That is democracy, but it does not tend to happen in the Irish context.  I was amazed at Deputy FitzGerald's attack on indications that in the next few years there would be a reduction in tax rates.  I thought this would be part of the consensus approach and that people would be aware of what would be involved.</P>
    <P>In regard to the budget, the Government's performance in the past two years has created enough confidence to encourage the social partners to come forward and participate in drawing up the programme. They all must go back to those they represent.  Nine groupings were involved, the most wide-ranging representation ever, and that is an indication of confidence and willingness to work and participate.  Compare that with the 1982-87 efforts.  The unions had a say at that time but although the Labour Party were involved for three years and seven months the unions seemed reluctant to become involved.  They did not trust the people in power at the time as far as I could read it.  Now there is a feeling of confidence which is closely associated with the credibility of the Ministers and the Government.  That credibility results <Col N="771" /> from really delivering, and we must deliver on what is in the budget which lays out the financial provisions for the year to come.</P>
    <P>If we review the debate on the past four budgets we will see on one side a set of proposals, a set of figures and a set of targets that have been delivered on all occasions and exceeded on many occasions.  On the other side we have invariably had, particularly from Deputy Noonan, an ongoing contribution in which the phrase &ldquo;lost opportunity&rdquo; was used in each of the four years, a declaration that the targets could not possibly be achieved and a statement that the growth rate at least in 1989 would be nil. That was his forecast.  I happened to pick up his contribution last year.  I had thought it was only this year he turned to the mechanical side but last year he spoke about a jet landing in the field outside but really it was not a jet, it was bankers snoring up in the Gallery.  Such rubbish has no place in the debates aimed at turning this economy about.  Talk about selling secondhand cars and tinkering with them and jets landing in fields outside is complete rubbish.  Thus, Deputy Noonan carried on the track record he had established when in power.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the former Deputy Ray MacSharry in his time and now the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, established credibility.  The important thing is that they have delivered on and even exceeded targets.  If somebody comes into a forum to speak for the farming Community &mdash; again I emphasise Macra na Féirme, the young farming sector, are included in this programme &mdash; for the trade unions or anybody else, it is important that the credibility of the people they are talking to is not under question but inspires confidence.</P>
    <P>Budgets have been geared to correcting the financial problem we inherited, therefore people accept that the right things are being done.  The Opposition forecasts are on the record of the House and are worth perusal at some stage by anybody interested in this question. The Government's rating has been <Col N="772" /> very important in gaining the commitment of the various people involved in the discussions.  That commitment is based very much on the credibility I have referred to and these people are anxious to work, to co-operate and move ahead. Such co-operation is a prerequisite for full economic recovery and there is no possibility of achieving that without co-operation. We must exploit the advantages we have, and they are many and can be listed some other time.  It behoves all of us to work together to achieve the highest possible standard of living and quality of life for all our people.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks I noted what I took to be a concerted effort by Fine Gael spokespeople whom I have read, heard or seen in action to undermine not just this programme but the integrity of its competent parts.  I witnessed one of the Cork Deputies, Deputy Allen of the Fine Gael Party and former spokesman on Health, stating that in his estimation the leaders of the trade union movement were isolated in ivory towers.  As a trade unionist I took umbrage at that at the time.  We cannot go around attacking people in that way but that seemed to be a concerted attack on this programme, for whatever reason I do not know.  We must move forward in this area whether under this or any other Government in the years to come.  That is the way forward. I do not need to come in here and defend the leaders of the trade union movement who are acting in a practical, honest way on behalf of their members.</P>
    <P>There are many other elements included in the programme with which we could deal.  I think it was Deputy Quinn who said there are 66 separate elements requiring legislation while one or two other commentators contended there was nothing of any substance included.  Obviously, there is a contradiction there.  I welcome particularly the measures aimed at dependent spouses, the homeless, the unemployed, the down and out, the handicapped whom we will have to target very deliberately. We will have to siphon off moneys to be targeted at them specifically <Col N="773" /> whether from those allocated for health care or whatever.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the structuring of wage agreements.  I have argued in the past that, in a free for all &mdash; which I thought for a moment Deputy De Rossa was recommending &mdash; the weaker, such as the handicapped, unemployed, social welfare recipients, deserted wives and so on, fell behind.  With a proper structure and properly implemented programme utilising the moneys now being targeted at these areas, these people will do better.</P>
    <P>I welcome also section VII under the heading, Area-based Response to Long-Term Unemployment.  As one who has been working for community development I have long argued that local communities must be involved, that we could not allow people work alone.  I felt there was a need for such an area-based response in many circumstances.  For instance, we have seen this response take off in regard to the care of the mentally handicapped.  I can speak only for my experience in the Cork area but I observe tremendous steps initiated in that respect.</P>
    <P>This programme, if fully implemented and supported, will enable us encourage that type of community-based development, a commitment to the unemployed, the less well-off, those people most in need of our help and our support.  Every Member should be in favour of this progressive step.  I strongly recommend this agreement or programme.  Having carried a trade union card for 35 years I feel competent to comment on the wishes of the ordinary working man and woman.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Dennehy I too carry a trade union card.  Hopefully, I will carry one in the future because I am a fundamental believer in the role and record of the trade union movement.  But I was somewhat amused at his description of Deputy John Bruton's comments on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as being petty political jealousy. In fact, what Deputy Bruton was doing was giving a factual, forthright, analytical <Col N="774" /> critique of what is an inadequate, lacklustre document.  He based it, first, on the document before the House this afternoon and, second, on its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which failed to deliver or impact on the key areas of our economy, that is jobs, unemployment, emigration or real visible, tangible, meaningful growth.</P>
      <P>Anybody looking from the outside at the pomp and splendour of the launch of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> would be forgiven for thinking we were witnessing the end of a glorious era of economic fortune which had put this country into a new orbit of economic prosperity.  One would get the impression, from all the post-launch celebrations, tipping of glasses and so on, all the jubilation between the Government and social partners, we were witnessing chapter two of a success story that would send us into even dizzier and better economic heights.  I have been amused at the kinds of clichés and words bandied about, such as confidence, credibility, partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Saturday at my clinic I met a young man whom I had taught at school. He is married with two children, a boy aged three and a girl aged two.  Three years ago he operated a small plant hire firm, a nice tidy operation, with his brother; nothing spectacular but it ticked over nicely giving them a nice living. There were grants for drainage, sites to be excavated, contracts taking the odd bend off a county road here and there, roadworks, sewerage works, water schemes.  The grants disappeared, the work evaporated, the local economy went dead, the machines disappeared and the hire purchase companies moved in. His brother went to England.  This very evening, that man is in Kilburn looking for a job, plying his wares in the already hopelessly overcrowded labour market of London while his young wife, son and daughter remain at home waiting for the telephone to ring.  That is the story of thousands of young husbands throughout the length and breadth of this country. Indeed, it is the story of thousands of <Col N="775" /> wives and so-called orphaned children who will in future see their fathers only on his annual visit at Christmas time. How meaningless to them must be the Taoiseach's nicely rounded rhetoric in the preamble to this document which said:</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> showed what can be done when we work together to improve our standards of living and social equity.</P>
    <P>Let us examine where we stand after three years of that <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Again in the preamble to the latest programme the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>To secure such an economy we need this partnership in commitment and co-operation between the Government and the principal economic and social interests in our society.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is, always was and will continue to be the mainstay and backbone of the economy of rural Ireland, but today agriculture is on the broad of its back as never before.  Cattle prices are back at £100 per head; sheep prices reduced by 30 to 40 per cent, with pig producers struggling hopelessly trying to compete with rising input prices.  Wool is down from 95p per lb. last year to 20p per lb. this year and, in some cases, one cannot even give it away.  Milk has been reduced by 20p per gallon with no visible sign of any improvement on the horizon. The GATT negotiations being conducted by a former Minister for Agriculture, the Irish Commissioner, were bungled hopelessly by giving away 30 per cent, three out of the ten cards in his hand, before he even sat down at the negotiating table.</P>
    <P>Reading Section VI &mdash; Agricultural Development &mdash; of this document one can perceive no tangible measure to improve matters generally.  Instead of the impetus of new ideas needed to resuscitate agriculture there is empty, recycled jargon which, when stripped down, means absolutely nothing.  The Government do not appear to realise that Santa Clause simply did not come to many <Col N="776" /> children in rural Ireland this year because the headage cheques did not arrive. Indeed, the 1990 headage cheque still has not arrived in many households I represent.  Over £20 million have been spent on animal disease eradication.  In the new programme there is a section dealing with this.</P>
    <P>We are as far away from solving the problems of TB and brucellosis as we were when the programme was begun, TB being rampant in particular.  There are major loopholes ruthlessly being exploited by people in the trade.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to instigate immediately a top level inquiry into the use of the drug cortisone.  This drug is freely available among farmers, jobbers, cattle men and is being injected into animals in order to reduce the visible presence of TB.  It reduces the swelling, rendering detection extremely difficult which means diseased animals can literally waltz through the disease eradication dragnet.  I now call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to deal with this as a matter of urgency because the implications are all too clear.  The programme's commitment to further research might well be directed into plugging the glaring loopholes in the present scheme.</P>
    <P>Instead of measures to improve the lifestyles of farmers we have layer upon layer of red tape.  For example, a widow with a non-contributory pension whose animals contact TB cannot get her compensation grant unless she produces a tax clearance certificate.  Imagine the amount of red tape that must be gone through to prove that a widow who has already been means tested for a social welfare pension does not have taxable income.</P>
    <P>This document has 17 lines in relation to operational programmes.  There is a new programme called a leader programme. Based on experience in the past two or three years, I see nothing to indicate that this type of programme will do anything to enhance rural economies.  I note with a certain amount of sceptism the new concept called &ldquo;leader initiatives&rdquo;. If thinking up new titles for old initiatives would solve our economic <Col N="777" /> problems we would have been home and dry ages ago.  Agriculture is going down the tubes and farmers are going to the wall.  Rural communities are disintegrating. People are depressed, demoralised and unsure.  The sad thing is that the problems are not of our own making.  This Government failed to impress our innocence in relation to over production on the EC.  We sometimes flaunt our credentials in relation to trying to arbitrate in a difficult world situation and yet we have failed to make any dent in the international logic which has on the one hand millions of tonnes of beef and butter in costly storage facilities, while millions of children are dying of starvation in Sudan.  Our jet-lagged Deputy Collins might be better occupied in everybody's interests in trying to bring some sort of sanity and humanity to bear on the scandal of unused food surpluses on the one hand and gross malnutrition and starvation on the other.</P>
    <P>This country is in a sad state.  We spent 800 years trying to get rid of the invader and we have made an unmitigated mess of our affairs in the interim.  This programme is full of catchphrases such as those we had from Deputy Dennehy about credibility, confidence, sustained economic growth, structural reform, collective and individual social responsibility and so on.  Major play is made of the fact that we have the lowest inflation rate in Europe but what good is that if we have the second highest rate of unemployment in Europe.  There are 250,000 people out of work, exactly the same level of unemployment as when this Government took office in 1987.  We do not actually know the true emigration rate but it is pitched somewhere in the region of 30,000 although this programme blandly accepts a figure of 19,000.  Unemployment of even 19,000 is much too high.  We are in fact a nation in exile.  There are more Irish people living outside the country than in it.  This week for example in Mayo, which cannot exactly be described as an industrial boom area, 1,000 employees have gone on short time and seven enterprises are tottering on the brink of survival.  We have the worst <Col N="778" /> roads in Europe, the longest health queues and we are about to dismantle our postal services because we are losing money.  We have a failed tourism policy in relation to developing the industry to its full potential.  The launches and the desires become more glittering and expensive, but everyone knows that without the annual influx of emigrants many of the glowing statistics furnished by Bord Fáilte each year in an effort to sustain their own credibility would show a paltry return for the investment put in.  This nation has totally underperformed.  I do not see this programme giving the impetus needed to give us the economic lift we so badly need.</P>
    <P>The programme, the budget, and every initiative this Government have launched seem to be based on the premise that if we get the main economic nuts and bolts right the rising tide will lift all boats.  It has already been proved that the rising tide philosophy does not work.  It works for the craft that are buoyant but the smaller craft remain in the mudbanks, depleted and dilapidated.  It is the poor I am talking about here.</P>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of economic revival and economic policy and one of the major social instruments we have for doing something tangible about poverty is education but under this Minister for Education things have disimproved.  The Minister has a very good public profile. She spends quite an amount of time preening her feathers and making nicely crafted speeches while opening projects most of which were approved by her predecessors, Deputies Cooney and Hussey. At primary school level the Minister launched into the task, with Thatcherite ferocity, of introducing the infamous circular 20/87.  She worsened the pupil-teacher ratio to 27:1 with the result that within one year 1,029 primary school positions were suppressed.  While in this document, the Minister is committed to improving the pupil-teacher ratio to 25:1 and is talking about putting 500 jobs back on a two year basis, she is only barely plugging a minor hole in the dent she created in the first instance.</P>
    <P>One in every ten children does not <Col N="779" /> benefit from the primary school system. One in every ten children comes out of school at 3.30 p.m. more dejected and demoralised than when he or she went in.  A considerable number of children simply cannot cope with the existing curriculum. We have a moral, social and educational obligation to provide for these children.  There should be remedial facilities in every school.  Our educational system is at nought when every child coming out of sixth class after nine years of primary level cannot, at the minimum, read, write, multiply, substract or divide. Many of these children having come through the educational dragnet will leave post primary school as soon as they reach the minimum leaving age of 15.</P>
    <P>This programme does not contain any real commitment to eliminating educational disadvantage.  Even allowing for a pupil teacher ratio of 25:1 we still have the largest classes in Europe and the lowest per capita spending.  The review body report on primary education identified the population trend whereby pupil numbers in primary schools will drop from 544,900 this year to 427,000 in nine years time, that is by the turn of the century.  Even allowing for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 25:1, at least 3,000 fewer teachers will be required.  I implore the Minister to give a commitment to the teacher unions, the educational interests, parents and children, that the children will be facilitated by having those 3,000 teachers left in the system and by providing every school with a remedial teacher in order to have the early intervention that is required.</P>
    <P>Massive changes are taking place at second level.  I implore the Minister to forget about green papers and discussion documents and to do what she did at primary level &mdash; establish a review body. Vocations are dropping, the interest of the Catholic Church is wanting, the population is declining and major changes are occurring.  School level education is in a stage of drift.  It is the Minister's duty to intervene, to oversee and to rationalise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Dáil debate on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  This programme records a remarkable consensus between Government, trade unions, employers and farmers in the major areas of economic and social policy.  It provides a firm base for ensuring continued economic growth and social development through the nineties, when as a nation we will have many serious challenges to face both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The programme creates a framework for a ten-year national strategy.  It builds on the outstanding success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of 1987, which transformed the whole economic climate during the past three years.  As the House is aware, many solid achievements were recorded in the period of the last programme from 1987 to 1990: annual economic growth averaged 4 per cent; inflation was brought down to low single figures; the volume of investment grew significantly; and the public finances exhibited a dramatic improvement. These positive economic developments led to a net increase of 70,000 jobs in the private sector outside of agriculture, and a net 40,000 increase in employment in all sectors.  At the same time, taxes were reduced and there were substantial improvements in the social benefits to the least well off.  Significant progress was made in reducing the key debt/GNP ratio &mdash; the ratio, which was up at 131 per cent in 1987, was reduced to 111 per cent at the end of 1990.  That is substantial progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in a position to consolidate and build on the achievements of the past three years.  The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> as in the case of the 1987 programme, has had the benefit of an excellent guiding report from the National Economic and Social Council.  The council's recent report entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for the Nineties: Economic Stability and Structural Change&rdquo; laid the groundwork for the new programme.  Of course, well laid groundwork alone is not sufficient.  The Government had to engage in intensive <Col N="781" /> negotiations over a three-month period with the social partners before the programme was finally agreed.  I would like at this stage to commend all of those who worked so hard to ensure the successful outcome to the negotiations.  A lot of very hard and difficult work went into it from all sides of the social spectrum.</P>
    <P>The programme is based on a strategy of accelerating economic and social progress in the nineties.  The strategy is based on maintaining a low-inflation economy, with a stable exchange rate which can compete internationally, and which can lead to higher standards of living and improved social services.  The strategy will have to be pursued in the context of very radical changes that are now taking place in the international economic environment. It is clear that developments within the European Community, in particular the completion of the Single Market and the creation of the Economic and Monetary Union, mean that Ireland will become even more closely integrated into the international economy over the next few years.  We must prepare for that.</P>
    <P>The Government record their commitment to the maintenance of a viable and profitable commercial semi-State sector in the programme.  It is clear that the sector will continue to play a very strong role in the Irish economy.  As it is, the impact of the commercial State bodies on the economy is very considerable. It is estimated that they account for 10 per cent of gross national product, with assets in the region of £9 billion and employment of some 73,000.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the seven commercial State bodies for which I am responsible, in the transport and communications sectors, represent nearly 70 per cent of employment and over a quarter of the total assets held by the commercial semi-State sector.  I hardly need to emphasise to the House the importance that needs to be attached to ensuring that these commercial State bodies not only operate efficiently in the domestic economy, but also that their performance compares favourably with corresponding sectors in our main trading partners.  As it is, Ireland's geographical position in <Col N="782" /> the European Community represents a major disadvantage in competitiveness terms.  The additional distance, time and associated cost factors contribute significantly to Ireland's communications costs.  The fact that we will soon be the only island nation of the EC makes the provision of efficient, economic and competitive transport and communications services even more essential than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector is clearly identified by Government as a major axis for economic development in the programme. There is no doubt that Irish tourism has come of age, and has adopted a more sophisticated, market-led approach which emphasises the need to diversify, improve and promote the quality, value for money and overall attractiveness of its product in a very competitive international environment.  In particular, very valuable lessons have been learned about the need to market our tourism product skilfully, to target that product, selectively, matching specific products to particular market segments and paying particular attention to demand in more affluent markets.</P>
    <P>The development of the tourism sector in recent years has been stimulated by the favourable operational climate created by the Government's policies which have elicited an upsurge in new investment &mdash; £420 million in the three-year period to end 1990.  A £300 million investment package under the <i>Operational Programme for Tourism</i> agreed last year with the European Community will run until the end of 1993 and ensure that the momentum in development is maintained. Under the operational programme, some 150 projects have been approved so far, representing a total investment of almost £140 million, of which the EC contribution is nearly £40 million.  Work under the programme is proceeding in 1991 and is expected to involve further investment of the order of £100 million.</P>
    <P>In the light of the prospective difficulties arising for tourism, from the Gulf crisis and from the climate of recession in some of our main markets, the <Col N="783" /> Government have at my request, allocated in the recent budget an additional £1 million for Bord Fáilte for marketing and promotion in 1991.  This I understand is being targeted by Bord Fáilte, particularly in the UK and mainland European markets, as a matter of some urgency.</P>
    <P>As a general response to difficult marketing conditions in 1991, Bord Fáilte are intensifying their product development, marketing and promotion efforts, finetuning their strategies to take account of the most promising markets and market segments.  A positive approach along these lines is, I believe, the only course of action we can afford to contemplate, if we are to maintain the momentum on tourism which we have already so clearly established.  Our determination to press ahead with our growth programme for tourism, with its emphasis on the creation of new jobs, is clearly stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
    <P>The transport sector has an important role to play, both directly and indirectly, in improving the competitiveness of the economy and underpinning employment creation.  To this end, a major development of transport infrastructure and facilities, which will be co-financed by the European Commission, is planned during the period of the new programme in the following areas: State and Regional Airports; Commercial and Local Seaports; and Public Transport.</P>
    <P>As regards the State airports, at Dublin, Shannon and Cork, £74 million will be invested in passenger terminal facilities and runway and other infrastructures. Approximately £20 million will be spent on improving the existing regional airport facilities at Carrickfinn, Connacht, Galway, Kerry, Sligo and Waterford Airports.  The works to be undertaken will include terminal and runway development and the provision of navigational aids.</P>
    <P>In addition, the commercial seaports of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare will be the subject of a development programme costing about £59 million.  The particular emphasis will be on providing <Col N="784" /> appropriate port capacity and quality port infrastructure which is strategically linked to the main internal transport arteries.</P>
    <P>As far as public transport is concerned, investment of about £36 million is to be made over the next few years.  The major proposed project is the development and improvement of rail services to Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and adjoining areas.  Other planned projects include the extension of the existing rail freight link within Dublin Port along the North Quays and the provision of new rail freight gantries at Cork, Dundalk, Limerick and Sligo.</P>
    <P>In addition to developing Ireland's internal transport infrastructure and facilities, it is a key objective of Irish transport policy that enhanced sea and air access transport services be developed between Ireland and other European Community States.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State opposite.  It is the first time I have been in the House with him and I would like to wish him well on his important new brief.</P>
      <P>Last week I referred to an adoption in Peru by one Irish couple.  The ordeal they outlined in regard to getting information before they went to Peru, defies belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially they got no information whatsoever from either the Adoption Board or any of the adoption societies.  They <Col N="785" /> were in fact told to give up any idea of adopting a child abroad.</P>
    <P>That seems to be the case with many of the parents involved in foreign adoptions &mdash; they relied on other parents who had been through it all and worked their way through the bureacracy.  These parents prepared a handout of important points of information for those planning adoptions abroad.  This was done for them and they did it in their turn.  The clear message was that all papers and legal requirements must be in order before the prospective adoptive parents leave Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the case I outlined eventually these parents established exactly what the Adoption Board would require in order to have their adoption order recognised when they returned.  They had to get five affidavits on domicile, Irish adoption law, there own health and certificates of police clearance, birth, marriage, finances, house ownership and religious practice. As has been mentioned so often, they had great difficulty in getting a home study report, and the social worker from another city who eventually did it for them was later reprimanded by her superiors.</P>
    <P>In this case preparations paid off and on presentation of documentation to the Adoption Board on their return from Peru their child was legally recognised within a period of nine months.</P>
    <P>These parents experience of inter-country adoption is not rare.  Many parents have fought a lonely campaign for a number of years before the Romanian issue brought the question of foreign adoptions to public attention.  I know of at least 12 Indian-Bangladese and South American adopted children living in Ireland with their adoptive parents and I suspect the numbers are much higher for these nationalities than the 30 mentioned by Deputy Shatter in his speech.  Their need of recognition is as great as that of the more numerous Romanian children mentioned in the Bill. All of this is a clear case of need and circumstances overtaking public policy and legislation.  Irish parents, because of <Col N="786" /> their desire to adopt, have ignored the obstructions, the negative advice, and taken control of matters and forced change &mdash; and good on them for this.</P>
    <P>One must ask seriously why there was such a conspiracy of non co-operation at official level up to now.  Ranks were closed right down the line, from the Adoption Board through the adoption societies and involving the health boards.</P>
    <P>Why is there such difficulty at various administrative levels in coping with the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; aspect of adoption?  Is it purely because of the legal difficulties, or constitutional complication, or is it, as has been put to me by one adopting parent, that there are undertones of rascism in some official attitudes.</P>
    <P>One mother, prior to going to Brazil to collect her baby, was surprised to be asked by a senior social worker if she had seen a photograph of the baby, that it could be very dark-skinned.</P>
    <P>I hope that the passing of this legislation, and the very obvious co-operation to be found on all sides of this House, will result in the same type of co-operation and support at all levels of the adoption process.  We have a duty to accord the same rights and privileges to children adopted from other countries as to children who are adopted under Irish law up to this.</P>
    <P>The experience of adoption in this country has been a very happy one, due in no small part to the commitment and integrity of those involved in the adoption process, and this I feel sure will be extended to and embrace the children coming from abroad to start new lives in Irish homes, once the legislation is through and the conditions are agreed.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill will lead to extensive changes in the rules and administration of adoption work, but certain measures should be taken in advance of that date.  There is a great need for a Government information and advice bureau for prospective foreign adopters. There is a need to oblige health boards and adoption societies to release copies of existing family assessments that they hold on parents for the purposes of foreign adoption and there is a need for them to <Col N="787" /> co-operate now in drawing up new home study reports for other parents who are hoping to travel to other countries.</P>
    <P>As has been said, this trend of foreign adoptions by Irish couples will continue and factors which influence this are undoubtedly the decrease in the numbers of Irish children eligible for adoption in recent years, a comprehensively greater affluence and better mobility.</P>
    <P>The real background to this Bill is the political events in Romania which exposed a cruel regime, a regime which outlawed contraception and compelled married women to have children they neither wanted nor could cope with.  The plight of the thousands of children in institutional care in Romania awakened the concern of decent people everywhere. These pictures were shown on television and in the newspapers.  Many Irish couples anxious to adopt set out for Romania to bring one, or in many cases, two and three of these children into their own homes.  I would question what is to happen to older children, the children who are ill, who have never had a normal home life and who will not be attractive to adopters.  I wonder what the future is for these children.  The younger children and the babies will continue to be adopted.</P>
    <P>To date, according to the Department of Justice, 450 clearance certificates have been given for Romanian children.  In effect this was the only official formal document that was given out for couples who were travelling and it indicated that this State would allow the child in on their return and without it the adoption applications would not be entertained. Full credit has to go to the Department of Justice for the way they have dealt with these applications.</P>
    <P>Like others I want to see this Bill pass as soon as possible.  I am aware there is a great reservoir of goodwill on all sides, and many of the difficulties perceived can be overcome with proper analysis and scrutiny.  I appreciate that the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, has real and genuine reservations about certain aspects of the Bill.  He mentioned three <Col N="788" />&mdash; the eligibility of the child, the consent of the natural parents and the eligibility and suitability of the adoptive parents.  I have to say I would share his concern that the consent clause should be fully respected where it is relevant.  However, I also realise that it is clear that for the vast majority of these children in Romania the parental links have long been broken and consent from them would be an impossibility.  The question of a constitutional test of this Bill was posed by other speakers.  While I accept the advice of the Law Reform Commission that this is not deemed necessary, at the same time I feel confident that prior to the Bill being signed into law President Mary Robinson will be a very suitable arbiter of its contents.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, an important provision which I would like to see inserted at section 12, would be a post-adoption monitoring role for the health board or the Adoption Board.  Irish adopted children enjoy this in their adoptive families, so in my opinion should inter-country adopted children.  I have no doubt this would be welcome by adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the debate surrounding it illustrates clearly a need for a new adoption law, one that recognises the radical changes which have taken place in Irish society in the last 25 years, certainly since the introduction of the original Adoption Act in 1952.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Government would now address themselves to drafting such a new Act as quickly as possible.  I am glad to see that the other Minister who will be involved in children Bills is now sitting opposite.  I hope such a new Act would take account of the shift from Irish adoptions to foreign adoptions and the new realisation that there is a mutual desire in both adopted children and their natural mothers to get in touch with each other, and this should be possible.  Further, there should be an extension of the categories now eligible to adopt.  These are just some of the things that need to be changed.  We certainly need a radical rethink of existing adoption legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally I would again commend my constituency colleague, Deputy Shatter, <Col N="789" /> for his work on this Bill.  I also extend my thanks and appreciation to the Minister for Health for agreeing to accept the Bill. I know it is no easy act under the parliamentary system we operate for a Minister to come in and agree to take a Bill which is in his area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and I hope it has a very speedy passage.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak in favour of the motion that this Bill be given a Second Reading. I am particularly pleased that for the first time in many years an Opposition Bill has been taken on board by a majority Government.  Perhaps it is a sign of a more mature and responsible attitude by the present Government to the proceedings in this House.  Now that this precedent has been set, may we expect a similar response on other Private Members' Bills?</P>
      <P>My pleasure at the Government's attitude to this Bill is tempered by the deep regret that they did not take a similar attitude to Deputy Shatter's other Private Members' Bill on the Environmental Protection Agency, which was refused a Second Reading in the Dáil more than a year ago.  I would remind Members of the House that the Government Bill dealing with this matter has still not come before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to the Recognition of Foreign Adoptions Bill, 1990, this Bill is absolutely essential, which is evident from the debate so far and from the many representations I have received from constituents and in particular from the Irish-Romanian Adoptive Parents' Group.  It may not be generally realised that there is a very small number of children available here for adoption.  There is a great tradition in this country of adopting unwanted children, both by parents who already have natural children or by childless couples.  Many of us who are unable to have children of our own feel a lack of fulfilment in our marriage because of the <Col N="790" /> lack of children.  Some people have resorted to such obscene practices as using surrogate motherhood which, so far as we know has not spread to this country, and I hope it never will.  It is particularly appropriate, in view of the ever-increasing world population, that childless couples should adopt, rather than seek to increase the world population by such a dubious method.</P>
    <P>It can be truly said that this Bill kills a number of birds with one stone, in that while it deals with the recognition of foreign adoptions it nevertheless particularly targets the problems of the Romanian babies.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay very great tribute to the courage and persistence of those couples who have gone to Romania to seek the adoption of these children.  I do not need to spell out to the House the appalling conditions to which these babies are subjected.  Certainly, every possible facility should be given to Irish parents seeking to adopt these children. However, care should be taken that the adoptive parents should be subject to a reasonable test of competency and resources to care for these children.</P>
    <P>Our great pleasure at the adoption of this Bill which ensures the future wellbeing of some of these unfortunate children must not blind us to the dreadful problems in the orphanages in Romania. Only the youngest and the best are being adopted; the rest lie there in absolutely appalling conditions, especially those whose parents cannot be traced because, as Members are probably aware, Romanian law provides that no adoptions can take place without the express permission of the natural parents.  Wellmeaning people and organisations have sent much aid to Romania but there are now very serious doubts as to how much of this is actually being utilised in these orphanages.  Much of it is being sold on the black market or removed for personal use by many of those who are assisting in the orphanages.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of children whom nobody wishes to adopt, those who are considered mentally retarded, because of the unspeakable regulations <Col N="791" /> still in existence and the many babies and children who have AIDS.  We can only do a very small amount in this country in assisting in the future welfare and wellbeing of Romanian babies by this Bill, but at least we know that some of these babies are in good homes and some Irish parents have the pleasure of knowing they have rescued children from a future of no hope.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Chris Flood, on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and to wish him every success.  I was his predecessor in that Department and I know he will have many hours, and hopefully years, of enjoyment working with the excellent officials in the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have been given an opportunity to contribute to this debate. Deputies will recall that I had the privilege of having charge of the Child Care Bill as it passed through this House.  That Bill passed all Stages before Christmas and I look forward to introducing it in the Seanad very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Child Care Bill represents the most comprehensive reform of the law in relation to the care and protection of children since the foundation of the State. As is indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government are committed to implementing the Bill, when passed, on a phased basis, and to gradually increase the number of social workers and other staff employed in the child care services. <Col N="792" /> A sum of £1 million was provided in this year's budget to begin work on the implementation of the Bill and additional funding will be provided in subsequent budgets.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also recall that the Child Care Bill was considered by an all-party special committee of the House. I will be the first to acknowledge the important contribution made by the representatives of all parties on that special committee.  The issues which arose at special committee were discussed and examined in a constructive non-party political manner, and it was possible to reach a consensus on many of them.  For my part, I was very happy to accept all worthwhile amendments to the original provisions in the Bill in the spirit in which they were proposed by the various representatives.  There is no doubt that the Child Care Bill was greatly improved as a result of the deliberations of the special committee and I would like once again to express my sincere gratitude to those Deputies from all sides of the House who are associated with it, and particularly to those who participated in the committee.</P>
    <P>Based on my experience with the Child Care Bill, I am confident that the special committee appointed to examine the Recognition of Foreign Adoptions Bill will be successful in developing and improving the proposals contained in it to the extent necessary to ensure that it will provide a secure legal framework for the recognition of foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to highlight some of the proposals in the Bill about which I have reservations, I would like to acknowledge Deputy Shatter's initiative in introducing the measure.  His action was motivated out of concern for those parents who have adopted children in Romania and in other countries and who are encountering various difficulties with their adoptions.</P>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to my Government colleagues for their positive response to the Bill.  The decision not to oppose a Second Reading of the Bill demonstrates that the Government are very concerned about the problems being <Col N="793" /> experienced by the adoptive parents of foreign children, and that they are committed to finding a workable solution to their problems.  It is particularly gratifying to note that the Government's anxiety to avoid a divisive potential wrangle on this sensitive issue, which would have reflected badly on this House, has been publicly acknowledged and warmly welcomed by the group representing the adoptive parents of Romanian children. The suggestion made in some quarters that the Government's decision was influenced by other considerations is unworthy of comment.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed on the desirability of enacting legislation which will clearly define the circumstances in which a foreign adoption is entitled to recognition in the State.  Indeed, the Government were already in the process of preparing their own legislation to deal with the matter when they graciously decided to accept the principle of this Bill for the reasons that I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Since the validity or otherwise of a foreign adoption order under Irish law affects a matter as fundamental as the adoptive parent's entitlement to exercise parental rights with respect to the child, it is very important that the legal criteria for recognising a foreign adoption should be explicit.  It is equally important that the criteria should reflect the standards and safeguards applicable in our own adoption process, be in conformity with the Constitution and have due regard to our commitments under international conventions.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a number of mechanisms by which a foreign adoption would be entitled to recognition.</P>
    <P>The first two mechanisms are related to the domicile and habitual residence of the adoptive parents at the time of the adoption.  I have no objection in principle to these proposals.  Of course, regard must also be had to whether the foreign country in question operated a civilised system of legal adoption and whether the adoption has substantially the same legal consequences as an Irish adoption.</P>
    <P>Recognition principles based on domicile and habitual residence are in line <Col N="794" /> with the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission.  The important point to bear in mind in relation to these connecting factors is that they would recognise the long standing connection that the adoptive parents have with the foreign country where the adoption takes place.  In some instances not only would the adoptive parents have lived in the foreign country concerned for a considerable period of time but they would also have been born there.  The effect of the provision in relation to domicile would be to put the apparent position at common law on a statutory footing.  As my colleague the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, has already pointed out, recognition based on domicile and habitual residence would be of no benefit to those Irish people who travelled to Romania or elsewhere for the sole purpose of adopting a child.</P>
    <P>These cases are without question the most difficult cases for which to legislate. It is unfortunate that the Law Reform Commission provide no guidance on the matter.  Indeed, the Commission make it clear in the introduction to their report that they do not deal with cases where Irish people travel abroad for the sole purpose of adopting.  It is important to emphasise this point to counteract suggestions made by some Opposition Deputies that the Law Reform Commission's proposals cover these cases.</P>
    <P>In order to set the record straight I would like to quote the following two paragraphs from the introduction to the Commission's report:</P>
    <P>At the same time, the limitations on our present inquiry should be understood. As we have pointed out, it seems likely that an increasing number of Irish parents are seeking to adopt children abroad.  We have been informed by the Adoption Board that they receive a small number of applications from such couples who have &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; children abroad and who now wish to adopt the child under Irish law.  Such overseas &ldquo;adoptions&rdquo; have usually been effected in Third World countries.  In the majority of cases dealt <Col N="795" /> with by the board, the requirements of Irish law as to eligibility for adoption and the obtaining of consents were met.  In others, however, they were not, so that it was not possible for the Board to grant the applications for adoption under Irish law.  Since the adoptive parents in such cases are neither domiciled nor even resident for any significant period of time in the country of adoption, it is obvious that such adoptions would fail to meet the threshold requirements of any systems of recognition of foreign adoption decrees which uses normally acceptable criteria.  It is unfortunately the case that adoptive parents in this position will not necessarily be assisted by the proposals in our Report if they are implemented.</P>
    <P>The Commission fully recognises the problem created by such adoptions and accepts that they are likely to increase with the decreasing number of children available for adoption in the State and the continuing rise in the population of Third World countries.  It is generally acknowledged, however, that this problem can only be tackled at an international level and it has already been decided that the 17th session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law in 1993 will be devoted to the finalisation of a convention on <i>The Adoption of Children Coming from Abroad</i>.  In these circumstances, it would be premature for the Commission to embark on an examination of this particular topic.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this quotation that the Law Reform Commission's report does not provide a working basis for creating a framework for the recognition of this type of foreign adoption.  In fairness to the Commission, it must be borne in mind that the Commission's report was completed before the situation in Romania developed.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to deal with this type of adoption by providing for their recognition based solely on the nationality and residence of the child.  I share the grave <Col N="796" /> reservations expressed by previous Government speakers about the acceptability of this proposal.  As the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has already set out in detail the serious implications of the proposal, I shall confine myself to some general comments on it.</P>
    <P>The first point I would make is that the nationality and residence of the adopted child is but one of the factors that needs to be taken into consideration.  Regard must also be had to the type of adoption system operated by the foreign country in question, the consent of the natural parent, the eligibility of the child and the eligibility and suitability of the adoptive parents.  These considerations also arise in relation to the other recognition mechanisms proposed in the Bill.  They are by no means exclusive to one mechanism. This is one of the matters that will need to be addressed at Special Committee.</P>
    <P>I believe that any criteria for the recognition of foreign adoption orders granted to people who are domiciled or habitually resident here at the time of the adoption must include consideration of their eligibility to adopt under Irish law.  Since their main connection is with this country rather than the foreign country surely their entitlement to recognition must depend, among other matters, on whether they fulfil the eligibility requirements of our own adoption laws.  It would be manifestly contrary to public policy to provide for the recognition of a foreign adoption order granted to an Irish couple domiciled here whose marriage is not recognised by the State and who are therefore ineligible to adopt here.  Such a provision would also be in contravention of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children, to which the State is a party.  I must point out that section 4 of the Bill as it stands does not exclude such an adoption from recognition. This is another matter that will have to be examined at Special Committee.</P>
    <P>I also find it difficult to understand the omission from the Bill of any reference to the consent of the natural parent or legal guardian.  I cannot envisage a single <Col N="797" /> set of circumstances in which the recognition of any foreign adoption could be considered without reference to whether the necessary consents were given or dispensed with on appropriate grounds.</P>
    <P>Under our own adoption laws the consent of the natural parent or legal guardian of the child is normally required for the various adoption procedures.  The Adoption Board are precluded from making an adoption order for a child without the necessary consent unless the board are satisfied, following detailed inquiries, that the person whose consent is required either cannot be found or is mentally incapable of giving consent. These are the only two grounds on which the board may dispense with consent without the necessity of referring the matter to the courts.  In all other cases the authority of the High Court is required to the making of an adoption order in the absence of parental consent.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that the European Convention on the Adoption of Children also prohibits the grant of an adoption without the consent of the natural parent or legal guardian save on exceptional grounds determined by law.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the foregoing that consent is a fundamental feature of any civilised system of legal adoption.  It goes without saying that consent must also be included in any criteria for the recognition of foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that Deputy Shatter has attempted in section 6 to define the criteria applicable when the Minister for Health is called upon to determine whether a particular country or jurisdiction is entitled to designation.  It will be essential to broaden the criteria proposed to include the consent of the natural parent or guardian and other relevant factors.  I also consider that the same criteria should apply irrespective of who is called upon to determine whether a particular foreign adoption is entitled to recognition.  Section 9 as drafted provides no guidance to the High Court as to the criteria by which it is to decide whether an adoption is entitled to recognition. Surely the court should have regard to the same matters as the Minister for Health <Col N="798" /> would be required to have regard to under section 6.</P>
    <P>One fundamental question the Special Committee will not be able to resolve is whether it is constitutionally permissible to recognise foreign adoptions made in respect of children born within marriage. Only the Supreme Court could give a definitive ruling on this issue.  At this stage it is not even know whether an Irish adoption order may be made in respect of a foreign child born within marriage under the terms of the Adoption Act, 1988.  My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, has already expressed the view that it might be necessary to amend the Constitution in order to allow for the recognition of foreign adoption orders relating to children born within marriage.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to correct what Deputy Therese Ahearn told the House last Wednesday in relation to the Law Reform Commission.  The commission did not state in their report that the Constitution does not prevent the recognition of foreign adoption orders made in respect of children of married parents.  What the commission said was that the recognition of such orders would not necessarily be inconsistent with the Constitution.  This suggests to me that the commission, like the rest of us, are unsure whether such a provision would be in conformity with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Health's announcement to the House that he is already in the process of arranging for the health boards to undertake home study assessments for people seeking to adopt abroad.  In the context of Romania, this move coupled with the establishment of a centralised committee for adoptions there should facilitate contact and co-operation between the authorities in the two countries in relation to future arrangements for the adoption of Romanian children by Irish people.</P>
    <P>I want to give one word of warning about the Bill.  The committee dealing with the Bill must be given ample time to deliberate and adjudicate on the many legal and constitutional complexities involved in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> I should like to conclude my contribution but emphasising that we all appreciate the anxiety of Irish parents who have adopted children abroad to have their position regularised under Irish law and that we are all committed to finding a solution to their problems which will stand up in law.  The difficult task of achieving this will fall on the all-party Special Committee appointed to examine the Bill.  I wish that committee well in their deliberations and I sincerely hope they will be as successful as the committee who considered the Child Care Bill.  I wish the Bill and the committee every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Chris Flood on his recent and well merited elevation to Minister of State and to wish him well in his new office.  Coming as we do from adjoining constituencies we have had occasion in the past to communicate often.  I know he will carry out his new duties extremely well.</P>
      <P>The aims and objectives set out in Deputy Shatter's Bill are commendable. He seeks to provide a mechanism which will enable Irish couples to go abroad to adopt children in need.  Unfortunately, the Bill as it stands falls far short of what is required but no doubt the appropriate adjustments and improvements will be made to it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister and the Government have decided not to oppose the Bill in view of the major social implications involved.  Many caring Irish couples have gone to Romania, for example, to adopt babies who were living in atrocious conditions.  These are wonderful caring people who provide good homes for these children.  It is of the utmost importance that these good people are not exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we in Ireland should consider ourselves very fortunate to be in such a comparatively affluent situation as to be able to consider adopting children from abroad.  We should not forget that not so long ago, through a combination of poverty and stigma, many young <Col N="800" /> unmarried mothers were forced to go to England where their babies could be adopted and that many of those who had their babies here had to give up their babies for adoption to people from the US, Canada, and Australia because there was no proper provision in our law for their adoption by Irish people.  Thus, it was a sense of national shame that led to the passing of the 1952 Adoption Act which established legal adoption here for the first time.  It would serve us well to remember that piece of recent social history when it comes to considering legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>We would also do well to remember who adoption is for.  It is not, as is sometimes thought, a romantic solution to the problem of childlessness.  Adoption is a service for children and their parents, first and foremost, and is not primarily a service for childless couples.  It is also worth keeping in mind the short history of inter-country adoptions which has really only existed since the end of the last world war.  This issue has been the subject of studies by the UN since 1953 culminating in the excellent 1986 UN resolution which made special reference to foster placement and adoption both nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of Deputy Shatter's Bill provides for a mechanism whereby foreign adoption orders could be retrospectively recognised in this country provided they were made by a lawful authority in the country of origin.  This provision presupposes that both countries would have similar laws and adoption procedures.  Irish adoption practice is of a very high standard and is one of which we can be justifiably proud.  However, the same cannot be said of the adoption practices in some other countries. Children are not valued in some countries and child care practice is of dubious quality. Consequently we need to be more rather than less careful in how we deal with such countries.  What might be common practice in these countries might be illegal here.  For example, while it is illegal in Ireland for third parties other than registered adoption societies to arrange adoptions it is normal in some <Col N="801" /> other countries for all manner of third parties to do so.  How can we accept such standards without creating a two-tier system?  It is illegal for money to change hands in adoption cases here, but such practices are common place abroad.  We must not appear to condone or collude with what may amount to baby trading. Unfortunately the Bill as it is drafted contains no in-built mechanism to avoid such malpractices.</P>
    <P>Another major deficiency in the Bill is that it does not envisage a role for the adoption board, the regulatory body for all adoptions in Ireland.  If we have two different systems for granting adoption orders, are we not creating two different types of adoptees and in so doing creating two different types of citizens?  It would clearly be unconstitutional and totally unacceptable to establish any form of second-class citizenship.  The January issue of <i>The Irish Law Times</i> criticised this Bill for excluding the adoption board from adoptions, and I concur with that view.  It is extraordinary that the Adoption Board is excluded from a Bill which purports to put all adoptions here on an equal footing.  Why is it necessary to set up a two-tier system, one for indigenous adoptions and a quite separate one for those from abroad?  This seems rather illogical if the aim is to have a unified system.  There might be some coherence in this plan were we dealing with countries which have laws and adoption procedures akin to our own, for example, other EC countries, but this is patently not the case with, for example, Romania.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report on inter-country adoption which Deputy Shatter quoted extensively but rather selectively recommends that we should have a mechanism to recognise adoptions from countries with laws and procedures similar to our own.  Countries like Peru, the Philippines and Romania, due to the levels of poverty and oppression, cannot provide the safeguards with regard to adoption that we consider necessary, and therefore it is up to us to provide them. I would hate to think we would leave ourselves open in any way, even indirectly, to becoming involved in child <Col N="802" /> trafficking.  I would like to protect Irish couples from being exploited.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in Brazil alone 1,600 children a year are abducted for the purpose of sale to wealthy foreigners.  In Italy it is not unknown for the Mafia to become involved in auctions of healthy white babies.  Last year a woman from South America successfully fought a case in an Israeli court for the return of her child which had been taken from her illegally. Do we want to involve ourselves in this aspect of foreign adoption?  If not, we must install proper safeguards.  This Bill as it stands does not do so, and indeed could open up opportunities to exploit children and adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (b) of the Bill states that there should be: &ldquo;as far as is practicable, a proper inquiry relating to the adopter or adopters, the child available for adoption and the guardian or guardians and natural parent or parents of the child carried out by a public or private authority or by a properly qualified person with expertise in the area of adoption&rdquo;.  By not insisting that this work be done by bona fide, suitable qualified people, it seems Deputy Shatter is prepared to accept practically anyone, any middleman or go-between, as a suitable private authority for the purpose of adoption.  If he wishes to exclude undesirable third parties he should be guided by our own Adoption Act, 1952, and make it explicit.  It is perhaps noteworthy that even in Romania where corruption is still rife new regulations have been introduced to control unscrupulous baby traders from exploiting foreigners.</P>
    <P>What constitutes a proper inquiry?  To say the least, this is vague in the Bill.  It does not insist, for example, that the consent given by the parents should be a fully informed one.  As Deputy Shatter knows well, the Supreme Court has specified how important this is.  These are not mere technicalities; they go right to the core of the matter.  No adoptive parent should be exposed to any doubt that the child placed with them was placed properly and with due regard to the rights of his or her parents.  At a later date they <Col N="803" /> may have to answer very searching questions from the child, the most difficult of which may well be &ldquo;Why was I adopted?&rdquo;.  It will not be enough to explain about the political situation, poverty and so on as the next question from the child will be &ldquo;Were all the other children in my country adopted?&rdquo;, to which the answer will have to be no.  This leads logically to the next question: &ldquo;Why me?  Of all the children in my country why was I not able to stay with my parents when other children could?&rdquo;  Without saying &ldquo;Because your birth parents did not want you&rdquo;, which of course would be extremely damaging to the child, this question can only be answered with a combination of skill and intimate knowledge, gleaned by an impartial, properly trained and properly motivated person. A mere inquiry does not necessarily convey the degree of tact, concern or objectivity that is required to carry out this most sensitive task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has gone on record as criticising the Government for what he termed a knee-jerk reaction to this issue, but he should know from his time on the Special Committee dealing with the Child Care Bill, which was excellently handled by the Minister in front of me, a committee of which I was also a member, that this Government take a cautious and thorough approach to complex issues concerning children.  The same approach will be evident in this case.</P>

      <P>The central problem is not what is happening in this country in relation to the adoption of Romanian children.  That situation is only a symptom of a greater problem, namely, a history of arch conservative laws and practice in the area of adoption generally. It is fortuitous that the two events have crossed: the dramatic events leading to the collapse of the totalitarian regime in Romania led to a significant number of Irish citizens adopting abandoned Romanian children on the one hand, and on the other, the State has failed and neglected to legislate for the recognition <Col N="804" /> of foreign adoptions in any circumstances. This failure had been addressed by the Law Reform Commission and their report was published in June 1989, in advance of the Romanian upheaval.</P>
      <P>The need for, and the debate on, the recognition of foreign adoptions existed independent of the events in Romania. Needless to say, however, that without those tragic events so graphically described and witnessed in many media reports, we, as legislators, would not have found time or interest in addressing this issue, of recognising foreign adoptions. The House, therefore, is thankful to Deputy Shatter for the Bill and to the Government for accepting it for consideration on Committee Stage, but that is only as it should be.  If this House is ever to attract people as Members who have the expertise and knowledge to enhance our work as legislators, then a much more accommodating approach to Private Members' initiatives and interventions needs to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission have acknowledged the expertise of the mover of the Bill.  Deputy Shatter was one of only six people who made observations on their consultancy paper on the matter and the only such person from outside Government or State agencies concerned with issues surrounding foreign adoption. It will be a source of encouragement then for other Members and groups in Opposition that this excellent piece of legislation will be moved, with Government support, to a Select Committee of the House and dealt with thoroughly there.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party will give their fullest support to the Bill in Committee as they do at this Second Stage.  We anticipate and expect that the composition will be as with the previous Special Committees on Company Law, Child Care and Marital Separation and will involve a Workers' Party Member or Members. A place and opportunity should also be afforded to Independents in the House on this Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to come back to the provisions of the Bill and deal with some of the Minister's reservations later.  It must be <Col N="805" /> expected that the approach of Government on Committee Stage will be in the spirit of offering practical help and support to all parents who have adopted children abroad and that the experience of the Judicial Separation Bill will not be repeated.  In the select committee dealing with that Bill the Government sought to dismantle the best provisions and were only forced to accept a workable formula by the will of this House, who voted for the recommittal of the Bill to Committee in the face of a negative attitude to its provisions by Government.</P>
    <P>It must be noted with concern the many reservations voiced by the Minister and other speakers on the Government side in their contributions and reference to if not reliance on the restrictions &mdash; selfimposed &mdash; of the Law Reform Commission report on the subject.  Many parents with children adopted outside the State, in Romania and elsewhere, are appreciative of the progress achieved here last week but are still worried that what is, or may be, eventually cobbled together by us, will not meet their requirements or needs.  I want to urge the Minister to adopt &mdash; if that is not importing too strong a pun &mdash; a broad and flexible approach to this issue and to avoid a party political row on issues at the Committee.  I must warn him that if he proceeds to Committee carrying many of the false issues or artificial constraints evidenced in his contribution, The Workers' Party will be there to take him on and to resist his very narrow attitude. We believe that all genuine parents who have adopted children abroad should &mdash; and must &mdash; be accommodated in our legislation and this can and should be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is a fact not often appreciated that the State did not legislate on adoption until 1952.  In the first 30 years of this State's existence no laws were available to the courts or to citizens to deal with or to regularise adoptions, at home or abroad, involving Irish citizens.  At its first attempt in 1952, the State took a very cautious and conservative initial step; the provisions of the 1952 Act allowed for <Col N="806" /> adoption in the narrowest terms conceivable, of children between the ages of six months and seven years who were orphaned or born outside wedlock.</P>
    <P>In his seminal book on <i>Fundamental Rights in Irish Law and Constitution</i>, the late Professor John M. Kelly summed up the matter graphically, and I quote from his text at page 239 as follows:</P>
    <P>Previously there was no legal adoption system in Ireland, and adoptive parents were faced with the possibility that the mother of an illegitimate child adopted by them might demand back her child, even after the lapse of many years.  To such a claim only the strongest considerations of the child's welfare would provide an answer.  The adoptive parents had, as such, no rights.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Act and its subsequent interpretation by the courts has been added to and built upon by our Judiciary.  As a result the law has become almost stagnant and proves very difficult to operate.  The backdrop of the provisions of the Constitution and the family in Article 41 has provided a sure foundation for this conservative, if not impossible, position.  The legislators undoubtedly framed the 1952 Act with the provisions of Article 41 in mind. Consequently, no legitimate child born in wedlock could be adopted, no matter what the circumstances.  This position appertains up to the present day except for a modification of the law in the Act of 1988 and other minor alterations in the Acts of 1964 and 1974.</P>
    <P>Equally, to be adopted, a child must ordinarily be resident within the State; thus, Irish parents living abroad for work or other reasons, could not have their adoptions accepted as of right under existing legislation on resuming residency here.  It was not until 1974 that the principle that the welfare of the child should be the dominant and paramount consideration was incorporated in our law.  For the first time, 50 or more years after the State was founded, we wrote into our laws a provision that moved our adoptions away from the idea, as one commentator, Father James Good, said <Col N="807" /> in an article in <i>Legal Adoption in Ireland</i> in 1971:</P>
    <P>The child is the property of the mother and short of killing or physically maltreating it, she can do just what she likes with it.</P>
    <P>That is a very narrow interpretation of the concept of the family provided indirectly by the Constitution in Article 41.3.1º and cautiously interpreted by the courts and it has meant that only married couples, in the main, would be allowed to adopt.  Two people applying must always be married and single applicants must be a natural parent or close relative of the child.  At a time when other countries have regard for the concept of the family as something not necessarily founded on marriage or indeed based on the union of opposite sexes, we are still caught in a narrow straitjacket that will continue to cause unnecessary hardships and difficulties in this regard.  The interjection of the Constitution and the regard for non-nationals before our courts in matters of the family have been very narrowly and unnecessarily harshly interpreted. This is no better illustrated than in the case of Mr. Antonio Tamburrini as set out in the Law Reform Commission's report at page 4.  I will quote the facts of that case to illustrate how ridiculous our laws are and as they operate in regard to non-nationals before our courts:</P>
    <P>Here, an Irish woman had gone to live in Scotland where the gave birth to a boy, outside marriage.  She sent the child back to be reared by her parents in Ireland, and over the years contributed regularly towards his maintenance.  When the boy was four, she married a divorced man in Scotland, who was not the child's father. The following year she and her husband formally adopted the boy under the provision of the Adoption of Children (Scotland) Act, 1930.  They later sought custody of the child from his grandparents, who resisted their request.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> The High Court rejected the application of the mother and adoptive father, and the child was permitted to remain with his grandparents.  The Court was primarily concerned with the child's religious welfare, which, it felt, would not be served by moving the child to Scotland.</P>
    <P>These situations cannot and should not be allowed to continue.  There must be a willingness here to ensure that in placing the interests of the child as the paramount consideration, we do not allow the narrow Catholic or conservative attitudes of past years to influence or deflect us from the job to be done, namely, the acceptance in greatest measure of the Bill before the House.  This is imperative when we see a lead now being given by our courts in this area and in a liberal direction.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court, in the judgment on the reference to it by the President of the 1988 Act, had little or no difficulty formulating a view that the family as an institution would be strengthened and further protected by allowing children of wedlock to be adopted where the child had been abandoned or deserted of parental care.  The court rejected the narrow attitude heretofore held.  In page 11 of the report of the Law Reform Commission it said:</P>
    <P>The Court rejects the submission that the nature of the family as a unit group possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights makes it constitutionally impermissible for a statute to restore to any member of an individual family constitutional rights of which he has been deprived by a method which disturbs or alters the constitution of that family if that method is necessary to achieve that purpose.</P>
    <P>This must be taken as a guiding light to our deliberations and, with that attitude and a little ingenuity on all our parts, we can provide a solution for all parents and children concerned.  If we continue to waive the Constitution or bend to a <Col N="809" /> narrow minded lobby, then we will get nowhere.</P>
    <P>Speaking of narrow mindedness, special mention must be made of the provisions of the 1952 Act, in particular section 12, which required the parents adopting to be of the same religion as the child and parents or mother, where the child was born outside wedlock.  As a result, parents of a mixed marriage could never adopt and this continued until 1974 when the High Court found the provision to be unconstitutional.  Now, under the 1974 Act, some relief has been afforded to adoptive parents in a mixed marriage.</P>
    <P>Finally, some mention must be made of the role of the adoption societies and the Adoption Board in perpetuating a regime of conservatism in their vetting and assessing of suitable applicants.  The unbelievable intrusions visited on applicants by the societies, in meeting their own interpretations of the law and its requirements, are unbelievable in the extreme.  Many parents to whom I have spoken simply abandoned all hope in the face of the standards and inquiries levelled at them.  Many more tell of taking up churchgoing as a necessity to maintain appearances for the societies.  We must at some stage address these issues if we are to deal properly with the problems now facing us, and which exist for all prospective adoptive parents at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that adoption is in some way unreal and not to be encouraged. Our tardiness as a State in dealing with matters of adoption is a reflection of this.  To adopt from another country or race is taken to be even more unreal in the minds of many.  In a rapidly changing and expanding world of easy travel and inter-country trade and commerce, we should now recognise that adoptions outside the State are a permanent phenomenon, as natural as they are inevitable.</P>
    <P>This Bill allows us to recognise these facts and enables us to respond intelligently to this situation.  Adoption is a normal and natural response to circumstances of need involving children and parents alike.  Nothing should be done to create artificial and narrow <Col N="810" /> minded obstacles in the way of the accommodation of all adoptions that are based on the best interests of needy children and which meet reasonable standards. In this context, therefore, we should look at the need for the current legislation.  There are some points which need to be underscored.  First, there is no law governing the situations of foreign adoptions; secondly, adoptions at home are decreasing annually and do not meet our home needs.  Third, foreign adoptions are a normal and ever increasing feature of family life and should be so treated affording equality of treatment and a caring approach.  Fourth, the efforts of well meaning adoptive parents and foreign children must be respected and supported.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is a gross disservice to those outside the House who have raised this issue, the mover of the Bill and those who have sought to support its provisions to suggest that we want to facilitate the trafficking of children.  The Bill if looked at carefully will be seen to be comprehensive in its approach and design and capable of meeting any of the reservations expressed, particularly by those who have suggested that trafficking might be accommodated in some way by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Fifth, the standards applied and the requirements which have to be met in many other countries, including Romania, easily meet the standards expected here and should be accepted. Furthermore, a bilateral scheme at national level should be established.  One of the lies which has been thrown in obliquely to this debate, in the context of Romanian adoptions, which I will deal with shortly, is that the standards there are not as good as those laid down in this State to date.</P>
    <P>Sixth, the health boards and the Adoption Board should become involved in the area of foreign adoptions and resources made available to those seeking to adopt abroad.</P>
    <P>Seventh, in the instance of Romania, the standards are high and exacting.  For example, the consent of the mother or, <Col N="811" /> where she cannot be contacted, that of her parents is required.  No Romanian child in Ireland has been brought here without such consent.  Furthermore, a full social inquiry must be presented by the adopting parents.  It has been pointed out that adopting parents have gone to Britain and elsewhere to seek professional aid and support in providing such reports because of the absence of such support at home.  A court in Romania must also approve any adoption order while a 15 day interregnum exists once the court has approved the order to allow reflection and reconsideration by both the natural and adoptive parents. Therefore, there is no fault or deficiency in the Romanian standards which would inhibit the Minister, once this Bill becomes law, from entering into a bilateral arrangement with that country.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal briefly with the Minister's approach to this Bill.  I believe that he misunderstands the law and that other Members on the Government side of the House have unwittingly borrowed his arguments without first considering them.  In particular, he believes that an Irish court or statute dealing with foreign adoptions would require all the same rules and standards of the foreign country making the adoption order as would be applied or required at home.  This is not so and unless the Minister irons out this matter satisfactorily before the Bill is dealt with by the Special Committee he will persist there in pursuing unnecessary issues.  By suggesting, in the context of the foreign adoptions, that all domestic standards should be met before any agreement can be entered into or recognition can be given to such adoptions we are going to go absolutely nowhere despite the magnanimous gesture of the Minister to allow the Bill proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example.  The Minister stated that a child born within marriage may not be adopted.  However, I would argue, as I hope would others, that such a child should be susceptible to adoption. The Minister stated that he could not support this as part of some open ended <Col N="812" /> scheme and &ldquo;it is not clear whether it is constitutionally permissible&rdquo;.  The simple response is that it is constitutionally possible as it is not a question for our Constitution. The adoption is a matter instead for Romanian law and constitution.  Once we are satisfied with the overall practice and standards and enter a bilateral arrangement, under section 5, the adoptions may proceed and our courts would be entitled to recognise and act upon them.  Therefore, it is up to the Minister in looking at the arrangements which exist in another country, under section 5, to say that we can enter a bilateral agreement.  Once we enter into such an arrangement that would put an end to any doubts as to whether that arrangement meets the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution safeguards the rights of Irish citizens and works to protect the institution of the family.  It is up to the Government to decide if the rules of practice and law, and the standards applied in Romania or other countries, are acceptable, and once they have been designated as acceptable all the child or the adoptive parents need do to give full effect to that adoption is produce a valid order of a competent authority.  This is analogous on all fours with the way foreign divorce orders are given the force of law and recognised here by our courts.  It is ridiculous in the extreme to suggest that we have to hawk our Constitution around the four corners of the earth to see if the arrangements there are in keeping with it.  This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the principles of law and the interchange of laws between nations. Unless the Minister, and the Government, iron out this misunderstanding of the law we are going to get bogged down with endless problems at the Special Committee and repeat the mistakes made when such a committee dealt with the matter of judicial separation.</P>
    <P>The standards of the Romanian adoption procedures are such that no Minister or Government should hesitate for one moment in accepting them.  It should be pointed out that there would be nothing to prevent a foreign natural parent coming to our country to challenge the <Col N="813" /> adoption order before the courts.  This is true in the case of all adoptions whether made here or abroad.  By bringing in the Constitution the Minister has blurred the lines of distinction between the domestic rules of law to be applied to Irish adoptions at home and the rules of private international law to be applied by Irish courts in accepting Irish adoptions made abroad.</P>
    <P>The same reasoning or misunderstanding has been applied by the Minister in touching on other perceived problems, such as the consent of the natural parents being an absolute prerequisite to any adoptions recognised by the courts here.  Given the horrific events which can occur, for example, famine, natural catastrophe or the mad-cap proposals of Ceausescu in the seventies and early eighties that mothers produce babies regardless of whether they wanted them, a Minister may well say that we can dispense with the absolute prerequisite of the consent of the natural parents.  That is not the case in Romania but we must reserve the right in law for a Minister to look at each case, country by country. Those who suggest that a constitutional bar exists fail to recognise the distinctions which exist between constitutional requirements at home and the rules of private international law.</P>
    <P>A further requirement to be met here is that the age of the child needs to be a minimum of six weeks.  The Minister stated that, perhaps, we should demand this of laws abroad.  Again, circumstances may arise where a child younger than six weeks deserves to be adopted.  Should we throw out the proposition that there is something in our Constitution which might make that difficult and suggest that one reason for not allowing the Minister to proceed is that we may end up with a two-tier adoption system between people lucky to adopt at home and others who have the courage to go abroad?  We should not talk about such unrealities. We can have a caring and broad approach to this problem or we can devise schemes <Col N="814" /> and obstacles that need not and should not exist and that will defeat the purpose of what we wish to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to raise the problem of join adopters being of necessity married and-or living together.  Again, the Minister borrows the European Convention on Adoption as an argument in aid.  Let us remember that instrument dates from 1967 and we have moved on 20 years.  Perhaps it is time to review that document and where it interferes with and impedes the progress of enlightened legislation to meet the problems we want to deal with here and which the people who are concerned in Romania want us to deal with, let us derogate from all or any of those provisions of 1967 that do not help us.  Let us not look for obstacles where they do not exist.</P>
    <P>Single parent adoptions are argued against because they would in some way introduce two-tier or unconstitutional considerations.  Again this is an artificial introduction of an obstacle that need not concern us.  There may well be circumstances existing here at home involving people adopting here or elsewhere who are single people, who because of the absence of divorce here are not able to marry but have stable relationships that can be established on comprehensive social inquiry.  If that is so we should be working in our legislation to facilitate those people as well.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister is somewhat ingenious in his drawing up of arguments in quoting this spurious passage in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> report saying the same standards should apply.  I disagree with that editorial.  I believe a Minister who would adopt a comprehensive approach, an approach that should be caring and seeking to help solve a problem rather than create obstacles, would be prepared to stand up to the reasoning there.  In any event, the sad, sadistic history of Romania under Ceausescu makes a case for a departure, especially in regard to children of married couples, or for the dispensation of the mother's or parents' <Col N="815" /> consent in particular instances.  Otherwise the provisions of section 12 involving the health board and contact there comes into play so that no unstable persons, as in the instance given in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> report and borrowed by the Minister, or couple would be facilitated by any other country abroad.  If we involve the health board they will then ensure that on referral back such a couple or person going abroad would not be accommodated.</P>
    <P>If we want to create difficulties we can do so; there is no problem in that. However, I say to the Minister and those who would seek so to suggest, the area is not necessarily as complex as we are led to believe.  An approach with an open mind and the will to find solutions will guide and aid us.  The basis for a comprehensive address to the problems is well laid in the provisions of this Bill. Therefore, it deserves the support of this House not just on Second Stage; it deserves an enlightened and comprehensive approach when we come to Committee Stage where I have no doubt we will put together a Bill that will meet the needs of all the people who are concerned and who are watching us so closely today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened with interest to Deputy McCartan's contribution over the past half hour, I must say I was struck by how simple things are in his world.  In the course of the half hour he succeeded in doing away with the Constitution, the European Convention on Adoption, the UN Charter on Children's Rights and God knows what else from other countries in which I am not too aware of the law.  If things were that simple I cannot understand how a Bill like this was not introduced ages ago and passed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heartily concur with his opening remarks, that it is good the Bill is going to a Special Committee of the House because it concerns a sensitive issue, but I <Col N="816" /> think the best way to avoid party political rows on the Committee would be to refrain from implied threats about what his party will do if they do not get their own way.  He quoted one example of a Special Committee of the House and the problems that arose.  It would have been better in the context of this Bill to cite a more recent example of a Special Committee of the House, that on the Child Care Bill on which Deputy Sherlock and both Deputies opposite here served. There was a spirit of co-operation and a good atmosphere on that Committee and Deputies on all sides contributed and were constructive.  I hope this Committee will be likewise.</P>
    <P>Nobody with any vestige of sympathy who witnessed the harrowing scenes of children in orphanages in Romania following the fall of the Ceausescu regime could contemplate standing in the way of any legislation that would allow the children we saw there to escape from the living death in which they exist.  Nobody who claims to have an ounce of humanity could contemplate allowing bureaucracy or red tape to hold up any procedure that might improve the lot or alleviate the sufferings of the innocent victims of an unjust and corrupt regime.</P>
    <P>The issues which give rise to the Bill before us are very emotive and sensitive. We talk about the plight of the children in Romania, the rights of children and their parents, family rights and obligations under the Constitution and various other constitutional questions. Because the question is emotive and sensitive we, as legislators, must treat it sensitively, but we would be failing in our duty if we were to agree to pass legislation in this House which is based purely on emotion and has little regard for constitutional or legal implications in the future.</P>
    <P>While, in principle, the Bill before us is a good and necessary one and the sooner it is passed the better, I feel there are flaws in it.  I know the parents who <Col N="817" /> have adopted Romanian babies in particular regard it as answering all their problems and resolving a very difficult situation for them and for their children. It would be wonderful if life was as simple as that.  I think no Deputy on any side of this House would not rush to embrace any legislation that would solve this problem very quickly.  We all want to see that type of legislation passed through the House as quickly as possible.  I am sure were such a Bill put forward it would get all-party support very quickly and could be passed within a matter of hours.  That has happened in the past with important legislation.  Unfortunately life is not that simple, the solution to this problem is not that simple, and I presume Deputy Shatter is not that simple either.  As a solicitor and a recognised expert in the area of family law I know he is sufficiently well versed in this law to know his legislation is flawed, unworkable and probably unconstitutional as it stands.  It will solve none of the major and substantive issues relating to foreign adoptions or the constitutional rights of those adopted children and their parents.  While the legislation before us appears to meet the needs of the adoptive parents it fails to tackle the real issues.</P>
    <P>One very important area addressed in the Bill was a matter of frustration for all those who tried to go to Romania and to adopt children there.  That was the area of the home study or assessment visits. That aspect is dealt with in section 12, the provisions of which propose that health boards should undertake such assessments. Because of the difficulties encountered by adoptive parents to date, some regularisation of the current legal position is required, but I do not think it is necessary to pass legislation for that purpose.  I welcome the Minister's announcement last week that arrangements are in hand to organise the assessment procedures obtaining in a more positive manner.  That will meet an immediate need.  I hope it will mean that those parents seeking to adopt foreign <Col N="818" /> babies will not be left with the feeling that everybody is working against them in their efforts to adopt.  That feeling was communicated to me very strongly in recent months, that health boards and adoption societies generally gave the impression they would block the efforts of people who wanted to go abroad to adopt children.  I realise that health boards and adoption societies &mdash; perhaps because of shortage of manpower &mdash; were afraid of the legal implications, which fear was expressed by social workers. Nonetheless, I contend the whole issue could have been handled very much more sensitively.  The impression was given to prospective adoptive parents that everybody was against them, nobody wanted them to adopt foreign babies.  That was an unfortunate impression which I am glad is being addressed.</P>
    <P>I should have asked your permission at the outset, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to share my time with Deputy Martin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the House agreeable to the Deputy's request. Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the Minister's proposals with regard to the assessment procedures are fraught with certain danger.  It is good that an agency or agencies be formally established to ascertain the acceptability or otherwise of parents to adopt foreign babies.  If an agency refuses a prospective adoptive parent approval effectively, probably that will end that parent's chance of adopting in the future.  The current arrangement with private reports being prepared by social workers probably is not the best method of undertaking the task.  On balance it would be better to have some formal, legal arrangement in place.  I welcome the announcement that such is to be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our major concern in relation to the adoption of foreign children must be with regard to its long term implications.  We must ensure that such children will face <Col N="819" /> no long term legal or constitutional difficulties with regard to their status.  We must endeavour to ensure that such children will enjoy full status as Irish citizens so that no challenge, legal or otherwise, can cast any doubt on that in the future.  We must so ensure for the sake of both the adoptive parents and the children adopted.</P>
    <P>Can one imagine the heartbreak involved if legislation passed by this House were found to be flawed or unconstitutional? Deputy McCartan made a very strong case in defence of its not being unconstitutional.  The Minister will have sought and obtained the advice of the Attorney General.  Indeed, the Minister outlined some dangers he foresaw last week.  Once there is any doubt about the Bill before us being unconstitutional we must endeavour to overcome such doubts or difficulties.  Imagine the heartbreak if, in ten or 12 years' time, one of these children had to be returned to Romania?  How could any of us in this House face the adoptive parents of such a child?</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan gave me the impression that he was accusing the Minister of being awkward, of opposing the Bill just for the sake of opposition.  I know that is not the case.  We can all advance various points or arguments on the Bill before us.  We can disagree about its legal or constitutional provisions but I do not think anybody should impugn anybody's motives, whether those of Deputy Shatter in proposing the Bill, the Minister in pointing out flaws or anybody else's.  That should not happen here.  I very much regret that that appeared to be the line followed by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister there is a constitutional difficulty involved in recognising a foreign adoption order relating to children who would be ineligible for adoption in Ireland; presumably that is the advice the Minister was given by the Attorney General.  That question must be addressed by this House which, on my <Col N="820" /> understanding, has not been addressed in the Bill as it stands.  The Adoption Act, 1988, allowed the extension of eligibility of adoption to children whose parents, married or not, were deemed by the High Court to have failed in their constitutional duty to care for them.  The High Court is the only authority that can authorise the making of an adoption order in relation to a child born within marriage.  The High Court can make such an order when satisfied that the natural parents failed in their constitutional duty. As has been pointed out already, the conditions which must be met are set out in the Adoption Act, 1988.  At that time that Bill was referred to the President of the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court emphasised that failure on the part of parents to care for their children &mdash; due to externally originating circumstances, such as poverty &mdash; would not constitute failure within the meaning of the Act. Therefore, it is open to question whether the court would accept that the conditions prevailing in Romania or elsewhere, in themselves, are sufficient grounds to justify the adoption of foreign children here under the 1988 Adoption Act.</P>
    <P>We must also face up to the question &mdash; again dismissed by Deputy McCartan &mdash; whether we can or should accept lower standards for the adoption of foreign babies than those in place for the adoption of Irish children.  For example, is it right, fair, legal or just that we should have certain standards for Irish children and lower standards when foreign babies are involved?  If we apply lower standards to foreign adoptions, is it not then possible that people refused the right to adopt here &mdash; because they may have been in their forties, or were not in a recognised marriage &mdash; would challenge the adoption of some of these foreign children by another couple in similar circumstances? For example, could they claim they were being discriminated against?  If they did, what would be the <Col N="821" /> implications of such an action if successful? For those people who have gone to the trouble, expense and trauma of searching for, finding and adopting a baby in a foreign country, all these considerations must be taken on board and studied carefully.  The best way to tease out all the implications of the provisions of the Bill before us would be through the establishment of a Committee of this House.  In saying what I have, I hope I do not appear to be callous or indifferent to the general plight of those people who have adopted Romanian or other foreign babies.</P>
    <P>My concern is that whatever we do we do it right, so that we can stand over it in the future.  We should be able to have a law which protects these parents and the children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is very relevant in view of the report today.  Why does a State which promises to do so much to protect the rights of its unborn children do as little as possible to protect and care for those children once they are born?  It is estimated that there are at least 700 homeless children under the age of 18 in Ireland and that close to half of them are on the streets of Dublin. Existing services are grossly inadequate as is legislation and child care policy.  Last year there was a monthly average of 31 callers under the age of 18 seeking accommodation at one of the centres for homeless youth in Dublin.  Only 23 per cent of those seeking accommodation last year were successfully placed and the remaining 77 per cent were most likely not placed anywhere.  Growing numbers of young people are seeking accommodation and these people are remaining homeless for longer periods.  Young <Col N="822" /> people are left in a tragic cycle of persistent and intermittent homelessness because of the lack of suitable organisations to help them.  Their needs are obviously not being met through existing child care services.  In the last five years the rampant growth of the problem was met by an increase of one emergency bed only while the number of non-emergency beds actually decreased.  This illustrates the absence of suitable services for homeless youths in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The lack of accommodation means that young people are exploited by the many desperate horrors of life on the streets. There is alcohol abuse, drug abuse and shoplifting.  Crime and even prostitution are a means of survival for these homeless youths.  Their means of survival create further problems for the Garda and for the District Court.  The District Court cannot recommend suitable care for these children.</P>
      <P>In 1990, 21 young people both male and female were sent to adult prisons where, instead of learning how to become productive members of society, they are learning how to commit crimes more successfully. Despite the passing of the Child Care Bill, 1988, through the Dáil and the 1990 declaration of the rights of the child, we still have these problems.  We still have an alarmingly expanded number of poor, undernourished, exploited, unprotected youths on our streets.  There is no new model of care to meet the needs of young people who can no longer remain at home.  There are inadequate funds for the voluntary and statutory bodies who are trying to assist homeless youths.  We have not sufficient emergency accommodation or short term, medium-term or long term accommodation.  No Government Department have claimed responsibility for the care and protection of our children.  The Child Care Bill, 1988, should be speedily enacted and we should ensure that it is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to respond immediately to young homeless people.  We need emergency accommodation for them.  If we <Col N="823" /> could provide 100 emergency beds at a cost of £1 million in this city it would help eliminate the immediate problem.  We need a secure unit for girls.  We need short term, medium-term and long term care facilities and therapeutic facilities and training for child care workers.  We should make provision not only to alleviate the problem but to prevent the problem occurring by providing funds for support services for troubled families strained by unemployment and poverty. It is important to have a 24-hour call service to help people.</P>
    <P>Introducing such measures is the only way we can reduce the numbers of children in the streets.  The problem is worsening.  Fr. Peter McVerry faces eviction from the flat which he has made into one of the few hostels in Dublin for homeless teenage boys.  Fr. McVerry has no problem with leaving the flat which he admits is grossly overcrowded, but only if he and his boys have some other place to go.  There is no other place to go for either Fr. McVerry or his boys or for any other homeless youth for that matter. Caring for our homeless young people is not only a question of resources and funding, but also a primary question in relation to values and priorities in our society.  The welfare of our young people must never cease to be a priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are very conscious of the difficulties faced by young homeless persons and are taking a number of initiatives to tackle the problem. The Child Care Bill which passes all stages of the House before Christmas contains important new provisions to assist young homeless people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, will impose a statutory duty on the health boards to promote the welfare of children up to the age of 18 who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  Of particular relevance, is an entirely new section in the Bill requiring the health boards <Col N="824" /> to investigate the circumstances of homeless children and, in appropriate cases, either to receive these children into care or to take steps to make accommodation available for them.</P>
    <P>The Bill will shortly be introduced in the Seanad and, as is indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government are committed to providing the additional resources necessary to bring the legislation into operation as soon as practicable after its enactment.  The Minister for Health has set aside a sum of £1 million this year to begin the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of service developments aimed at meeting the needs of the young homeless have also been initiated.  Particular emphasis has been placed on the problems which have arisen in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Examples of these initiatives include: the assignment of a special team of social workers to deal specifically with homeless young people.  This is supported by a centralised crisis accommodation unit; a new community residential project for boys which has been established in Tallaght and which provides residential care for boys between 12 and 16 years of age; a similar residential project for girls which has been set up in the Ballymun area; a new long term residential unit which has been developed in the Clontarf area by catering for boys in the 11 to 14 age group; the setting up by the Eastern Health Board of a new project called &ldquo;Carers for Young People&rdquo; which will cater for adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings; the purchase of a premises near Blessington which will house a therapeutic unit for boys and girls with special difficulties. This facility is due to come on stream in the first half of this year and negotiations are also taking place between the Eastern Health Board and a number of organisations regarding the provision of additional emergency and long term accommodation for both boys and girls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> Outside the Eastern Health Board area a number of other initiatives for the young homeless are being supported. Approval has recently been given to the Southern Health Board to build a new group home at Shanakiel Road, Cork. Funds have also been made available to the Mid-Western Health Board to develop a new unit for adolescents near Limerick.  Projects in Galway, Tullamore and Sligo for disadvantaged youth are also being supported.</P>
    <P>Funding has also been made available by the Minister for the Environment for special projects for the young homeless. &ldquo;Focus Point&rdquo; has received grants amounting to £2.4 million from the Department of the Environment's voluntary housing scheme towards the provision of a new flatlet project at Stanhope Street, Dublin, and the provision of a residential facility at Arran Quay, Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the information that I have given to the House that the Government are well aware of the problem of the young homeless and are committed to doing all we can to bring to an end the plight of young people sleeping rough on the streets of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I am sure all in this House hope that the initiatives to which I have referred tonight will be successful, and will go towards clearing the young people who are sleeping rought off our streets.  None of us can accept that that situation should continue.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins has been given permission to raise the need for the Minister for Education to carry out an in-depth analysis of existing structures, possible plans for rationalisation, school organisation and financing in the light of the falling school going population, especially at second level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most positive initiatives from this Minister was the establishment of the Review Body for Primary Education.  That body carried out an in-depth analysis of the whole primary school sector, analysed in depth and made 75 very worthwhile recommendations. It was very analytical, very practical and gave us an overview as to where we stand in relation to primary education, its needs and its deficiencies, the strong points and the weak points and where we should be going.  I am asking the Minister to do precisely the same thing at post-primary level.</P>
      <P>Massive sea changes are taking place structurally at second level.  The Department of Education predict that second level pupil numbers will fall from 342,000 this year to 262,000 within 15 years.  The number of Catholic religious in secondary schools is dropping much faster than predicted. In many communities we have two, three, four and sometimes five schools in close proximity, sometimes side by side.  Because of contracting numbers these are very often in a frantic, unedifying scramble in the canvass for students.  Instead of co-operating we have in some cases rather more than vigorous competition.  I welcome competition, but competition for numbers is essentially bad.  We have duplication and triplication of facilities and subjects, yet the Minister and the Department have thus far essentially withdrawn from the process and seem for some mysterious reason to be afraid to get involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They seem to be allowing the situation to drift, allowing a fight to the death to ensue, with the survival of the fittest being the order of the day. We are very much on the brink of an educational civil war at second level unless urgent ministerial and departmental intervention takes place.  Community schools and colleges seem to be <Col N="827" /> the exception rather than the rule and they are being built essentially in greenfield sites.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister and the Department to oversee the situation.  It is their duty to promote, encourage and assist the rationalisation process.  Rather than the Green Paper promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, a review body should be set up immediately to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that the former Fine Gael Ministers for Education, Richard Burke and Gemma Hussey, both mooted the idea of local education structures during their terms in office but they were not accepted at the time.  The recent OECD report, however, recommends in the context of decreasing enrolments that a consolidated, co-ordinating regional authority could help to avoid the fierce and very detrimental competition for students in many local catchment areas which we are now witnessing.  This we will witness with greater vigour in the future.</P>
      <P>At present we have 465 secondary schools, 276 vocational schools and 65 community or comprehensive colleges. About 200 of these will go to the wall.  In Macroom, for example, the De La Salle school is about to be handed over to the management of a lay authority with no definite structure in place in relation to who will manage same.  In Ballycastle and Lacken in County Mayo we have two schools, one of which has been sanctioned by the Minister for a grant.</P>

    <P>I accept that what Deputy Higgins has put down is a very valid proposition.  I will not be proceeding with a review at second level because I have initiated a very comprehensive programme which will consist of a Green Paper, a White Paper and an Education Bill.  Within this framework all the points the Deputy has raised will be debated by the public at large.  This will lead to many interesting debates.  I intend to write a preface to that paper.  I want everybody to be honest <Col N="829" /> so that we cannot have people parading in here saying &ldquo;protect our school&rdquo; and then running out calling for rationalisation and saying that the Minister and the Department are scared.  I am not scared of anybody or anything.  I know quite well what I have to do.

      <P>The third thing I want to say, and I said it when I met with the Deputy last week, is that I hope the Deputy will be here for a long time and that I will be here for a long time.  I would like to say that the Deputy should not take himself too seriously.  I listened to him on the monitor tonight and he cut down every educational provision he could think of while teachers, parents, unions and the wider public are praising them.  The Deputy should give himself some leeway and praise something.  From time to time that does one a lot of good.  I hope I have finished the lecture.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Deputy praising Tom Murphy.  It was the first word I heard from any Opposition party Member in praise of that review.  There are not 75 proposals but 107 in it and they are all being carefully worked through at the moment.</P>
      <P>To go back to what the Deputy put forward, I am not about to embark on a special review for second level because I have already done so in the whole educational process.  PESP includes all the matters which have annoyed us all for a number of years.  We are getting the policy right now that we have the plan right.</P>
      <P>With regard to amalgamation and rationalisation, I ask each community to face it clearly and honestly.  We will have a further contribution from Deputy Finucane and I will be kinder to him because he approaches these matters in a better way.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael Finucane gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the plans the Minister for Education has for the continuation of post-primary education at the Convent of Mercy, Foynes, County Limerick after January 1995 in view of the fact that the Sisters of Mercy are withdrawing from post-primary education in that area.  Deputy Finucane has five minutes and the Minister has five minutes to reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>On 19 January last the principal of the Convent of Mercy in Foynes, County Limerick wrote to each parent outlining the very difficult and painful decision they had to make in withdrawing from the post-primary school at Mount Trenchard, Foynes.  Their reasons were: the shortage of religious personnel and the ongoing financial drain on their congregation, the grants provided by the Department of Education are totally inadequate; and the refusal of the Department of Education to provide any grant towards the maintenance of the prefabricated buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This school was first established in 1958 when a boarding school was opened.  In 1967 the local secondary school at Shrulawn, Foynes with the advent of free education amalgamated with the Convent of Mercy at Mount Trenchard.  The school is ideally situated overlooking the River Shannon in a rural sylvan setting.  It is an ideal location conducive to a good education environment and has a proud academic record.  About 250 pupils attend the school.  The school services a catchment area embracing Foynes, <Col N="832" /> Loughill, Ballyhahill, Kilcolman and Shanagolden.  All these schools have a total schoolgoing population in the 6th class at present of 94 pupils eligible for post-primary education in the area.</P>
    <P>The school is situated near Foynes, a thriving port which is the industrial hub of the area providing employment for about 300 people both full-time and casual workers on the docks.  The Sisters of Mercy have made a great contribution to education in Ireland and especially at Mount Trenchard, Foynes.  The local community are most appreciative of the great contribution the Sisters have made.</P>
    <P>Their difficult decision to withdraw has now created uncertainty in the local community. They will still welcome 1st year pupils in September.  Therefore, an early positive decision by the Minister will help to dispel any uncertainty that parents may be feeling at present.</P>
    <P>On Saturday, 16 February the parents and teachers invited public representatives to attend a meeting at Foynes. The meeting was addressed by various public representatives including myself who stated they would support them in their efforts to ensure continuation of post-primary education at Mount Trenchard, Foynes.</P>
    <P>They have formed a committee to ensure that this objective is achieved.  I would earnestly request the Minister for Education to do her utmost to see that the proud education record of Mount Trenchard in Foynes is maintained by ensuring her commitment to the continuation of the post-primary school at this location.  I thank the Minister for her attendance and for listening to my comments.</P>

      <P>Let me join with Deputy Finucane in praising the order.  I have gone back over the record and it is indeed a proud one with a very strong commitment to education.  I also want to thank them for properly and courteously informing the Department four years in advance that they were going to pull out. They have every right to do so if they wish; it is a voluntary private secondary school.  They own the property and the nuns feel their mission in the area of education is coming to an end.  Sometimes people ask why an order should leave.  An order has every entitlement to leave if they so wish.  It is fair that, representing the Department of Education, I should put on record our praise and appreciation of the nuns for their contribution to education.</P>
      <P>This is a classic case.  There are four schools in that post-primary area.  There is the one of which we spoke, the Mercy Secondary School in Foynes, the vocational school in Shanagolden, Scoil Mhuire Secondary School in Askeaton in connection with which Deputy Finucane featured recently in the paper, and the Salesian College in Pallaskenry.  The present school population, apart from boarders, is 750.  In a couple of years' time there will be 500.  We should let those facts sink in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the authorities of those schools visited the Department and the Department's plan for rationalisation was laid out clearly for them.  There will not remain four post primary schools. That would be ridiculous.  There is a need for rationalisation within west Limerick. I urge Deputy Finucane not to get himself tied up with supporting the four separate <Col N="834" /> schools because that will not be an issue. The plans remain now to be discussed and talked through.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has the best interests of the young people at heart with regard to the varied curriculum they will need, practical and academic, to equip them for the future, he will accept that that cannot be achieved in four separate schools with a small pupil enrolment in each.  The authorities simply would not be able to provide the teachers, the range of subjects and the range of decent facilities that post-primary education demands.  I share the Deputy's respect for the Mercy nuns in Foynes.  My thanks to them for announcing in good time that they are leaving their mission in Foynes.  The commitment now is to seek the consensus within the west Limerick area on the best options for the provision of post-primary education in the future.  Go raibh míle maith agat.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle and I want to thank the Minister for coming into the Chamber this evening to answer my query.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sought to raise this matter because a number of people have asked me about it from time to time and I wanted to take the opportunity to discuss it with the Minister.  Under the means testing system of the Department of Social Welfare, the income of one spouse is reckoned to be divided between them in so far as 50 per cent would be attributed to the other <Col N="835" /> partner.  If PRSI were charged on the family income on that basis, both partners would be entitled equally to a contributory pension when they reached pensionable age.  That is not the case at present and I wonder if this is an anomaly which could be exploited by somebody at some stage, for example, under family law the property of one spouse is reckoned to be jointly the property of another.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase in juvenile crime has created a severe shortage of places in detention centres for young offenders.  They can only be placed in custody if a place exists for them.  Some offenders are, as a result, deprived of a chance of rehabilitation while others develop an attitude that their actions can go unpunished.  District justices have no option in most cases but to place them on probation and as result they become habitual criminals, with no respect either for the law or their victims.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that one year after the Justice Wine case in Dún Laoghaire, there is still no female unit for wayward girls.  Trinity House for boys is far too small and has a considerable waiting list.  Meanwhile, tearaway children are jailed in unsuitable conditions in Mountjoy Prison, are detained in the Bridewell or freed into the community.  The hands of the courts are tied in many ways and justices are becoming more and more frustrated and consequently the law falls into disrepute.</P>
      <P>This problem must be tackled immediately by the appropriate Ministers acting together and not avoiding the issue by buck passing.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the same issue.  On 5 February last I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice asking if he would give details of the number of male and female juvenile offenders who were detained in places of detention during the various years and I got a very silly reply.  The Minister told me that I would get the information in a report which would be published some time later.  How can the Minister administer the system if he does not have the numbers available to him?  I am certain he has the figures but he has refused to give them to me.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think we are living in a banana republic?  Because of the way he approached these matters &mdash; and he got away very lightly all year because he had two portfolios &mdash; most of the time we could not get any information from him.  I am extremely disappointed with the Minister.  I want to take the matter further and I am going to try to ensure that when Deputies table questions in the House they are given answers.  It is a disgrace that we cannot do that at present.</P>
      <P>The day after I asked the question I saw a report in the newspaper where a juvenile offender was released because there was no place for him.  The Minister is obviously trying to hide things and it is disgraceful that he should do that.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Cotter's question, the self-employed were brought into the social insurance system for the first time with effect from April 1988.  Under the scheme self-employed people with annual incomes of £2,500 or more are insured for contributory old age and widows and orphans' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain relatives who work with self-employed <Col N="837" /> persons running a business &mdash; and it can be a business or a farm, of course &mdash; but who are not partners in the business are excluded from the scheme. The are not required to make a PRSI contribution.</P>
    <P>In the case of farming couples, it is normally the husband who enters the social insurance scheme for the self-employed. His social insurance contribution is based on farm income assessible for tax.  His spouse is considered to be an assisting relative.</P>
    <P>Although only one spouse contributes to the scheme, the other spouse will of course, be regarded as an adult dependant. At present, the personal rate of contributory pension is £61.50 per week, while the adult dependant allowance for a spouse over 66 years of age is £45.70. This is the highest rate of adult dependant allowance paid under any of our social insurance schemes.  In addition, farmers' wives are entitled to widow's contributory pension on the basis of their husband's insurance.</P>
    <P>Any change to the system which caused farm income to be allocated between husband and wife would deprive some farmers of social insurance cover.  This would arise because the farmer's income would be divided between the farming couple, and neither of them may then have an income in excess of £2,500. Farming couples would, therefore, have little to gain and much to lose from a change in the system along the lines suggested.</P>
    <P>The pension position of relatives assisting in a self-employment situation is one of a number of issues which will be addressed by the National Pensions Board in their final report which is due shortly.  Deputies will appreciate that it was one of the elements that had to be left to the end but it will be considered by them and we should have the report by summer time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main <Col N="838" /> detention facilities operated by the Department of Justice geared primarily towards young offenders are St. Patrick's Institution, Wheatfield and the open centre at Shanganagh Castle.  Measures are taken to ensure that the numbers being accommodated there are kept within desirable limits.  Overcrowding is never a problem at Wheatfield or Shanganagh Castle.  As St. Patrick's Institution is unlike the others, a committal institution, and as the number of committals from the courts on a given day is unpredictable it can happen from time to time that some nights more offenders have to be held at St. Patrick's Institution than might be considered ideal.  However, when this happens, measures are taken the following day to attempt to bring the numbers there under control.</P>
      <P>On the general question of secure detention centres for young offenders the position is that the courts may commit young offenders in certain age groups to St. Patrick's Institution and to our committal prisons.  These institutions are the responsibility of the Department of Justice.  The courts may also commit young offenders in certain age groups to special schools, such as Trinity House in Lusk which was designed specifically as a secure detention facility for male offenders.  The House will be aware that the Department of Education have plans in this area, including plans to provide new accommodation at Lusk for young female offenders.</P>
      <P>At present, two young female offenders have a case before the courts in relation to their detention.  Consequently, as the matter is <i>sub judice</i>, I am constrained from commenting on it.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House, and particularly Deputy Cotter, that once questions are tabled to the Minister, the Minister answers those questions and we do not want to deny any Deputy the information that is available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House further that the Government are constantly examining <Col N="839" /> and reviewing the situation pertaining to juvenile justice and the House can be assured that as matters unfold the Government will take the appropriate action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 37, 50 and 91 together. Assuming the enactment of this year's budget proposals the full year effects, estimated by reference to the income tax year 1991-92, which would arise from the changes referred to in the questions are as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  Conversion of basic personal allowances to tax credits</P>
      <P>The revenue yield which would arise from a conversion of the basic personal allowances to tax credits at the standard rate of income tax would be of the order of £264 million.  If all of that yield were used to increase the level of tax credits, the net benefit, in terms of tax saved, to those taxpayers still paying tax at the standard rate after the conversion would be of the order of £243 for a single taxpayer and £486 for a married taxpayer. Taxpayers paying tax at 48 per cent would suffer a net loss of £156 if single and £312 if married.  Those paying tax at 52 per cent would lose £240 and £480 respectively. It should be noted that, despite the increase in the personal allowances &mdash; given in the form of tax credits &mdash; the percentage of taxpayers liable at the higher tax rates would increase to 58 per cent.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Conversion of mortgage interest relief to a tax credit</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If mortgage interest relief was to be given by way of tax credits at the standard <Col N="568" /> rate of income tax, the consequential yield to the Exchequer could provide, on a revenue neutral basis, for an increase of about £90 for a single taxpayer and £180 for a married couple on the current ceilings for mortgage interest claimable and, in addition, for the restoration of the amount of interest qualifying for relief to 100 per cent of the new ceilings.  Those mortgage holders still paying tax at the standard rate after the conversion would have a net gain; mortgage holders paying tax at the higher rates would suffer a net loss.  It should be noted that some 40,000 mortgage holders currently paying tax at the standard rate would, as a result of the change to a credit, be moved into a higher rate.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Conversion of PAYE allowance to a tax credit:</P>
    <P>If the current PAYE allowance of £800 was converted to a tax credit at the proposed standard rate of 29 per cent, the appropriate credit would be £232.  This change would cause neither a gain nor a loss to individuals still paying tax at the standard rate despite the loss of the allowance. For individuals whose marginal tax rate was 48 per cent there would be an increase in tax of £152 and the corresponding tax increase for individuals taxed at the proposed top rate of 52 per cent would be £184.  Some 45,000 PAYE taxpayers who would otherwise be paying tax at the standard rate would be moved into a higher rate.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Conversion of medical insurance relief to a tax credit:</P>
    <P>The conversion of medical insurance relief to a tax credit at the standard rate of income tax would give rise to a revenue yield of £16 million.</P>
    <P>It is important that, in looking at possible options in the area of taxation, there should be no confusion between the underlying policy considerations, such as equity, progressivity or efficiency, and the essentially administrative issue of how best to realise these in practical terms.  Tax credits simply represent an alternative means of pursuing goals which could equally be advanced within the framework of the present allowance <Col N="569" /> system.  The choice between a credits system and an allowance system should, therefore, rest on considerations of simplicity from the standpoint of taxpayers and the administration.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of substituting tax credits for basic personal allowances, it should be made clear that this would significantly increase the progressivity of the tax system in the absence of other changes.  It is already quite progressive. For example, a single PAYE taxpayer with only standard allowances will, in 1991-92 be liable for a tax rate of 48 per cent on income in excess of £9,886, or about £190 per week.  Moreover, some 37 per cent of taxpayers currently pay tax at a rate above the standard rate.  As the figures given above show, one effect of replacing personal allowances by credits would be to bring about a situation where a far greater proportion of taxpayers would be liable at the higher rates.  I do not believe that this would be generally seen as an improvement in the tax system.  It would certainly run counter to the view that economic and employment objectives are likely to be best served by keeping marginal tax rates as low as possible.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the estimated current real value of (a) personal allowances and (b) PAYE allowances taking 1988 as a base year; and the nominal value which both would be in the 1991-92 income tax year if their real value was equivalent to their 1988 value.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 January 1988, the single, married and PAYE allowances stood at £2,000, £4,000 and £700 respectively.  The current real value of these figures would be £1,822, £3,644 and £638 respectively. Their nominal value in the 1991-92 tax year if their real value were equivalent to their 1988 value is estimated at £2,264, £4,528 and £792 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that maintaining the value of these allowances in real terms is not the only way of alleviating the income <Col N="570" /> tax burden.  Since 1988, considerable progress has been made in relation to income tax.  The general exemption limits, which in January 1988 stood at £2,650 for a single person and £5,300 for a married couple, will in the 1991-92 tax year be £3,400 for a single person and £6,800 for a married couple.  In 1989 I introduced a child addition of £200 per child in conjunction with these limits; I increased this to £300 per child in the 1990 budget and this year to £500 in respect of third and subsequent children.  The personal allowance itself has been increased twice in recent years, in 1988 and this year, on both occasions by £50 for a single person and £100 for a married couple.  The PAYE allowance was increased by £100 in 1988.  In addition, taking this year's budget into account, the standard rate band has been extended by £2,000 for a single person and £4,000 for a married couple, while the top rate of tax has been reduced from 58 per cent to 52 per cent and the standard rate from 35 per cent to 29 per cent.  These reliefs benefit all taxpayers and represent substantial progress on income tax over the years in question.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EC law, VAT is chargeable on works of art at point of entry, although purchases by approved museums and galleries where the items are not intended for sale and are bought from non-taxable persons, are relieved from the tax.  EC law does not allow a distinction to be drawn accordingly to the country of origin of the work.</P>
      <P>An exemption for works of art in an individual member state, by way of derogation to existing Community law, would be unlikely to obtain Community approval in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to assume that all works of art being imported or re-imported into Ireland would already have borne VAT in another country.  This would depend on many circumstances, for example, the origin of the goods, the status of the vendor, whether an auctioneer is involved in the sale and the particular tax regime applicable in the country where the goods are sold.  A large proportion of works of art imported into Ireland come from the United Kingdom and would be sold there by private individuals through auctions.  In these circumstances, the only <Col N="572" /> VAT charged is on the auctioneer's commission: the goods themselves do not attract UK VAT.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 47, 98, 99, 101, 103 and 108 together.  The recommendation to which the Deputies refer is, presumably, that contained in the NESC report, &ldquo;A Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo;, which was published in October of last year.  The recommendation for an &ldquo;audit&rdquo; in that report was made in the broad context of maximising the contribution of the State sponsored sector to the economy.  The Government at that time welcomed the report, which it saw as an important contribution to the negotiations then under way on a programme for economic and social progress to succeed the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  These negotiations, as the Deputies are aware, have successfully concluded, and a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been agreed between the Government and the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme clearly states that as far as commercial State bodies are concerned, they should neither be discriminated against nor favoured by the State in their commercial operations. This is fully in accord with the terms of the NESC report.  I might also add that the Government's desire to ensure transparency and fair play in relation to competition throughout the economy is reflected in the commitment given in its Programme for Government to a competition Bill.  This Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation.  It will, I believe, <Col N="574" /> together with the principles set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, ensure that the commercial State sector competes on a fair and transparent basis with the private sector.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the estimate he has of the average cost of rearing a child; the estimated current 1991 value of child tax free allowances if these had been increased in line with the cost of living since the early seventies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics on the average cost of rearing a child are not collected.  I am not sure that even if they were, they would serve a useful purpose for policymaking. Average data would, for instance, mask the differences in expenditure on children by the very well-off and by the less fortunate in the community. There are also differences in the cost of providing for children of different ages and in cost per child, notably in small families against large ones.</P>
      <P>In 1971-72 the general child tax allowance stood at £150 for children aged over 11 years and at £135 for children not over 11 years.  These allowances would be £1,045 and £940 respectively in 1991-92 if they had been increased in line with the consumer price index over the intervening period.  The cost of reintroducing the allowances at this level would be up to £260 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that the child tax allowance, which then stood at £100, was abolished with effect from 6 April 1986, and that the revenue from its abolition was used, along with other moneys, to fund the introduction of child benefit at a rate sufficient to compensate standard rate taxpayers, then paying tax at 35 per cent, for its loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that in 1989 I introduced a child addition of £200 per child in conjunction with the income tax exemption limits, and increased it to £300 in 1990.  In the 1991 budget I increased it <Col N="575" /> to £500 for third and subsequent children. The purpose of the addition is to benefit low-paid taxpayers with family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, substantial improvements have been made in income tax in recent years.  Including the changes I announced in this year's budget, the top rate of tax has been reduced from 58 per cent to 52 per cent and the standard rate from 35 per cent to 29 per cent, and the standard band extended by £4,000 for a married couple.  There have also been increases in the personal and PAYE allowances. These changes are of benefit to taxpayers generally, including those with children.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is considerable expenditure on children other than through the income tax system.  For example, child benefit payments will amount to over £210 million in 1991, while estimated gross expenditure on education will amount to £1,400 million.</P>

      <P>Arising out of a recent review <Col N="576" /> of the operations of the Ordnance survey, I directed that a new 1:50,000 tourist map series should be produced as a matter of urgency.  Maps on this scale are the standard local tourist map in most countries but our existing small-scale mapping is extremely old and does not meet the demands of the market.  This is a matter of considerable concern as the product is an essential tool for walking and rambling holidays, a segment of the tourist market which generates some £60 million revenue a year.  The non-availability of up-to-date 1:50,000 maps would impede the achievement of the ambitious targets set by the Government for the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>There are 71 map sheets in the series covering the Twenty-six counties.  To date three preliminary sheets (for Kenmare, the Slieve Blooms and Wicklow) and one definitive sheet (The McGillycuddy Reeks) have been published.  It is expected that a further four sheets will be published in 1991 (the Derrynasaggart Mountains, the Dingle Peninsula, Ben Bulben and South Sligo).  When the programme reaches full production an average of ten sheets per annum will be produced.  The programme should be completed in about seven years.</P>

      <P>A reduction of 2 percentage points in international interest rates, including Irish interest rates, if maintained for a full year would reduce the annual cost of interest payments on the national debt by about £175 million.  An exchange rate of 1.90 US dollars to the Irish Pound if maintained for a full year, as compared with the rate of 1.8180 dollars on 14 February, would reduce the <Col N="577" /> Irish Pound value of annual interest payments by approximately £5 million.</P>
      <P>The effect of changes in interest rates and exchange rates on the interest payments in any calendar year, including 1991, would of course depend on the timing and duration of any such changes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 42, 44, 46, 49, 54, 55, 83, 92 and 95 together.  Section 41 of the 1988 Finance Act gives an exemption from corporation tax on dividends received from abroad by an Irish company from a foreign subsidiary where such dividends are applied for the purposes of an investment plan directed towards the creation or maintenance of employment in Ireland. The foreign subsidiary in question must be located in a country with which Ireland has a double-taxation agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To claim the relief, the company must first of all submit an investment plan to the Minister for Finance showing how it proposes to apply the foreign dividends. This plan is examined by the Department of Finance who will usually discuss the details with the company.  The <Col N="580" /> Department will then make a recommendation to the Minister on the proposal.  If the Minister is satisfied that the plan is directed towards the creation or maintenance of employment in trading activities in Ireland, and if the other conditions are met, he is empowered to issue a certificate exempting the relevant dividends from tax.  An approved investment plan is a plan in respect of which the Minister has issued such a certificate.</P>
    <P>The exemption has been applied in two cases to date.  For reasons of confidentiality, it would not be appropriate to specify the two companies in question or to reveal the nature of the approved investment plans.  The scheme is a worthwhile one in that it brings in money from abroad, which might not otherwise have come in, and it is directed towards employment creation and maintenance in Ireland.  It is not possible to estimate precisely the amount of Irish tax foregone to date as this depends on variable factors such as the amount of double-taxation relief that otherwise might apply, the availability of group relief and the fundamental issue of whether the money would have come in the absence of the scheme.  The maximum theoretical cost to date would not exceed £6.5 million and the real cost would probably be only a fraction of that.</P>

      <P>The European Commission brought forward, in February 1989, a proposal for the introduction of an EC-wide minimum withholding tax of 15 per cent on interest income.  This was strongly opposed by a number of member states and, although it has not been withdrawn formally by the Commission, it is not expected to find agreement.</P>
      <P>Deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) relates to accounts of residents within the State, and I would point out that, under the EC Directive on liberalisation of capital movements, Ireland is not obliged to permit residents to open accounts abroad before end-1992.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the position on DIRT in the post-1992 situation under review in the interim, taking into account both future domestic taxation developments and the experience of other EC member states which retain analogous taxes while relaxing exchange controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 67 together</P>
      <P>It is estimated that of the order of 80 projects are affected to one degree or another by the budget measures relating to the business expansion scheme, and that they proposed to raise £100 million or more under the scheme, with a potential cost to the Exchequer of around 50 per cent of the amount raised.  The vast majority of those projects were related to accommodation development and, while a precise estimate is not available, it is likely that the construction content would be considerable.  The question of whether the budget measures restricting the scope of the BES, which were necessary for the funding of the social welfare and income tax improvements, caused the cancellation of a significant number of projects is speculative.  Some projects may go ahead notwithstanding, on the basis of alternative sources of finance; it is unlikely that all the projects in question are dependent on funding subsidised through the BES scheme, predominantly at the highest rate of income tax.  Neither is it clear that all the proposals would have come to fruition in the absence of these measures, especially in view of the large amount of BES funding being sought.  I should also point out that the elimination of certain sectors from the ambit of the scheme is likely to facilitate the raising of funds for other areas and that the extension of its duration for a further two years from 6 April will enable many new projects to benefit.</P>

      <P>The work carried out to date by the Office of Public Works in connection with the Grand Canal has consisted mainly of repair and reconstruction of the 200 year old fabric of the canal and associated structures.  New lock gates have been manufactured and installed, lock chambers repaired, embankments strengthened and reconstructed, bridges and aquaducts repaired, and water supply <Col N="588" /> channels, overflows and culverts cleaned and, where necessary, re-instated.  Sections of the canal have been dredged, banks and towpaths cleared and in the Dublin area a large number of trees have been planted along the banks.  Two new lockhouses have been built and the Naas branch of the canal has been re-opened. Major programmes for control of aquatic weeds, monitoring of water quality and development of fish stocks have also been put in hands.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure by the Office of Public Works on the Grand Canal from 1 July 1986, the date on which the canal was taken over from CIE, to the end of 1990 was of the order of £9 million.  This figure includes the cost of routine maintenance and operation of the canal and the cost of reconstructing the section near Edenderry where a major breach occurred in 1989.</P>
      <P>In 1988 a management and development strategy for the Grand and Royal Canals and Barrow Navigation prepared by consultants was adopted and published by the Commissioners of Public Works.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are most concerned about payments due from Iraq and will continue to insist that debts must be paid. No formal representations have been made to the Iraqi authorities since the beginning of the Gulf crisis and, following the outbreak of war, it is not feasible to pursue the matter at this time.  I would remind the Deputy that similar delays in payments are being experienced by companies in other countries who did business with Iraq in recent years.  Last August the Iraqi authorities proposed discussions in Baghdad with creditor countries and offered to trade oil for debts.  This offer was not accepted as it would be contrary to the terms of Resolution No. 661 of the United Nations Security Council.  The Irish Government reserve all their rights as well as those of their nationals and private companies to use all available legal means to recover debts owing by Iraq.</P>
      <P>A request was made last autumn by a group of banks for compensation for loss of interest on moneys owed to a company by the Iraqi Government.  This request was turned down and there has been no further approach from the group in question.</P>

That scheme was undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works between 1954 and 1964.  As the Commissioners' functions in the area are now confined to the maintenance of the scheduled works, they have no plans to undertake the additional works now requested.</P>

      <P>The Government do not have any list of companies which they are proposing to open up to private sector interests in the sense to which the Deputy seems to be referring.  In the course of the address in question the Minister for <Col N="595" /> Labour stated that, where appropriate, the Government are prepared to consider the question of private sector involvement in State trading bodies.  There is nothing new or novel in this.  As the Deputy is aware, this Government have no ideological or doctrinaire approach to such questions.  We are always open to suggestions as to how State companies can play a more effective role in maximising their contribution to the economy and securing the future of their employees.  In this regard the Deputy will be aware that many State companies are already involved in joint venture with private sector companies.  Since the Deputy tabled his question we have seen the publication of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which sets <Col N="596" /> out clearly the agreed views of all concerned on the commercial State sector, including the question of private participation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's information is incorrect; the national lottery do not enjoy a zero-rated status for VAT purposes. The company are, in fact, VAT-exempt which means that, while they do not have to charge the tax on their ticket sales, neither can they recover VAT on any purchases of business requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lotteries, other than the national lottery, do not have to charge VAT on their ticket sales either.  However, one specialist company operates a series of lotteries under the Gaming and Lotteries Act on <Col N="598" /> behalf of a number of charities.  These charities use the specialist company's professional services to promote, market and manage the lotteries on their behalf. In this instance, a service of management is being provided to the various charities and this specific activity must bear VAT. The applicable rate will be 21 per cent from 1 March next.</P>

      <P>The effects on growth prospects of the Gulf war are inherently unpredictable.  In taking account of the Gulf situation in my economic and budgetary projections, I had regard to the views of two major international forecasting agencies.

But, as I said in my budget speech, if the imponderables should develop unfavourably, the Government will not be slow in taking whatever action is needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of 1992 indirect tax harmonisation, the EC Commission has put forward proposals in relation to the rates and structure of excise duties, and the rate of VAT, which should apply to heating oils.</P>
      <P>In regard to excise duties there are two sets of proposals.  The first deals with the structure of excise duty on mineral oils and seeks to ensure that similar products are generally taxed in like manner and that tax-induced differences in the final price of these products are not such as to encourage fraudulent or artificial purchases. Mandatory exemptions from excise duty are proposed for natural gas, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) when not used as motor fuel, and coal.</P>
      <P>The second proposal deals with the approximation of rates of excise duty on mineral oils.  A rate band from 47 to 53 ECU per 1,000 litres &mdash; 16.5p to 18.6p per gallon &mdash; is proposed for heating oil; it would apply from 1 January 1993.  Our present rate of duty on oil and LPG used for heating purposes is 17p per gallon. Both proposals have yet to be discussed.</P>
      <P>In regard to VAT, the Commission has proposed that fuels for heating and lighting be taxed at a rate in the reduced band of 4 to 9 per cent.  However, in Council deliberations on the matter to date, a majority of member states have supported standard rating for environmental and conservation reasons.  Final decisions on this question are due to be taken by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Compensation paid in a lump sum for personal injury is not charged to income tax.  I presume that what the <Col N="601" /> Deputy may have in mind is the tax treatment of income arising from investment of the compensation amount.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Finance Act, 1990 exempts investment income from income tax where the income arises from compensation paid following the institution of civil action for damages in respect of personal injury.  For the exemption to apply the income must represent the sole or main income of an individual who, as a result of the injury, is permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself.</P>
      <P>I take it that what the Deputy is referring to is a situation where compensation is invested in a medium subject to deposit interest retention tax.  Retention tax applies to deposit interest generally, and I have no plans to change that position. I would point out, however, that persons in the circumstances described can claim a repayment of retention tax deducted from deposit interest on the compensation amount.  I would also point out that there are a number of investment options which are not subject to retention tax, including Government securities and certain savings options operated by An Post.</P>

Approximate estimates of population <Col N="602" /> figures for other game species may be found in a 1980 publication by the Stationery Office entitled <i>A List of the Birds of Ireland</i> by Robert F. Ruttledge.</P>
      <P>The hunting of game species is regulated by the fixing, under Ministerial Order, as provided in the Wildlife Act, 1976, of an annual open season.  The inclusion of any game species on the open season's list is determined by the Wildlife Service having regard to the conservation requirements of each species.  If any species is threatened by undue pressure, hunting of that species can be restricted to certain areas or it can be removed entirely from the Open Seasons Order. The Open Seasons Order does not restrict the numbers that may be shot. The order is published in the national newspapers.</P>
      <P>Protection of habitat is effected through the Wildlife Act, 1976 by the creation of a network of nature reserves, refuges for fauna and game bird sanctuaries and by entering into management agreements with landowners with the objective of protecting habitats.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Commission has proposed that, in the post-1992 system, all food should be liable to the reduced rate of VAT in the range 4 to 9 per cent.  In addition, the Council has indicated that zero-rating can continue where this does not entail distortions of competition between member states.  No definitive decisions have yet been taken by the <Col N="603" /> Council of Finance Ministers on either the Commission's proposal or the scope of the continued application of the zero rate.</P>

      <P>Because new zero rates of VAT are prohibited under EC law, I cannot remove VAT from hospital equipment, irrespective of how its purchase has been financed.</P>
      <P>Medical equipment, instruments and appliances are generally liable at the standard rate of VAT, which is being reduced to 21 per cent on 1 March.  Expenditure on such items is, for the most part, financed by the State where publicly funded hospitals are concerned.  However, in the case of certain medical equipment donated to hospitals by voluntary fund raisers, a refund scheme exists to give back the difference in VAT between the standard rate and the low 10 per cent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The refund scheme was established in recognition of the valuable work done by <Col N="604" /> voluntary fund raising groups who raise significant amounts of money to finance purchases of specialised health equipment. I am satisfied that the scheme meets this objective sucessfully.</P>

      <P>As I have already stated to this House on 11 December 1990, the Government have accepted the recommendations in Reports 30 and 31 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, dealing with allowances to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and ministerial pensions.  The necessary legislation to implement the changes recommended in the two reports is being prepared and will be introduced in the near future.  Discussions can take place as necessary with the Whips on this legislation.  Legislation on secretarial assistants involves fundamental considerations affecting members of this House and I think should be considered in the first instance by the Whips.</P>

      <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation are a commercial financial institution and as such should not be <Col N="605" /> placed at any disadvantage to their competitors. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to reveal the total value of loans written off by the corporation.  The corporation apply rigorous loan assessment criteria in their lending activities and have specific procedures in place to ensure the timely repayment of loans.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to reveal that, at the request of my Department, the Central Bank recently carried out an examination of the loan book of the ACC's operation.  While it was not an exhaustive examination of the loan book the Central Bank were satisfied with the systems and the level of controls in operation.  They also stated that the corporation had a satisfactory policy of providing for loans at risk.</P>

      <P>I have read the report of the <Col N="619" /> Arigna Task Force to the Minister for Energy and considered its recommendations in so far as they concern my Department.  One recommendation in the report that seeks the involvement of my Department in the development of Arigna is that concerning urban renewal on the lines of the incentives available for areas designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  The report also recommended the designation, under the urban renewal programme, of areas in the towns of Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon. The urban renewal tax incentives, which include capital allowances for commercial premises, double-rent allowance for traders and owner-occupier residential allowance are, however, specific to the run-down and derelict parts of certain towns and cities, and are primarily aimed at construction and reconstruction of buildings.  As for designation, this is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and I have no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>The report also refers to the county development teams, which come under my aegis.  I can assure the Deputy that as part of their ongoing work in the area in question, the county development teams will take a special interest in the development of any worthwhile economic projects for the area.</P>

      <P>Each year there are proceeds from the sale of assets, and the provision of data on the basis requested is therefore somewhat unreal. The outturn for Exchequer borrowing in 1990 &mdash; excluding the proceeds of sale of property and other State assets &mdash; was £472 million or 2.1 per cent of GNP.  The figures for 1991, on the same basis, but with the nominal value adjusted by the GNP deflator to express it in real 1990 terms, are calculated as £544 million, and 2.3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The public sector borrowing requirements in 1990 and 1991, similarly excluding sales of State assets and with the 1991 figure expressed in real 1990 terms by reference to the GNP deflator, are calculated as £691 million and £906 million, respectively.</P>

It is expected that expenditure in the current year will amount to £1.9 million approximately. There are no plans at present for the recruitment of additional staff on a seasonal basis or for lay-offs or redundancies on this scheme in 1991, but these matters are kept under continuous review in relation to the arterial drainage programme.</P>

      <P>The total allocation for my Department in respect of consultancy for 1991 is £10.55 million.  A significant part of the overall amount is provided to meet the estimated cost of the flotations of Irish Life and of the Irish Sugar Company (CSET). and of the possible sale of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  However, at this stage I am not in a position to give a breakdown of the amounts allocated for consultancy costs in these areas as appointments in respect of some services have yet to be made and the fee scales agreed.  Disclosure of the amounts available would not be appropriate in these circumstances.  As certain fees are related to the size of the flotation, disclosure could fuel speculation about prospective share values.</P>

    <P>It is normal practice to give effect to this provision by the inclusion in the licence of a clause granting to a company or person and its or his assigns the right to cultivate fish and do related things.</P>
    <P>The procedure for transferring a licence from one company to another is for the proposed new licensee to apply to my Department for the assignment of the licence, and for the existing licensee to consent formally to such transfer.  Subject to my Department being satisfied with the applicant company's bona fides, and with the existing licensees utilisation of the licence in compliance with its conditions, the licence may then be assigned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that I have already outlined the position in this case in my letter to him of 7 February, 1991, in response to his representations of 18 January, 1991.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in that reply, insurers are required only to notify my Department of alterations in their motor rates and such alterations are determined by the individual companies themselves in the light of their own particular underwriting experience.  Therefore no increases were &ldquo;granted&rdquo; to the company in question.</P>
      <P>However, I have had inquiries made into this particular case and, as I have already explained to the Deputy, while the person in question has earned the appropriate no claims bonus for one year's claims free driving, the premium has increased due to the alterations in the insurer's basic rates implemented during the year.  The rate increases notified to my Department by the insurer are as follows:&mdash; 1 January 1990 &mdash; 8 per cent on average; 9 April 1990 &mdash; 5 per cent on average; 1 September 1990 &mdash; 11.5 per cent on average and 1 January 1991 &mdash; 8 per cent on average.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware of the driving record of the person concerned.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> These figures are compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  However, as the CSO has not yet compiled complete figures for 1990 I have given my Department's provisional estimate for that year.</P>
    <P>The figures for the three years 1988 to 1990 which cover the period of the operation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> compare very favourably with those for 1984, 1985 and 1986.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and its associated pay agreements has resulted in a period of remarkable industrial relations peace.  Disputes over pay were at an all-time low during the three years and it is hoped that this trend will continue under th <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
    <P>The 1990 figures are disappointing compared with 1989 and 1988 but it should be borne in mind that of these 84 per cent were accounted for by three major strikes, i.e. Waterford Crystal, Barlo, Clonmel and Gateaux, Finglas. The final quarter of 1990 showed an encouraging return to low figures with just 9,000 days lost.</P>

      <P>With the agreement of my colleagues in Government I approached all State Sponsored Bodies and asked them to complete and return to me a questionnaire on equal opportunities initiatives in their organisations in 1989.  About 70 per cent of organisations returned the questionnaires. The results were analysed and were the subject of a report by my Department earlier this year.  I have placed copies of the report in the Oireachtas library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The analysis of the data furnished indicates that much remains to be done by State Sponsored Bodies, if equality of <Col N="647" /> opportunity at work is to be achieved. Nevertheless, several positive steps have been taken.  For instance, a large number of organisations examined have taken initiatives which help women and men to combine career and family responsibilities, for example, by providing flexible working hours, job-sharing and career breaks; about half the organisations who submitted reports have a positive action programme; the majority of organisations have equal opportunities officers.</P>
    <P>Arising from the analysis of the 1989 data a new questionnaire has been devised.  This questionnaire will seek more relevant and more quantifiable information.  The initiative has also been extended to local authorities and health boards with effect from 1990.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on a recent comment by a spokesman for the Environmental Health Officers' Association, that the build-up of naturally occurring radioactive gas in some houses in the west of Ireland, including parts of west Cork, was of greater magnitude than the effects of radioactive discharges from Sellafield or Chernobyl and that tests in Irish homes have found the level of indoor air radon to be over eight times the permitted level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre standard adopted by the Nuclear Energy Board.</Quest>

      <P>Detailed information about radon levels is a matter for the Nuclear Energy Board, and the Deputy should therefore approach the board in this matter.  Most Irish homes, about 96 per cent, have levels of radon which are not significant. A small number of houses &mdash; about 4 per cent &mdash; are estimated to have radon levels of above 200 becquerels per cubic metre, the level agreed by the Government as the reference level above which remedial measures should be considered.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 7 January 1991.  On the basis of his Irish contribution record in the governing contribution year, 6 April 1989 to 5 April 1990, he is not entitled to benefit. However, inquiries are being made with the UK authorities to determine whether he is entitled to have contributions awarded in the UK aggregated with his Irish record.  In addition his request to sign the unemployed register retrospectively for the period June to November 1989 is being investigated.  When these matters have been resolved his entitlement will be decided without delay.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit from 30 November 1990 to date.  He had previously been in receipt of invalidity pension from 18 July 1985 to 24 January 1990.  On 28 May 1990 an appeals officer decided that, because the person concerned had been working and not observing the conditions for receipt of invalidity pension, he was not entitled to payment for the period 9 July 1988 to 24 January 1990, as a result he was overpaid £4,347. He was informed of that decision at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He claimed disability benefit again in <Col N="659" /> November 1990.  His claim was incorrectly awarded as he has only a total of 14 credited contributions in respect of the 1988-89 contribution year which governs his claim.  At least 39 contributions, paid or credited, in that year are required to qualify.  Consequently, he does not qualify for payment of disability benefit from November 1990.  A letter will be sent to him shortly explaining the position.  In the circumstances the Department are not seeking recovery of the money paid to him since 30 November 1990.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit was disallowed from 23 June 1990, following an examination by a medical referee, who expressed the opinion that the person concerned was capable of work. She appealed this decision and was examined by a different medical referee on 3 August 1990, who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>She pursued her appeal and her case was referred to the social welfare appeals office.  Following an oral hearing on 16 January 1991 an appeals officer decided that she was not incapable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts from 23 June 1990 and not entitled to be paid disability benefit from that date.</P>
      <P>The decision of the appeals officer is final and may only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh medical evidence. The person concerned has continued to submit medical certificates in support of her claim that she is incapacitated. Arrangements are being made to have her examined by a different medical referee in the near future and her entitlement to benefit will be reviewed in the light of that examination.</P>

      <P>Section 95 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides that road markings such as yellow lines to prohibit parking may only be removed from public roads by road authorities with the consent of the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Commissioner does not propose to consent to the removal of the yellow line at the place referred to in the question.  I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the removal of the yellow line could be misleading to the public because parking at the location would continue to be prohibited under the Road Traffic General Bye Laws, 1964 and the Dublin Area Traffic and Parking Bye Laws, 1986 because there is a continuous white line in the centre of the roadway at the location in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238, 239 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that in Questions No. 238 the Deputy is referring to the 1990 Fair Trade Commission report on the legal profession. The position is that the recommendations and conclusions in that report about the provision of conveyancing services are being examined and any decisions reached will be announced in the normal way in due course.  I would point out, however, that the commission made no unanimous recommendation about the removal of the present restriction on non-solicitors providing conveyancing services for reward.  The commission's chairman favoured the ending of the restriction, but only after the process of land transfer has been simplified.  The other commission member did not favour the creation of a new class of licensed conveyancer.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 1,027 neighbourhood watch schemes and a further 245 community alert schemes throughout the country. I am also informed that there are 55 neighbourhood watch schemes and 37 community alert schemes in Cork City and county.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to attribute, with certainty, a change in the level of criminal activity to any particular measure such as the neighbourhood watch or community alert schemes.  However, the Garda authorities consider that the neighbourhood watch scheme is playing a significant role in reducing crime, particularly residential burglaries which, based on provisional figures for 1990, have dropped by over 19 per cent countrywide since 1984.  I am also glad to say that attacks on the elderly, in particular, have decreased considerably since the community alert scheme was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is important to make the point that the benefits of neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes cannot be judged by statistics alone.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that these schemes have been particularly successful in involving the community in <Col N="665" /> crime prevention, in enhancing relations between the Gardaí and the community they serve and in promoting a greater sense of security especially among the more vulnerable members of our society.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 272 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 102 of 14 February 1991, allocations under the amenities/recreational facilities grant scheme take account of the desirability of the proposed work, the cost effectiveness of the project and the employment which may be expected to result, as well as the need to distribute available funds on an equitable basis to all areas of the country.  The allocations are also designed to provide varied opportunities of enjoyment to all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>Grant applications are not generally identified by reference to their degree of use by men or women.  I do not accordingly regard the comparisons adduced in the questions as valid.  All grant allocations are conditional on certification by the local authority concerned that the project, when completed, will be of public utility and will be available for public or community use as far as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the particular application <Col N="669" /> referred to in Question No. 250, I did not find it possible to allocate a grant because of the limited funds available for distribution. It would be open to the sponsors of the project to make a further application under the 1991 scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 563 and 564 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland along with the other member states of the EC maintains its own independent licensing system for medicinal products.  These take account of, and reflect, the provisions of Community directives on the licensing of medicines and I do not accept that Irish regulations are contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>The requirements regarding the licensing of medicines are set out in the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations 1984-1989.  The procedures followed are the same for all medicines and in the interests of protecting public health, I would not wish to introduce lesser standards of scrutiny for particular categories of medicines.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the costs of licensing fees in respect of medicines are reducing the range of natural or herbal medicines available in this country.  The licence fees are set at the level necessary to meet the costs incurred by the State in assessing and evaluating applications for licences.</P>
      <P>The current licence fee in respect of a product authorisation is £1,605 for a period of five years.  This is equivalent to an annualised fee of £321 per product authorisation.</P>
      <P>The following is a schedule of fees currently payable in respect of the licensing of medicines.  There is no distinction made between different categories of medicines, such as natural or herbal, nor are there separate scales of fees depending on whether an applicant for a product authorisation is a manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Product Authorisation (Licence) &mdash; New Products (containing new chemical entity), £3,150 (five year period); New Product, £1,605 (five year period); Additional Formulations, £1,200 (five year <Col N="688" /> period); Renewal of Product Authorisation, £535 (five year period); Manufacturing Licence, £965 per annum; Wholesale Licence, £480 per annum; Additional outlets, £160 per annum.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of clarification, I would mention that a retailer engaged solely in the business of retailing would not normally be required to be a holder of product authorisations for those medicines he may be engaged in retailing.  A product authorisation is normally obtained by the person responsible for placing the product on the market in Ireland, usually the manufacturer or importer of the medicine.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate the average payments in respect of licensing fees by any individual or company dealing with natural or herbal medicines because of the range of variable factors that would arise.</P>

Income from this source in the current year is estimated at £13.5 million.  Medical card holders and certain other special categories are exempted from hospital charges so that, in effect, they are levied only on those who are deemed to have ability to pay.  In view of this, hospitals <Col N="691" /> and health boards try to ensure that all those who are liable for the payment of hospital charges do so.  However, I am assured by the Southern Health Board that nobody on their staff or acting on their behalf calls to the homes of former patients seeking payment of outstanding hospital charges.</P>

      <P>The adequacy of extended care provision for the elderly in care was not an issue in the case referred to by the Deputy.  On 3 February 1990 the proprietor of St. Martin's nursing home, Montennote, Cork, sought to transfer the approval under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, from St. Martin's to St. Mary's nursing home, Montennote, Cork, as the patients at St. Martin's were being transferred to St. Mary's.  I agreed to the transfer of the approval in respect of 40 beds, this being the number of beds in St. Martin's.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the proprietors of St. Mary's sought an order of <i>certiorari</i> in the High Court against this decision.  The High Court refused the relief sought and upheld my decision.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Southern Health Board have access to sufficient extended care beds for the elderly in Cork.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, updates the law on nursing homes. Under its provisions, a statutory duty will be placed on health boards to register nursing homes.  The boards will also be enabled to subvent a person in need of care in a registered nursing home, following an assessment of the person's dependency and their means and circumstances. The Act, which will repeal section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, will be commenced later this year.</P>
