      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7, 12, 13 and 14.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that: (1) No. 7 will be taken without debate, (2) the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 12 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Marine, and (3) Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 22, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I note, Sir, with some disappointment not to say surprise, that <Col N="1606" /> the Taoiseach has not made any provision to allow us, shall we say, to sit two hours later this evening so that we might not sit between the hours of 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock this afternoon.  Obviously I accept the Taoiseach's proposal in this matter.  Nonetheless I am sure there would be many Members of this House and of the public generally who might be even more interested in what happens between those hours in Lansdowne Road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business generally, the Taoiseach indicated in the House yesterday that he would be willing to envisage a debate in the House in the near future on the Inter-governmental Conferences.  I should be grateful if he could give an indication of when he expects them to take place.  Would he also consider, within that general context, the possibility of a separate debate, accompanied by a Government White Paper, on the implications for our economy of the likely changes in the Common Agricultural Policy in view of the very substantial numbers of jobs in the PAYE sector that may be lost as a result of some changes being contemplated? I am sure the House would wish that we would have a debate on those matters before they become a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering where legislation comes into this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question I feel called upon to answer is that of the debate on the work of the two Inter-governmental Conferences.  I suggest that might be held within the next couple of weeks. I am looking at the agenda of progress within the Inter-governmental Conferences at present to ascertain at what stage we might intervene with our <Col N="1607" /> debate, but I believe it should be held within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On that narrow point, would the Taoiseach say whether it would be possible to so frame the terms of that debate that the related issue of the threat to our economy arising from the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy could be discussed as it is a relevant part of the overall scene?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think the Whips could discuss that.  I would have no particular objection to it but there is enough going on within the two Inter-governmental Conferences to fill the time in one major debate.  However, we can consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point, would the Taoiseach say whether, in view of the rather unsatisfactory nature of a series of statements which has characterised previous discussions on European affairs, he would consider transferring this entire matter to the foreign affairs committee he proposes to establish?  Would he agree that perhaps discussions between the Whips could take place on this matter because a serious of statements on a matter as complex as both of the Inter-governmental Conferences is an unsatisfactory way of conducting our business?  Would he not consider another way in which the House could be informed about the evolution of the Government's position in relation to these two matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned here the other day &mdash; this point was referred to yesterday also &mdash; that I think it is important that there be a general discussion throughout the public generally on these matters.  I believe the best way to initiate that particular discussion among the general public is to have a wide ranging comprehensive debate here.  I propose to follow the traditional practice of debate. I do not intend that we should proceed by way of statements.  I would visualise this debate taking the form of an introductory statement, probably by myself, <Col N="1608" /> followed by contributions and by a winding-up statement in which the various points put forward in the debate would be replied to.  It would be a full scale debate, not the statements procedure.  I believe that is the best way to proceed.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, a Cheann Comhairle, but these two matters will be of major significance for this House and its future, for its powers, indeed including your own, Sir. Might I suggest that the Taoiseach inform the House as soon as possible when he proposes to establish the foreign affairs committee proposed which will be an integral part of this whole process?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise two matters while I am on my feet.  First, will the Taoiseach, at an early stage, provide time for the House to debate the situation in areas such as Bangladesh and other areas where there is a serious hunger problem?  This House should be given an opportunity to debate the matter to see how this country and the European Community might best respond.  Second, since the first anniversary of item No. 1 on the agenda has long since passed by can the Taoiseach indicate when the Whips will give time in the House to debate the interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts which has been on the agenda of the House for well over one year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 15 to 17, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>This section sets out the circumstances in which possession of a share certificate may be required in order to fish.  Sixty per cent of the ordinary members eligible to vote must vote in favour of the requirement. This scheme was worked out in discussions with the various angling interests.  I am exempted persons under 18 years of age and those aged 66 and over. As well as that, and again in discussion with the various angling interests, we decided to exempt the long term unemployed in receipt of social welfare assistance and persons in receipt of invalidity pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 30, the intention in the original package, which was worked out in consultation with angling interests, was to have a mid-term review of the decision under this section. There is general agreement now that this <Col N="1614" /> would be unwise and complicated and I am proposing to delete subsection (2).  In order to give official status to any decision taken by a society, arrangements are being made for the publication of the decision in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> and this is covered by subsection (3).  In subsection (4)  there is a provision that production of a copy of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> containing notice of a decision may be used as evidence in any legal proceedings which may arise in relation to the requirement to possess a share certificate.

      <P>This is the most appalling section of the Bill.  This section allows the societies to decide to prevent the individual citizen from fishing in our rivers and lakes unless he holds a share certificate.  We are creating a closed shop by establishing these societies with all their corporate members, who can decide by a vote of 60 per cent to require an individual to hold a share certificate in order to fish in a river or lake.  The Bill was bad enough with that provision, but the Minister is now proposing to remove the right of the society to rescind that decision &mdash; in other words once the decision is made by 60 per cent of the members, nobody else can fish in a river or lake without a share certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 (2) would have given the society the right to rescind that decision. There was a certain amount of hope that if the membership of a society changed or if their views on the rights of an individual citizen were to change, they could rescind their decision under this section.  Now the Minister is removing that right and is making the situation worse.  The only explanation he has given us for this change is to state &ldquo;there is general agreement that it would be unwise&rdquo; to leave in this subsection.  Who is in general agreement with the Minister on this <Col N="1615" /> matter?  Is this another example of the private discussions the Minister has been having with some of the interests in this dispute?  Has the Minister agreed with them to change some of the terms of the Bill as published?  This makes the situation much worse.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is in general agreement with the Minister on this issue.  I do not recall this subsection becoming the subject of a great deal of public discussion. I cannot recall reading a single line in a newspaper commenting on this provision in the Bill.  I cannot recall any organisation commenting on their unhappiness with societies having the right to rescind a decision taken by 60 per cent of its members.  Yet the Minister says out it goes.  We are entitled to a fuller explanation than what we have been given up to now.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this section of the Bill.  Whatever about the provisions to establish societies and giving them the right to decide that their members must have a share certificate, it is going beyond the point of reasonableness when societies can exclude the individual citizen from fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis for the rod licence dispute was that many people in our community were unwilling to forego the traditional rights which had been enjoyed with regard to fishing.  Section 9 will effectively remove those traditional rights.  Whatever prospects there had been that decisions taken under section 9 would be rescinded are now being removed and once the society makes the decision, the ladder is taken away and that will be the position for all time.</P>

      <P>I am appalled that the Minister has tabled this amendment to section 9, which is the fundamental essence of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990.  As Deputy Gilmore has said, section 9 is quite unacceptable as it stands <Col N="1616" />&mdash; we on this side of the House oppose it &mdash; but the amendment which the Minister has now put is totally unacceptable.  Not alone will it further copperfasten the general principle of section 9, it goes a step further and makes the societies even more exclusive.  It is taking from the societies the power to rescind a decision taken under this section, as originally proposed in the Bill.  The section as amended will prevent the societies from rescinding a decision as to who may fish and this is a very backward step.  I am amazed that the Minister has seen fit to table this amendment on Committee Stage.  One must question what has happened since the Bill was originally drafted.  I see the hand of bureaucracy heavily in place in the drafting of this amendment.  I can see senior officials in the Department wishing to get back to square one where they started two to three years ago.  What appears as a minimal change is in fact fundamental to the essence of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This amendment is appalling and we on this side of the House strongly oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish also to oppose this amendment.  The Minister has not given an adequate reason for introducing it. The Minister talks all the time about consulting with the angling interests, but I would like to know with which angling groups he consulted.  The Minister certainly has not consulted the National Anglers Representative Association, which &mdash; as he well knows &mdash; represents anglers from all over the country, from counties Mayo, Cavan, Kildare and Cork.  This is a very representative association and they are extremely angry with the many provisions in this Bill and they certainly are not in agreement with this proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be argued that the section is unconstitutional as it gives excessive control to persons over a public asset which they do not own.  There are many free fisheries in Ireland, especially the former Crown lakes in the west.  A society is allowed to make the purchase of a share <Col N="1617" /> certificate compulsory before an angler can fish waters which the society does not own.  Such waters are the property of every Irish citizen and a co-operative cannot by vote exclude people from enjoying them.  There are a couple of minor problems with this section.  For example, there is reference to the area of control of the society.  That is a very vague measure.  There should be some clause whereby a map would be provided so that the delineated area that the society controls is quite clear.  Fishery owners should be exempt from this measure when fishing their own waters.  For these reasons I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have opposed every amendment so far and I also have to oppose this one, more on principle than anything else.  The 60 per cent provision was not acceptable but to delete it completely horrifies me.  If this amendment is carried there will be confrontation in fisheries.  I have received representations indicating that some of the fisheries group fear there will be a closed shop if this amendment is passed. The 60 per cent would at least be of some help but to delete it would realise the fears of the people who fear that they will have no comeback.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of this section needs to be teased out a little more.  I am anxious to know with whom the Minister discussed this matter.  He said that having had discussions with groups he had decided not to implement this aspect of the Bill.  Some people to whom I have spoken have very vehemently said they would oppose any compulsory aspect of this section.  Here again we are operating without the rules of societies being outlined to us.  The Minister included in the Bill the 60 per cent provision &mdash; he called it a democratic procedure &mdash; but he is now deleting it.  That provision was a redeeming factor and to delete it would be a recipe for confrontation between groups who fear they would be deprived of the right to fish, with no redress whatsoever. This amendment is very weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going through a rather futile <Col N="1618" /> procedure this morning.  It is just a charade because the Minister has in mind to get this Bill through one way or another. We have a deputy to the people who have asked us to oppose compulsory measures in the legislation.  The people are afraid that a compulsory measure will be introduced whereby some group will have control and they will be denied the right to fish.  Therefore I have to oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the right to act as watchdogs, irrespective of the Minister's intention to get the amendment through.  It is our duty to speak out about every section of the Bill.  When the legislation was originally introduced the Oireachtas was guilty of not taking into account all aspects involved.  Therefore, it is our duty on this occasion to look at the Bill line by line and ensure that nothing goes through that will make it worse than when it was presented.</P>
      <P>If the Minister's amendment to delete this section is passed the co-operative societies, once they make a decision, will not have the right to rescind it.  In three, four or five years' time new members in a society, may adopt a different attitude to the rule about the necessity to have share certificates in order to fish.  It would be like a GAA club, or any club, making a decision and nobody being able to alter it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a club or society decide by a majority of 60 per cent that people can not fish on a lake without a share certificate, is it the fisheries officers who will check to see if the people fishing have share certificates? All sorts of complications would arise just as they do for example, when assessing people for unemployment assistance and so on.  The essence of this measure is exactly what the anglers opposed when the original licence was introduced. When a person is out fishing on a lake the last thing he or she wants is a speed-boat disturbing their peace and activity by asking them whether they have a share certificate or a licence.  Under the 60 per cent provision in the first Bill it was entirely a matter for the societies to make a decision by a majority of 60 per cent of <Col N="1619" /> their members as to whether or not to implement that rule.  If we accept this amendment and in two or three year's time the society realise they made a mistake in deciding by a majority of 60 per cent that this rule would apply, it will not be possible for them to rescind the decision, even if all members agree.</P>
    <P>The Minister consulted many people about this Bill but I do not know whom he consulted about this amendment.  He said he had wide-ranging consultations with interested parties.  I pose the question: were the interested parties the civil servants who drew up this Bill or the people who will be out on the lakes fishing? I question very seriously the intention to introducing this amendment.  I was not entirely happy with section 9 but we could have accepted it.  However, if this amendment is put to a vote we will certainly not accept it because it changes the whole emphasis of the Bill as regards policing or hounding anglers on lakes and rivers.</P>

First with regard to Deputy Gilmore's contribution, I do not know how he can say that if people who are anxious to contribute to the development and protection of fisheries join together and make a decision by 60 per cent of their members it would develop into a closed shop.  I know that Deputy Gilmore must have a grasp of political science and political structures &mdash; and of political structures in place &mdash; which <Col N="1620" /> would regard 20 per cent of a special <i>corps d'élite</i> as adequate to rule a country or to run an organisation.

      <P>The Minister lashed out in all directions and raised as much dust and diversion as he possibly could to distract attention from the amendment before us in order to avoid answering the points made.  In his entire contribution, he did not make a single defence of the amendment.  He made all kinds of changes in direction but he did not address himself to the amendment.  Will he explain why he wants to take out of this section the provision that the societies could rescind their own decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental difference between a periodic review, which is what the five years is about, and a body having the right to rescind a decision.  I cannot think of any organisation or State body, or indeed legislation, where a body could not rescind a decision which they have previously taken.  I do not know of any legislation which removes from an organisation the right to rescind a decision.  This is an unprecedented amendment.  I do not know of any case where it existed before <Col N="1624" /> and it is disingenuous of the Minister to equate it with a periodic review, just as it is wrong for him to claim in the House that Members who have spent a long time on this legislation on Second Stage and after several days of Committee Stage are unprepared or have not read the Bill.</P>
      <P>Let us deal with the Minister's preparation in regard to the Bill.  With whom did he reach agreement that this amendment should be tabled?  I asked him on the last occasion we were here about meetings which he had with interests to the rod licence dispute since the publication of this Bill, but he has not yet told us clearly what meetings he held, with whom and what was agreed with them.  He should do that now so that we know the general agreement to which he referred.</P>
      <P>This is an appalling amendment.  If accepted, it will give rise to a situation whereby groups of people who do not own the rivers and lakes can come together and make a decision to exclude other citizens of the State from fishing in them.  That is what it is about.  Having made that decision they cannot go back on it.  No matter how much they come to realise that they made a mistake, no matter how much controversy arises in an area, let us say in Galway or Mayo or wherever, if 60 per cent of the members of a society decide that they will exclude other people from fishing they cannot then go back on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the practical implications of this.  The Minister says people under 18 will not have to have a share certificate. Anybody who knows anything about the minor grades in GAA codes will know that we very often come across some very elderly minors indeed.  I suspect we will be coming across some ageing 18 year olds on the banks of rivers and lakes under this legislation.  As the temperature begins to rise, as resentment rises in local areas among people who are being harassed for share certificates, and a society may come to realise that they should perhaps change their minds under the amendment the Minister has now introduced they cannot do so.  There is no reason why the Minister should have <Col N="1625" /> introduced this amendment except that he wants to lock in for all time control of the rivers and lakes of this State in the hands of small numbers of people under the pretext that it is some kind of democratic move.</P>
    <P>I say with some regret that the Minister will go down in history as the man who handed over the rivers and lakes of this State and their control to small numbers of people who in time to come may abuse the powers they have been given under this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to confine myself to the section we are discussing and particularly the amendment by which the Minister wants to delete the right of a society to change its mind within five years.  The Minister gave an extraordinary reply to our last contributions. Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall to be cool on this occasion.  I have great respect for the Minister and the work he has put in to try to solve this rod licence problem. Since he became Minister for the Marine he has made a genuine effort to speak to all parties.  I would like him to spell out to whom exactly he spoke.  At secondhand, I gather he spoke to many interested parties and I give the Minister credit for that.</P>
      <P>I myself have been involved in this dispute right from the beginning.  If anybody has any doubt he can look up my speech in the Seanad on 17 December 1987 when I warned of the danger of the introduction of this licence &mdash; I did not think then that we would still be talking about it three years later.  I was proud of that contribution at the time.  Unfortunately, many of the things I foresaw then, and worse, have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the amendment, we can all make wrong decisions.  If that amendment had been put into this Bill when it was introduced, it would mean that we could not have amended this Bill for five years.  Here we are for the last three years trying to amend this Bill. Three years after the introduction of the Bill we are almost succeeding in getting amending legislation, but it is not now satisfactory legislation.  The Minister's <Col N="1626" /> amendment is making the legislation even more unsatisfactory than the Bill which the Minister presented to us and which he said was agreed by the interested parties at the time.  Now the interested parties are not in agreement because the Minister wants to put in an amendment.  If he had got agreement with the interested parties could he not have left it so even though we were not satisfied?  This is now making it worse. The societies to whom the Minister wants to give control would not have the authority to amend a decision for a period of five years.  The whole principle of opposition to this Bill is related to the control of waters.  This is adding to the amount of control the Minister has.  I am sorry that on the last occasion I attributed blame in the wrong place.  The Minister wants to keep the control.  We have complained that in 15 sections of this Bill the Minister has certain powers.  Now we are putting in a 16th one.  It has gone beyond a joke and I would appeal to the Minister to be reasonable and withdraw his amendment and then we can consider the rest of this section.</P>

      <P>In his response the Minister said that Members of this House had come in inadequately prepared.  Let me remind the Minister that on 15 December 1987 the Labour Party opposed that notorious legislation because of the dangers in it.  Here we are, four years later, with another Bill which we are opposing for very good reasons.  I was not in the House in 1987 but I certainly had to appear for this Bill because I saw the flak that was generated outside by legislation that was hurried through the House at that time.  Now, in 1991 I believe the Minister is making a mistake and there will be confrontation.  Despite what the Minister said this is a closed shop.  If 60 per cent of a group can deprive the people who are not in that group of the right to fish that is a closed shop despite what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The five year review does not meet the standards I would put into the Bill.  Every organisation, even the Minister's own, has an annual general meeting at which <Col N="1627" /> the whole activity of the year is looked at, rules and regulations are looked at and changes are made if necessary. Under this amendment this is being denied to the societies.  I would have to reject out of hand the missiles the Minister fired here on the Opposition benches because we do not agree with him.  We have very good and sound reasons for not agreeing with the Minister and he must know this.  The Minister has had discussions with groups outside the House &mdash; he has not told us who they are.  I can tell the Minister who I had discussions with.  There are many people in Cork city at present who feel that this legislation will deprive them of the right to fish as they saw fit to do in previous years.</P>
    <P>I have opposed sections as they came up.  The Minister indicated at the start that this Bill was an amendment Bill to get rid of the rod licence.  The share certificate is just a licence under a different name.  I have very good reasons for opposing some sections as they come up. I do not want to see us in the ridiculous situation where people across in Britain are being told to come to fish in Ireland when we still, effectively, have a licence system.  I am surprised that the Minister has come in here and put forward this amendment which proposes that a five year review will be adequate.  A five year review will not be adequate and I will oppose this amendment.  I will also oppose the section.</P>

      <P>Not alone did the Minister lecture and abuse us when he was replying to our contributions but he did not in any way seek to explain further to the House or the public at large why he has put forward this amendment at this stage.  In my original contribution I asked the Minister to say what has happened since the Bill was published which motivated him to table an amendment which proposes to rescind section 2; in other words, what motivated him to put forward an amendment which will prevent the societies from changing their minds in regard to a decision they made at an earlier date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is supposed to be about co-operatives but the more we go into it and the more amendments the Minister tables the more we seem to be moving away from the principle of co-operatives and the reasons for them.  What the Minister is proposing is not a co-operative system; it is very much a system which will be put in place by the Department and which will be under the thumb of the Department and the legislation passed by this House.  Section 2 is not the type of section which should be included in any co-operative legislation.  I suggest to the Minister that he should examine previous co-operative legislation to see what sections of it <Col N="1629" /> would in any way relate to most of the sections in this Bill.  This section and the amendment put forward by the Minister, which will further tighten down the section and prevent ordinary people from fishing in our rivers and lakes, are unacceptable to us.  This is an undemocratic and dictatorial move on the part of the Minister.  I am surprised that the Minister has not seen the error of his ways and the inherent dangers in this section.  It is vital that the Minister re-examines his amendment to section 9.  While section 9 is unacceptable as it stands, amendments Nos. 30 and 31 are totally abhorrent to us and against the principles of co-operation and free fishing.  We on this side of the House very much oppose the Minister's amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does his reading of the Bill indicate to him that there will be an opportunity to rescind the rule at the end of five years?  If the Deputy has not grasped that I cannot understand why. The fact is that at the end of five years it will be possible to change the rule and say that a share certificate is or is not necessary; 60 per cent of the members will make the decision, as they will have done first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore invented the phrase &ldquo;periodic review&rdquo;.  The fact of the matter is that my amendment will exclude between year one and year five exactly what can happen each five years.  I would be pleased to elucidate the Part of the Bill which may be causing ambiguity in that regard.  So many people have said that the decision cannot be rescinded that there must be a misreading somewhere. I would be glad to clarify that point for the benefit of the House and specifically for the benefit of the spokespersons here today.  There can be a rescission.  Deputy <Col N="1630" /> Gilmore said they could not go back on their decision.  Of course they can go back on it at the end of the five years in the normal way and by a 60 per cent majority.</P>

      <P>It was only at the insistence of the anglers that I put forward this amendment.  I consulted them right across the board &mdash; those pro-licence and anti-licence &mdash; so that I could get as subtle legislation as possible on the Statute Book, realising, as Deputy McCormack said, that the original legislation had caused some trouble.  There is absolutely no element of an extension of control by the Minister in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I will come back to that point in a moment because the Deputy will be surprised where it came from. Deputy O'Sullivan said he had also spoken to people.  I want to tell the Deputy that Cork made a big contribution to the development of this Bill. These included old age pensioners, juveniles and the unemployed.  The input was not exclusively from there but I am glad to be able to say that they made a very strong contribution in that regard.</P>
      <P>This change was put in at the request of the anglers because they felt it would be onerous to have another vote between the two election periods.  This happens to be expensive as well, because it is a postal ballot and each individual member in democratic fashion is asked to vote.  We are trying to calm passions that have undoubtedly been raised.  They also said that having the ballot between the first and fifth years might induce disputation and they persuaded me that it would be better to leave the five year span.  There are rescission possibilities at the end of the five years and I cannot understand how that was misunderstood.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I am anxious to learn.  The first thing I would like to learn <Col N="1632" /> is where in the Bill it refers to the decision being rescinded after five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of five years dual elections take place, one for the regional board and the other for the board of management.  There is potential in that new situation to make the other decision which is to last five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is not we on this side of the House who do not understand the Bill.  The Minister is having difficulty understanding his own Bill because the five years he is referring to is the five year intervals for the election of the regional boards which will also coincidentally be the period for the election of the board or officers of the society. The election of the board and officers of the society is different from the decision to rescind the 60 per cent rule, because the decision to rescind the 60 per cent rule will not be made by the board or officers of the society.  It is made by ballot of the entire membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Held by the boards of management, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It says:</P>
      <P>Where a society has so decided by vote of 60 per cent. of its ordinary members eligible to vote and voting, a person shall not be entitled to angle for trout or coarse fish in the area of that society unless he is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and then it goes on to give the exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Minister is referring to section 14.  This section provides for the election of members for the regional boards and it also refers to the fact that the management committees of the society would be elected at the same intervals as the regional boards.  Nowhere does it state that the election of a new board or a new executive committee for the society will result in any right to rescind a decision taken by the entire membership.  The Minister lacks understanding of his own Bill.  There is nothing in the Bill which allows the decision to be <Col N="1633" /> rescinded after five years.  The Minister should clear that up.  There is no connection in this Bill between the election of the officers of this society and a decision to rescind or change rules.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister keeps saying that he is in agreement with the anglers, that he consulted the anglers and so on.  He is quite entitled to ignore recommendations but he should come into the House and say that.  That would be honourable and correct.  We do not have to do what the anglers wish.  We are <Col N="1634" /> not at the beck and call of outside interest groups.  We should listen to them carefully and take their ideas on board if we can, but we are not obliged to take them on board.  That is our function as democrats.</P>
      <P>The Minister implies <i>ad nauseam</i> that all the angling associations agree with everything in this Bill and he keeps trying to belittle the opposition to this Bill by saying we are being irresponsible and have not read the Bill.  That is not so.  The Minister referred to the anti-rod licence people.  That is a delightfully vague expression.  Who does it include?  We have the Minister Angling Council, the National Anglers Representative Association and various groups of anglers of varying importance.  The National Anglers Representative Association is one of the more important angling groups here.  Will the Minister say clearly what this group had to say to him about this proposal?  If he is honest, he will say they opposed this amendment.  The Minister should have the honesty to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister owes Opposition Members an apology.  The Minister strongly condemned Opposition Deputies about the five year proposal and said we did not read the Bill.  I carefully reread the Bill a number of times and the five year period was not mentioned in the Bill in the context to which the Minister referred.  The Minister has made a gaff on this issue.  The five years proposal does not even enter into the matter.  The Minister said it would be costly to have this rule rescinded during the period due to the postal ballot.  It is not a postal ballot, it is a secret ballot.  Most of those co-operatives will meet perhaps once a month or once a fortnight during the season and the only expense would be in notifying people of the venue and time of the meeting to vote on whether to rescind a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer back to the closed shop, because what we are talking about here is a group of people telling other people that due to a decision of 60 per cent of their membership, they are being denied <Col N="1635" /> the right to fish a particular stretch of river or lake.</P>
    <P>The reason we opposed that Bill from the first day was that we felt it was bad legislation and the Minister should have recognised this.  Subsequent events have proved us to be correct.  We are now going to put worse legislation in place and I suggest, before there is another débacle, that the Minister should either withdraw or change the Bill.  I and the Labour Party will oppose this section tooth and nail.  I must say that the Minister is wrong in trying to bulldoze it through the House this morning.  In the process he has ridiculed some of the Members which is very unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I can, quite frankly, understand the Minister's anger, impatience and annoyance.  I would like to quote amendment No. 39 for those Deputies who have a problem with this provision relating to the five-year review and question whether the society will be able to rescind their own decision.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>A decision of a society under section 9 of this Act shall have effect until the next election of its management committee and shall then cease unless at a ballot for the purposes of that section it is decided in accordance with subsection (1) of that section that the provisions of that subsection shall continue in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The language used is complicated but the message is very clear and I suggest that those Deputies who have a problem with <Col N="1636" /> this provision should read that amendment carefully.</P>
    <P>This issue has torn the heart out of the nation over a lengthy period.  I share a constituency with Deputy Garland who has been closely involved in this issue but many of us have strong connections with parts of the country where this is a live issue.  There have been tortuous consultations over a lengthy period and, quite frankly, as I said, I can understand the reason the Minister is a little bit impatient with those who want to dig up issues which have already been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I was at Dublin Airport during the weekend where, interestingly enough, I saw a large group of German holidaymakers arriving with their fishing gear.  I could not but feel relieved that things were calm given that this has been a very contenious issue.  Tortuous consultations and talks about talks have taken place and I feel that Members on all sides of the House have a responsibility to give the legislation a chance.  If Members listen to the Minister and read the Bill carefully they will see that there are inbuilt safeguards.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 32 is in the name of Deputy Garland. Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 are alternatives. I suggest that we discuss together amendments Nos. 32, 33 and 34.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 30 to 34, to delete subsection (2), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister may, 3 years after the enactment of this Act and at 3 year intervals thereafter increase the fees as specified under subsection (1) of this section without consultation of a society providing that the amount of such increase shall not exceed the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In so far as we have to have this Bill and annual certificates, we can probably agree that the amounts provided for in the Bill are reasonable and certainly not excessive.  We must have some machinery in place to deal with the matter in the future.  Subsection (2), which deals with the possible increase in the cost of annual certificates, gives sole power to the Minister to increase or otherwise alter the price of certificates.  The Minister's amendment No. 34 improves the position somewhat in that it requires the consent of the majority of societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to introduce a sense of fairness and equity and to try to cut out bureaucracy.  In so far as people have to pay for these certificates, the amendment is reasonable and would not require consultation with the societies because they would agree <Col N="1640" /> that the cost of living index would be a fair measure of assessment.  It would simplify matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 33 is in my name.  This section sets out how much the share certificates will cost.  An annual certificate will cost £12, a 21-day certificate £5 and a three-day certificate £3. These share certificates are the rod licence under another name.  Admittedly the price of the share certificate is somewhat less than that of the rod licence which caused so much fuss.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) gives the Minister the right to alter the price of the share certificates. We know that money has been behind this whole business since 1987, when the original rod licence legislation was introduced.  The Government had cut back on the money available to the regional fisheries boards for the development of inland fisheries.  To make up the loss they introduced the idea of a rod licence.  That did not run, so the Government have found a new means of raising money for inland fisheries by shifting the onus to the anglers and angling clubs, allowing them to set up co-operatives and requiring them to charge for share certificates which must be obtained by anyone wishing to fish on the rivers and lakes.  To sweeten the pill the cost of the share certificate will be pitched at £12 a year for a start.  Everybody will say it is not too bad since it is less than the cost of the rod licence.  The sting comes in subsection (2) where the Minister takes the right to increase the price of the share certificate.  I agree with Deputy Garland that the Minister's amendment improves the position in that he will only be able to do so with the consent of a majority of the societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has apparently persuaded some angling interests of the merits of this Bill, which will deprive the individual citizen of the right to free fishing, the core of the rod licence dispute.  It is conceivable that he will be able to persuade the societies of the merits of increasing the price of the share certificate especially when they will be squealing for money <Col N="1641" /> and the clubs themselves through corporate membership can offset the charge. They will not have to pay it because they will be able to offset it against outlay on works of public benefit under section 8. The societies will, by and large, be controlled by the corporate members.  That is quite clearly what will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not rubbish.  The corporate members such as the angling clubs will not have to pay the increased price for share certificates because they will be able to offset it.  It will be passed on to the individual angler.  We have a vehicle whereby the Minister in years to come will be able to drive up the price of the share certificate.  He will get the agreement of the societies because the corporate members of those societies will not have to pay it.  The individual angler is the person who will pay the higher cost. The £12 annual fee will last for a very short time until the pain of the introduction of the idea has been got over. Then the Minister and the societies will be able to meet again in Portlaoise and decide to put up the price of the share certificates.  This is a recipe whereby anglers will end up paying more for share certificates than they ever paid for the rod licence.  That is the bottom line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of the manner in which the Minister dresses up this section in regard to share certificates &mdash; whether it be a 21 day certificate or a three-day certificate &mdash; basically what is entailed here is a camouflaged rod licence; at the end of the day that is the nitty gritty.  No matter how we view it, or how it is done, it involves a charge on fishing.  Of course, the Minister will totally disagree with me; nevertheless he still retains power to increase share certificates as he sees fit, admittedly after consultation with other groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have realised the cost of inland fisheries, that a certain amount of money must be paid for their protection and development and were prepared to do so.  The Minister should have viewed the <Col N="1642" /> matter in that light and stipulated that a voluntary contribution was the way forward. Fishing groups nationwide know in their hearts and souls that they must contribute to the protection and development of our inland fisheries.  It is my belief they were willing to contribute thereto voluntarily having lived through the experiences since 1987 when people were up in arms about compulsion or coercion with regard to payment.  I would advocate that the Minister re-examine the overall position with regard to charges.</P>
    <P>This amendment, which endeavours to relieve the Minister of some of his power, is a good one.  My opposition to the proposition was that angling clubs or anglers individually would have been willing to contribute voluntarily so that this compulsion or coercion will lead to antagonism on the part of angling clubs generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like others, I am opposed to the Minister's amendment.  In this section there has been no consideration of the voluntary effort of anglers and/or angling clubs.  We must acknowledge that there are and have been major contributions on the part of anglers and angling clubs in the work they undertake in our lakes and rivers.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this section are specific with regard to the price of the share certificate, including that pertaining to a group certificate or that held by an angling club.  There is no mention of any consideration being given to the contribution of individual anglers or their work.  These share certificates will be subject to review or adjustment.  I contend that anglers nationwide will be fearful of the inherent danger in this section, which is that a share certificate could be increased dramatically in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing legislation in this House one cannot deal with the present only; we must give some consideration to circumstances that may prevail in the future.  For example, we must anticipate what will be the circumstances prevailing in, say, ten or 20 years.  The provisions of this section as drafted do envisage circumstances developing in which a <Col N="1643" /> share certificate could be increased so enormously, it would become a matter simply for the exclusive few, which would be contrary to the tradition of fishing patterns here.  That trend has developed in England and Scotland where fishing has become a pasttime of the wealthy sectors of their societies but it would be unfortunate were that pattern to develop here.  The provisions of this section could be instrumental in the development of an exclusive class of fishing here; there is that inherent danger.</P>
    <P>Therefore I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As he said, Deputy Garland's amendment was tabled in an effort to introduce fairness and equity into the provisions of this section, which I fully accept.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index was what we discussed originally, very extensively in my Department with regard to this section.  The point made by a number of contributors was that, when something is impaled as it were, in a statute, one must follow it to the nth degree.  As members of my staff, experienced in finance, indicated, one is then getting into fractions. If one wanted to be punctilious about it, one might charge, say, .88 of a penny if one adhered strictly to the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>I thought that my amendment, as tabled, would commend general support. It is totally democratic in that if a majority of societies decide that the amount to be determined should be the approximate consumer price index figure, then that is what it will be or, if they decide there should be no increase at all, then there will not be any increase. Equally, if they decide on some other figure, that will be the determinant.  I appreciate Deputy Garland's amendment but, substantively, my amendment covers what he is endeavouring to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned corporate members.  Once more I should like to place on the record of the House that a corporate member, say, of an hotel, a magnate, with a lot of money, and a conscience &mdash; of course conscience kept <Col N="1644" /> titillated by Deputy Garland and his party &mdash; who lives in a certain area and decides to invest, say, £1,000, £2,000, or whatever, will have one vote or the institution concerned will have one vote.  It would be my hope that such people in the various regions &mdash; realising the gift we have in our lakes and rivers &mdash; would be convinced that they should contribute to their development.  It does not give them any rights in accordance with the size of their wallets but, as happens nowadays, in some countries to a greater extent than in ours, people who have amassed wealth should consider investing money for the development and protection of fisheries and for the benefit of the community in general.</P>
    <P>With regard to angling clubs, again from the manner in which Deputy Gilmore spoke, one would think he was talking about the Freemasons.  These people are ordinary anglers who decide to form a co-operative society for the specific purposes I have mentioned continuously, that is, the protection and development of fisheries in their regions.  A person will only have one vote whether or not he be a member of an angling club.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is germane to the remarks made by Deputy Taylor-Quinn when she said there was no recognition of the work undertaken by clubs; <i>au contraire</i>, it is quite clear in section 8 that there is such recognition. From the very beginning of our discussions the point was made strongly to me that the actual voluntary work undertaken and investment on the part of angling clubs had not been appreciated within the community generally and, specifically, by the Department of the Marine, formerly the Department of Fisheries.  It was with a view to that that section 8 was constructed as it is <i>ab initio</i> that point was made to me time and again by the people who are committed to angling.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned that the anglers were quite prepared to pay.  I agree with him and I took them at their word.  They came and made that case to me.  They said it was a travesty of their position to state that the reason they were <Col N="1645" /> opposed to the rod licence was that they did not want to contribute to their own sport.  I accepted their contention.  The whole system is based on voluntary subscriptions which Deputy O'Sullivan said is desirable and I agree with him.  There is no compulsion on anyone to join.  In a case where a particular society decide there is no requirement to have a certificate to fish then the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan is covered.  Deputy O'Sullivan used an emotive word, &ldquo;coercion&rdquo;.  There is no element whatsoever of coercion in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply briefly to the Minister.  With respect he has not read the small print in my amendment because he referred to the cumbersome nature of the financial figures which may result from applying the cost of living index to what are round sum amounts of £12 and so forth.  If that were to be the effect of my amendment it would be flawed in that minor way.  If the Minister would take the trouble to read my amendment again he would see that it seeks to provide that the amount of such increase shall not exceed the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index.  If we take the £12 licence and apply to it the cost of living index over three years the cost of the licence would be £13.06 and, clearly, that would be a ludicrous amount to ask people to pay.  If my amendment is accepted the amount presumably will be fixed at £13. I could have tabled a lengthy and detailed amendment, which I did consider, to deal with this rounding down following the application of the consumer price index to the existing licences but I decided it was too cumbersome.  I expected that common sense would prevail and that a round figure would be arrived at which would be slightly less than the consumer price index.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge that his argument in that respect is flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy said, that the amount of such a fee shall not exceed the rate of inflation or the <Col N="1646" /> consumer price index in the amendment. My proposal has the additional advantage in that it is left to the societies. Much of the criticism directed against the contents of the Bill was directed against the Minister having power and Deputy Garland's amendment seems to be anxious to give me this power but I prefer to leave it to the societies.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> This is a short amendment.  The only people who are entitled to vote in a society are members who are ordinarily resident in Ireland.  What is the position of Irish emigrants who come back on holidays, want to fish, join a society, take up membership and get a share certificate? Those people would be denied the right to vote under the provisions of the Bill.  Deputy O'Sullivan had a Private Members' Bill debated in the House recently dealing with the question of giving voting rights generally to emigrants but under the scope of this Bill that would be impossible.  There are specific reasons why citizens who are not ordinarily resident in the country should have the right to vote in these cases.  Emigrants who take out share certificates and return on holidays should have a say in how these societies are run.  The purpose of this amendment is to extend the voting right within societies not just to people who are resident here but to citizens generally. If they hold a share certificate they should have the right to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  This matter was discussed in consultation with the various angling groups.  In particular consideration should be given to Irish people who were forced to emigrate because of economic circumstances and find employment elsewhere.  In many instances these people support their less fortunate families at home.  When they return on holidays everything possible should be done to make their stay pleasant.  This amendment takes that into consideration.  Perhaps Deputy Gilmore will be able to beef up this amendment on Report Stage.  There are 20 million people around the world entitled to Irish <Col N="1648" /> citizenship and if they came here on holiday the economic benefits would be dramatic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My proposal is that individuals who reside in Ireland, north, south, east or west, shall be entitled to purchase a share certificate and to vote for the committees of management and also for positions on the regional boards. I understand the thinking behind the amendment.  I know at one stage there was a move to exclude people from the Six Counties, which I am sure, a Cheann Comhairle, you will agree was a partitionist approach, which I reject.  I am not prepared to go any further than that. With regard to the position of emigrants &mdash; I have a personal sympathy with them because unlike many Members of this House I had to emigrate; in fact out of our family of seven, five had to emigrate at one stage or another, so as a result I have always had a special interest in emigrants &mdash; after due consideration we came to the decision that in the circumstances we would confine membership and voting to people who were ordinarily resident in Ireland, North and South.  This does not exclude people from membership, including non-ethnic tourists who come here to fish, and from holding a share certificate where it has been democratically decided that they should.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the balloting <Col N="1650" /> arrangements for elections which will take place for the purposes of meeting the provisions of section 9 of the Bill.  I would remind Members that section 9 is crucial to the Bill because it deals with whether the society will decide to have an annual share certificate.  Obviously adequate debate should take place within the society to ensure that after a full debate a democratic decision will be reached.  Let us look at the actual wording of the section, subsection (4) (a) states:</P>
    <P>The first ballot for the purpose of section 9 of this Act shall be held at the same time as the first election of the society's management committee and the election of the regional board of the region of which the society's area forms part.</P>
    <P>In my view that does not give sufficient time for debate, hence my amendment which seeks instead to substitute &ldquo;at the first annual general meeting of the society's management committee.&rdquo; We feel the best time to have the ballot is at the first annual general meeting of the society's management committee.  While this is a technical matter, nevertheless it is an important point and I hope the Minister will respond positively to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now discussing amendments Nos. 35 to 41 to section 11. This section outlines the arrangements which are to apply in respect of ballots to determine whether possession of a share certificate is required to fish for trout or coarse fish in any society's area and is to be confined to the members as outlined in our discussion on the last amendment. Voting is by secret ballot and only those normally resident in Ireland may vote. The first such ballot is to be held at the same time as the first election of the society's management committee and the next election of the regional fisheries board, which is due in December 1991. Ordinary members with current share certificates are to be entitled to vote.  We are now dealing with amendment No. 36. However, amendment No. 37 is relevant. The Bill provides that to be eligible to vote in any subsequent ballot on this <Col N="1651" /> issue, members will be required to have been in continued membership of the society since the previous ballot.  That requirement is a bit stringent and, as Deputies may know.  I have tabled an amendment, No. 38, that this requirement be altered to the current year and any two other years in the <i>interregnum</i> of the five year period.  Any subsequent ballot on this issue is to be held at the same time as the management committee elections, which is a reasonable management and administrative arrangement. In his amendment, Deputy Garland is indicating that this should take place at the annual general meeting.</P>
      <P>Again this was the subject of widespread discussion when I was preparing this Bill.  Apart from other considerations, the idea of an annual general meeting as distinct from a ballot might be difficult if there is the demand for membership of the societies which I expect.  It would not be possible to have an annual general meeting unless we were to hold it on, for instance, the Hill of Tara &mdash; and that would only be for the Leinster region &mdash; because I expect there will be huge numbers.  The idea is to have a register of members and that would be available throughout the country.  There would be a straight, open, democratic ballot and people would not have to indicate to anybody for whom they were voting.  I think that is a very fair way of dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>The changes proposed here are mainly drafting changes flowing from my decision to delete subsection (7) and provide for ballots to be held at five yearly intervals.  There was some difficulty in understanding this earlier.  These ballots would be held at the same time as the regional board elections.  It has been pointed out to me that the requirement under the existing subsection (5) to have held a certificate effectively for five years would be too onerous and therefore I am altering this requirement to the current year and any other two years in the interregnum, that is in the five year period.  I am proposing amendments Nos. 36a and 37a to enable a cut-off date to be decided in relation to eligibility to vote in these ballots: 31 October has been suggested. This should facilitate the societies when making arrangements to hold ballots, and of course it is important that that should be so.</P>

      <P>I have a problem with subsection (5) of this section.  It proposes that to be entitled to vote in any subsequent ballot a person must be the holder of a current annual certificate of the society and/or be deemed to be the holder of such certificate for each year since the previous ballot.  This needs to be clarified because a problem could arise here with junior anglers on coming of age.  It would also discourage new members.  I would ask the Minister to consider that.  I would also refer to subsection (7) which is the subject of my amendment No. 41.  This subsection provides that if the Minister at his discretion so permits no other ballot may be held in the second or third year between the election and such date as may be fixed for that purpose.  It seems that this matter is arbitrary and should be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a couple of observations on this section which, perhaps, the Minister will clarify.  It is a rather strange section as, for example, subsection (1) proposes to allocate functions to every authorised officer of a regional board.  If a society decide by 60 per cent that everybody must have a share certificate, under this section it now becomes the function of every authorised officer of a regional board to enforce that provision.  I have two questions in that regard.  Where does that leave the boards in relation to directing their own staff and officers?  As I understand it, the position at the moment is that the various functions under, say, the 1980 Act are given to the board <i>per se</i> and it is a matter for the board to decide how they discharge those or what instructions or functions they give to their own officers to discharge them.  Secondly &mdash; and I do not know whether the Minister has considered this &mdash; is it in order for legislation to give specific functions to identifiable officers of the regional boards?  I would have thought that the functions of officers of regional boards would be a matter for their terms of employment with the board and that, in turn, would be a matter for <Col N="1656" /> negotiation between those officers, their trade unions and the boards concerned. I am somewhat concerned that specific functions &mdash; which may be very controversial &mdash; are being assigned in the legislation to identifiable officers of regional boards.  I raise that point as it may give rise to difficulties and I should like to hear the Minister's observations in that regard.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to me in regard to a fishery officer carrying out instructions at the behest of the fishery board, but also, according to the legislation, of a particular group who could direct a fishery officer to carry out certain duties.  This raises the whole question of who controls the fishery officer or the fishery board.  I presume that the fishery board will be instructed by the co-operative movement to tell a person to do a certain duty. However, that is a fairly hefty responsibility because it could possibly mean prosecution at some stage.  Is that the right course to adopt?  I will be anxious to hear the Minister clarify the position because it is a matter of serious concern to many people, particularly those in the fishery boards throughout the country, who are now in the invidious position of having to carry out instructions from people with whom they were probably in confrontation in the recent past.  The position needs to be clarified since so many people made their views known on this matter.</P>

      <P>This is a particularly interesting section in relation to the enforcement of the regulation of fishing and the powers vested in fishery officers to enforce it.  Subsection (5) specifically states that it shall be a good defence to prove that he had the rod and line in his possession as a manufacturer or seller thereof and not for use.</P>

      <P>Yes, indeed.  One <Col N="1657" /> has to stretch one's imagination to visualise a manufacturer of fishing rods on the shoreline of the Corrib or, indeed, at any lake right across the country, selling fishing rods.

Would the prosecution be dropped because of that defence?  The legal eagles will have some amusement with this section and many an interesting case will be pursued because of it.</P>

      <P>Fishermen are entitled to tell lies about the size of the fish, particularly about the one that got away, because it cannot be verified.  Anything I would say here would not help a judge in future or indeed a senior or junior counsel to come to a conclusion, because only what is in the Act will count.  It would be an acceptable defence to say that you are trying to sell a fishing rod on the shores of Lough Derg, a lake which I know very well.  I would advise the purchaser to buy the rod and line and to start fishing in Lough Derg, all round the Clare Coast, Tipperary and on to South Galway.  The defence is clearly outlined in the Bill and I do not expect any great difficulty in that regard.  I may be wrong in the derivation <Col N="1658" /> of the word &ldquo;accost&rdquo; but I think originally it meant &ldquo;to rib&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor-Quinn because it seems to be a daft subsection.  I would have thought that a matter like that could be left to the courts.  I wonder is this some kind of agreement which the Minister has made with what he describes as anti-rod licence people.  Perhaps this would be the standard defence used by anglers to get over this.  It might become a standing joke.  A man might say he was trying to sell his fishing rod when an inspector came along. This could get great mileage in the world press.  It is really very amusing when one thinks of it.  I concede that there might be the odd angler who would be there with the intention of selling his fishing rod.</P>
      <P>I am sure the justices have heard peculiar defences in their time and, by times, these defences are genuine, and I have little doubt that the district justice involved would decide on the facts of the case.  Putting this subclause into this legislation is only putting ideas into people's minds.  Some clever, crafty solicitor defending a client who is obviously guilty of the offence will get hold of this. He will suggest to his client that maybe he was down there trying to sell the fishing rod and the client will say that maybe he was, that if somebody had offered him £50 he might have sold his fishing rod and that, of course, he was there trying to sell it.  This is ridiculous and as the Minister does not seem to be making any real effort to defend it, I want to put him on notice that I intend to put down an amendment to this effect on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I sit down I would like to refer to a slight problem I have with subsection (3).  In line 25 of subsection (3) there is reference to someone in possession of a rod and line capable of being used for <Col N="1659" /> that purpose at a fishing place.  That is not wide enough and should be amended to read &rdquo;at or in the vicinity of a fishing place&rdquo;.  I intend putting down an amendment on Report Stage in respect of that also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, perhaps, we are devoting too much time to this idea of complication and so on.  Just because a person has a rod or line he should not be immediately presumed to be committing an offence.  This is inserted to make it easier for people like that to say they are trading, which they do &mdash; I saw them last week turning up at places where fishermen were gathered to try to sell their goods, and they are entitled to do that.  I would not, therefore, be inclined to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  It is simply a defence in a certain circumstance.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that the officers of the regional fisheries boards have statutory obligations independent of this legislation.  When the decision to have or not to have a share certificate is taken and published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> it is officially the law and the officers will be requested by the fishery societies to see to it that the law is carried out.  It is a very simple operation.  We consulted the Attorney General about it and he indicated that it was in accordance with normal legal statute.</P>

      <P>I want to explain why the sum of £1,000 was included in the original Bill.  It was put in on legal advice and was drafted as a standard kind of formulation, indicating that a prosecution could be initiated at District Court level only.  It was purely a technical, legal thing.  With the consent of the Attorney General I decided to revert to the alternative wording which I have proposed in my amendment.  This was done in the spirit of the negotiations which we held over the long arduous months when we were trying to put this Bill together.</P>

I think all Members on this side of the House strongly opposed this section on Second Stage.  We were opposed to the exorbitance of the fine and the intolerable penalty it would put on ordinary people who fish.  I welcome the Minister's amendment which proposes that a fine shall not exceed ten times the fee for an annual share certificate. This means that a very nominal fine may be imposed on people &mdash; it may be even less than the fee for an annual share certificate.  This is a move in the right direction.  I am glad that the Minister has had the wisdom to put forward <Col N="1662" /> this amendment as the other fine was totally unacceptable.</P>

    <P>These amendments extend the compensatory provisions applicable to the holders of salmon rather than ordinary licences in 1990 to persons who held composite licences in that year and makes further provision for compensatory measures for persons who take out such licences in 1991.  In other words, the amendments are in relief of salmon anglers.  The latter amendment arises solely from the fact that this Bill was not passed before the end of 1990.  The other amendments are purely drafting amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>17.&mdash;Section 294 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>`(2A)  (a) An appointment shall not be confirmed unless the person concerned has been issued by the appropriate regional board with a certificate of suitability for appointment.</P>
      <P>(b)  An appointment shall be for a period not exceeding five years.</P>
      <P>(c)  Every appointment made before the commencement of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, and in force at the date of the commencement thereof shall expire not later than five years after that date.</P>
      <P>(d)  The form of instrument of appointment set out in the Sixth Schedule to this Act may be modified in conformity with the provisions of this subsection.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 294 of the Fisheries Conservation Act, 1959, provides for the appointment of individuals as private water keepers purely on the basis of applications by the persons concerned to a district justice. This process can be undergone without any consultation with the fishery boards in the area and has, I am told, given rise to situations where unsuitable persons have been appointed as water keepers which confers on them considerable power and authority under the Fisheries Acts.  Another important aspect is that there is no time limit on such appointments. In order to tighten up this provision my amendment proposes that it should be necessary for an applicant for <Col N="1666" /> this form of appointment to hold a certificate on suitability issued by the Regional Fisheries Board and that there should be a time limit for five years on the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>In 1987 my concern at the activities of unscrupulous moneylenders, in all parts of the country, prompted me to arrange for the Combat Poverty Agency to undertake a detailed study of this problem. In the light of the agency's findings the Government published an action plan to deal with the issues highlighted in their report.  A central aspect of that plan provided for the establishment of a revolving loan guarantee fund which could be used to assist those who found themselves in debt to moneylenders.  Proposals for the operation of this fund were presented to me in November 1989 by a supervisory committee which I established to examine how best the fund could be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the loan guarantee fund, which is administered on a day-to-day basis by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in co-operation with the credit union movement, is to break the client's reliance on expensive credit and to help families to escape from a self-perpetuating cycle of high-cost debt by introducing them to acceptable sources of low-interest credit.  More than 650 families have been assisted to date.  Over 350 families have been assisted under the loan <Col N="1671" /> guarantee fund.  Some £220,000 has already been drawn down from the fund with the average loan being between £1,000 and £1,500.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul have also assisted a further 300 other families to overcome debt problems by arranging credit union loans for them.  In addition hundreds of families have received advice on debt and money management.  Over 11,000 families have also benefited from the home management and personal development courses which has been financially supported by my Department.</P>
    <P>A review of the loan guarantee fund will be undertaken shortly within my Department in consultation with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the credit union movement.  Any changes necessary to improve the effectiveness of the operation of the fund will be made in the light of this review.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the great numbers of moneylenders, many of them legal, now operating even in the smallest rural towns? Heretofore we had understood that this problem was associated with large centres of population.  This has now come down to very small rural villages and provincial towns.  Is the Minister happy with the results to date of his endeavours to put a stop to this?  Would he tell the House what he thinks of moneylenders who charge exorbitant rates of interest &mdash; up to 39 per cent &mdash; on loans for such items as Confirmation and First Communion outfits?  As I said, I am referring here to legal moneylenders, but is he aware that those moneylenders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I wish to inform the House that a fund is now in operation in Dublin, Waterford, Tipperary, Galway, Cork, Laois, Limerick, Cavan, Kildare, Mullingar and Kerry &mdash; in those areas where the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the credit unions are working.  The society have asked me not to push them too quickly as a substantial number of demands will be made.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rate of interest mentioned by the Deputy, 39 per cent, that is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Justice. The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently pointed out that legislation will be introduced to allow us comply with the EC Directive on consumer credit.  Preparation of that legislation is well under way.  The question of a 39 per cent limit will have to be addressed in that legislation.</P>

Despite what some people may think it is not easy to find a remedy for this problem which as the Deputy is aware, is a difficult one.  Approximately 1,000 families have been helped directly as distinct from the number of families who have been helped in a general way. Money advice centres have been set up in <Col N="1673" /> a number of areas.  The system of support and assistance is being developed but we should not mislead ourselves into thinking that this problem can be resolved overnight.

      <Quest>if, in view of (1) the increasing concern over the Government's decision to reduce the level of social welfare payments for cohabiting couples to that of married couples, (2) the fact that this will reduce the income of many people living on or below the poverty line and (3) the fact that this will force many people to misrepresent their domestic circumstances in order to protect their standard of living, he will reconsider his decision to cut such social welfare payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, provided for the changes necessary to introduce equality of treatment between men and women in matters of social security in accordance with EC Directive 79/7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the basic principles of the 1985 Act was that unemployment assistance payments should continue to be provided on the basis of the needs of the household. Consequently, the 1985 Act provided that where both of a married couple were entitled to unemployment assistance or where one of the couple was entitled to assistance and the other was entitled to a social insurance payment or old age pension, the overall amount payable would be limited to that which <Col N="1674" /> they would receive if only one of the couple claimed and received an increase in respect of his or her spouse as an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>Following a Supreme Court decision in 1989, the Government introduced the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1989, to ensure that married couples were not treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  The effect of this legislation was to extend the rules which applied to married couples to cohabiting couples.</P>
    <P>Certain other provisions within the existing code which were identified as involving less favourable treatment of married than of cohabiting couples were amended in the Social Welfare Act, 1991, so as to provide for a non-discriminatory method of dealing with the payments in question.  One of the effects of these changes was to confer entitlement to cohabiting couples under the family income supplement scheme from which, in certain, circumstances they were previously excluded.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision which found provisions of the equal treatment legislation to be in conflict with the Constitution raises the whole question of the treatment of different household situations within the social welfare code. In view of the complexity of the issues involved, the Government established an independent review group to examine the social welfare code as it affects households with particular regard to the equal treatment provisions and the requirements in relation to the treatment of married couples arising from the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The group have now completed their review of the present arrangements and I expect to receive their report shortly. In keeping with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the report will be discussed with appropriate interests.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The free electricity and free natural gas allowance schemes, which are primarily designed to assist elderly persons, living alone, with their heating, cooking and lighting needs, operate on the basis of metered usage for the benefit of persons connected to those services.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme provides assistance to those who are dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to pay for their own heating needs.  A weekly payment of £5 is made for a 26 week period from mid-October to mid-April each year.  In addition, I introduced at the start of the 1990-91 heating season a smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week.  This additional allowance is designed to help low-income households meet the extra costs of using smokeless or low-smoke fuel in those areas of Dublin where bituminous coal has been banned.  Some 74,000 households received the smokeless fuel allowance at a cost of £5.8 million in 1991.  This is in addition to the provision of £29.1 million for the national fuel scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> The free electricity allowance assists pensioners with the costs of heating, lighting and cooking.  Because of the flexibility of electric heating and the variety of appliances available, it is a particularly suitable form of heating for elderly people.  There has not been a demand for the substitution of solid fuel for electricity or natural gas and I have no plans to remove or reduce the level of free electricity allowance, albeit with the substitution of a solid fuel alternative.  The question of increasing the free fuel allowance itself would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many elderly people like the idea of an open fire; indeed, they cherish it.  Having regard to the fact that peat briquettes are considered to be a clean fuel and environmentally friendly, many elderly people have pointed out to me that they cannot understand the reason they are not allowed to use this fuel under the scheme. Given that it is a native fuel and employment is provided in bogs, we would do a great deal of good if we allowed people to use it under the scheme.  I ask the Minister to give us his views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One can purchase any fuel one likes under the free fuel scheme as a free fuel allowance is given.  People may spend that allowance however they wish. The free electricity allowance is operated on the basis of metered usage and there would be no guarantee, if a cash payment was made, that the money would be spent on fuel.  Therefore, an arrangement has been made with the ESB to supply electricity which the Department pay for. Natural gas is also a metered heating facility.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the findings of a survey undertaken by the British Family Policies Studies Centre, which found that child benefit in this country was among the lowest in the EC; if, in the light of these figures, he will increase the level of child benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey to which the Deputy refers was published recently by the British Family Policy Studies Centre. It compares the basic family allowances paid in the 12 EC member states.  This survey indicated that, of the member states who have a benefit scheme, Ireland ranked seventh out of 11 in terms of the level of payment provided for a one-child family.  The survey also reveals that Ireland is among the seven EC countries which recognise the special needs of larger families.</P>
      <P>The author acknowledges that simple comparisons of the level of basic family allowances in different countries do not give a comprehensive picture of support for children because of the considerable differences in social welfare systems in the member states.  She then goes on to point out that several countries, as is the case in Ireland, provide extra child-related payments such as a lone parent's allowance and special grants relating to back-to-school costs.  Families on low income in Ireland are further supported through the family income supplement and by the child related tax exemption which is now £300 for the first and second children in a family and £500 for third and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, the survey fails to take account of the considerable support to families which is afforded by adult and child dependant allowances which are payable in Ireland through social insurance and social assistance schemes generally.  The rates of payment for these allowances have been improved and streamlined in recent years.  For example, <Col N="1678" /> over the period 1987 to 1991, the minimum child dependant allowance has been doubled from £6 per week to £12 per week.</P>
    <P>These extra allowances mean that the actual level of child income support in this country is considerably higher than our basic rate of child benefit suggests, particularly for those families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the special financial pressures faced by families, particularly those on low incomes, and are committed to improving the levels of child income support as resources permit.  The Government intend to build on the progress to date and, under the <i>Programme for Econommic and Social Progress,</i> will provide the level of resources necessary to implement the additional child income support measures recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  This will entail additional expenditure on child income support of some £69 million in 1990 terms over the ten year period of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the statistics are quite shocking particularly for a country like Ireland which places so much emphasis on the family? Mothers in Belgium, for example, get £112 a month more than their Irish mother counterparts with two children. The report highlights this huge disparity that exists in the treatment of children. Why did the Minister this year refuse to increase child benefit schemes while last year he made only such a nominal contribution it would not even pay for the purchase of an apple a week for the mothers of children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is surely aware of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  He cites often enough to me in this House the fact that the commission stressed that additional resources should be provided for those on lower income particularly and for large families on social welfare.  The findings of that research are very clear on where the additonal resources should be targeted.  This <Col N="1679" /> House, over the last three years particularly has been targeting very substantial extra resources to those on the lower incomes so that all those who are dependent on social welfare got substantial increases.  Child benefit was increased of course, at the same time with a particular emphasis on larger families.  The question that one has to face, and which will have to be faced in future in relation to the additional £69 million, is where best at this stage to spend that extra money which is committed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> In that, the question of child benefit will be fully considered, with the emphasis both on the FIS and child related tax exemption which were very substantial this year. Between the child related tax exemptions and child benefit the increase was over £16 million directed to the children of families at work on lower incomes as distinct from those on social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying, in recent years, to streamline the various rates of social welfare payments by reducing the number of different rates of payment which currently exist.  This policy is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  Further progress was made in this regard in this year's budget.  There are currently two different basic rates of invalidity pension &mdash; £54.10 for people under 66 and £55.10 for people over 66.  From next July, these will be replaced with a single rate of £56.40.</P>
      <P>The new rate of £56.40 is above the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  It is not means-tested, so there is no reduction in the rate if the claimant has other income. In addition, invalidity pensioners are entitled to a range of valuable fringe benefits, such as free fuel, free electricity allowances and free travel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 22, 32, 34 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance, which I introduced last year, provides a direct payment to people on low incomes who provide full-time care and attention for incapacitated social welfare pensioners. The allowance is payable to people who are providing full-time care and attention to social welfare pensioners aged 66 years or over or to recipients of invalidity pension or blind pension regardless of their age.  I am happy to say that I will be extending the scheme in July next to cover carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance and of persons getting a pension from another member state of the EC or from a country with whom Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.  In addition to the extension, the maximum weekly personal rate is being increased from £45 to £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the scheme was launched my Department have received 5,094 applications for the allowance.  The total number of persons currently in receipt of the allowance is 3,206.  The estimated cost of the allowance to the end of March is £1.3 million.  The estimate for this year as a whole is £7.8 million.  Current claim <Col N="1682" /> trends indicate that almost 30 per cent of applicants who have not been awarded a carer's allowance are in receipt of another social welfare payment at a higher rate.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is the first step in recognising the situation of carers on low incomes and providing them with income maintenance arrangements.  I am aware that some carers with comparatively modest incomes do not qualify for the allowance or receive a partial payment owing to the application of the means test.  I am reviewing the means test arrangements at present to see, within the resources available to me, what improvements can be made in this regard.</P>
    <P>The scheme is specifically designed for carers on low incomes who are providing full-time care and attention and who are residing with the pensioner.  Any extension of the scheme to include carers who are providing occasional or partial care would have substantial cost implications. The question of removing the means test would also have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the fact that only 3,206 persons have qualified for any payment, and many of them would not be on full payment under this scheme, indicates that the scheme is a farce and inoperable? The means testing level of £2 per week is the most severe in any social welfare scheme.  Will the Minister agree that while this is a first step in the right direction the hype about the scheme has led to many false hopes and expectations? Would he not agree that the best thing for the patient, for the State and for the family, is the removal of means testing and the application of taxation to the payment to redirect it to areas where it is most needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made very clear at the outset that this was a means tested scheme intended for people on low incomes.  That was stated in the advertisements and was part of every statement <Col N="1683" /> we made about the scheme.  The rate of takeup is increasing all the time.  It is a totally new scheme and we will shortly have a fair indication of how it is going generally.  I am reviewing the scheme and the means testing arrangements.  The question of revising social welfare means test generally is being examined.  Regarding taxation, allowances are paid under the taxation system.  Perhaps the Deputy should look at those from a tax point of view rather than this scheme, which is a social welfare carer's payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Minister has been contacted by groups of carers and by an association of carers who are offering evidence that worthy applicants are being excluded from the scheme by demands placed on them, particularly in relation to means testing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that in my original reply.  I am aware that there are people who are worthy in the sense that they are giving great care and who are in receipt of incomes which are not very high.  That raises the question of how much further one can extend the scheme by raising the means test level.  From the beginning of July we are introducing the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>Most of the representations which have been made to me have been concerned with this category, that is, people with no income or very little income who are looking after people in receipt of DPMA. In objective terms they are the next category to be looked after.  Subsequently we can consider going further.  In the meantime I am looking at the means tests to see if any marginal changes would bring a reasonable number of people within the scheme.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister agree that the method of assessment is gravely offensive for many women looking after elderly relatives at home who find themselves assessed as having half their husband's income?  This is a way out of giving people an allowance to which they should be entitled.  The DPMA allowance will be useless to a woman I know looking after two disabled persons whose husband has an income of £80.  She will be assessed as having an income of £40 per week and the State will cash in on her generosity in looking after the elderly while they could be in hospital.</P>

      <P>My first priority is to look after people on the lowest incomes.  We have had a debate on the Estimates for the year and a budget debate.  I am distributing £7.8 million in accordance with my ministerial responsibility.  To consider <Col N="1685" /> the people who might benefit from an allowance if such were available is a much wider question.  It was always desirable but nothing was done.  This is a first and very valuable step in this area.  Anyone in Opposition who has been on the Government benches in the past will realise that the sum of £7.8 million represents a substantial commitment.  The experience gained in this area will provide evidence in relation to the wider question.  There are other approaches that could be taken by health boards in relation to specified people who might be provided for without going into hospital. It is done in certain ways by the health boards at present.  Deputies are suggesting that it should be done in other ways.  The Minister for Finance also makes provision for such care.  We intend to develop this scheme to include carers of recipients of DPMA.  We will see how much further we can go with regard to means tests, within the resources available. The much wider questions which have been raised are budgetary matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he and his Department are treating people in a very cruel manner? When introducing the carer's allowance the Minister said in the House he believed there would be 8,000 recipients.  The projected figures today are worse than those given last year.  We are told 2,500 people are in receipt of the allowance and a grand total of 12,000 carers who applied have been rejected.</P>
      <P>I contend that the person involved should not have to be solely resident with the person requiring the care and that the term &ldquo;pensioner&rdquo; should be excluded. That would vastly improve conditions as was clearly the original intention. Removing the residential obligation on the carer in addition to removing the term &ldquo;pensioner&rdquo;, would render everybody requiring this type of attention entitled to receive a relatively small amount of money.</P>

      <P>Every suggestion advanced here would entail a widening of the allowance.  As Members know, there was a prescribed relative's allowance which I managed to have converted into a carer's allowance for social welfare purposes.  I must stress that the estimate is for the year as a whole.  We shall have to ascertain the relevant numbers and how the spending goes over the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne raised another question, that of bringing people who are not resident in the home into eligibility.  If one goes beyond the immediate, say, granny flat arrangement, or some such arrangement, one is going very much beyond the provisions of the scheme and those for whom it was designed to cater; it would entail a big extension of its provisions. The question of people within close proximity, of the household whom the Deputy or I might regard as being there but who might not technically be regarded as being in the household, is something I shall have examined within the review. The Deputy must bear in mind that I do not want to create wild expectations because, going further out into the community, would entail a very substantial extension of the provisions of the scheme. That is a budgetary matter to be decided by Government at a later stage when we have had experience of the operations of the scheme and when the Department of Health will have decided what they want to do.</P>

Is he aware that many people in receipt of social welfare benefit who care for the <Col N="1687" /> elderly, are at present terror-stricken because, not alone do they discover they are not entitled to the carer's allowance, but there is an actual reduction effected, on assessment of their means with regard to such benefits as unemployment assistance and so on?

      <P>We discover with any scheme we introduce that its provisions can result in the revision of the means of an individual &mdash; if they are means-tested &mdash; which can give rise to means being disclosed which had not been heretofore. Indirectly that can have an effect and will apply in some limited cases.  That is not a function of the operations of the new scheme and is a reflection of the fact that means had not been disclosed though they had increased in the meantime. There is an obligation to disclose such means.  Of course, I accept that that can happen.</P>

When the Minister signed the requisite regulations for this scheme he announced that £10 million would be made available whereas £7 million only has been made available.  In addition, he announced that 10,000 people would qualify whereas 3,000 only have done so. The Minister has qualified everything he has said by the overriding consideration encapsulated in the phrase &ldquo;within the resources available&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the lone parents allowance scheme is to provide an income to parents who have to look after their children on their own and who as a result are unavailable for employment.  Before the introduction of this scheme the needs of lone parents were catered for by six different schemes under social assistance which differentiated between such parents on the basis of the cause of the lone parenthood and on whether the parent was male or female.  The new scheme streamlined all existing social assistance payments for lone parents and extended provision for lone parents under social assistance to separated spouses, unmarried fathers and prisoners' husbands.  It represents a significant milestone in the development of non-discriminatory social welfare provision for lone parents who are unable to provide for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion by the Deputy that the means test in respect of male applicants only for lone parents allowance be removed would reintroduce discrimination in this area, in this instance against women.  It would also result in many men qualifying for an allowance who have sufficient income from employment or other sources to maintain their families without any assistance from social assistance schemes which are financed directly by taxpayers.  It would <Col N="1692" /> also represent a major departure from the principle of social insurance whereby entitlement to non-means tested social welfare benefits is conditional on the payment of PRSI contributions.  For these reasons I am opposed to the Deputy's suggestion.</P>
    <P>I do acknowledge, however, that there is unequal treatment of men and women under social insurance in the event of widowhood or desertion.  This issue is being examined by the National Pensions Board with a view to bringing forward proposals for the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in this whole area.  The board's final report is due to be completed shortly and I will be giving priority to the board's recommendation on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my reply that under the insurance system there is a deserted wife's payment and a widow's payment; that does not apply on the insurance side for men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I would remove the means test in respect of male applicants for lone parents' allowance. We have brought in a scheme right across the board, for men &mdash; widowers, deserted husbands and separated husbands. They are now eligible for that allowance scheme.  That was a major change and development in our system on the means test allowance side.  The issue of the insurance is separate and is a major question financially that will have to be considered in the near future, first, in the context of the report of the National Pensions Board &mdash; we are well up to date in getting our homework done <Col N="1693" /> in that area &mdash; and, secondly, in relation to developments within the EC.</P>

      <P>Why does it take so long for an assessment to be made on a lone parent's application for benefit as opposed to all the other schemes, <i>vis-à-vis</i> deserted wives, etc.  From people who contact me my understanding is that it takes a considerable period from the time the application is made until the benefit is actually received.  I understood, that, because it is a lone parent's allowance, it would be much easier for the Minister's staff to decide on an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a question down elsewhere on that issue.  I could get the reference material from that question if the Deputy wishes.  The position is that since November we have improved the whole system.  The introduction of the lone parent's allowance scheme does away with the question of having to prove desertion which resulted in the big delay, but a social welfare officer still has to establish means.  The allowance is being received much faster than previously because of the change.  We have made some administrative changes also which result in earlier decisions to get the payment made earlier.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it would be desirable to introduce a change which would bring about equality in that a payment similar to that paid to deserted wives should be available to deserted husbands, because both are equal in the sense that if they have to go to work they may require somebody to look after their children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to equal treatment in these areas as directed by the EC.  The Deputy will be aware of what <Col N="1694" /> happened previously when the equal treatment provisions were implemented, as the Opposition were in Government at that time.  There were enormous difficulties, and there are still difficulties, in the courts in relation to that whole area. One of the major problems is cost.  There has been a great deal of delay in implementing the EC Directive because it has not been decided in this country or in the other member states how it will be done.</P>
      <P>We have taken legislative action in relation to occupational pensions.  Again, the area of equal treatment is being improved.  However that is the one area that will have to be addressed, but how it can be addressed is a major problem. The report of the pensions board which will be available by the time Deputies come back after the summer recess &mdash; it should be available sometime in mid-summer &mdash; hopefully, will throw much light on that issue and indicate where we will go from there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A person resident in Ireland and in receipt of an overseas pension could qualify for non-contributory old age pension subject to satisfying the means test. Where the overseas pension is from another EC member state or from a country with which Ireland has a reciprocal <Col N="1695" /> agreement on social security, the person would now be entitled in any event to the free electricity and other allowances which apply to Irish pensioners.</P>
    <P>Under the means test arrangements a single person can have means of up to £6 a week and qualify for the maximum rate of non-contributory pension, with the rate being reduced proportionately where means exceed £6.  The basic rate of UK retirement pension is £52 sterling per week or £57.14 in Irish punts.  The basic rate of non-contributory old age pension here is £53 at present increasing to £55 from July.</P>
    <P>To exempt for means purposes any part of a pension payable by the UK or any other country in the case of claims for the old age non-contributory pension, as suggested by the Deputy, would give the people concerned an advantage over other claimants for this pension, who had a weekly cash income, unless similar exemption was extended to all forms of such income.  Any such exemption would also have implications for people in receipt of contributory pensions under the social insurance system.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I acknowledge that ancillary benefits such as free electricity are valuable components to making the lives of the elderly more tolerable.  Is the Minister aware that thousands of returned emigrants, who have worked hard all their lives in other countries, who will spend their final years here and bring valuable foreign currency &mdash; in this case sterling &mdash; to this country, are penalised on every penny they earn over and above the basic exemption of £6 per week?  In most cases they would have a small nest egg.  These people are due special consideration.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy realises that if we were to do that other people would also have to be catered for.  In relation to emigrants, we have extended the benefits to EC pensioners generally.  That is something the Deputy was concerned about earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> We have also extended those benefits to pensioners from other countries who will enter into a bilateral agreement with us.  Of course, that means that the bilateral agreement has to be completed before it comes into operation.  We have signed agreements with Austria, Canada and recently with Australia.  Before the end of this year I hope we will sign an agreement with the United States of America as a result of which many people would be entitled to extra benefits. However, the means exemption limits would have to apply to the whole population.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the Minister has problems in relation to equity, however does the Minister not acknowledge that every 1,000 pensioners who return from the UK are worth £2.5 million in net terms to the Irish economy and that attracting the emigrants home is a good economic and social exercise? One of our problems is that we do not have population growth and, therefore, we do not have an increasing number of consumers.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the problem but there are the difficulties I have already mentioned.  In many ways, I am paving the way for people who wish to come back.  One of the things I discovered when I was in Australia was that some of the people who went out in the fifties are not quite as well off as one might have expected while others, of course, have done very well.  Some are anxious to come home and are very anxious to avail of the arrangements we are making currently.  That is happening in a number of other countries as well.</P>
      <P>On the whole, we provide reasonably well for elderly people in Ireland in spite of what had been said earlier on other matters.  The fact that the extra benefits are provided for people returning not only from the European Community but from outside it is a very big improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The report gave recognition to the range of measures introduced by this Government in response to the situation of the unemployed.  These include the scheme to provide educational opportunities for the unemployed and the part-time job incentive scheme.  The report also recognised the role of social support in buffering people from the full effects of stress.  Here, too, the Government have been active through their aid for the activities of voluntary and community groups.  This year I am providing £2.34 million in grants to voluntary and community groups.</P>
      <P>We have taken unprecendented steps to raise the incomes of the unemployed. During the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the personal rate of unemployment assistance was increased by some 11 per cent in each of three successive years.  As a result the rate for a husband with a wife and three dependent children will be £124 per week from the end of July this year.  In the recent budget we announced that the short term unemployment assistance rate is to rise by 11 per cent from July, while the long term rate was increased by almost 6 per cent, both well above the rate of inflation, 2.6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to continue to protect social welfare rates against inflation and to move by 1993 to the priority level of social welfare rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Thereafter, the Government are committed to increase social welfare rates further and <Col N="1698" /> progressively, in accordance with the recommendations of the commission, as the resources of the economy grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably agree that the survey he mentioned makes extremely sad reading particularly in the light of the unemployment figures over the last three consecutive months. The grinding consequence of poverty facing so many of our citizens is creating a far sicker society than we should tolerate. Given that the Minister is not directly responsible for job creation, although he is a member of the Cabinet which has direct responsibility for it, will the Minister implement a recommendation in the report to guarantee substantial social welfare increase in line with that recommended by the Commission for Social Welfare and increase the miserable supplementary welfare allowance of £50 per week to at least £63 which would help keep these people out of psychiatric hospitals and from the type of destructive activities which we see in our cities every day of the week?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will know we have been making progress in that area continuously and we plan to continue with that process.  In fact, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> outlines the targets to be achieved in that respect.  On the question of stress and psychological problems associated with unemployment, the best solution, of course, is to get a job or a position of some sort.  The number of people at work is still increasing but as Deputies will know quite a few people are coming home from abroad which affects the number on the live register.</P>
      <P>We are involved in a number of initiatives around the country to involve people in activities at community level. In fact, we have a strategy for providing employment on a local basis.  I will do anything I can to provide the environment to create both work and involvement in community developments.</P>

Why have the Government given a very low priority to the social employment scheme throughout the country?  In fact, the moneys made available have been reduced.  Would the Minister not agree that this would be an ideal opportunity to help local communities to do things which they could never afford otherwise, while at the same time providing people with an outlet for their energies by working?  Is it not better to pay them to work rather than to pay them social welfare?</P>

Through the Jobsearch programme a number of places on schemes were made available specifically to the long term unemployed, which was part of our strategy.  My recollection, although I am not the Minister concerned, is that the total amount of money made available for social employment schemes in the Estimate was increased this year but we increased the rate of payment to individuals and of course the cost of materials has increased.</P>

Is the Minister not conscious of the daily muggings and the crime rate in our inner cities due to alienation?  There are massive complexes with 70 to 80 per cent of people on unemployment assistance and low incomes. The targeting he is talking about has not happened.  There are flat complexes with as many as 300 families who have not got the most simple community facilities available to them.

      <P>There are 51 employment exchanges throughout the country which are staffed by full-time civil servants who are recruited by the Civil Service Commission in the normal way.  The employment exchanges are administered directly by my Department.  Deputies are no doubt aware that the standard of employment exchange accommodation has greatly improved over recent years and I am determined that the quality of my Department's public offices be improved where necessary and maintained at a high standard.  The improvements that have occurred have, of course, cost a considerable amount of money.  By the end of this year my Department will have spent, since 1987, some £12 million on <Col N="1702" /> the construction of new local offices and refurbishment of existing offices.</P>
      <P>In relation to this matter generally, the Deputy will appreciate that the increase in the live register in recent times will have imposed an additional burden on the accommodation provided in all local offices.</P>
      <P>In addition to employment exchanges, there are also 79 branch employment offices which are run by branch managers. They are employed under a contract for service which, among other things, requires them to provide suitable premises.  The recruitment and appointment of staff in branch employment offices is a matter for each branch manager. My Department have no function in this process other than to ensure that prospective employees are suitable for employment in such offices.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the facilities at the majority of the branch employment offices are of a reasonable and acceptable standard.  I am aware that there are a number of offices where improvements are required.  At my request my Department have undertaken an examination of branch office premises where improvements appear necessary and discussions are underway with the branch managers in question.  I am satisfied from the response to date from branch managers that such improvements will take place on a mutually agreed basis.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 55:</P>
    <P>In page 8, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;This Act shall not come into effect until such time as the rules for <Col N="1750" /> the regulations of societies in accordance with section 5 (1) have been published and agreed with the regional fisheries boards and the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Garland.)</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, this amendment would put a new section 17 into the Bill which would have the effect of deferring the effective date of this legislation until such time as the rules for the regulation of societies, as provided for by section 5, have been published and agreed with the regional fisheries boards and the Minister. The last time we discussed this Bill, last month, we had a very long and heated debate on the question of the rules of the societies and a great deal of dissatisfaction was expressed on this side of the House in regard to the rules and to the fact that they had not yet been drawn up and agreed with the fisheries boards and the angling interests.  The fairness of this Bill stands or falls very largely on the detailed rules of the societies.  All Members on this side of the House are still very dissatisfied in this regard and the only way of dealing with the matter at this stage is by this amendment which would effectively defer the implementation of the Bill until the rules have been agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Garland.  Section 5 deals with the rules of the society and very clearly states that additional rules and regulations may be introduced by the Minister in conjunction with the societies and fisheries boards.  It is well not to operate in a vacuum and legislation cannot come into effect until the rules and regulations of operation are drafted.  As we do not know what the rules and regulations are it would be contrary to the spirit of the legislation to implement the Bill without them.  Possibly a problem in relation to legislation is the number of rules and regulations, apart from those implemented in this House, which are very much a feature of legislation going through the House.  I am not sure that in <Col N="1751" /> all instances it is satisfactory.  It is important to have rules but flexibility is also important and societies should be in a position to operate without too much consultation with the Minister.  The fact that the Minister has such a strong voice in relation to the rules of the societies takes from the societies the whole spirit of co-operation and basic principle of co-operatives.</P>
      <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Garland deserves consideration.  I presume the Minister will not implement the Bill until the necessary rules and regulations are in place.  Perhaps he will give us an assurance in the House that that is what he proposes to do and that the Bill will not come into effect until then?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section appears to be a last shot at trying to put sense into the Bill.  There has been controversy regarding each section because of ignorance of the rules and regulations which were being laid down. Obviously someone, somewhere, knows the rules, there must be a draft available but it seems incredible that we are now passing legislation governing co-operatives, societies and angling clubs without knowing what rules will be imposed.  Will an opportunity be afforded to people directly involved to assess the rules and make recommendations?  When will the rules be formalised?  People outside cannot make sense of the Bill because they are in ignorance of the rules by which they will be governed.  The amendment is reasonable and I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that one of the arguments in relation to the Bill is that we do not know who will govern the co-operatives and what their relationship is to the fishery boards.  That is a very important factor in this legislation because there appears to be a division between the fishery boards and the co-operatives which will be set up.  Will the Minister accept the amendment to accommodate the people who have consistently looked for publication of the rules or a formula which we can show to the people involved?  Perhaps we should <Col N="1752" /> ask for submissions from the fishery boards and the angling interests.  The Minister should give some concession to the people who have tried to tease out the problems governing this legislation, about which I have grave reservations.</P>

      <P>This is a very good amendment dealing with a topic which we discussed in a different way at an earlier Stage of the Bill.  It is a question of rules for societies.  The amendment is very practical because we know that this legislation will not be in place for this year's fishing or tourist season.</P>
      <P>The Bill has to pass through the remaining Stages in this House, go to the Seanad and, very possibly, come back to this House.  At the very earliest this legislation will be in place for 1992 and it is taking a very optimistic view to expect the societies to be in place and so on to give practical effect to it.  The amendment is very practical in that there would be an effective date put on the legislation which would be after the agreement and publication of the rules of the societies.</P>
      <P>Second, the Minister should come clean with this House regarding the rules for the societies.  On a previous occasion here I mentioned that the rules of the societies had not been made available to us and said we should have available to us at least the Minister's thinking about these; otherwise we are passing legislation which enables the Minister himself to make the rules.</P>
      <P>He has attempted to describe the societies as co-operatives.  They are very strange co-operatives indeed that are not being given the right to draw up their own rules.  These rules are being made by the Minister.  Not only are they being made by the Minister but we do not know what rules he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion I expressed my opinion that the Minister did know that the rules were to be, that he had discussed draft rules with persons outside of this House and that he had, at the very least, a fair idea what kind of rules he would make for these societies.  At first he denied that he had anything in mind as <Col N="1753" /> regards rules.  Then he tried to tell us that all he had in mind was the headings which are already contained under section 5. Then, as the debate wore on, we began to get glimpses of some of the rules the Minister had in mind.  I am satisfied that the Minister already has at an advanced stage ideas or drafts of the rules for these societies and he should inform the House what those rules are before this legislation is put into effect.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways of doing it.  One is the way Deputy Garland has suggested.  A second way is that the Minister would come in, circulate the draft rules to Members before Report Stage so that we could, even at that late stage, see what exactly we are legislating for because we really are writing a blank cheque in setting up societies the rules of which we have not been told, even though we know the Minister has a very good idea what the rules will be.  We should be told what those rules will be.  Certainly, I will support Deputy Garland's amendment. It is one very practical way of getting the rules in place before this legislation is given effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment.  Whatever system of co-operatives is set up to replace the soon to be defunct rod licence, it is essential that everybody concerned in this long running dispute should know what the rules are to be.  Yet we are being asked to pass this legislation this evening without knowing what rules will govern the co-operatives or societies that are to be set up to take in share capital to replace rod licence fees.</P>
      <P>Where will these co-operatives be registered?  When co-operatives were first established by Horace Plunkett in 1894 they were all registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, Hume Street.  Will a new registry be formed now that we have this new unique animal of a co-operative to deal with the abolition of the rod licence; or will societies be registered with the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of the Marine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we pointed our earlier, no fewer <Col N="1754" /> than 16 sections of the Bill give the Minister authority to do various things.  That has never happened before in the history of co-operatives, and I speak with a great knowledge of co-operatives having worked all my working life in co-operatives before arriving in this House. Never before has there been legislation giving the Minister the control over co-operatives that this Bill will give the Minister if it is enacted.  Before we finally vote on this Bill this evening it is essential that the principal rules of the co-operative would be spelled out to this House and to the many interested parties.</P>
    <P>Nobody is more aware than the Minister of the hardship and anguish caused by the introduction of the original, unnecessary legislation.  We have spent three and a half years arguing for the abolition of the rod licence.  Let us not be hasty on this occasion and introduce bad legislation, as was done before.  That simply means that the legislation, according to the amendment, should not come into effect until such time as the rules for the regulation of societies in accordance with section 5 (1) of this Bill have been published and agreed with the regional fisheries boards and the Minister.  I would be inclined to include angling interests but I will not quibble on that aspect.  One way or the other, it is essential that the rules governing co-operatives would be set out here before we vote finally on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in putting down this amendment Deputy Garland had the best intentions and he clarified what his thinking was.  We had a long discussion on this already on other sections of the Bill and on Second Stage.  The debate centred on the idea that was promulgated sometimes outside the House that the Minister had too much power under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I embarked on what I could call a positive programme of masochism as far as the Minister was concerned taking out, one after the other, the powers that were objected to in good faith by those who contributed to the debate.  I can assure <Col N="1755" /> Deputy Garland and Deputy Taylor-Quinn that I have no intention of bringing in the rules before there is full consultation.</P>
    <P>In section 5 there is a reasonably detailed account, skeletally, of the rules, in other words, there are parameters and a framework for those rules.  On the earlier occasion when this matter was raised I indicated that I would not finalise the rules until I had discussions with a catholic amalgam of angling interests, and that includes the regional boards.  I also gave an assurance to Deputy Talor-Quinn that I have no intention of naming the commencement date until after that has been finalised.</P>
    <P>We know the parameters and the framework.  As I said, an amalgam of angling interests will be consulted.  If Members of the House, and especially the spokespersons, have strong views about any specific rules I invite them to submit them to me for consideration.  I would welcome contributions from Members of the House and spokespersons in particular.  Any positive suggestions will be treated with the respect they deserve.  As Deputy O'Sullivan rightly said, an attempt was made to tease out the various features of the Bill in the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore was a little pessimistic about the timing.  As I indicated, the quinquennial elections, which are outside the scope of this Bill and in accordance with other legislation, are due to take place during the winter of this year and I intend everything to be in place before then.  The House should be apprised of the fact that these are purely procedural rules.  I made that point already during the debate.  As Deputy Gilmore rightly said, the formulation of the rules is at a very advanced stage.  Section 5 is very detailed and gives a good outline of the parameters which will be used.  The rules are purely procedural and, of course, all the details could not be incorporated in the legislation.  If we were to include all the details in regard to quorums, etc., the Bill would be a yard long.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's invitation to Opposition spokespersons to make submissions to him.  May I invite the Minister to furnish the Opposition spokespersons with a draft of the rules and regulations prior to finalising them?  Perhaps he could have a meeting in his Department with the various spokespersons so that he would know our combined views about this matter.  It is all very well for Opposition spokespersons to furnish their views but it would be much more helpful from the pont of view of the general and common good if we knew from what premise we were operating and the confines on us.  It would be very helpful if all sides of this House could come together and state their views about these rules and regulations and if the Minister could circulate us with a draft of them before they are finalised.  In that way we could either subtract or add to the views put forward by the Minister and he could choose to ignore or accept some of the combined proposals put forward by Members on this side of the House in their wisdom.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the approach adopted by the Minister this afternoon is more conciliatory than the approach he adopted this morning when he felt we were all due a good lecture.  I think he is now beginning to recognise that we&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 5 sets out the rules of societies.  These rules will be fundamental to the operation of the legislation.  Section 5 is one of the most powerful sections of the Bill.  It deals with such matters as the functions of trustees, the membership, the quorum for meetings, ballots, the establishment and management of a development fund and the guidelines for the society in relation to the disbursement of funds.  Therefore, it is important that extensive consultation takes place with all the fishing interests and not just selected fishing interests.  As we know from past mistakes, it is very unwise to ignore some of the various interests in this area.  A wide variety of interests should be consulted, for example, the statutory groups such as the regional fishery boards and the fishery representative bodies.  All of these groups together with Opposition spokespersons should be consulted about this matter.  I hope the Minister sees the wisdom in doing this.  As Deputy McCormack said, the mistake made in 1987 has not been resolved almost four years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a commendable Bill and that is why Fine Gael are strongly opposed to its overall thrust.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Garland would give all interested parties <Col N="1758" /> a greater input into the rules and regulations. I hope the Minister will be generous enough to initiate that deep consultation and circulate Members on this side of the House with the guidelines before they are finalised by him and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The note I made about Deputy McCormacks's contribution escaped my notice.  I apologise for not referring to his points when I was making my closing remarks.  I appreciate the Deputy's knowledge of co-operative societies and the co-operative movement. I should like to claim spiritual brotherhood with the Deputy in that regard as my family were involved very heavily with Plunkett and George Russell &mdash; AE &mdash; in the co-operative movement during the early part of the century.  I appreciate that the Deputy has worked in the system and knows about it.</P>
      <P>The question of registration was raised in the earliest part of the debate by Deputy Gilmore and was well teased out at that time.  I want to repeat that co-operative societies will be registered in the Department of the Marine.  The system is parallel to the system operated by the Registrar of Friendly Societies. The whole structure of co-operative societies is <i>ad idem</i> with the ones with which the Deputy and I are familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>My unease at this section of the Bill has been slightly lessened by the Minister's response. However, this is a complete new departure for co-operatives and we will pass this legislation without knowing exactly what the rules will be.  Under this legislation these co-operatives will be registered in the Department of the Marine. This is a completely new departure from the concept of co-operatives.  For the last 100 years co-operatives were registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies at Hume Street.  We will now have two locations to register co-ops which may lead to duplication and duplicity.  Will one registration office have to check with the other to ensure that the co-operatives cannot have the same name and to ensure <Col N="1759" /> that a grant to a co-operative will not be paid to the wrong co-operative because of similarity of names?</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the innocent rod licence dispute has led to a complicated Bill which in turn will lead to a new society to register co-ops.  This may have repercussions for the co-operative movement beyond what this legislation is trying to achieve, and the Bill complicates matters beyond the subject of this Bill.  I regret that the rod licence could not have been just abolished and we could then have set about collecting fees or contributions in some other manner.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that any dispute shall be referred jointly by the angling clubs and the regional boards concerned to the Minister whose decision shall be final. That is an example of the power the Minister is retaining under this Bill.</P>

      <P>The passage of this Bill has been a frustrating experience for Opposition Deputies.  We are now on the last section and the Minister has thrown <Col N="1760" /> out a little bait, inviting us to make submissions to him.  It is a remarkable invitation, given that during the course of the debate the Minister accepted one relatively small amendment from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>We are on the final section of the Bill and the Minister wants to haul us in, because he wants us to become part of the legislation that will be an appalling failure.  This is one fish that will not rise to the bait.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy McCormack about the registration of the societies, that was debated previously.  I can understand why the Minister is registering these societies in the Department of the Marine.  It is because the Registrar of Friendly Societies would not register those societies as co-operatives because they are not co-operatives.  They do not fulfil the criteria.</P>
      <P>In relation to this amendment on the question of drawing up rules for the societies, the Minister has arrogated this to himself.  Even at this late hour the Minister has not made available to us the draft rules.  Since we are at the invitation stage now, I repeat the invitation made to the Minister from Deputy Taylor-Quinn to let us have the draft rules so that before we come back to Report Stage we will know exactly the full import of the legislation before us.</P>

      <P>People are still suffering from the rancour that developed as a result of the initial legislation which the Minister is now trying to change in this Bill.  This Bill is not a complete answer, by a long shot.  It is a very deficient answer to the difficulties that arose.  We are trying to make the best of a bad lot in assisting the Minister to put together the best form of rules and regulations so that there will be as much freedom as possible and as little bureaucracy as possible.  The Bill is a farce.  The situation is a farce.  The Fianna Fáil Party made a major political error in presenting the legislation in 1987.  I appreciate the Minister's efforts since he became Minister to solve the problem, but as a result of this legislation we still have an unsatisfactory situation.  The Minister would be well advised to circulate the guidelines and regulations he proposes to implement, before this legislation becomes operable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (7) (c), lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;educational and cultural activities&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;educational, cultural and individual and group artistic activities, expositions and performances&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I expressed the view <Col N="1770" /> that as many people as possible should be free to apply to become beneficiaries under this Bill.  I suggested that we should use the opportunity to change from the model of An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cóm-halairte, The Scholarship Exchange Board, to bring a degree of flexibility into the arrangements.  I gave some details as to the manner in which the procedures of the board had worked out in practice.</P>
    <P>My amendment is designed to get around the difficulty which arises when a programme does not exist in a receiving institution, either in Ireland or America, to which a scholar may wish to go.  It enables flexibility.  Often people who are involved in cultural or literary activities or performances are not affiliated to a programme or an institution, yet their work may be of such individual merit and importance that they may like at short notice to move to an institution which wants them to exhibit, perform or participate in seminars, workshops and so on.  The wording I am proposing would also include groups of artists such as the Sculptors' Association of Ireland or Poetry Ireland or a group of visual artists. The word &ldquo;expositions&rdquo; takes account of particular kinds of exhibition.  The inclusion of the word &ldquo;performances&rdquo; might allow, for example, an Irish competitor in the GPA Pianoforte Competition to be included in the programme.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to improve the position in such a way as not automatically to give money but to word the terms of reference of the commission so that people would not be precluded from the beginning.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  It would be far more satisfactory than the wording as drafted. The killer in the existing subsection is the word &ldquo;programmes&rdquo;.  I do not believe that the case I have put forward is met by such phrases as &ldquo;other related educational and cultural activities as may be provided for in budgets approved in accordance with section 8&rdquo;.  Under the existing wording the individual who would benefit is seen as a derivative from the programme rather than the other way <Col N="1771" /> round; the programme should be responding to the person who can either gain or make a contribution or both.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiment behind Deputy Higgins's amendment. The whole area of academic research, cultural activity and endeavour has changed dramatically since 1957 when the first scholarship fund was set up.  At that stage clearly there were very few individuals, or groups of individuals, in these fields, as it were, working in an independent manner.  But over the past ten years, with the growth in understanding of development of our arts and cultural activities, as Deputy Michael Higgins has said, there are now very many more people working independently of our institutions, universities and colleges.  I fear that the provisions of this Bill would not take on board those kinds of changes that have taken place within our academic and cultural fields.</P>
      <P>The people for whom the provisions of the Bill are intended are already quite an élite group, the cream of our academic and cultural people.  I would be fearful as is Deputy Higgins, that we would render them even more élite by excluding some people who may have decided, as it were, to plough their own furrows in that area in a more independent manner rather than be linked to a university or college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, Deputy Higgins's amendment might encompass say, somebody who might engage in photography, now a very fine form of art, a fine form of cultural and sociological study, in that photographic exhibitions can tell a thousand stories.  We know that there was discovered recently a set of photographs taken by a Fr. Browne which comprise enormous background studies into the growth and social changes that took place in this country.  Therefore, it would be beneficial if a person who undertook such work could apply, as an individual, and be considered for the awarding of a scholarship. Of course some such person, maybe working in an attic having no linkage with any university or college, might <Col N="1772" /> be unable to break into what is already a very élitist group.</P>
    <P>I do not believe acceptance of this amendment would extend the provisions of the Bill so widely that people would be turned down hand over fist.  Since the introduction of this Bill has been awaited since 1988 when the agreement was signed by the United States and Ireland, this amendment might also afford the new commission greater flexibility.  Once established the commission members themselves may approach the Minister to make this kind of change if they find they are receiving applications from very fine, qualified people who would do this country enormous credit and, equally, from Americans who would be of tremendous benefit to us here.  The members of the commission themselves might find their hands were tied if we did not introduce greater flexibility in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that the Minister would find it possible to accede to my colleague's amendment which would be a very useful addition to the objectives of the Bill.  If the Minister tells us, for example, that that is understood within this section, we will take that as being on the record and meeting Deputy Higgins's objectives seeking to expand the provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>Now that there is some little cultural activity elsewhere in this city I should like to ask the Minister whether universities and colleges, noted for their sporting activities, will be included under the provisions of this Bill.  I would remind him that many young Irish people, if you like, &ldquo;one-offs&rdquo; in their particular fields of sport, are particularly in demand in American universities but do not often get a chance to attend because of the financial constraints on their parents. Perhaps the Minister would inform us whether such students would be afforded the possibility of attending such universities while, at the same time, advancing their academic studies.  I would suggest that such students in the sporting field be included in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins's amendment has <Col N="1773" /> merit.  I know the Minister of State present always accepts any reasonable proposition.  In this case I would hope he would find his way to accepting Deputy Higgins's amendment or, alternatively, inform us that its objectives are covered already in this section.</P>

      <P>I would have no real objection to the thinking behind Deputy Michael Higgins's amendment.  Nonetheless, I do not honestly think there is any need for it.  As the Deputy knows, the Bill has been prepared in conjunction with the agreement signed in October 1988 with many of the phrases included in the Bill having been taken from the actual agreement, which would cause me some difficulty.</P>
      <P>I will revert to some things Deputy Kavanagh said later.  May I assure Deputies Higgins and Owen that the artistic and cultural element, about which Deputy Higgins spoke, is already a feature of the programme which has obtained since 1957 and was included in the 1957 Act.  I might also assure them that a number of grants have been awarded annually in the visual and performing arts areas about which Deputy Higgins was particularly worried.  There has been provision for the continuance and expansion of that cultural element in this Bill.  Therefore, Deputy Higgins's fears are ill founded in that the wording in the Bill has been taken from the agreement.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Kavanagh's question concerning people particularly talented in the sporting field, I do not think they are covered.  I do not know of any such example in that area.</P>
      <P>This programme has been devised mainly for post-graduate students or people with certain outstanding skills &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; advisedly. Deputy Owen said that a number of applicants under this programme are very highly qualified, which is the case.  It is a question of using students' experience of America here, benefiting therefrom and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would have no objection to accepting this amendment in the normal <Col N="1774" /> way, Deputy Higgins can take my word for it that what he seeks is already covered in the section.</P>

      <P>I awaited the Minister's response to Deputy Michael Higgins's amendment before intervening.  I feared he might contend that the objective of his amendment was catered for already in the Bill.  He has gone further and said that this has already taken place. I was not aware of that fact.  I do not know whether Members of the House are aware of what had taken place under the Scholarship Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1957 &mdash; which we are now repealing &mdash; under which Act I understand the Minister has said the performing arts were covered.  I should like the Minister to give us concrete examples.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in Deputy Higgins's amendment in that it appeared to me to be something which would divorce the whole educational exchange from the &ldquo;academia&rdquo; by which it was surrounded before, bringing it into the public gaze, so that people would be aware of what is happening.  There is the danger &mdash; when excellent educational exchanges or scholarships take place for some very worthy motive &mdash; that one never hears about them, the public may not be aware of them.  There would be greater participation in such a programme if there was greater knowledge of what is happening, when public performances or expositions &mdash; referred to in Deputy Higgins's amendment &mdash; would highlight the whole educational exchange idea thereby generating greater participation. Perhaps the Minister does not want greater participation because it might entail more money.  On Second Stage, I asked what money we were putting into the programme.  I have not heard of any being injected by this Government. If he is worried about the exchange developing to such an extent that it would cost the State much money he should tell us that.  Section 2 (7) (f) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>financing such other related educational and cultural programmes.... <Col N="1775" /> as may be provided for in budgets approved in accordance with section 8 of this Act.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is worried about the financing of these exchanges, particularly the type Deputy Higgins has proposed in his amendment, he should say that is a problem and that there would not be sufficient money for it.  It is much better to have in the Bill, even if the Minister wants to leave in the existing wording, some part of Deputy Higgins's amendment in brackets such as, &ldquo;individual and group artistic activities, expositions and performances&rdquo; so that the board and the Commission would be aware when they are set up that this was discussed, that these specific ideas were put forward and that they are expected to do that.  It would be better if the wording, as proposed in this amendment, was included in Bill.</P>

Deputies Mac Giolla and Higgins asked if a freelance artist got a grant towards furthering her interest in painting.  A student in the University of Ulster also received a grant for painting.  Under existing legislation, of which the Bill is in many ways a copy, the points raised and the doubts and fears expressed by Deputy Higgins &mdash; and <Col N="1776" /> rightly so &mdash; have been covered.  That is why I said I would have no objection to the inclusion of Deputy Higgins's amendment if it was not adequately covered and the wording has been taken from the agreement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State is anxious to respond to my point and I certainly am influenced by that.  I want to make a couple of brief points by way of clarification.  I note he is putting on the record that the wording I have suggested is to be incorporated in any reasonable interpretation of the Bill. The reason I went for the conservative view is that it is better to stitch points in legislation rather than put them in minimally. The agreement is an agreement between two parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Between two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Between two parties or two countries, the United States and Ireland.  In the case of one the main flow of personnel is coming through the Fulbright scheme.  What we have to bear in mind in the legislation, therefore, is that while it has to enshrine the agreement it can mirror the agreement, or, can be a place where the agreement lodges; in other words, that the legislation can be that bit wider if necessary.  Why I argued in favour of the amendment, and why I would argue that it would be better legislation, was to take account of the fact that from the Irish side we have more to gain from not being narrowly linked to the Fulbright criteria than has the United States.  I will give an example because I do not want to be abstract about it or to delay and be tedious about my amendment. In the case of Ireland in a discipline <Col N="1777" /> such as writing, the average Irish playwright, the average Irish poet or the average Irish painter is almost unlikely to be affiliated to an institute of higher learning whereas in the United States the poet is likely to be a writer in residence, the playwright is likely to be in a drama department, artists are likely to be in a department of fine art and so on.</P>
      <P>In our legislation which is directed for the benefit of our citizens we have to be careful to take cognisance of what the position is in relation to the arts.  It is not as easy as the Minister of State said. For example, the manner in which the Fulbright scheme operates is that if somebody who is a political scientist is seeking to go to Ireland on a Fulbright scheme they have to find a slot in an institution in Ireland.  While it is good at that level where there is a parallel of arrangements between institutions here and the other party to the agreement, the United States, it is looser at the other side because it is much more public and separate from institutions in the Irish case in relation to the arts.  I can tell the Minister that it would create no difficulty if he accepted the wording in the amendment because he can accomplish his agreement within it, but, at the same time, his words would want to be ones of deep commitment to ensure that nobody is put off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which is important. When we come in a later section to the composition of the commission's representatives, they are more likely to represent institutions of higher learning and artistic performance than the free unaffiliated artist, writer and so on and yet there is a growing demand for such a person.  Here is the crux with which the Minister will have to deal.  If a distinguished playwright such as Tom Murphy, who would be welcome in any institution in the United States, wanted, separate from any institution in the United States, to go to New York and have a workshop he would, under the existing scheme, find more difficulty than if he was going to a place that had been set aside for him in a university.  In sending his form applying for the grant he would be asked which institution had <Col N="1778" /> accepted him.  The nub of the matter is that the new arrangements can retain everything the old scheme was doing but create an atmosphere of flexibility.  That was the case for the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to try to reassure Deputy Higgins.  He referred to Tom Murphy, a very distinguished playwright. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a person like Mr. Murphy, or anybody else the commission felt had the expertise, from going to the United States to give such an exhibition.  Generally, as the Deputy said, this goes from institution to institution.  I would like to return to the case where a freelance artist has been awarded a grant.  That should reassure the House that, in the words of Deputy Owen, a person such as that is not precluded. I ask the House to accept my explanation particularly in view of the fact that I am anxious, as far as possible, to keep the wording of the agreement which, after all, is an agreement between two countries which was reached after long argument.</P>

Perhaps the Minister could indicate what arrangements are being made.  I also asked how much money remained in the fund set up under the Scholarship Exchange Act, 1957, and whether this money would be transferred to the commission.  The amount being given to the commission by the United States has been stated but are the Irish Government or anybody in Ireland providing money for the commission? Could the Minister outline the total funding available to the commission and whether they will receive also an annual allocation?  I have not been able to lay my hands on the financial report of the last board; in fact, there have been <Col N="1779" /> no reports in the Library since 1982, I had laid my hands on the 1982 report but it did not include a financial report.  I mentioned that point during my Second Stage contribution.  The Minister confirmed that reports had been issued and he assured me that they would be made available in the Library.

      <P>We were very pleased to hear on Second Stage that the existing chairman of the board will continue to serve on the commission.  Tribute was paid to the members of the board that is being replaced by this legislation.  The detail in which this section deals with the membership of the Commission is pleasing.  The Minister was anxious to assure us of the breadth of experience, academic qualifications and probity of the Irish members on the board, but I am at a loss when looking at the American members of the board to discover whether it will be the person who holds a position in the embassy of the day or a diplomat &mdash; diplomatic practices differ and a person might have a political orientation &mdash; or the people from academic institutions in the United States who will serve on the board.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will, I am sure, understand I cannot pre-empt the decision of the United States Government on their nominees to this commission. The practice in other countries has been for the United States to nominate in the diplomatic category those <Col N="1781" /> embassy officers with experience and responsibility in cultural and educational affairs.  The Deputy can be reasonably satisfied that all such appointees to this commission by both the Irish and US side will be well qualified to carry out their tasks.  As I have said already, the onus would be on the United States Government and I would not like to pre-empt what they might do.

      <P>I would like further information on the Minister's appointments to the commission.  When the Minister is making appointments to a commission which will have to make judgments on a very wide agenda, does he take advice from various organisations?  Will the Minister indicate if he approaches the universities and asks them to submit a short list of people who might be suitable or does he approach cultural bodies such as the Sculptors' Association or artistic bodies?  In making appointments, I urge the Minister to be aware of the 51 per cent of the population and ensure that a few women are included in this commission.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (8) states:</P>
      <P>A vacancy arising by the death, resignation or termination of office of a member shall be filled by the appointment of an eligible person in accordance with subsection (2) or (3), as the case may require, to hold office for the unexpired period of the term of office of his predecessor.</P>
      <P>If a person served for a period of a year or a year and a half would he be entitled to complete a term of eight years on the commission, in other words would they be able to serve for part of a period of a two-year term in order to make up a total of eight years?  Members are allowed to serve for a two-year period and then for three other consecutive two-year terms. Is the person who takes up office in the middle of a two-year term precluded from serving a total of eight years?</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Owen and Deputy Higgins, I am also concerned about the qualifications of the members of the commission.  The Minister has assured us that the members will not need specific qualifications.  Ten or 20 years from now, forgetting about current Ministers and other people who are here talking about the Bill, there may be very little protection for the members of the commission.  It would be right that the Minister lay down that one or perhaps two people from each side should have some qualification.  For example, one person could have a specific educational qualification and another a cultural qualification. There should be some standing for at least two of the appointees.  I can expect two political appointees on each <Col N="1783" /> side but to have four political appointees on each side, as could happen in the future, would be a bit of a disaster for the whole scheme.  It is a pity that there is nothing in the Bill to say that any one of the commissioners must have a particular standing in the community or ability in the cultural or academic area.  I would ask the Minister to consider some qualification for at least one member, perhaps the chairperson or deputy chairperson. The document here mentions chairman and deputy chairman.  Therefore there is not much hope for Deputy Owen's suggestion about 51 per cent of the population being represented on the commission.  However, there should be some protection so that the function of the commission is maintained well into the future by ensuring that there is a certain standard of ability and integrity on the commission.</P>

During the operation of this scheme appointments have been made by Governments of all shapes and sizes and of differing political opinions.  All Governments have accepted the responsibility that has been put on them.  The last board is one that even Deputy Mac Giolla must say is a first class board.  This matter is so important that no Government would appoint a person to the board, be it a man or women, unless they had the ability to do the work.

      <P>I would like to raise a very small point on this section and again I do not want to delay on it.  Perhaps the Minister would inform me a little more on subsection (9).  Why, of all the officerships, has the position of treasurer been selected as one requiring the approval of the Minister and the representative of the United States?  There is a touch of tautology here.  We are all suspending any reservations and disbelief we may have to go along with the Minister's good intentions, but if the Minister has appointed four impeccable people and if, equally, four unimpeachable people came from the American side, could we not trust these eight wonderful people who have met every criterion to pick a treasurer?  Why, having gone through the procedures so wonderfully, is a further ratification required, not by one but by both parties to the agreement, for the position of treasurer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to that same point.  Deputy Higgins and I must have been looking over each other's shoulder because I, too, read this subsection with a certain amount of surprise. I not only wondered why the treasurer is to be sanctioned by both sides but why the assistant treasurer could be any old person who does not have to match the same criteria or undergo the same scrutiny. It is with the assistant treasurer that the difficulty could arise.  I wonder why it is necessary to have that line in the Bill. I would have thought that if anybody is to be subject to the approval of the Minister it should be the chairperson, but the chairperson is probably appointed by the Minister &mdash; I thought all the people would be appointed by the Minister.  I have one other point to make on this <Col N="1785" /> section but I will allow the Minister to answer this one first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very simple answer &mdash; the treasurer is the person who will sign the cheques and be responsible for the money and the accounts, unlike the assistant treasurer who will not have the same responsibility.  It is for that reason that both parties would have to be satisfied with the person who is to be treasurer.  I do not know who the treasurer is going to be, but the Minister and the agent of the United States Government will have to be satisfied with the individual concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say something to the Minister in case he gets the wrong impression.  I was 13½ years old when in 1957, legislation to initiate this scheme first came to this House and I have no knowledge or remembrance of this whole set up.  Therefore, in asking questions I am not casting reflections on the people who have operated the system over a number of years.  This is the first chance I have got as an adult to examine the legislation.  I would ask the Minister if subsection (7) of section 4 is not tautolous in the sense that nobody is allowed to be on the board for more than four consecutive terms.  I wonder why that provision is there.  It implies that a person can be in office for only four terms but can continue to be an ordinary member for further terms.  In section 3 (5) it is clear that a person can be in office for only four terms.  I wonder if there is excessive wording there.</P>

      <P>In a way that could well be the case.  A person cannot hold office for more than four consecutive terms but as Deputy Owen has said if they can serve for more than four terms that should be an answer in itself.  However I do not think it makes any real difference to the Bill and it is not going to affect it in any way.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a very small point.  Subsection (4) states that the income of the Ireland-United States Educational Fund shall be made available to the commission for the purposes of its functions.  My earlier question was whether the capital sum, as well as the yield, could be used to fund the scholarship programme and the Minister replied that it would be a matter for a decision by the commission as to whether it wanted to lean on the capital fund rather than restricting itself to the yield. However, this subsection seems to specify the yield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise a similar point here in regard to funding which has not been clear to me from the beginning.  I take it that the Ireland-United States Educational Fund will be composed of £552,528 plus $127,000 from the United States.  The Irish Government are not contributing money but will, of course, provide secretarial expenses, accommodation, equipment, light, telephones and the various expenses incurred in the functioning of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to clarify the point Deputy Higgins raised.  Will the only money available to the commission be the income arising from the fund which, under subsection (3), will be invested by the Minister for Finance, with the consent of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in such securities as may be approved of by the Minister for Finance?  All that will be available to the commission will be the income arising form those securities.  Will the Minister give an indication of what the income currently is from the sum available if invested by the Minister for Finance? What income is available to the commission on a yearly basis for the purpose of bursaries, etc.?  I take it, if the Irish <Col N="1787" /> Government are providing all the backup services of secretarial expenses, accommodation, light, telephones and expenses incurred in the functioning of the board, they will be able to use all this income for the purpose of scholarships, bursaries or various grants to individuals or, since the Minister agreed with the proposal of Deputy Higgins, to group artistic activities.  This proposal must have been thought up by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance, that this money is available and that if it is invested in securities so much interest will be gained annually.  Will the Minister give us an indication of what will be available annually?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (6) says that the Government may, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, make contributions to the commission for the purposes of its functions.  Will the Minister give us an indication &mdash; I do not know if he has the figure available &mdash; of how much money has been provided by the Oireachtas?  Has the whole scholarship scheme been totally funded from interest payments?  Has there been any cost to the State?  Does this section of the Bill oblige the commission to invest those moneys in accordance with the instructions of the Minister for Finance?  The fund is more or less under the control of the Minister for Finance.  A later section states that the commission can accept funds, goods and services as may be made available to them and I wonder if such goods, services and funds that they might get are covered under this section of the Bill.  Is the word of the Minister for Finance supreme in relation to any moneys available for spending or do they have a little latitude?</P>

      <P>Yes.  There will be nothing to stop the commission from using the sum of £52,000 which has accumulated in interest; there is nothing in the Bill to prevent this and it is left to their own discretion.  Of course if they dip deeply into it the money available will be that much less.  I cannot forecast what the commission might do in relation to that but they will probably keep the £500,000 intact.  Unfortunately, I do not have the figure of the contribution of the Irish Government but it has been generally in the provision of accommodation, lighting, various equipment, some secretarial work, heating, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his clarification of the previous point. I was interested to hear that there is flexibility which depends on the commission of the day.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to line 43.  Subsection (b) states: &ldquo;the recommendation to the Board of Foreign Scholarships of the United States of America....of the candidacy of students, research scholars, and teachers to participate in the programmes envisaged by this Act, bearing in mind the fact that that board will identify appropriate agencies to arrange placement.&rdquo; I do not want to be tedious about it but I want to alert the Minister to the fact that the giveaway word in that line is &ldquo;agencies&rdquo; because, let us be clear about it, although they have powers of recommendations with the United States side in relation to institutions, not all <Col N="1789" /> institutions are participating institutions. To become an agency for one side of it in relation to, for example, the traditional evolution of the Fulbright scheme, does not include all the agencies of the United States or the academic or third level institutions of the United States.  Neither does it include institutions outside academic ones altogether, not to speak of the fact of it not including freely organised groups of artists, musicians, writers, the Drama Guild of America and all the other things we mentioned.  My fear, lest the Minister of State think it is overstated, is justified by the very wording we have here bearing in mind that the board will identify appropriate agencies to arrange placement.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that, of course, this is a matter for the United States, who are the other signatories of the agreement and certainly that is a valid reply.  I am saying that this is evidence of the very thing I suggested with a danger in relation to restriction because we are being pointed at rather definite and specific targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>Subsection (2) states that members of the commission may not themselves benefit by way of scholarship or travel bursaries.  I do not know whether the Minister had time this morning to hear of the major competition being run for a bar of gold where one of the conditions is that members of RTÉ and their families are not allowed to participate in the search.  I wonder about this section.  Clearly members of the commission could not be sitting on a board and awarding themselves the scholarships, but it is important that it be clear that members of their families either would not be excluded, or, equally, would not be shown any form of favouritism. I wonder if the Minister has any comment on how that section works.  If it was included in the original I do not think it was exactly in those words because I could not find it.  Was there ever a conflict involving a member of the family of any member of the commission feeling they were being excluded because a parent or some relative happened to be <Col N="1790" /> on the commission?  I just wondered how that part of the Bill had been working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is that I do not know.  If I catch the drift of Deputy Owen's contribution I gather she would not be very happy if a member of the family of a member of the commission was not able to avail of the scholarship if they were suited in every other way.  I have to say that I agree with her.  I agree with her also that a member of the commission itself should not be able to avail of a scholarship or a grant, but I feel that it would be undue interference if a member of their family who was sufficiently well qualified should suffer because a parent was a member of the commission.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Higgins is fair.  Under the existing scheme any recommendations made by the existing board and, indeed, by the commission in the future will have to be passed on to the board of foreign scholarships.  In relation to the Fulbright Programme itself, operation is normally by the Council for International Exchange of Scholars at scholar level and by the Institute for International Education at graduate level.  That is a normal part of the Fulbright Programme.</P>
      <P>I can understand the Deputy's worry about agencies, but the examples I gave earlier should go some way towards alleviating his worries on that point.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if this section does not unduly restrict the commission. Under section 7 there is a very wide range of powers.  In fact, one of the selling points of this Bill according to the Minister was that it was giving more autonomy to what was formerly known as the board and is now to be known as the commission, allowing them more flexibility in their approach and giving them the right <Col N="1791" /> to set up their own offices so they would not be directly under the control of the Department of Foreign Affairs, although excellently managed by them.  Now they were becoming a more autonomous body and able to make decisions for themselves. I just wonder if this section is not tying their hands when it comes to the powers granted under section 7 (a) &mdash;&ldquo;the planning, adoption and execution of programmes in accordance with the purposes of this Act&rdquo;.  I feel they should be entitled to decide in one year, perhaps, that they might like to give a few extra scholarships because they happen to have a particularly high standard of applications, and maybe in another year decide that they did not feel the standards were reached, and reduce the numbers. I wonder if the necessity to go to the Minister for Finance to get their budgets approved annually is such a good idea. Perhaps the Minister would assure me that this is not unduly tying the hands of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very minor and related point in relation to this section.  The Minister might be able to tell me whether the phrase &ldquo;following consultation with the Minister for Finance&rdquo; is an innovation on the 1957 Act. I cannot remember exactly but I would be inclined to wager that it is not in the 1957 Act.  It is a fascinating exercise because here the principle of good legislation is involved.  The Minister would be entitled to stand up and reply that ultimately in regard to moneys given by the Irish Government by way of an Act that is coming in under the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State are the accountable people to question in the Dáil.  I can understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much support Deputy Owen's point, but we should understand that even if there is to be accountability, it is not restriction, and that the flexibility of drawing from the capital sum and/or the yield in any one year taken with another is something that should be there. <Col N="1792" /> However, what is absolutely extraordinary is the insertion of the phrase in line 3 &ldquo;following consultation with the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  Let us be dead on about this one because money and funding in this Bill have been a bit elusive. What is really being said is that the component for which the Irish Government have responsibility will be used to determine the total policy of the commission from all funds, including those not given by the Irish Government at all. Therefore what it is saying is that, even if the Minister for Foreign Affairs was to hear a submission by the commission on the very point Deputy Owen makes, this year we have an extraordinary group of people who would benefit and if the Minister was amenable and said he agreed it made sense that if sums were not used in one year they could be rolled on to another year, he has to go back in consultation with the Minister for Finance, and the small component which, as Deputy Mac Giolla has been saying, is by way of contribution to light, heat, rental, telephones and so forth, is used as a drag on the total funding.  It seems that the way to deal with it is for the Minister of State to tell us on Report Stage &mdash; and he would have my support &mdash; that he will drop the words &ldquo;following consultation with the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. We can drop them because they provide no advantage in this legislation and throw an air of uncertainty over the work of the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is putting any veil of uncertainty over the work of the commission because this section is based on Article 6 of the 1988 Agreement and corresponds to section 8 of the 1957 Act which concerns the annual programme of the Scholarship Exchange Board.  As Deputies know, it is normal for any Minister to get sanction from the Minister for Finance.  There are many of us who might like to get rid of that.  I can again sympathise with what the Deputy has said.</P>

There is no reference in the section to the need to have the agreement of the Minister for Finance; the section merely refers to consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Section 5 (3) provides that all moneys invested shall be invested with the consent of the Minister for Finance in such securities as may be approved of by the Minister for Finance.  It is only diplomatic to consult with the Minister for Finance about such matters.  We do not have to get the approval of the Minister for Finance; we only have to consult with him.</P>

I have no problem with allowing the Minister for Finance to have a say in investments in Government securities and giving good advice &mdash; he has a wealth of advice in his Department &mdash; but the Minister of State will agree that the gremlins got to work when they started to interpret Article 6, which I have only just seen.  Article 6 clearly uses the words &ldquo;in accordance&rdquo; which, from my reading of it, is exactly the same as <Col N="1795" /> section 8 (3) of the 1957 Act, at which time there was no Minister for Finance hovering around.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 1, after &ldquo;accept&rdquo; to insert&ldquo;, seek&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my preparation for the debate on this Bill, I had discussions with various interested parties about it.  One point made by them was that it was a bit restrictive to merely allow the commission to &ldquo;accept and use&rdquo; other funds, goods or services.  I got the distinct impression that people, maybe not here but, certainly, in the United States, may be interested in making money available <Col N="1796" /> to the commission but might not be aware that the commission would like to receive it.  The commission should be given the flexibility to seek such funds.  For example, a former recipient of one of these scholarships who might have acquired a certain amount of wealth might, if asked, be willing to give money to the commission so that other students could avail of it.  Some Irish members of the commission may feel left out or embarrassed if they are not able to seek such funds.  I know that the United States side would like to have the flexibility to seek such funds and it would be a pity if we were to prevent the Irish side from doing this.</P>
    <P>Such funds, if sought, would have to be used in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  I am not proposing that the commission could seek funds and run off and do what they like with them.  My amendment would give the commission some flexibility in this regard.  In later years the Minister may be thanked by students who were able to avail of scholarships under this Bill because the commission were permitted to raise £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000.</P>
    <P>A few days ago I attended a meeting in Dublin City University and I was extremely pleased to hear reports from the university of the amounts of money which people had made available for the purchase of technological equipment and the building of extensions to the university. Many of those people had given six figure sums to the university and they wanted no praise or publicity for doing so.  That shows that there are people who want to help in this area of education.  It would be a pity if we did not enable the commission to avail of all the opportunities to seek such funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Owen's amendment.  I will be very brief because the need for such amendment is obvious.  I will give an example, drawn from the experience of the board since 1957.  When the board used advertise in newspapers, they headed them, An Bord Cómalairte Scoláireachtaí with a second heading, The Scholarship Exchange <Col N="1797" /> Board.  The format and the main title were enough to deter people from applying. I am not saying that by way of criticism. To take Deputy Owen's point, if one wants the commission to have more funding, one could argue, in terms of their administrative provisions, that they should be allowed advertise their charitable status, tax exemptions and so forth. However, another interpretation of this would be that the commission are over-stepping themselves and should sit there and wait for the money to come to them. It makes eminent sense to include the word &ldquo;seek&rdquo; in this section.</P>
      <P>In order to save time later, I strongly advise the Minister to check the usage of the term &ldquo;An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cómalairte&rdquo; throughout the Bill.  I am anxious to see the modernisation of the Irish language in print but I have a very deep suspicion that everywhere the word &ldquo;Cómalairte&rdquo; occurs in the Bill and the explanatory memoranda that it should, in fact, read &ldquo;Cómhalairte&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Owen's amendment.  The more money the commission have available to them the more effective they can be and the more they can do in relation to cultural and educational exchange.  There are various tax incentives in the United States to encourage people to put money into charities, bursaries, scholarships and so on.  We may reach that stage here in the next ten, 15 or 20 years and it would be very useful if the board were able to openly market the commission in the very fashionable marketplace about which we all speak.  People may wish to put money &mdash; some people regard this as a way in which they can be commemorated after they die &mdash; into the commission's bursaries, scholarships, exchanges and so on.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;seek&rdquo; is a very good, simple way of providing for that in the Bill.  Not alone may they accept if somebody is offering the money to them but they may go out and actually look for money. Certainly it can be got currently in the US.  Universities can go out openly and look for funds, so the commission should be able to do the same thing.</P>

      <P>I can understand the desire of Deputy Owen to make certain that the commission can get their hands on as much money as possible but the wording of the Bill does not preclude them from going out.  While I accept that Deputy Owen's amendment would make it more positive, the present wording does not preclude the commission from seeking money.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy Higgins, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the commission from letting people know that they have a charitable status, because that is actually conferred on them by section 2 (6) of the Bill.  The section is based on article 7 (G) of the 1988 agreement.  It corresponds to section 13 of the 1957 Act which concerns gifts to the Scholarship Exchange Board. We felt that it was undesirable to impose on the commission the obligation to look for funds.  The Deputy's amendment is a good one but I would have to go back and have it clarified.  I want this legislation put through as quickly as possible and I accept the point that it is a long time in formulation.  While I accept the thinking behind the Deputy's amendment, I would ask her to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>If it is any consolation to the Minister, I could almost guarantee that that is exactly the kind of amendment to this Bill that the US side want. They did not ask me to put in this amendment, but I know from discussions with them in preparing for the Bill that they would like the opportunity to go out to seek funds.  It is really only the Irish side <Col N="1799" /> from whom I would like an answer today, that is from the Minister.  I checked the word &ldquo;accept&rdquo;, and although I am not as good as Deputy Higgins in analysing English words, it means that one opens one's hands and accepts, for instance, a gift.  I do not see how the Minister can say that the word &ldquo;accept&rdquo; means the same thing as actively seeking something.</P>
      <P>I wonder in what part of the Bill is it implicit that the word &ldquo;accept&rdquo; means that one can accept money after one has sought it.  The Minister is saying that one can accept money whether or not one has gone out to seek the money or it has been offered.  I am advised that the Minister's interpretation is not implicit in the Bill and that the American side do not feel they have the right to seek money.</P>

      <P>The very fact that the word &ldquo;seek&rdquo; is not there does not preclude the commission from looking for money.  I was not a party to the discussion that Deputy Owen had with the American side and I can only say that the American side were very much involved in the agreement and we have taken the wording of the Bill from the agreement. I am not opposed to the word &ldquo;seek&rdquo; except for that.  I am sure the House would like to have the commission established as soon as possible.  I accept that this has taken quite a while.  Because the drafting was carefully chosen not to preclude the commission from seeking money, the Deputy might consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like some clarification from the Minister as to what type of equipment needs to be imported for the commission.  It is a most unusual section.  There are many educational establishments who would love to have that facility available to them, that they may import necessary equipment free of import charges.  I thought that perhaps this referred to exhibitions, sculptures, paintings or whatever in the exchange forward and back, but it does not seem to be that.  If it was, it would probably be specifically said.  It says &ldquo;equipment necessary for official use&rdquo;.  That would include computers, typewriters and whatever office equipment was required.  If that section allowing that sort of equipment to be imported free of import charges is included here it will open up the floodgates with many people looking for similar facilities.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why it is necessary to have this.</P>

      <P>The point is well made. The section has been designed to give effect to Article 1 (C) of the 1988 agreement, which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(C)  As an organisation established for charitable purposes, the Commission will be exempt from income tax and capital gains tax in relation to income and/or gains applied for charitable purposes.  Transfers and leases of land made for charitable purposes will be exempt from stamp duty.  Inheritances applied for public or charitable <Col N="1801" /> purposes shall be exempt from inheritance tax.</P>
    <P>The Commission shall be entitled to import free of duty necessary equipment for official use.  My understanding is that that is something that the American negotiators looked for and that it is part and parcel of all the typical scholarship agreements they have with other countries.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister of State give us any idea of the expenses which might be incurred by him?  I assume since this body is being given autonomy they will be able to open up offices and sign agreements for the provision of a telephone service or will it be the case that the Minister will continue to pay? However I note that the ubiquitous Minister for Finance will keep a beady eye on the Minister for Foreign Affairs who will not be allowed to incur any expenses, to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, unless they have been sanctioned by the Minister for Finance. <Col N="1802" /> That clause only began to appear in legislation during the past few years.  It first appeared in a Bill relating to education &mdash; I think Mr. Ray MacSharry was Minister for Finance at the time &mdash; with the result that the approval of the Minister for Finance had to be sought first before a school could buy a new blackboard.  I would suggest that we should not take from Ministers the responsibilities given to them when appointed and that this is not good for democracy.  Would the Minister of State be prepared to say that he, too, is concerned about the presence of the ubiquitous Minister for Finance?</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 13, after &ldquo;destroy,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;whether wholly or partly,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment but nonetheless it may have implications of substance in the workings of the legislation. I am proposing that the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; contained in section 1 should be extended to include the words &ldquo;whether wholly or partly&rdquo; so that the definition, contained in paragraph (a) subsection (1) which outlines the different acts covered, would read &ldquo;to destroy, whether wholly or partly, deface, dismantle or...&rdquo; The Law Reform Commission use those words in their recommendations.  For that reason we should follow suit.  The summary of the recommendations of that report states:</P>
      <P>2.  The legislation should use the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in the substantive offence; a subsection should provide that this term includes cases where the interference consists wholly or partly of destroying, defacing or dismantling the property or rendering it inoperable or unfit for use:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should use the same terms, the same words in our definition.  As this is the first amendment to the Bill, it is welcome, for closer examination on Committee Stage, that the Minister in drafting the legislation worked extremely closely to and from the report of the Law Reform Commission on this very important subject.  It is good that the Government have taken <Col N="1805" /> on board almost verbatim the recommendations and amendments the commission made.  The Bill when finally passed, will represent a very significant modification and clarification of the general law with regard to malicious damage which, as we were told by the Minister on Second Stage, includes an unbelievable litany of offences under the original Act of 1861.  In following closely what the Law Reform Commission recommend and borrowing their wisdom and terminology, I suggest this amendment might be included as a way of ensuring we are precise in the language we use.</P>
    <P>The one difficulty I envisage is that where an item of property is damaged, not entirely rendered inoperable or useless, or where it is only partially interfered with or damaged, a case may be made of that, in view of the definite definition in the Bill as drafted.  I do not think the words &ldquo;wholly or partly&rdquo; in any way take away from or diminish the intention of the legislation.  If anything they merely clarify it and ensure that it is as comprehensive as it should be.  Therefore, I hope they are acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to thank Deputy McCartan for recognising that we have worked very closely to the commission's report when drafting the Bill.  We devoted much time and study to the report.  I understand the Deputy's wish to have the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; as comprehensive as possible so as to leave no room for doubt.  In fact, as the Deputy has mentioned, the Law Reform Commission's report referred specifically to the notion of destruction as an alternative to damage.  The report states that one view was that the reference in the British Act to destruction was unnecessary, as property can scarcely be destroyed without being damaged.  As against this, it was possible to envisage cases where the interference with the property would more easily be described as destruction than as damage, according to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report went on to instance the <Col N="1806" /> burning down of a haystack where &ldquo;damage&rdquo; would not be an appropriate description of what had occurred.  To get over any possible uncertainties the commission recommended that damage should be defined as including destroying, defacing, dismantling or rendering inoperable or unfit for use.  We have done that in the Bill.  Consequently, it is unnecessary to include the words Deputy McCartan desires.  The position is clear and other sections clarify it beyond any doubt.  I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry we have got off to what would seem to be a rather poor start.  I urge the Minister to reflect a little further on this before we pass from it.  I do not have to make a point by asking him why he thinks the Law Reform Commission felt that in their recommendations they should use these words, but let us look a little more closely at the definition in the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that it can arise in two categories. The first category would be of those acts that would amount to an almost complete total destruction of the property involved.  The act of destruction is very total in its meaning.  One destroys or destructs.  Equally, the word &ldquo;dismantling&rdquo; involves the concept of taking something apart in its entirety.  Rendering something inoperable requires a very final act or almost total destruction of the property rendering it unfit for use and then there is preventing or impairing the operation of it.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the word &ldquo;defacing&rdquo; is very specific in itself.  It could mean, say, spray painting.  I have no doubt that that in some way involves the plastering of slogans or scratching the paintwork of a motor car or of property. On the one hand we have what seems to be concepts of almost total action involving a very definite extent to which the damage is done and, on the other hand, a very specific act, that of defacing. Those are the two categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is room for play here among the legal geniuses who will be asked to interpret this Bill in ease of defendants <Col N="1807" /> in courts when charged, by saying that, while they have caused interference with the property they have not gone the distance to constitute its destruction, its dismantling in the total sense of the word, rendering it inoperable or unusable in the total sense of the word.  We have to look at the range to which damage can be caused and inconvenience visited upon the owner of property by providing for the partial destruction, partial dismantling or partial rendering inoperable or unusable.  For that reason I urge the Minister to look at this.  There are halfway stations involved in this that may not be covered in the very specific terms of the definition.  I am anxious that this legislation should have the widest possible application.  For that reason it is important that we consider this further.  Including these words in no way takes from or dilutes the intention of the legislation or the very fine definition that is there.  I can see little difficulty about accepting it.  The Minister says there are other provisions in the Bill that will make the point clearer. Perhaps, in response he will draw my attention briefly to where in the Bill we can find assistance on this point.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this for Report Stage.  Why are we not taking up the suggestion the commission made and using the words they used in their recommendations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan has gone to great lengths to persuade me to reconsider this point.  We are talking about a very thin line, something of a grey area.  One can damage a motor car by hitting it with a sledge hammer or one can damage it but it can be repaired.  One can destroy it by burning it and rendering it absolutely inoperable, totally unusable. It is a very thin area.  Complete destruction is already covered in the definition. To damage includes to destroy.  Damage in its ordinary meaning covers partial destruction.  Deputy McCartan has made the point that this is really a drafting matter.  The Bill has been drafted without these words, despite the fact that they were included in the report of the Law <Col N="1808" /> Reform Commission.  Perhaps there is a good reason for that.  To ensure that there is no doubt and to ensure that the legislation is to the maximum satisfaction and without ambiguity, I am prepared to consult with the parliamentary draftsman to see if we should include what Deputy McCartan desires on Report Stage.  I hope this is satisfactory.  As ever, I should like to be helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly it is acceptable to me.  The Minister suggested that &ldquo;damage&rdquo; includes partial destruction. We are providing in the Bill for a specific definition of damage.  That definition as it stands does not include the word &ldquo;partial&rdquo;. It should be as all-embracing as possible.  I welcome the Minister's decision to consider this matter before Report Stage.  In the spirit of co-operation I agree to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extremely important amendment. I am proposing that we extend the definition of damage to include damage caused to property resulting from the driving of a motor vehicle without insurance as required by the Road Traffic Acts.  Where a person without insurance drives a motor vehicle recklessly or carelessly and causes damage by way of collision, that damage should be considered damage for the purposes of this Bill and, therefore, chargeable as an offence of malicious damage within the terms of the Bill.  There is so much so-called joy riding and uninsured driving that it puts the public at huge risk of loss should accident or damage arise.  I am suggesting that to damage by this type of driving should be an offence under this Bill.  Heretofore <Col N="1809" /> damage caused by such driving was not considered to be malicious damage and a person could not recover damages under the 1861 legislation.  A typical instance occurred in my constituency recently which prompted me to table the amendment.</P>

      <P>Last night I outlined the role of the women of Ireland in building this great country of ours.  The influence of mothers on sons and daughters made Ireland the great country it is and that influence came from rearing the family. For that reason alone this Bill is worthy of support.  I do not accept, in this day and age, when the modern woman feels she has a more outgoing role to play and she wants to move out into the world, that there should be any bar in her way. It is wrong and backward thinking that any club or organisation should have rules or regulations that debar women. People of that mentality should not be supported by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, there is an attitude abroad that it is no longer fashionable for the mother to stay at home and rear her family, that it is not important work.  If a woman is interviewed and is asked her occupation one notices that she is sometimes shy or embarrassed in stating that she is <Col N="1813" /> a housewife.  She should not be embarrassed. It is still important work.  It was never more important that her children be guided because of all the attractions and the medium of television.</P>
    <P>For that reason and in recognition of the work of women in Ireland I commend this Bill and compliment Deputy Mitchell on bringing it forward.  I ask the House to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be worthwhile to remind ourselves very briefly what our vision of society should be in terms of participation of both sexes.  I suggest we should aim to have a society where it would be totally unremarkable to find that half the positions in any occupation, whether with or without influence, should be occupied by men and the other half occupied by women.  We should also have as our objective bringing about a society where every member, without any distinction of sex, creed or any other distinction, should feel that he or she has an equal chance to make his or her own choice, unaffected by any outside values that might be brought to bear on them about what path to follow in life, what profession to follow, what degree of influence to aspire to or any of those things that are the meat of most of what we say about careers.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution is very eloquent in this regard because it shows an attitude that is totally out of keeping with those two objectives that we should have in society.  Only one provision in our Constitution speaks about the matters we are talking about now in a totally unbiased way, Article 9.1.3º.  It is worth recalling it because I think it was part of the consideration that led Deputy Gay Mitchell to draft this Bill in the way he did.  Article 9.1.3º provides:</P>
      <P>No person may be excluded from Irish nationality and citizenship by reason of the sex of such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Article is clear and unambiguous, nothing of a paternalistic nature can be read into it, nothing of a condescending nature can be read into it and that, rightly, has been part of the model <Col N="1814" /> Deputy Mitchell used in drafting this Bill. It is because it has the character I have just outlined that he used it in that way.</P>
    <P>The other provisions in our Constitution are very different.  Article 40.1. provides that:</P>
    <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph of that provision goes on in a way which opens up ambiguity, room for interpretation or scope for prejudice against which Deputy Mitchell's Bill is aimed because it provides:</P>
    <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>That is where the real difficulty comes in our Constitution, that is where the real problem Deputy Mitchell's Bill addresses begins.  Article 41.2.1º speaks of a particular role for women:</P>
    <P>In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>Article 41.2.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>It is in those Articles we find the beginning of the problem that has been much talked about, much argued about for many years but which we have not yet fully resolved or tackled.  Those Articles in the Constitution depart from the starting point we should have which is that every citizen should feel he or she has the same freedom, the same right and the same ability to follow his or her bent in life without interference from any other values imposed on him or her by the Constitution or by law, but particularly by the Constitution.  Every citizen should feel that he or she can live in a society where it is a matter of indifference, a <Col N="1815" /> matter of no comment, a matter that is totally unremarkable that about half the people in positions of influence, power, sway or importance &mdash; whether political, social or economic &mdash; will be women.  We do not have that situation.</P>
    <P>That is not the spirit that lies behind our Constitution.  What lies behind our Constitution is a very paternalistic view of the role of women, a very condescending view to women, and I say that not to denigrate the framer of the Constitution but simply to make the point that these Articles are based on a particular view, a particular concept of society which had not come to terms with equality, which had not come to terms with the right of each individual to have access to and the ability to develop himself or herself to the full without the interference of external values, external constraints.  It is that that has caused the problem here for so many years and it is that which Deputy Mitchell's Bill seeks to address.</P>
    <P>It is ironic in a sense that, while all of these provisions in our Constitution sprang from a particular view of society and a concern to defend, to promote or to vindicate that view of society &mdash; and done at the time for the best of motives &mdash; it is those provisions that have trapped women in Ireland since 1937 and which have brought about a situation where in countless, not readily observable, ways half the members of our society are denied the same right to develop their own contribution to society, to their families, to their own life, that the other half of us are able to take for granted.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution of 1937 by the way it refers to women traps them and creates a situation where inescapably they are discriminated against not only in law but more importantly and more comprehensively in the attitudes that lies behind our law and the way our society functions.  Some years ago when we were talking about financial matters, a very wise civil servant said to me: &ldquo;Minister, when somebody tells me that a progressive change we wish to bring about requires only a change in public attitudes, I know it will never happen.&rdquo; I would not <Col N="1816" /> be as pessimistic as that but there is more than a grain of truth in it.  It takes a long time to change an ingrained attitude that is buttressed up by our Constitution.  It takes a long time to change a prejudice that is given sanction by the way our Constitution is written.  I hesitate to say this &mdash; and I know Deputy Mitchell will not be too happy that I would say something contentious about this Bill, which he quite rightly wants to make non-political &mdash; but it takes a long time to change an ingrained attitude in the Fianna Fáil Party, because they lead firmly from behind.  When Fianna Fáil change their attitude on any major topic you will know, as sure as night follows day, that it is because the public has already changed.  We all hope that that ingrained attitude in Fianna Fáil has changed but it has not yet changed on this issue.  We saw how long it took to change attitudes within Fianna Fáil on the financial management of our economy and indeed on the econmic management of our State to the benefit of the people.  It will take a long time to change the prejudices that underlie the provisions of our Constitution that have caused the problems we are talking about in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Attitudes take a long time to change and they will not change if we in this House refuse to take the steps that will encourage and indeed lead the public into changing their attitude.  These attitudes are very deeply ingrained in all aspects of Irish life.  About 20 years ago my wife and I lived in a south Dublin suburb which in more recent times would have been called &ldquo;yuppie&rdquo;, although that term has now gone out of fashion.  The rest were a great deal more affluent than we were at that time but that suburb would have been regarded as affluent and socially progressive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not Deputy Mitchell &mdash; he was still in short pants at the time. The suburb would have been regarded as quite progressive.  We were delighted to <Col N="1817" /> hear the parish priest issue an open invitation from the altar for lay readers. Whatever we may have thought of the Constitution at that time we thought this was good: the Church is changing its attitude about the laity.  We both went around to the sacristy after Mass and sought out the parish priest.  I told him we were delighted to hear his invitation and we wanted to sign up as lay readers. He beamed at me and said: &ldquo;That is grand, Alan, we will be delighted to have you, what Sunday will I put you down for?&rdquo; In those days I was not a politician and I had Sundays mostly to myself and I told him I was generally free.  Incidentally, I said, Fionnuala wants to become a reader too.  He turned around to her and beamed at her and said, &ldquo;Can't Alan do it for you?&rdquo; I do not know if that man ever realised how close he came to assassination from two sides on that Sunday.  It showed an attitude. The Church, and rightly so, was seeking to involve the laity in its activities to a greater extent than before and yet because of this unspoken prejudice was saying that half of the people do not really qualify to do it.  In the same connection we still have what I regard as a non-sensical debate or dispute, if that is what you would call it, about girls serving on the altar.  However, I am happy to say there are other parts of the country where you do not have that problem.  Of course, our Constitution has nothing to do with the running, of the Church &mdash; which is another days work &mdash; but it has to do with the attitude we are talking about, the attitude that distinguishes between the people and the women, which is what we are seeking to unlock and change in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's attitude to the Bill seems to be very unwise, partial reluctance and backward looking.  All law needs a good solid foundation in the Constitution &mdash; that is what Constitutions are for, to guide and inspire law, so that by laying down a clear set of values and objectives, we will know that those values and objectives will inspire and inform the law that we make.  If the Constitution is paternalistic and condescending in any <Col N="1818" /> respect, then there is a fair chance that the law is going to be paternalistic and condescending in that same respect.  It is nonsense for speakers on the Government side to say that the issues we are dealing with should be dealt with only in law and not in the Constitution, because without the proper constitutional foundation the law will not match up to our requirements on this essential issue of human rights.</P>
    <P>I listened with some distress last evening to the ubiquitous Deputy Roche, who has been brought out to speak on all of these issues, speaking as if we could do without any constitutional inspiration for the law in these areas.  He was trying to pretend that there was something wrong with Deputy Mitchell's Bill because it did not change the law in all the specific respects we could talk about. My point, which I share with Deputy Mitchell, is that unless and until we change the Constitution we can never be sure the law will meet the objectives, the requirements and the aspirations we set out for all of our people.  It is nonsense to pretend &mdash; and we hear more of this from the Government these days &mdash; that our Constitution is in some way a seamless web and that no part of it can be changed without all the other parts of it being changed also.  Apparently that view started from a liberal feeling among the Progressive Democrats but in the hands of this Government it has turned into a recipe for making no change whatsoever. If we examine the issue we might find it undemocratic to be faced with a choice between on the one hand changing everything in our Constitution or changing nothing.  I think the Progressive Democrats have been wrong about that because all they have succeeded in doing so far, after all the huffing and puffing about a new Constitution, is making sure that the other party in Government decide to change nothing.  It is pernicious in regard to the matter we are discussing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the law needs a very clear and firm foundation in relation to our objectives and principles and the values we put on people as individuals.  If our <Col N="1819" /> Constitution does not set that out in the way we want it set out, then there is a more than even chance that our laws will not achieve those objectives, and that our laws will have the same flaws that have been talked about for the past 30 or 40 years and that will not disappear until we root the same fundamental flaw out of our Constitution.  It is urgent and absolutely of the highest necessity that we make the change that is proposed in our Constitution and to insert in it the provision that rights under the law shall not be limited or denied by the State by virtue of the distinction of sex.  That has the same clarity that we see in Article 9 of the Constitution.  That provision can be the keystone we will use to build a structure of equality and to achieve the things for half of our population that we want to achieve and we can make sure, with the right keystone, that they will endure.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome and support this amendment to our Constitution proposed by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  As far as the women of Ireland are concerned, this amendment is long overdue.  It is appropriate, and indeed important that we have a clear, unequivocal, unambiguous clause inserted into the Constitution underpinning the fact that women are indeed equal to men and must be so deemed under the laws of the State.</P>
      <P>For far too long women have laboured, and sadly continue to labour, under an abundance of discriminatory attitudes, practices and even laws.  It has taken the tenacity, valour and obstinate determination of many women over the years to reverse the blatant discrimination against them in the laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joining the European Community gave a tremendous boost to the pursuit of equality for women under law.  Fortunately the women's movement seized the opportunity presented by European Community membership to push Ireland into the 20th century as far as the issue of women's rights was concerned.  Under the watchful eye of the European Court <Col N="1820" /> Irish Governments have been embarrassed and coerced into putting women on a par with men before the law.  Now we urgently need to move forward, to put Ireland into the 21st century and take the all important steps of publicly demonstrating through our Constitution that we as a nation unreservedly acknowledge the inherent right to equality in the economic, political and social spheres.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is the guiding light for all our laws.  It is the soil in which the plant of our law is rooted.  Yet, viewed from a woman's point of view, it is an unbalanced document.  Women, wherever they get a mention, are by and large relegated exclusively to domestic spheres.  No other role is readily seen for women.  The language and thinking of the Constitution are male dominated.  Yet is it not an ironic twist that remedies for some of the injustices against women have been arrived at by recourse to the Constitution?  I share Deputy Mitchell's view that this is not good enough.  There are ambiguities in the Constitution.  The interpretation of certain Articles depends on the courts which may or may not choose to see inequality.  Clearly Article 40.1 and 40.3 are most certainly not on every occasion seen by the courts to, without hesitation, support the notion of equality.  As matters stand, the recognition of equality of women can be won or lost by the attitude to the Constitution by the courts.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by the Government's recital of all they are supposed to have done to improve the lot of women.  Is it not scarcely a matter for self-congratulation that they have set about righting injustices against half the population? The fact that we still need an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights serves to show that women do not yet enjoy full equality in all spheres.  The very existence of this committee, and indeed the lack of a men's rights committee, speaks volumes of the position of women in Irish society in 1991.</P>
    <P>If one takes a glance around this House or the Seanad or looks at the composition of the Cabinet one must ask, why are there so few women?  The fact that there <Col N="1821" /> are 13 women in the Dáil out of a total of 166 Members; six out of 60 in the Seanad and one out of 15 in the Cabinet is stark evidence that all is not well for women today.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment is needed.  The Government must come clean on this issue.  They must be prepared to insert full equality into the most important document in our land. Women are watching and waiting.  They demand, as we in the Fine Gael Party do, that our Constitution should recognise unequivocally through this amendment full equality for women.  Therefore, to remove all doubt and all ambiguity the Fine Gael Party demand clarity in this matter in the shape of the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like from the outset to say that I very much regret the fact that my absence abroad on official business last week precluded me from making the opening contribution on behalf of the Government to this debate.  I am grateful to my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and Government Chief Whip, Deputy Vincent Brady, for taking my place at that time and for outlining the reasons why the Government will be opposing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> My interest in this debate stems, of course, from the fact that, in addition to my responsibilities for European affairs, the Taoiseach has assigned to me a specific monitoring and co-ordinating role on all aspects of Government policy as they affect women.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the promotion of equality and equal opportunities between women and men is clear for all to see, and it was for this very reason that the Government decided not to oppose the moving of Second Stage of this Bill.  While we believe that Private Members' time could and should be used to a lot greater effect to promote legislation of real benefit to our citizens, women and men alike &mdash; I quote Deputy Shatter's Judicial Separation Bill, as subsequently amended and enacted, as a case in point &mdash; we nevertheless welcome this opportunity for the House to debate such a fundamental principle of our society, the question of equality between the sexes, which we believe is already adequately enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I have studied the contributions made in the debate on this Bill last week with great interest, and was present to hear the contributions made in the House last evening and again this evening.  Overall, I would like to commend Deputies who contributed to the debate for the quality of their contributions.  It is a measure of the maturity of this Legislature and the seriousness with which it addresses the principle of equality of all our citizens that the contributions in this debate were, in the main, well researched and highly responsible.  If I was to take exception to any particular contribution, I would have to say that I found that of Deputy Fennell to be overly selective in attributing credit for past achievements in this area to Fine Gael-dominated Governments, but I propose in any event to put the record straight as regards the Government's commitment to the promotion of equality between women and men.</P>
    <P>In his opening address to the House, Deputy Mitchell suggested that the record of the Oireachtas and successive Governments on the issue of equality was <Col N="1823" /> abysmal.  While I would certainly contend that there is room for improvement on our past record, I quite simply cannot agree with this assertion.  What strikes me most about it is the fact that, in apportioning blame to successive Governments, the Deputy must assuredly have been including that Government which was dominated, numerically, although clearly not ideologically, by his own party in the period 1983-87.  The House will agree with me when I say that I find it a little bit odd, to say the least, that Deputy Mitchell and his colleagues, while underlining the absolute necessity for the draft legislation before us at this time, made absolutely no effort to enact such legislation in the four year period during which they were in office.</P>
    <P>The simple explanation is, of course, that what was not an absolute necessity or an imperative in the period 1983-87 is still not an imperative today.  This fully justifies the Government stance on the issue before the House to the effect that it is simply not necessary.  In fairness to Deputy Mitchell's partners in Government in the 1983-87 period, Deputy Ferris, on behalf of the Labour Party, made it clear in his contribution last week that his party share the Government's view that an amendment to the Constitution is unnecessary and that any remaining obstacles in this area can be addressed by legislation to be enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A further point which strikes me about the weakness of the Fine Gael Party's arguments for the necessity for this Bill arises from the contribution made by Deputy Fennell.  Although the Bill before us confines itself to an amendment of Article 40 of the Constitution, Deputy Fennel, who is after all her party's spokesperson on equality issues, volunteered to the House her personal opinion that we should go further even than this simple amendment.  She suggested that we should also, &ldquo;scrap Article 41.2 of the Constitution; it is meaningless&rdquo;. I am bound to ask the House how are we to address this Fine Gael <Col N="1824" /> proposal seriously if the party's spokespersons on constitutional reform and equality issues.  Deputies Mitchell and Fennell respectively, cannot agree on the nature of an amendment to the Constitution dealing with equality?  If the House was foolish enough to enact this unnecessary legislation before us, are we not to assume that we must brace ourselves for a further legislative proposal in six, 12 or 18 months time to provide for another referendum to meet the concerns expressed by Deputy Fennell in relation to Article 41.2?</P>
    <P>One of the more forceful points made in the debate so far on this Bill was the fact that, far from promoting the principle of equality in our society, the provisions of the Bill as they stand could, in fact, restrict the scope for action in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris very validly posed the question as to whether the Oireachtas could ever enact legislation to provide for positive action in favour of women if the Fine Gael proposal was enacted and carried by referendum.  Deputy De Rossa reinforced the doubts on this issue and went so far as to propose an additional text to the Fine Gael proposal to ensure continued scope for positive action.  My own view, although I would have welcomed legal advice on it if the time had allowed, is that the Fine Gael proposal as it stands would restrict the scope for future legislative action to cover positive action in favour of women.  In doing so, it would fly in the face of the wishes and decisions of this House, which has already enshrined the principle of positive action in our Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it would cut across the universally accepted opinion throughout the western world, as enunciated most clearly in the five year equal opportunity programmes of the European Community which we must implement, that, with the achievement of equality in law in most western democracies in recent decades, positive action is regarded as an essential policy instrument if what Deputy Dukes talked about and what we all want, equality in reality is to be <Col N="1825" /> achieved over time.  Indeed, I would remind the House that Ireland, by virtue of our accession to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, is now bound by international law to respect the principle of positive action. Article 4 of the convention provides that:</P>
    <P>Adoption by States Parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating <i>de facto</i> equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved.</P>
    <P>Given the serious question mark surrounding the implications of these proposals for future positive action measures, I believe that this is a further strong reason for the House to reject this unnecessary and poorly researched proposal.</P>
    <P>A further point made in the debate by Deputies Mitchell and Fennell was that the Constitution, in particular Article 40.1, allowed the passage of legislation which was restrictive to women and, in fact, that it has inhibited legislation in the equality area.  I suggest to Deputies that this is patently not the case.  The Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, in his contribution referred to the wide range of legislative measures which have been enacted by successive Governments, including measures by some of the parties opposite when in Government, to give effect to the principle of equality and to enhance the status of women in our society.</P>
    <P>These legislative measures &mdash; covering such issues as married women's status, succession, employment equality, equal pay, maternity protection, unfair dismissals, guardianship of infants, the care of children, maintenance orders, juries, maintenance of spouses and children, family planning, social welfare and <Col N="1826" /> income maintenance, taxation provisions, rape, domicile and recognition of foreign divorces, and protection for part-time workers &mdash; have all been enacted in full compliance with the provisions of our Constitution and have given very real support and provision for redress of wrongs to Irish women.  If, in some instances, these laws have been found to be inadequate or overly-weak, I would argue that this has arisen not from any inhibitions in our Constitution but, rather, from the failure of this Legislature to enact sufficiently comprehensive provisions to achieve the objectives originally intended.  As Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, implied in his contribution last week, the real challenge for us as legislators is to fulfil our responsibilities to the electorate by using our ingenuity to draw up effective and practical legislative measures to combat the highly complex problem of discrimination between the sexes.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn briefly to the Government's record on equality issues and to some of the points raised in this context by Deputies.  Deputy McGahon last evening expressed some views regarding which I was glad to see Deputy Taylor-Quinn taking him to task.  Deputy McGahon last evening suggested that a serious shortcoming in the Government's new law on rape was that it omitted to address the problem of rape within marriage whereas he believed a recent judgment from the House of Lords placed Britain far ahead of us on this issue.  I attempted, but failed, to put the record straight last evening, so I wish to make it clear here that Deputy McGahon was misinformed in his assertion.  The Government's new law on rape does address the problem of rape within marriage and provides that it is subject to the same maximum penalty as rape in any other circumstances, that is, life imprisonment. The Deputy will be pleased to learn, therefore, that our rape laws are now far advanced in comparison with many of our European neighbours.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa very kindly complimented me on my role of monitoring and co-ordinating Government policies <Col N="1827" /> as they affect women, but went on to criticise this role on the grounds that I have no obligation to report to this House or to let Deputies know what the Departments of State are doing specifically to improve the status of women.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa is correct in saying that I have no specific reporting obligation in these matters, but I would point out to him that I published a comprehensive booklet just over two years ago in which I itemised the actions taken by each Department of State to promote equality over the period March 1987 to September 1988.  This booklet was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, was available from the Government Publications Sales Office and was given widespread distribution to women's groups throughout the country.  It had the benefit of sensitising the community to what specific actions had been taken in this area and of promoting a public debate both on the efficacy of these actions and the need for further measures to be taken. Moreover, I believe that the very exercise of requesting this information from the senior policy-makers in all Government Departments had the important function of sensitising them &mdash; the majority of whom unfortunately, are still male &mdash; to the effect which the policies they propose and implement can have on women's lives.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that, in line with a promise which I made when I published this detailed booklet, I am now in the process of drafting a second publication which will again itemise, by Department of State, all the activities which have been carried out by this Government since September 1988. Material is being received by my office from each Department at present, and I hope to be in a position to publish the document within weeks.  I believe this will largely meet the point made by Deputy De Rossa as regards his perceived shortcomings of my role on equality issues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the Second Commission on the Status of Women. He stated it was disappointing that the <Col N="1828" /> Government have contented themselves with the appointment of another commission in this area because, no matter how well intentioned and busy that commission will be, he believed it would be possibly another two years before there is a call on the Government to act.  I am happy to inform the House that Deputy Ferris is way off the mark with this assertion.</P>
    <P>The position is that when the commission were established some six months ago, they were asked to report to Government within 18 months.  So at this stage the longest timescale for responding to the commission's recommendations would be one year from now, and not two as suggested by Deputy Ferris.  However, implicit in the Deputy's criticism was a suggestion that the establishment of the commission was something of a stalling exercise.  I reject this suggestion out of hand and would point out that, when the Taoiseach addressed the new commission last November, it was he who took the initiative by inviting them to consider making interim recommendations pending their final report. So, far from putting these issues on the back burner, as it were, it was the Taoiseach himself who invited an early response from the commission.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to remind the House that the commission have, in fact, responded to the Taoiseach's invitation by announcing seven interim recommendations only last week in their first statement to Government.  In her otherwise excellent contribution last evening, Deputy Taylor-Quinn spoke at some length on the content of these seven recommendations and called for their implementation. What she neglected to point out, however, was that the Taoiseach immediately announced that the Government had considered the recommendations and that they were in principle acceptable to them.  This very positive response from the Government, coming only some six months after the establishment of the commission, is a clear indication of the Government's commitment and sincerity in promoting the status of women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> The practical effect of the Government's decision is that legislation to provide for joint ownership of the family home and household chattels &mdash; which I must emphasise is already under consideration by this Government &mdash; will be finalised once the outcome of a case on appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court is known.</P>
    <P>In future, all Government decisions will specify the probable impact, if any, on women of proposed policy changes. The Government have also agreed to work towards the commission's guidelines as regards representation of women on State boards subject, of course, as their recommendation in any event accepts, to the need for appointing men where objective criteria so indicate.</P>
    <P>The Government will appoint a woman to the Top Level Appointments Committee which selects candidates for the most senior posts in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Government also accept the recommendation that national lottery and other public funds should not be allocated to private clubs which operate discriminatory policies which deprive women of the right to apply for full membership.</P>
    <P>As regards public service age limits, the Government can already report progress under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in raising the recruitment age for the public service so as to broaden career choices for women, particularly women who are keen to re-enter the work force.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards the commission's recommendations on the curriculum for primary schools, the Government will ensure, through the Minister for Education, that the curriculum is revised to exclude all sexism and sex-stereotyping.</P>
    <P>The swift response from Government to all seven interim recommendations from the Commission on the Status of Women sums up very well this Government's approach to equality issues.  We believe that the promotion of equality is a matter for all Ministers and all Government Departments.  We are committed to implementing practical measures which <Col N="1830" /> will change our laws and administrative arrangements in all cases where such laws and arrangements pose an obstacle to women's full and equal participation in Irish society.  We refuse to be deflected from our commitment in this area by proposals for piecemeal amendment of our Constitution which have been ill thought out, poorly researched and do not stand up to reasoned argument.  We are for sustained, solid and practical progress in the equality area and, as the forthcoming publication of my second booklet on the precise measures which the Government have taken in this area will clearly show, we are happy to stand on our record and submit it openly to the full rigours of public debate.</P>
    <P>Despite a full and lengthy debate on the Fine Gael proposal before us, and having carefully considered the issues raised in this debate, I have to say that we on this side of the House see no attraction in the Bill.  For this reason, we will be opposing the passing of its Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn say that she intends to publish another report on the action taken by all Government Departments to promote equality.  I would also like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister personally for the work she has done having been given the responsibility for the co-ordinating and monitoring of all aspects of Government policy in relation to women's affairs.</P>
      <P>As we already know, this Government are totally committed to equality for women in every area of life in Ireland.  I am sure we would all agree that substantial progress has been made and will continue in the years ahead because of the commitment of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is unnecessary.  I am at a loss to know why Deputy Mitchell should put down a motion such as this because, of all the Deputies in the House, he is very conversant with all the legislation.  He is an excellent contributor and participates more than many of his colleagues.  I feel <Col N="1831" /> that this amendment is really a waste of time in that it will not achieve anything.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides that &ldquo;all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rdquo;.  Deputy Mitchell wants to add another sentence: &ldquo;Rights under the law shall not be limited or denied by the State by virtue of distinction of sex&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The task of interpreting the provisions of our Constitution falls to the courts. The growing importance of the courts in interpreting the Constitution has been a major political development since the mid-sixties.  The rate of constitutional decision making has dramatically increased.  There were two referenda in the eighties as a direct result of decisions by the Supreme Court.  Other decisions have led to the introduction of new legislation or the amending of legislation already in existence.  It is the fundamental rights provisions of the Constitution, namely Articles 40-44, that have most directly affected Irish social policy since the Supreme Court took a more active approach to the Constitution in the sixties.</P>
    <P>The Constitution means what the Supreme Court says it means.  In this sense, the court is not limited to interpreting the Constitution by reference to the standards of the thirties.  Far from it.  The courts interpret in terms of the present time.  In a wide range of cases the courts have made explicit rights and entitlements of citizens they have found to be implicit in the Constitution.  In the words of Mr. Justice Kenny in Ryan <i>v.</i> Attorney General, &ldquo;There are many personal rights of the citizen which follow from the Christian and democratic nature of the State which are not mentioned in Article 40 at all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Article 40 speaks of citizens having rights as &ldquo;human persons&rdquo;.  There is no reference to these rights being dependent on the sex of the person.  The courts have upheld the equality of the sexes in this regard.  It is at the level of the courts that the real protection afforded by the <Col N="1832" /> Constitution, for all people in this country, is upheld.  As long as the courts continue to interpret the Constitution to provide for equality of opportunity for all citizens, whether male or female, then we do not need any amendment of the Constitution in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell has introduced this Bill for reasons best known to himself. Even if it were enacted and accepted by the people of Ireland, it will not in any way affect the position of women in our society.</P>
    <P>What we want, and this is the position adopted by Fianna Fáil, is to show and to take positive practical action to improve the position of females in Ireland.  One of the first major pieces of legislation in this area was the Succession Act, 1965.  This was the work of the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Justice. It was regarded at the time as a major development which would substantially improve the position of women.  It has achieved that objective and still remains a measure of great force for the position of women.</P>
    <P>The Succession Act established equality in the workplace, in the tax code and, in particular, the protection of the status of women rearing children in the home. For far too long, women in the home did not receive recognition.  We must give greater recognition to women at home.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat disappointed with Deputy Fennell's contribution last week when she referred to the absence of the Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, has certainly made a major contribution in this area which has been acknowledged not alone in Ireland but in Europe.  Deputy Fennell reminded the House of the legislation she was responsible for bringing into the House but she conveniently omitted to give the same recognition to other people on this side of the House.  There was a promise that women in the home would get a cheque for £9.50 on a Thursday morning if an election went a certain way.  When it did, the postman came on the Thursday morning but we never saw the cheque.</P>
    <P>I must refer to some of the changes which have occurred, such as the ending <Col N="1833" /> of the marriage bar in the Civil Service in 1973, the introduction of free legal aid in 1979 and paid maternity leave which came into effect in 1980.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, which has again been re-established in the present Dáil and of which I am privileged to be a member, gave Members of the House an opportunity to meet groups directly involved in women's affairs throughout the country.  It has certainly been a great experience for me to meet those people, to listen to their views and to be aware of the difficulties and problems that many of them have.</P>
    <P>There was also the abolition of illegitimacy, the reform of the adoption law, the Judicial Separation Act, the reform of the rape law, the recent child abduction legislation and the protection of part-time workers.  These are all major pieces of legislation which affect people.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to part time workers because all sections of the House paid tribute to the Minister recently for recognising this very sensitive area where the vast majority, 70 per cent, are women working for unscrupulous employers and being abused.  This Bill was another positive response by the Government.  Rather than being negative all the time, some Members on the other side of the House should recognise this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> I should also like to acknowledge the progress which has been made to date in the appointment of women to the boards of State bodies &mdash; I think the Minister mentioned a figure of 297.  Women are also heading Government commissions and task forces.  Again, the commitments given in this area have been honoured by the Government.  In addition, a second woman judge was appointed to the High Court recently.  Every opportunity is being taken by the Government to ensure that there is equality in all sectors.</P>
    <P>The recent establishment of the Second Commission on the Status of Women will highlight continued areas of inequality.  Unfortunately, I cannot refer to all these areas in the time available to me this evening.  All of the changes in regard to inequality have taken place without any infringement of the Constitution. The first statement of the new Commission on the Status of Women was published recently.  It is a preliminary statement on the measures they consider necessary to secure equality for women in Irish society.  The commission were given a mandate to make comprehensive recommendations to the Government on the means by which women would be able to participate on equal terms and conditions with men in the economic, social, political and cultural life of our society, with special attention being given to the needs of women in the home.</P>
    <P>The commission have expressed their pleasure at the political priority given by the Government to equality and other issues affecting women.  This reflects the reality of the approach adopted by Fianna Fáil over many years and also clearly shows the Taoiseach's continuing commitment to the improvement of the position of women in our society.  The recent statement issued by the commission does not contain a list of comprehensive priorities.  However, it does indicate the approach of persons with a great deal of experience and expertise in the area of women's rights.  When one looks at the recommendations one can see the desire of the commission to achieve real practical progress on the road to equality. They recommend a series of practical <Col N="1835" /> steps which can be taken and which do not require lengthy and detailed consideration on matters of principle.  The Government have accepted these recommendations in principle.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted by the commission complements the thrust of the objectives set out in the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was agreed between the main sectoral interests in Irish society &mdash; farmers, unions, employers and the Government. This is a measure of practical importance for people.  There is no reference in the new programme or in the commission's recommendation to the need for constitutional change to improve the position of women.  The commission considered that the new programme contained a number of initiatives directed very much towards the achievement of equality in Irish society.  They went as far as to commend all the parties who were involved in the programme.  They welcomed, in particular, the new labour legislation on the protection of part-time employees and the promised reform of existing employment equality legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have more time to refer to other important areas.  The Bill before us tonight will not do anything for women.  As the records show, we are achieving many of the things which needed to be achieved in this area.  I do not think there is anything to be gained in pursuing the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that a great head of steam is being generated in relation to this proposed amendment to the Constitution.  I welcome the debate which is taking place in this House on the general issue of equality.  As a person who served on the Joint Committee on Women's Rights for a number of years and who participated <Col N="1836" /> in hearing evidence from different groups which later led to the publication of reports, I am delighted that there is such enthusiasm now for gender equality in Ireland, with the rare exception of the odd irredentist Deputy who wants to slide away from what is perceived as general progress.</P>
      <P>It is important that we face realities and live with them.  The truth is that our society is still deeply patriarchial.  A great deal of time was spent this afternoon on a rather small but technical and important Bill dealing with scholarship exchanges between Ireland and the United States. That legislation, as in the case of all legislation which comes into this House and the Seanad, uses the word &ldquo;his&rdquo;.  I am aware that there are interpretative regulations which suggest that this word is used generically to include his and her but the facility with which the word &ldquo;his&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; is used in other legislation and the apparent inability of those who draft Bills, those who are responsible for guidelines and draftsmanship to change them, seem to suggest that we are stuck in a rut.  But there has been progress though listening to the speeches, one hears from one side about people who did this or that.  There are even suggestions, rather on the lines of Ataturk and contemporary Turkey, that with the personality of our Taoiseach came all reform in relation to equality.  The Taoiseach should be credited with such gains as he initiated, be it in terms of justice, appointments or whatever but I do not think we should fall back and think that around his personal cerebral intentions lies the future of women.  It is more serious than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that after the State was founded we had a brief and rather simple but manageable 1922 Constitution which was amended in a series of different ways between 1922 and 1937.  That Constitution used the simple phrase &ldquo;without discrimination as to sex.&rdquo; Some time ago I looked at the de Valera papers in Killiney &mdash; I might say that these are a much over-rated source of information &mdash; and one of the things which comes out of them is that Mr. de Valera was very upset <Col N="1837" /> by what he perceived to be the attack on him by women who were worried about the omission of this principle in the new Constitution.  Included in Mr. de Valera's papers are cuttings from an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the day entitled &ldquo;Leaves from a Woman's Diary&rdquo; in which the author describes meeting another woman at the Horse Show.  When the other woman said, &ldquo;Mr. de Valera is a darling man&rdquo; she replied &ldquo;He is a darling indeed, you know what he has in mind for us.&rdquo; She went on to refer to Article 41 and his proposed future for women. We know that he was upset by that.</P>
    <P>A great deal of thinking went into this. The people who opposed the Constitution were primarily women, the movement against the 1937 Constitution was organised by women.  One of the biggest meetings held at that time was held by Professor Mary Hayden in the Mansion House.  After that meeting the late Minister, Mr. McEntee, said that the women present did not have a drop of nationalist blood in their veins.  This drew a response from Mrs. Clarke, the widow of the signatory of the Proclamation, who said that the proposed position of women was more or less an insult to her husband's intentions for women and their equality in the spirit of the Proclamation.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution excited interest in the position of women primarily. Women campaigned and held meetings because they were very worried about what they saw as a running down of their position, which had been preceded between 1932 and 1937 by a number of special work orders which had excluded women from certain categories of work. I think only two women spoke in this House on the Second Stage of the 1937 Constitution Bill.  One of those women was moved to suggest that Irish women should model themselves on the Polish family who had saved the Polish language and culture.  In a later part of her speech she suggested that womens nervous systems were not suitable to times of bombing and that when bombs fell in the City <Col N="1838" /> of London women ran from telephone exchanges.  Those were the kind of statements which were made.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the 1937 Constitution, where it refers to women, was a very serious regression.  I do not think constitutional historians could argue with that position.  For example, the social articles, from Article 40 onwards, are unsatisfactory in relation to a number of statements.  Article 40.1 includes the phrase &ldquo;differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function&rdquo;.  There is not any sustainable evidence in relation to social function or gender that could support a use of language like that now. Those who are thundering on about Deputy Fennell's suggestion on Article 41.1 are dealing with a very difficult situation, the definition of families.  There is a problem of interpretation as to what form of family is involved.  One possible interpretation could create difficulties for contemporary or modern households, and the drift of legislation is towards households.  I do not say that the Government will not be moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a new constitution but without doubt the position of women, the view of women, the role and function of women as stated in the 1937 Constitution, is not as favourable as that which they enjoyed at the foundation of the State.  It cannot be argued otherwise.</P>
    <P>Let us give credit where credit is due, all reforming legislation which would establish the rights and participation of women should be welcomed from whatever source.  The argument seems to be that there is a legislative momentum which can be accepted as sufficient. There is not any basis for the suggestion that an amendment like this would imperil that movement, but should one rely on that legislative process as it unfolds, alone?  We would have great difficulty bringing in affirmative legislation without a constitutional referendum.  For example, if one wanted to require it of all legislative instruments that they be drafted to include a clause which suggested that nothing in them should offend <Col N="1839" /> the principle of equality, one might need the prior constitutional reference to equality between the sexes.</P>
    <P>While I would prefer a new constitution, equality must go beyond gender equality now.  I see why people are looking to the Constitution to make the changes being spoken about.  People are a little too coy about the question of changes in relation to women.  From my time on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights I can say, &ldquo;let nobody think that the gains won were not won without considerable struggle&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education have been referred to, an outrageous example of discrimination against women in relation to promotions.  An enormous number of women serve as primary teachers but what is the number of women above the level of inspector?  All the main participants in education are women and yet they have not risen, as one would expect, to the higher ranks of the Department.  During the term I served on the committee we saw a form of questioning which could preclude women from senior positions in schools, even in relation to teaching posts.  The suggestion was that their social function was to get married and have children.  They were put into an impossible position in that they could not possibly answer the questions without lying.  Many women were deprived of their just entitlements in that regard.  That was wrong and it was done with the connivance of people who were satisfied, and would be satisfied today, with a male dominated Government Department and with a society that did not allow women full participation.</P>
    <P>In employment generally the evidence, not only here but in every country in the European Community, and outside, is that in State employment the greatest gains for equality have been made.  The mixture of the carrot and stick to induce private employers to accord equality has not been as successful as one would like. Put bluntly, equality is not conceded to women, it has largely been won by women.  That is the evidence from the workplace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> There is another side to it. Surely no one can be happy with the appalling abuse of women in the advertising industry. Week after week, and day after day, there is a suggestion of a set of roles appropriate to women.  There is the suggestion that the content of those is silly, facetious, flippant and so on.  That is an insult not just to women but to civilised members of society who take offence at it.  Yet, for commercial purposes women are regularly abused. Indeed, the national television authority only recently appointed a woman to the review body which looks at offensive advertising and decides whether an advertisement would offend.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of the Committee an editor of a newspaper wrote to say he found nothing wrong with a woman selling a tractor dressed in a bikini.  He wrote what he considered to be a humourous letter about this and showed us what an extraordinary rather bigoted and ignorant person he was.</P>
    <P>In relation to the concept of illegitimacy, it is wrong to suggest that it is strictly a women's issue; it is a rights issue.  I proposed a Bill to abolish the status of illegitimacy with two others in the Seanad in 1974 and a former Senator suggested that this was socialism under the sheets.  That Senator revealed, as has come across to me from this long debate in which I have participated for 20 years, that property values were always the problems one runs up against.  If a big farm is at stake, the woman is blamed and the law is not reformed in relation to the child born out of a liaison outside of marriage.  Something similar has happened in relation to divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to those who feel they have gone beyond obstacles of a legislative kind and who want to keep that momentum going, but I am not convinced of their argument that a constitutional referendum would in any way impede their progress.  Equally, while this constitutional amendment might be approached differently, it has afforded us <Col N="1841" /> an opportunity to debate the reality of the Constitution of 1937.</P>
    <P>We must think about how long it takes to change regulations.  Let nobody think that it was only two weeks ago that people read in the handbook for teachers that for boys martial airs and cheerful songs should be played and that a soothing lullaby should be played for girls.  I recall attention being drawn to that in the seventies. What an appalling length of time it has taken for that kind of nonsense to be stopped.</P>

      <P>I am finishing.  I recall seeing a textbook in the Irish language about a &ldquo;gúna nua&rdquo;.  The story was about how a mother brought her little girl off to a shop.  There was a little boy and a father involved.  The story used language like, &ldquo;mammy is buying a new dress; daddy is paying for it; are not women very expensive&rdquo;, and so on.  That was in use last year in the primary school system.  Do the people responsible for administering this new ethos of equality listen to us?  We are responsible for legislation and we should all support this Bill. I do not detect a great party difference on it.  It relates more to those who are open to change and those who are against change, wherever they are.  The administration of society, the attitudes, the embedded patriarchy, the way in which people negotiate their lives each day all need to change.  I would risk a referendum even on a form of wording which the Government could come back on but which might shock people into a debate on the attitudes that, need to change if there is to be equality.  It is not a matter of choosing just legislation and/or the Constitution.  That is a false choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced by the argument that an activist Supreme Court can save <Col N="1842" /> us from our responsibilities.  At the end of the day the Supreme Court can only indicate.  It can be activist in one period and not in another.  Interestingly, all the activists claimed that they operated from a basis of natural law which preceded positive law.  It would be very interesting if we could give an example to the Supreme Court of what we want to do and then ask them to adjudicate within the new ethos we are making constitutionally possible.</P>

      <P>During the recess I heard a radio interview with a woman who works as a radio presenter with a radio station in England.  I do not know if any of my colleagues in the House heard it but, during that interview it transpired that not too long ago this woman had been a man and had undergone a sex change operation.  She assumed that she would continue to work in the same job. She was told she could continue in her job but now that she was a woman her salary would drop.  That story depicts the kernel of this Bill; it has got to do with attitudes in society, not just the attitude of men but also of women.  Despite what Deputy Higgins said, progress has been made and new laws have been introduced. However, changes in the law will not lead to equality for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1971, shortly after I married, I attended one of the early heady meetings of the women's liberation movement in Ireland.  I felt that conference at lunch time as I was embarrassed and unable to cope because sitting around the table was a collection of women I had never previously come up against.  Despite being the child of a widow I had not come up against the harder side of society.  Sitting around the table were prisoners' wives, deserted and battered wives, single women who were minding elderly parents &mdash; a whole range of women working in <Col N="1843" /> society against all the odds.  Practically every one of them said there was no recognition for prisoners' wives, deserted wives or the single daughter who had decided to stay at home to look after her mother or father.  Thankfully, successive Governments have made changes since then in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>While progress has been made in terms of changes in the law, attitudes have not changed.  Only two days ago the Taoiseach, in reply to a question put to me, used the language which automatically attempts to downgrade women.  The Taoiseach used the word &ldquo;strident&rdquo; which implies that somehow women are going too far.  Until such time as the attitudes of men and women towards women and their place in society change, changes in the law will not lead to true equality.</P>

      <P>I heard an eminent lawyer, a former Attorney General, say recently that the adversarial system in the courts may be changed.  Having listened to the debate which has taken place on this Bill, perhaps the adversarial system in Parliament should also be changed as it stinks having regard to some of the contributions made purely on a party political basis.  I do not share the views of the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who said that all the contributions made were well researched.  I believe some of them were pathetic while others were excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my own contribution the Minister of State said it was a poorly researched proposal.  It is not.  I came to this view when I travelled to Queens University over a two year period and heard a speech on this subject by Dr. Yvonne Scannell on the radio.  The first thing I decided on being appointed party spokesman on constitutional reform last January, was to get a copy of that speech and go through the sections of the Constitution to which it referred.  I do not <Col N="1844" /> know how the Minister came to the conclusion that my proposal was poorly researched; I can only put it down to being a party political comment to which I take exception.  If the Minister of State reads my opening contribution and today's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> she will learn there are good and valid reasons for my proposal.  Presumably, if the Council for the Status of Women recommended the introduction of a constitutional amendment the Minister of State and others will have to recant some of the comments made.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to Deputy Michael D. Higgins who made what I consider to be one of if not the outstanding contribution in this debate.  It was delivered in a tremendous manner, its contents were educative and it was worthy of him. In time people will come to realise that we have abolished illegitimacy and it is now time to abolish inequality.  I thank all those who contributed to the debate, especially the lady Members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I avoided making party political comments but I have to defend myself. During my contribution I indicted all parties for their failure to do anything in this regard.  I resent a female Minister of State coming into the House to make party political comments.  Some of the dismissive comments made by a handful of Deputies reminded me of the South African President, Mr. De Klerk, who protested on RTE earlier this week that apartheid was not all bad given that 50 per cent of the South African police force are black.  This goes to show that one can quote scripture to suit the devil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brady, made a poor speech.  Whoever presented that speech from the Department of the Taoiseach did not do this House a great service.  The record will show that the <Col N="1845" /> speech was poorly researched and inaccurate. Reference was made to some unspecified technical problem with regard to the Irish wording of the proposed amendment.  Is that not what the Committee Stage is all about?  The purpose of Committee Stage is to iron out technical difficulties and consider amendments. The record will indict the Minister of State who replied to my opening remarks on the Bill.</P>
    <P>He also criticised Fine Gael for seeking to change the Constitution.  Is the Legislature to be condemned for seeking to legislate?  If there was a contempt of parliament Act the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, could be indicted for making such comments.  It is the job of the Legislature to legislate.  How dare any Member of this House condemn other Members for introducing legislation.  The people can change the Constitution but amendments must be initiated here.  That is our job and the job that I am paid to do.  It should be remembered that Mr. de Valera amended the 1937 Constitution on several occasions before the provision which allowed Members of the Oireachtas to make amendments was changed.  In 1959 he sought to amend it again himself.  He never claimed the Constitution was sacrosanct for all time.  All law, including the Constitution, is amendable.  To condemn such an initiative is to show contempt for Parliament and the people, in this case women specifically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris in his opening remarks had a bob each way and described the Bill in words to which I took exception. Far from being capricious, I gave a great deal of thought to it over a considerable time.  I first became interested having listened to Dr. Yvonne Scannell on the Thomas Davis Lectures broadcast on RTE well over 12 months ago in the series &ldquo;de Valera's Constitution and Ours&rdquo;.  I was appointed party spokesman earlier in the year and this was the first thing I took on.  My amendment was drawn up with the assistance of two of the most <Col N="1846" /> eminent lawyers in this field, one an authority on women's issues in law and the other a leading constitutional lawyer. Deputy Ferris had my Bill for a maximum of four days, though I suppose he had it really for only a few hours, and it was he who made the ill-considered, poorly researched remarks which are on the record for all time beside my detailed and researched contribution which stands up to analysis.  Nonetheless, I welcome the support of the Labour Party for the Bill. The contribution made by Deputy Ferris' colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, this evening went a considerable way to erase from the record some misinterpretations which could have been put on Deputy Ferris' contribution.</P>
    <P>I want to address some remarks to Deputy O'Malley.  Neither he nor any member of the Progressive Democrats even sat in on the debate, let alone participated in it.  He did not even see fit to attend in the House and neither did any of his Members.  He took a smug shot at Fine Gael and said that what is needed is not an amendment but a whole new Constitution.  He did not say it in this House; he said it smugly at his Ard-Fheis over the weekend.  I have read a draft of the Progressive Democrats' whole new constitution, the one which hurriedly restored God to its content.  It speaks of the Irish nation being the Republic.  The word &ldquo;nation&rdquo; means &ldquo;greater community&rdquo;. The Republic is not the Irish nation.  The people of Northern Ireland are part of the Irish nation, so are the 700,000 people of Irish birth living in Britain.  Is this the sort of amended new constitution Deputy O'Malley wants to bring into the House, one that refers to the Republic as the Irish nation, saying that, we, the Irish nation, hereby defend our inalienable rights?  This is the new constitution he is proposing.  Neither does the Progressive Democrats draft constitution which I have read contain a satisfactory sex equality clause; it contains none at all.  This is the party who styled <Col N="1847" /> themselves last weekend at their Ard-Fheis as &ldquo;the difference&rdquo; to quote their slogan.  The indifference of the Progressive Democrats is alarming.  Their backsides now are in the Mercedes and they do not give a hoot about changing society or changing the Constitution or changing laws, and they are using this well rehearsed excuse that really what we need to do is not make that change or this change but change the whole law and the whole Constitution, in the full knowledge that it will never happen. However, they can always use this as an excuse.  It is a little like a man whose car has a punctured wheel saying, &ldquo;I am not going to change the wheel or mend the puncture, I need a whole new car&rdquo;.  The indifference of the Progressive Democrats in not even attending in this House or contributing to this debate but smugly making contributions over the airwaves at their Ard-Fheis is a cop out.</P>
    <P>The last review of the Constitution was commenced by all parties in the form of a committee in 1966.  At that time Mr. Lemass said a review should take place every 25 years.  From 1966 to 1991 is exactly 25 years.  That committee, of whom incidentally Deputy Andrews was a member if my recollection is correct, made one interim report.  None of the recommendations of that report was implemented with the exception of the one regarding the special position of the Catholic Church and other named churches, and the committee never met again. Now they want us to wait for further reform of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I think the Constitution needs to be reformed from top to bottom for reasons within the Republic, not just because of Northern Ireland, but that does not mean we cannot take the opportunity of a local election on 27 June to put a specific amendment before the people who are the ultimate Legislature in connection with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to Deputy De Rossa for a very sensible, well thought <Col N="1848" /> out contribution.  I say in response that Fine Gael would accept even putting this Bill into a committee of the whole House if thereby improvements to the text could be made which would bring about greater equality.  I thought Deputy De Rossa's contribution was statesmanlike and I want to put my tribute to him on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dick Roche and Deputy Tom Kitt referred to Article 9.1.1º of the Constitution which they said deals with the issue.  It provides that:</P>
    <P>1.  1º On the coming into operation of this Constitution any person who was a citizen of Saorstát Éireann immediately before the coming into operation of this Constitution shall become and be a citizen of Ireland.</P>
    <P>2º The future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>3º No person may be excluded from Irish nationality and citizenship by reason of the sex of such person.</P>
    <P>How that deals with the question of nationality I do not know, but Deputy Dukes addressed this very well.  There is a clear, unambiguous content in Article 9.1.3º but there is no clear, unambiguous content in Article 40.1.  In other words if Article 40.1 was as unambiguous as Article 9 is in relation to citizenship, there would be no need for an amendment. It is because it is ambiguous that there is need for an amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to read into the record of the House what Deputies do not appear to have read, this morning's contribution in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> by Richard F. Humphreys, lecturer in law, University College, Cork, who strongly declares the need for an equal rights amendment.  He says:</P>
    <P>One might have been forgiven for predicting that a proposal to amend the <Col N="1849" /> Constitution to prohibit sex discrimination would attract the enthusiastic support of all members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Instead, however, Fine Gael's Bill to that effect, which will be voted on tonight, has been strongly opposed by the Government, and has received only a lukewarm reception from other party spokespersons.  This article argues that the Government's stated reasons for opposing the Bill are not only unpersuasive, but are beset with legal misconception.</P>
    <P>The Bill, introduced two weeks ago by Deputy Gay Mitchell, was roundly attacked in the Dáil by Government spokesperson Vincent Brady.  Deputy Brady's principal line of opposition to the proposed amendment is that &ldquo;it is merely another way of putting what is already in the Constitution&rdquo;, and therefore &ldquo;will not add one iota to the effectiveness of the Constitution with regard to the principle of equality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on the article says:</P>
    <P>The Government's claim that sex discrimination necessarily contravenes the existing Constitution is legally incorrect.  The general equality guarantee is seriously limited, not only by a clause permitting different treatment on the grounds of different &ldquo;capacity or social functions&rdquo;, but also by reference to other provisions of the Constitution which justify discrimination.</P>
    <P>Later in the article Mr. Humphreys says:</P>
    <P>In reliance on the circumscribed nature of the existing equality guarantee, the courts have in a number of cases upheld the validity of laws which discriminate on the grounds of sex (although it must be said that in the decided cases the discriminations have tended to fall more heavily on men). Differences between men and women regarding adoption were upheld in the Nicolau case; social welfare in the Dennehy cases; sexual offences in the <Col N="1850" /> Norris case; and citizenship in the Somjee case.</P>
    <P>The Government's claim that &ldquo;laws which discriminate solely on the grounds of sex are not permissible under the existing terms of the Constitution&rdquo; is, therefore, demonstrably erroneous.</P>
    <P>Further on the article continues:</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell, in introducing the Bill, emphasised that aside from its legal effects, it would have an important symbolic and educative value; particularly in setting a headline and in affecting attitudes over time.</P>
    <P>The Government's insistence in the Dáil that any constitutional amendment must have some direct and immediate practical impact has a rather strange flavour given Fianna Fáil's enthusiastic support for the abortion amendment of 1983, which was openly designed to &ldquo;copper-fasten&rdquo; and make explicit what was already implicitly in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This article concludes:</P>
    <P>... the Fine Gael proposal for an equal rights amendment is in principle an excellent one and entirely worthy of support.</P>
    <P>I have already said that the UN committee on anti-discrimination want this principle in our Constitution and in the Constitution of members.  The Women's Committee of the Council for Civil Liberties gave seven or eight points, all of which are on the record of this House already, for amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Those who advised the two Ministers of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and prepared their speeches should be hauled over the coals for the most dreadful responses to one of the most serious pieces of legislation to come before this House.  How are we to justify that women comprise only 6 per cent of people at the top level of the Civil Service and of the Judiciary and in our Parliament and Government, while 94 per cent are <Col N="1851" /> men?  The people who wrote those speeches had a vested interest in the views they expressed.  Perhaps they were blinkered.</P>
    <P>I commend this proposed amendment to the House and hope it will have all-party support.  It should stand on its own. It is time we unshackled women, gave <Col N="1852" /> them more opportunities and took the smugness from this Government and their advisers who had the temerity to come into the House with such a response to a well thought out and well argued proposal for constitutional change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, Sir, for having given me an opportunity to raise what is not a party political issue but rather a most pressing one in the public interest.  It is an issue of public funding and accountability.  Above all, it is one about the plight of the most vulnerable of our community, that of the mentally handicapped and, specifically, about the fact that, after more than five years, half of a purpose-built facility for the mentally handicapped, to which the State has contributed some £20 million, continues to remain vacant resulting from the inability of all patient effort to resolve the dispute at the heart of this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health must act now because, after years of futile discussions and negotiations, it is evident we have failed to tackle effectively the scandal of 60 places continuing to remain vacant at Cheeverstown House despite the proven extent of need within the community.</P>
      <P>I submit the stage has now been reached at which only legislation can effectively resolve the impasse that has continued for more than five years. Meanwhile, the 60 places to which I have referred are lying vacant while the need for more than 300 places has been established by the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped whose members were forced to take to the streets to air their grievance.  Almost £20 million of taxpayers' money has gone towards the creation of this purpose-built facility.  It cost £2 million roughly on an ongoing basis to fund it and the public agencies concerned &mdash; the Department of Health and the Eastern Health Board primarily &mdash; are impotent to resolve the problem and to at least meet on a part basis the pleas of the parents and the community for this very badly needed relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the matter in the House on a number of occasions.  As recently as 29 November on an Adjournment on the general plight of the mentally handicapped I referred specifically to Cheeverstown House and to a reply to a parliamentary question that day by the Minister for Health who said that a formula was now in place which he was happy, to the best of his expectations, would resolve the grievance.  It is now clear that that formula has failed, that the dispute continues and that there is a <Col N="1855" /> desperate need in the community for these places.  No longer can any party in the House justify our standing apart, notwithstanding how much we admire the voluntary sector.  The role of the voluntary sector has, indeed, been invaluable and its partnership with the Eastern Health Board can be reinstated but only after the Minister intervenes decisively to assert some element of democratic accountability and public control over the utilisation of these beds.  That is an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>It is six months since that undertaking was given to the House and I believe it was given in good faith but it has not managed to resolve the problem.  I do not think the problem will be resolved by negotiation and discussion at this stage. Consequently, this House has a responsibility to the taxpayer and, most of all, a responsibility to respond to the harrowing tales of woe one hears from parents who have children who are in need of the kind of respite that Cheeverstown House offers.  While there is that need in the community half of this facility is lying idle.  It is a shame.  We cannot stand over it.  The Minister has to act and all parties in the House will support that position.  Deputy Roche wants to indicate his assent with this, if that is permissible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank and congratulate Deputy Rabbitte for raising this issue.  He put it eloquently, and I do not think words are needed to add to what he said, that it is a scandal.  The issue of Cheeverstown House has been dragging on far too long.  Three hundred places are needed in the Eastern Health Board area.  Those of us concerned with the health issue, or the health board, have listened to the plight of these people.  A sum of £20 million of taxpayers' money has been put into that institution and it is costing of the order of £2 million to fund it.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, it is not a party political issue but it is an issue <Col N="1856" /> about power and power, unfortunately, has blotted out compassion on it.  It is a matter that will need rapid legislative and forceful action by the Minister at this stage.  The Minister gave an undertaking six months ago in good faith.  I realise that patient negotiations have now run out, the time for talking has ended and now we need to have decisive action.  I thank Deputy Rabbitte for giving me the opportunity to speak on this issue.</P>

      <P>On Thursday, 18 April this House was informed of the current situation regarding Cheeverstown House and of the initiatives undertaken by or facilitated by the Minister for Health to resolve the difficulties between Cheeverstown House and the Eastern Health Board.  The present initiative was undertaken during 1990 by representatives of the Federation of Voluntary Bodies providing services to people with mental handicap.  As a result of this initiative, a formula was agreed in October 1990 for a positive working relationship between Cheeverstown House and with the Eastern Health Board.  The agreement provided for a linked sequence of events over an 18 month period.  It provided for the recruitment of a chief executive officer to Cheeverstown House.  It included participation by Cheeverstown House on the mental handicap central planning committee of the Eastern Health Board. In so doing Cheeverstown House was provided with the opportunity to work in partnership with the health board and other voluntary mental handicap agencies to identify, agree and meet the urgent priority needs of the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once these steps had been taken, the agreement provided that additional funds would be allocated to Cheeverstown in 1991 to open additional facilities.  The role of Cheeverstown House in meeting <Col N="1857" /> the needs of the local catchment area was recognised in the agreement.</P>
    <P>A senior and much respected representative of the federation agreed to act as mediator between the Eastern Health Board and Cheeverstown House to assist with the implementation of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I am aware that difficulties have arisen in the implementation of this agreement. The federation mediator has withdrawn his services because in his view the board of Cheeverstown House was unwilling to abide by the terms of the agreement in relation to the recruitment of a chief executive officer which was central to the proper working of the agreement.  The federation's initiative is not yet over.  I understand that the federation has sought a meeting with the board of Cheeverstown House in an effort to convince the board of the importance of making the agreement work.  One can only hope that the board will accede to this request.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, the Minister for Health has dealt patiently with the board of Cheeverstown House.  He has allowed the various initiatives to resolve the difficulties between the board of Cheeverstown House and the Eastern Health Board ample time to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The issue at the core of the dispute is the reluctance of the board of Cheeverstown House to agree to an admissions policy acceptable, at first to the Department of Health and subsequently, to the Eastern Health Board. It is essential that mental handicap services, funded from public funds, are provided for those whose needs are greatest. In the Eastern Health Board area, there is a mental handicap co-ordinating committee, chaired by the Eastern Health Board and with representatives of the main voluntary bodies in the region.  They have agreed a common waiting list, based on need.  It is essential that as places become available in mental handicap centres, they are filled by people on this <Col N="1858" /> list.  As far as practicable, it is the policy of the committee that people will be placed in the centre closest to their home. This is the arrangement with which every other voluntary mental handicap agency in the Eastern Health Board agrees. Why, we must ask, is Cheeverstown House the only voluntary mental handicap agency in the region which does not have an excellent working relationship with the Eastern Health Board?</P>
    <P>One must also ask whose interest Cheeverstown House is serving.  Can it truly say that it is serving the needs of the mental handicap population of the catchment area or the families as provided for in the agreement.  Cheeverstown House is situated on the doorstep of a densely populated area with families who have a great need for its facilities.  On the basis of the agreement it was the intention to provide additional funding to Cheeverstown House to enable it to open additional places this year.  I must express my deep personal disappointment with the unwillingness of the board, to date, to operate an agreement which was painstakingly and thoroughly formulated and which was in the best interests of people with mental handicap in the area.</P>
    <P>I would like to reassure the House, and the families of people with mental handicap in South West Dublin, of one thing.  The Eastern Health Board had hoped to honour their part of the agreement to fund additional places at Cheeverstown House this year.  The funds remain available to provide additional places for people with mental handicap.  The health board are not dependent on Cheeverstown House for these additional places.  With the co-operation of the other voluntary mental handicap organisation, such as the St. John of God Brothers, the daughters of Charity, St. Michael's House, Stewart's Hospital, alternative residential places and day places can be provided for people on the priority waiting list of the Eastern Health Board this year.  The funds which <Col N="1859" /> were earmarked for Cheeverstown House this year will be diverted to other voluntary agencies if Cheeverstown House refuses to work the agreement.</P>
    <P>I want one message to go to Cheeverstown House from this House this evening; that is &mdash; operate the agreement to which it is a party.  There is still time for Cheeverstown House to reconsider its position and an opportunity for Cheeverstown House itself to resolve the present difficulties.  Failing this the Minister is determined to act.  Reluctant as the Minister is to interfere with the autonomy of a voluntary agency, he is determined to ensure that the Cheeverstown facility which was provided by public funds is put into full use for the benefit of the people for whom it was built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the issue of the appalling conditions in Ardfinnan national school.  I have a personal interest in this school as it is in my parish.  It caters for 303 students in totally inadequate, unsuitable and depressing circumstances. The nine teachers and the school principal try to cope with a lack of sufficient accommodation, poor quality classrooms and overcrowding in the halls and play area.  They do not have a general purpose room, a staff room or indeed an adequate principal's office.  With the exception of two classes of 34 students, all other classes have in excess of 40 pupils.  For the past ten years efforts have been made to have an extension built onto the school.  Indeed at various times the extension was approved by the Department of Education, sketch plans were drawn up, then changed and withdrawn.  Today, ten years later and after five deputations to various Ministers for Education Ardfinnan school has not had the new extension and the project is still at stage one, the sketch drawing of the plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I visited the school to view <Col N="1860" /> their circumstances.  I was appalled at what I saw.  In the two pre-fabs the children in second and third class had to jump from the hall into the classroom so big was the hole that was caused by flooding and decay over the years.  The fact that the pupils did not break a leg or indeed any limb is a tribute to the vigilance of the teachers.  The walls of the pre-fabs also have big holes and cracks due to both poor quality materials and decay.  In the building dating from 1911, all the walls are black and grey due to severe dampness. The play area was crowded.  It was never intended that it would have to cope with the number of children attending the school.  They have no sheltered area or green space.</P>
    <P>On that occasion I met the principal on the corridor and he was doing his work on the window sill.  His office if it could indeed be called such, was occupied by a visiting psychologist.  Indeed if any visitor comes to the school it means that the principal must retire to the corridor and do his work on the window sill.  The roof of the old building is in a serious condition as I have outlined.  The school is unfit, unsuitable and totally inadequate.  Something has to be done urgently about the conditions of the school.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister replies I want to tell him that we are tired of hearing about sketch plans about to be finalised.  We are weary of hearing of designs that have to be changed.  The board of management and the local community have the necessary local financial contribution in the bank for almost eight years.  I urge the Minister to give Ardfinnan school the priority it deserves and to allow the teachers and pupils in Ardfinnan to work in an environment that is conductive to progressive education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for her contribution on this case and for the patient manner in which she has made her case to date.  I accept completely the urgency of the case and I <Col N="1861" /> welcome the opportunity to outline my intentions regarding Ardfinnan national school in County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that conditions at the school are far from satisfactory and that congestion is a particular difficulty.  There are ten teachers, including, as the Deputy has said, the non-teaching school principal, and they have an enrolment of 306 pupils.  The accommodation consists of six permanent classrooms and a general purposes room as well as two prefabricated classrooms which were provided new in 1986.  As I have said, I accept that conditions at the school are not satisfactory and for this reason the Department have approved four permanent classrooms and necessary improvements to the existing premises. This particular case is one of just a few remaining schools in the country where the conditions need urgently to be improved.</P>
      <P>I will put the delay in context.  When we took over four years ago, a couple of hundred schools were in a very bad condition and at that time the information from the departmental officials was that it would take eight years to clear the very worst cases at the rate of progress they were making at that time. For this reason it was necessary to scrap many of the plans which would have cost outrageous money.  Unfortunately that is what happened in the case of Ardfinnan. The extension which will now be provided will cost approximately half of what it would have cost if we had gone ahead with the original sketch plan.  Given the shortage of resources it would have taken us much longer to deal with the long back log.  This is the reason for the delay.  I do not offer it as an excuse but rather as an explanation for the difficulties we have had in trying to get around to all of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that we are at an advanced stage with regard to the completion of those sketch plans, and very shortly we will be forwarding the plans to the school authorities to enable <Col N="1862" /> them to apply for planning permission.  I accept that it is a matter of urgency but the Deputy will accept that the various planning stages have to be undertaken until we get to the tendering and contractual stages.  I acknowledge there have been delays but I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to proceed as quickly as possible.  In the meantime I have asked our architect to look at the immediate problems that exist with regard to the prefab accommodation.  I assure the Deputy we will carry out the necessary improvements immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At first glance one might wonder why it is necessary to raise in our national parliament the question of the appointment of a single teacher to a school.  Unfortunately it is necessary when a situation becomes as serious as the one I am going to outline tonight.  I hope the Minister will not regard it as a minor, insignificant issue and that he will focus his attention on it and grant what is an undemanding request which will not bankrupt any budgets but will give great relief to a school that is under great pressure at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CBS secondary school in Wexford has undertaken to admit 110 pupils in September this year.  That was agreed by the principal when he understood a pupil-teacher ratio of 19:1 would apply under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> On that basis he understood he would have adequate staff to cope with 110 pupils.  There are that many clamouring for places in his school.  The Minister will know from a previous case I raised a matter of weeks ago that there is no spare capacity in any other school in Wexford; in fact, they are all under severe pressure due thankfully to a growing population in the town. Having agreed to take in 110 children in September, he now finds out that the 19:1 pupil teacher ratio will not happen this year, in fact it is hoped it will happen <Col N="1863" /> in the year 1992-93.  He is faced with a dilemma.  In September 1991, the 1991-92 school year, the school will have at least 490 pupils depending on how many are allowed to do repeats.  However let us focus specifically on the intake class. Obviously the intake of 110 pupils will have to be divided into classes of 40, 40 and 30 pupils.  The classrooms are relatively modern in the new block and 40 young adolescent pupils are being put into a classroom which is relatively small and cannot cope with 40 pupils.  I visited the school and I saw 40 pupils being put into the room.  They physically do not fit and the furniture will not fit in, and the school authorities just do not know what they are going to do.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister would accept for a minute that it is good, sound educational policy to begin the crucial stage of secondary education with classes of that size.</P>
    <P>The school has a mixed socio-economic intake.  Of the 110 pupils, 20 per cent have unemployed fathers.  It is a large urban school in the heart of Wexford town.  Although it is serving a mixed socio-economic grouping and is a main school in a large town, it is still not large enough to qualify for ex-quota staffing. It does not have any ex-quota guidance teacher, vice-principal or remedial teacher &mdash; in fact, it has no remedial teacher at all &mdash; to cater for those who are educationally disadvantaged; as I said, 17 of the intake pupils this year fall into that category.  What the school is asking for is not great recognition, extra quota teachers or great help but simply to be allowed operate on the principle on which they assumed they would be operating from next September, that the pupil/teacher ratio would be 19:1 which would give them an extra teacher to cope with this intake.</P>
    <P>I would mention in passing the condition of the school.  I want to singularly underscore that two classrooms are pre-fabs that have been there for a very long <Col N="1864" /> time.  In fact, I was educated in them a good number of years ago, and they have deteriorated a lot since then.  They are now, quite frankly, in a hopeless state of disrepair.  There are holes in the floors which are quite dangerous and the fabric of the prefabricated buildings is ridden with wood lice which makes it a very unattractive place in which to teach. When you stamp on the floor you are liable to be showered with lice from the holes in the ceiling.  It is a scandal that these buildings should remain as classrooms.  There is no cry and no screaming about it, but hopefully, things will improve so far as the fabric of the building is concerned.</P>
    <P>The request I have been asked to put before the Minister is an extremely modest and simple one, that the extra teacher who is urgently needed would be provided one year before the appointment is due to come on stream.  I would urgently request the Minister to give very sympathetic consideration to this modest and simple demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this issue as it affords me an opportunity to inform the House of the position in relation to staffing levels and the pupil teacher ratio in post-primary schools.  Before referring to the situation in Wexford CBS, I would like first to set out the position in post-primary schools generally.</P>
      <P>A common pupil/teacher ratio of 20:1 was introduced from the beginning of the 1988-89 school year.  No change was made in relation to the ex-quota position of principal and those of guidance teachers in schools with at least 500 recognised pupils.  Posts as resource teachers established for the purpose of catering for the needs of mildly mentally handicapped pupils continue to be allocated.  At present almost 300 additional posts are available for remedial teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commitment was given under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that <Col N="1865" /> the PTR would be kept under review.  In line with this, a &ldquo;retention ratio&rdquo; was introduced for the 1990-91 school year. Under this arrangement my Department authorise such additional allocation as would be warranted by the application of a PTR of 19:1 in place of a 20:1 PTR for the purpose of retaining existing authorised teachers.  In addition to this concession an allocation of posts &mdash; 60 in all &mdash; was made to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas on the basis of agreed criteria.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will result in an improvement in the pupil/teacher ratio in post-primary schools.  A phased programme, starting in 1992-93 and for completion in 1994-95, will be introduced to provide for the recognition on an ex-quota basis of 0.5 of a whole-time post for guidance in secondary and community-comprehensive schools in the 350 to 499 enrolment category, with a similar provision for vocational schools to be made on a VEC scheme basis.  Wexford CBS is one of the schools which will benefit under this provision.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the PESP provision, a further 60 posts will be allocated to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas for the 1991-92 school year.  The position will be reviewed in 1993.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> also provides for the phasing in of a pupil/teacher ratio of 19:1 over 1991 and 1992 for recruitment purposes.  As a first step, a ratio of 19.5:1 is being applied for recruitment purposes for the 1991-92 school year and the &ldquo;retention ratio&rdquo; to which I referred earlier is also being applied for retention purposes.  The 19:1 ratio will be applied for all purposes for the 1992-93 school year.</P>
    <P>The PESP also provides for the introduction of a phased programme, starting in 1992-93 and for completion in 1994-95 to provide for the recognition on an ex-quota basis of vice-principals in post-primary schools of 500 pupils and over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> I come now to the position of Wexford CBS secondary school.  The quota of incremental teachers for the school is calculated on an enrolment figure of 477 pupils.  Using the PTR of 19:5:1 the school is entitled to a quota of 24 incremental teachers in addition to the principal.  I understand that one teacher will be retiring at the end of the current school year leaving a vacancy to be filled. The principal of the school has made a case to the Department for the appointment of an additional teacher on the basis of projected enrolments.  However, the increase projected falls well short of the number required to justify the appointment of an additional teacher this year. Should the enrolment figures for the current school year be maintained, the school would be entitled to an extra teacher for the 1992-93 school year following the reduction of the PTR to 19:1.</P>
    <P>I should mention that for the school years 1988-89 and 1990-91 the Department accepted the projected enrolment figures supplied by the school for the purposes of determining the staffing level and this resulted in the school being allowed to retain teachers who would otherwise have been placed on the redeployment panel.  That is a significant factor that should be taken into account. In all the circumstances, I feel that Wexford CBS has been treated very fairly by my Department and the application for the appointment of an additional teacher for the 1991-92 year cannot be granted.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two minutes statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Energy.  I propose to call on the Deputies I have selected in the following order: first, Deputy Gerry Reynolds, second, Deputy Michael Finucane in respect of two matters and third, Deputy Philip Hogan. <Col N="1867" /> Each Deputy is entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and each statement will be followed immediately by a two minute reply by the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for being here.  I raise this matter on grievance time because it was brought to my attention this week that a constituent of mine who is a widow applied to be a participant in a social employment scheme in her local area but was unsuccessful due to an anomaly in the system. She is very much involved in the local community and the community got together to try to have a social employment scheme in the area.  There seems to be an anomaly in the system which I hope the Minister will correct.  There also seems to be a certain amount of discrimination against widows in this country, this lady is relatively young, has a young family and wishes to find employment. This would be an ideal type of employment for her for 12 months, but, due to an administration factor she is not able to gain employment this way.  I would be grateful if some change could be made so that this person would be entitled to get employment under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme is the principle Manpower intervention to assist the long term unemployed and provides an opportunity for persons who have been long term unemployed to become involved in work, albeit on a part-time basis, for one year.  Participants must be over 25 years of age and in receipt of unemployment assistance or registered as unemployed for over 12 months and in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows who satisfy these conditions can participate in the scheme.  The demand for places exceeds the number available, so an extension of the eligibility <Col N="1868" /> criteria to additional categories of persons could only be at the expense of those for whom the scheme was devised.  I take the point which Deputy Gerry Reynolds made but I should like to point out that the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> includes a recommendation that the live register requirements in the case of women applicants should be relaxed to facilitate women who wish to return to the workforce.  I have already indicated to the House that I am examining ways in which this recommendation can be implemented and later on in the year we will formulate proposals to see if that can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to McCormack Joinery Works in Ardagh, County Limerick, where an industrial dispute has been going on for some time. The Minister is aware of the history of this dispute because he was kind enough to respond to a question of mine on a previous occasion which I hoped would lead to success in resolving the dispute.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter as a result of frustration on the part of the workers because the dispute is still going on and the factory has closed down.  The nub of the issue appears to be that the management are not prepared to recognise the trade union's right to negotiate on behalf of the workers.  Within the mechanism of the new Labour Relations Commission, is there a provision for a body like that to get involved to seek a resolution to this issue and to break the impasse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute began in December last and involves about 26 workers.  It centres on the issue of union recognition and a retrospective pay increase.  Since I spoke to the House on this dispute in February last, the Labour Court issued a recommendation that the company should recognise and negotiate with the union. However, the recommendation has not been implemented by the management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission <Col N="1869" /> have been in touch and continue their efforts to bring the parties together to try to resolve the impasse.  However, I must point out to the House that, while workers have a right to join a union, employers have the right to decline to recognise it.  Unfortunately, that is the position in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The second matter is in relation to a recruitment consultancy firm which approached me when two advertisements appeared in a newspaper.  In one case FÁS were looking for a bar manager and steward; in the other, Shannon Free Airport Development Company were looking for a general manager. The point was made to me that this was unfair competition in relation to FÁS and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
      <P>In the past, when employment was probably a little more buoyant, FÁS were very much involved in this aspect.  What is the current policy in relation to FÁS advertising for managerial positions? Perhaps the Minister will comment on both cases as the other company are also semi-State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Services Act, 1987, specifies that one of the principal functions of FÁS is the provision of an employment service whereby persons seeking employment and persons offering employment are brought into contact with each other.  The Deputy will be aware that there are over 246,000 people on the live register at present.  It behoves FÁS, as the national placement service, to do everything they can to find employment for as many of these people as possible.  This requires the organisation to co-operate in every way with employers to assist them to fill the vacancies as quickly and effectively as possible.  This co-operation may require FÁS to advertise vacancies on behalf of the employers when suitably skilled <Col N="1870" /> people are not available on the live register. In such circumstances the employer bears the cost of the advertisement.</P>
      <P>The provision of a free employment service is a commitment into which Ireland entered through the participation in the International Labour Organisation. That may be of interest to the Deputy because a criticism of the organisation is that they do not have a high enough share of the vacancies available. Other member states &mdash; namely, Italy and Germany &mdash; do not permit the operation of private employment agencies. The figures which these organisations show in relation to securing jobs for people compared to FÁS are naturally far higher.  Non-EC countries, like Sweden, which have very good organisations in this regard, do not allow private employment agencies.  We do and that is where the problem arises.  In the meantime, FÁS have a statutory duty in that regard which they must attempt to fulfil.</P>

I am aware that the Minister made an announcement in regard to this matter some time ago but I am merely seeking information on the progress of the work which will get natural gas to the business community, <Col N="1871" /> hospitals and domestic consumers as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to give a progress report in relation to the plan he envisage for the installation of a very cheap and efficient domestic fuel?  It is important to bring a native source of fuel like natural gas to Kilkenny because it is environmentally friendly and smog-free and we are very conscious of our environment in the Kilkenny city area.  This would make a major contribution towards enhancing our environment as well as making a competitive and cheap fuel available to make our business more competitive in the years and decades ahead.</P>

      <P>The idea of natural gas for Kilkenny was first mooted by BGE in 1983, when they had under consideration a project involving the supply of gas to an industrial market and the Kilkenny Gas Company.  The proposal did not proceed due to the condition of the gas network in the city. No alternative viable project could be identified at the time and in 1986, BGE were asked to assist the Kilkenny Gas Company in the orderly close down of their operations.  BGE purchased the Kilkenny network in 1986 and a spur-line to the city outskirts was built in 1987, in order to facilitate the supply of gas to commercial and industrial consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions have been ongoing with potential customers since then.  While <Col N="1872" /> none has been connected to date, a new proposal to supply commercial customers in Kilkenny city with natural gas emerged in mid-1990 and was approved by the board of BGE.  The approved project involves the expenditure of over £420,000 for the construction of a ring main which follows the new ring road from Purcellsinch Industrial Estate, continuing on to connect Kilcreen Hospital and over-land to St. Luke's Hospital on the Fethard Road.</P>
    <P>Supply contracts have been agreed with the South Eastern Health Board, for the supply of gas to three hospitals in Kilkenny and with a number of industrial and commercial customers.  Negotiations are continuing with other potential customers. It is hoped to have these discussions concluded shortly.  Construction of the main pipelines will commence in mid-May and will extend through the summer.</P>
    <P>It is expected that natural gas will flow to the first customer in Kilkenny by early August 1991.</P>
    <P>Initial gas sales will be over 800,000 therms per annum.  Provision has been made for the extension of the network to connect other industrial and commercial customers within the city.  The question of supplying domestic customers in areas adjacent to the pipeline will be considered in the future, if viable projects can be identified.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 May 1991.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Means from farming for unemployment assistance purposes are assessed on a factual basis and are investigated by social welfare officers.  These assessments make allowances for all the typical expenses and for any exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Means are not assessed on the basis of stock on hand.  They are assessed by reference to sales of stock and farm produce in the past 12 months plus income from grants and subsidies.</P>
      <P>Receipts from sales of product and livestock are verified where practicable and take account of prevailing market prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> I am satisfied with the general instructions given to social welfare officers in relation to means investigation generally and that social welfare officers and their district supervisors are fully aware of current trends in farming in their areas.</P>
    <P>The actual decisions as to the weekly means to be reckoned for unemployment assistance purposes are made by statutory deciding officers who take account of the reports made by the social welfare officers.  Any unemployment assistance applicant who is not satisfied with the deciding officer's assessment may appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office and submit evidence in support of the appeal.</P>
    <P>Deciding officers and appeals officers see reports from many social welfare officers and this assists in ensuring that consistent approaches continue to be applied.</P>

      <P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy.  From July 1991, a single person on long term unemployment assistance will receive £55 per week, which is 21.0 per cent of the gross male average industrial wage.  A person with a dependent spouse and with two children will receive £112 per week, which is 42.8 per cent of the gross male average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>However, as unemployment payments are not subject to tax, a more useful comparison is with the average industrial wage, net of tax and PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From July 1991, a single person on long term unemployment assistance will receive 33.6 per cent of the net male average industrial wage.  A person with a dependent spouse and with two children will receive 57.4 per cent of the net male average industrial wage.  The net earnings <Col N="1705" /> are based on the standard tax allowances for a single person and a married person with a dependent spouse and two children.</P>
    <P>In addition to the basic rate, a recipient of long term unemployment assistance may also qualify for the free fuel allowance, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, and the EC butter voucher scheme.</P>
    <P>These percentages are based on the latest available figure for the gross male average industrial wage, which is £261.80 per week as of June 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The number of FIS recipients now stands at 6,568.  This is the highest figure ever recorded, and is 32 per cent above the corresponding figure for March 1989.  Family income supplement now provides for 24,536 children.  This increased level of take-up reflects the major improvements which I have made to the scheme in recent years.  These include a substantial increase in the income limits for eligibility, a reduction of the hours-to-work qualification from 24 to 20 hours, an increase in the number of qualifying children in a family from five to eight and implementation of a minimum £5 weekly payment for all recipients.  Take-up has been further encouraged by extensive publicity campaigns, and removal of the fear, which some claimants had, that FIS income would result in loss of the medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, the weekly income limits will be raised to £140 for a one-child family and £276 for a family with eight children.  The amount of FIS awarded will no longer be constrained by maximum payment limits.  For the first time children aged between 18 and 21 years who are attending full-time education will be <Col N="1706" /> regarded as qualifying children.  I am satisfied that these measures will ensure a further substantial increase in the numbers taking up the scheme.</P>
    <P>The purpose of FIS is to increase the incentive to work of low paid employees with families.  Because it is paid on a weekly basis, it provides an immediate cash supplement to encourage workers to remain in employment.  Payment of FIS on the basis of income tax returns would not be practicable.  Low paid workers could not afford to wait until the end of the tax year to receive their entitlements. If, on the other hand, payments were to be based on the previous year's tax returns, workers who had experienced a decrease in their earnings in the current year would be unable to benefit from FIS.</P>
    <P>My Department are co-operating closely with the Revenue Commissioners in encouraging the widest possible take-up of FIS.  This year, the Revenue Commissioners circularised all low paid taxpayers alerting them to the possibility that they might be exempt from all taxation, by virtue of the increase in tax exemption limits announced in the budget.  As part of this process, the Revenue Commissioners included details of the possible FIS entitlements of these taxpayers, and urged them to contact my Department.  Similar details were included in press notices issued by the Revenue Commissioners setting out the changes in the income tax code for the tax year 1991-92.</P>

      <Quest>if he will allow the right of appeal to persons who have been assessed by the maintenance recovery pensions services and found to be liable for the support and maintenance of a spouse in receipt of a deserted wife's benefit/ allowance or lone parent's allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The new liable relative's provisions came into force on 29 November 1990.  Under these provisions a man is responsible for maintaining his spouse <Col N="1707" /> and children and a woman for maintaining her spouse and children.  If he or she fails or neglects to do so and payments have to be awarded under the schemes for lone parents, deserted wives, or under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme they, the liable relatives, are required to contribute towards the cost of such payments.</P>
      <P>In calculating the maintenance contribution due by the liable relative account is taken of the person's particular financial circumstances and commitments, including commitments to dependants now living with that person. The legislation does not specify a formula to be applied in determining this contribution and I do not propose to set hard and fast rules at this stage, pending experience of the operation of the scheme.  In all cases of separation or desertion, however, the maximum amount due is the total weekly payment being made to the dependent spouse and children.  Where the liable relative is not married to the other parent of his-her children, he or she is only liable to contribute towards the cost of the child dependent allowances.</P>
      <P>In general the maintenance contribution is determined by reference to the liable relative's net income, after allowance has been made for outgoings on tax, PRSI, housing costs and so on. Allowance is also made for the living expenses of the liable relative and dependants living with him or her.  In general, the amount of such allowances is based on allowances under the social welfare schemes.</P>
      <P>The contribution due is 50 per cent of the balance of the net income, subject to the limit of the amount of the payment being made in respect of the liable relative's spouse and/or children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any liable relative who is dissatisfied with the amount of the contribution he or she is required to pay can write to and/or discuss the matter with the relevant officials of my Department who have been instructed to examine fully all such queries raised.  If the complaints are <Col N="1708" /> well founded an appropriate adjustment of the amount due will be made.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to have a review of the scheme carried out after it has been in operation for a year.  The question of changes in the administration of the new arrangements, including the question of a right of appeal against decisions made on the contributions which liable relatives are required to make will be considered in the context of that review.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the House that I am very aware of the situation of single parents on low incomes.  I have introduced significant improvements in the social welfare area for this group in recent years.  I introduced the deserted husband's and widower's scheme in October 1989; the lone parent's allowance scheme in October 1990, which streamlined the existing arrangements and extended their scope to include separated persons and unmarried fathers; and the back-to-school clothing allowance also in 1990.</P>
      <P>The increase in the rates of payment last year meant that the priority rate of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare has already been achieved.  The improvements provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1991 mean that this rate is maintained in real terms this year at £69 for a lone parent with one child.  As stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the aim is to increase social welfare rates further and progressively, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission, as the resources of the economy grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means-test applied to lone parents is better than for other social welfare recipients with a £6 weekly earnings exemption per child, together with allowances for child-minding and travel to <Col N="1709" /> work expenses, which allow a single parent the option of supplementing her or his social welfare payment with part-time earnings.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the programme, the Government are committed to an ongoing programme of reform of the social welfare system broadly within the framework outlined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Recent reports have highlighted the particular requirements of families and the need for a particular focus in meeting their needs.  In that context, resources on a scale necessary to implement the additional child income-support measures recommended by the Commission &mdash; some £69 million in 1990 terms &mdash; will be devoted to child income-support over a ten year period.  The particular measures to be taken will be worked out in the light of up-to-date information on child and family circumstances and in the light of available resources.  The position of single parents will be kept under review in this context.</P>

      <P>An age limit of 18 years has applied for a long number of years for the purposes of child dependant increases of social welfare payments except in the case of recipients of widow's pension and other analogous payments where increases continued to be payable up to age 21 in respect of children who continued in full-time education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989, I initiated a process of progressively raising the age limit up to which increases in respect of dependent children are payable to recipients of other long term social welfare payments where the children are in full-time education. This process was completed in the Social Welfare Act, 1991 and from July next, <Col N="1710" /> increases in respect of dependent children in full-time education will be payable up to age 21 in the case of recipients of all long term payments.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, increases in respect of dependent children of recipients of short term payments, including supplementary welfare allowance, are payable up to age 18.  The question of paying such increases beyond age 18 will be considered in the context of future developments and in the light of budgeting constraints.</P>

      <P>The claim of the person concerned was reviewed in October 1990 with regard to his efforts to obtain employment.

Claims are periodically reviewed to ensure that claimants continue to satisfy these statutory conditions.</P>
      <P>He supplied the names of two employers from whom he had sought work and stated that there was no work available in the locality.  His claim, with the report of the interview, was submitted to a deciding officer who took the view that he had not made satisfactory efforts to get work and disallowed his claim from 7 November 1990 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>He appealed the disallowance to the independent social welfare appeals office and submitted three further letters from employers, dated January 1991, in support of his appeal.  He attended an oral hearing of his appeal on 13 March 1991.

      <P>The lone parent allowance scheme which I introduced in November 1990 is means-tested.  This requires that claimants' means and family circumstances have to be assessed.  In most cases, this involves a visit and interview by a social welfare officer.</P>
      <P>The lone parents scheme is not confined to deserted wives.  It is available to men and women who do not have a partner to assist them in rearing children. Unlike the schemes which it subsumes, it does not seek to categorise that claimants and recipients.</P>
      <P>Under the old arrangements, lengthy delays did occur where there were disputes as to desertion and both parties had to be contacted, sometimes several times, before the facts could be fully established.</P>
      <P>I have also recently introduced more streamlined assessment procedures to reduce the time taken to investigate and decide claims.  These important measures will be gradually extended, as other new controls are developed and applied, and will, in due course, cover the lone parents scheme.

      <P>The level of support for local community-based activities has been significantly improved in recent years.</P>
      <P>I fully recognise the valuable contributions being made by the many voluntary and community groups working in the social services area in this country.  I have a strong commitment to action at local level to increase the social and economic well being of local communities and I will continue to expand and develop the practical supports provided by my Department for such activities.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funding provided for the community development and EC poverty programmes, I am providing £750,000 this year for the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations in the social services area.  Many of these organisations are working at local level providing services and support to local communities.  I am providing a further £500,000 to continue the scheme of grants for locally based women's groups which I introduced last year.</P>
      <P>Last year, also, I was able to initiate a specific community development programme under which funding is provided for resource centres in certain urban and rural areas.  The activities being undertaken through these resource centres include local enterprise initiatives and projects with the elderly, young families, single parents, the unemployed and other groups in need of help, support, advice and information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis in the projects is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the <Col N="1715" /> problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the areas concerned.  A key feature of the programme is that the projects have security of funding for a three-year period.</P>
    <P>This year the Government have provided an additional £225,000 for the programme bringing the overall allocation to £750,000.  This represents an increase of over 40 per cent.  These additional resources will be used to extend the programme to areas not at present covered and to provide further resources to the 15 projects already included in the programme to enable them further develop their activities.</P>
    <P>I am also providing almost £450,000 this year, via the Combat Poverty Agency, to the third Irish projects participating in the third EC poverty programme. Under this programme two large area-based projects are being funded, one in Limerick city and the other in north and west Connemara while a third project involving the travelling community based in Dublin is also being funded.</P>

      <P>I am committed to providing social welfare clients with as wide a range of payment options as possible.  My Department already uses a variety of payment methods &mdash; cash, cheque and personalised payable orders &mdash; to pay social welfare clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress is being made towards developing and installing the necessary support systems for the introduction of <Col N="1716" /> new payment options.  These options will include an electronic fund transfer (EFT) system whereby payments generally can be made direct into a person's current or deposit account.  It is expected that an EFT facility will be introduced for child benefit recipients during the first half of 1992.  In time this will be extended to other groups of recipients including old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>These developments will provide a choice in the method by which people can receive their social welfare entitlements. My Department are also working closely with An Post on developments of this nature and are, in principle, prepared to co-invest over the next ten years with An Post in the automation of An Post's counter services.</P>
    <P>This will enable a wide range of services to be made available, using modern technology, to customers of An Post generally and to social welfare clients in particular. One of these is expected to be a form of household budgeting which pensioners could request for regular bills such as rent and ESB.  The overall intention is to make facilities of the type which banks offer to their customers more generally available to all categories of social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment in 1975, Coolock Community Law Centre has been <Col N="1717" /> funded variously by the Department of Justice, the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty, my own Department and in recent years, through the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>Arising from my concern about the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the centre's funding, I arranged in 1987 for the Combat Poverty Agency to fund the centre for a three year period to the end of 1989.  This funding amounted to £60,000 per year.  I also arranged for an additional grant of £10,000 from the agency in late 1988 to clear the centre's long-standing overdraft together with a further grant of £6,000 in late 1989.</P>
    <P>During this period, the agency undertook a comprehensive review of the centre's activities.  In the light of this review the Government decided that the centre should continue to be funded by the agency at the increased level of £70,000 per year for the period 1990 to 1992.</P>
    <P>This represents a substantial increase in the level of funding over that provided in 1989.  It was also intended to give the centre security of funding at this level for a three-year period so that they could plan their operations accordingly.  The question of funding for the centre after 1992 will be considered in due course.</P>
    <P>The centre have not requested a meeting to discuss their funding position but any such request should be made to my office in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The basic principle guiding Government policy on refugees is the need to encourage and assist where possible efforts by the international community to build up respect for human rights and to resolve inter state and regional conflicts and disputes, in order to make it possible for the millions of refugees worldwide to return to their homes.</P>
      <P>Until these solutions are found, international measures are necessary to protect and support refugees.  These include the Geneva Conventions and the operation of the United Nations and other agencies which assist refugees.  I have primary responsibility for relationships with the international agencies &mdash; in particular the leading UN agency, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees &mdash; for funding emergency relief for refugees and for the admission and integration of refugees brought to Ireland under Government decision.  Asylum seekers are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my areas of responsibility, I am pleased to note, first, that we have increased our contribution to general operations of UNHCR by 5 per cent in the current year.  In addition, Ireland continues to contribute generously to UNHCR and other agencies involved in relief operations for refugees in different parts of the world.  The most recent example is that of the Kurdish refugees for which £0.55 million in bilateral aid has been provided, including <Col N="1723" /> £0.15 million for UNHCR and £0.685 million through the Community budget.</P>
    <P>Since 1985 my Department have responsibility for a programme of admission and integration of Vietnamese refugees and their immediate families in Ireland.  Their present number stands at over 400.  Our policy is to enable them &ldquo;to integrate into Irish society and to share in and contribute to its development&rdquo;. This is done by providing special intensive assistance after arrival to ensure that they benefit from the full range of public services available to Irish people and by providing english language classes.  New arrivals are also brought to the attention of voluntary groups who can help in very valuable but informal ways in the development of contacts with the Irish community and in bridging the gap between the refugees' experience and that of Irish society.</P>
    <P>Following on the recommendations of a report by the Policy Advisory Committee on Refugees (PAC) the Government decided recently to establish a refugee agency by merging the PAC and the Refugee Resettlement Committee (RRC).  Although these two committees, both in operation since 1986, had somewhat different functions &mdash; that of the PAC being to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs on policy matters which may arise in dealing with the admission and integration of refugees into Ireland on foot of Government decisions, while that of the RRC was to deal with the practical day-to-day aspects of the Government's refugee resettlement programme &mdash; they effectively worked in parallel with each other and it was decided that there was no need for two separate committees.</P>
    <P>Under its terms of reference, the refugee agency will combine the functions of the PAC and RRC.  It will be responsible for the development of policies for the reception and integration of refugees in Ireland.  It will arrange, in co-ordination with the relevant public authorities, practical assistance in key areas such as accommodation, social welfare and English language courses.  In view of the <Col N="1724" /> importance of social integration it will also try to nurture community support, particularly on a local basis.  It will operate under the aegis of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who will appoint the board of directors to be drawn mainly from relevant Government Departments.</P>
    <P>A new development is that it will be chaired by an independent unpaid chairman to be appointed by the Minister.  It will be funded by a Government grant-in-aid which will be paid, as at present in the case of the RRC, on an annual basis by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The refugee agency will be responsible for the reception and integration of all refugees admitted into Ireland under Government decisions but not asylum seekers for whom separate arrangements apply.</P>

      <P>Ireland believes that the political issues related to East Timor are best resolved in the negotiations between the countries directly concerned &mdash; Portugal and Indonesia &mdash; under the auspices of the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The Secretary-General has been given a mandate by the general assembly to facilitate a comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor and to conduct consultations with all the parties concerned. Ireland fully supports the Secretary-General in this endeavour.  We wish to see a just, overall solution to the problems of East Timor, a solution which is recognised by the international community and which complies with the principles of the United Nations Charter, including respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add that the issue of human rights for the people of East Timor is one <Col N="1725" /> which continues to be of great concern to me.  As recently as 27 February the issue of East Timor was raised by Ireland and its partners in the twelve at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>

The EC Commission met nongovernmental representatives of migrant communities originating outside, but now resident within, the member states of the European Community.  I understand that the forum will be an EC wide body, allowing the migrant community to establish a political dialogue with European Community institutions.</P>

      <P>I and my colleagues in the EC have <Col N="1726" /> for some considerable time past followed with attention developments in Peru, including the human rights area.</P>
      <P>Every effort has been and continues to be made by the EC member states to encourage the new President to make all possible efforts to ensure full respect for human rights.</P>
      <P>In his inaugural speech President Fujimori stated that &ldquo;the unconditional respect and promotion of human rights will be a firm line of action during my Government&rdquo;.  On the occasion of the investiture of the President the Community and its member states issued a statement in which they expressed the hope that Peru would rediscover the path of peace and development in full respect of the fundamental rights of the human person.</P>
      <P>In its ongoing dialogue with the countries of Latin America the Community takes every opportunity of making those countries aware of the concern of the EC member states in relation to violations of human rights.  The question of human rights in Peru has also been raised through the human rights procedures of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In regard to the cholera epidemic and as stated in the Dáil recently, Ireland has contributed an allocation of £20,000 from the disaster relief fund in response to the appeal by the Peruvian Government for international assistance.</P>
      <P>The fact that we do not at present have an honorary consul in Peru has not detracted from the attention which Ireland has paid and continues to pay to the problems in that country.  I am currently considering candidates to fill the post of honorary consul in that country.</P>

      <P>Eligibility for the free schemes such as electricity allowance, natural gas allowance, television licence and telephone rental is confined to persons living alone who are in receipt of social welfare type pensions.  The annual cost of those free schemes is £42 million.  It is not possible to give an estimate of the additional cost involved in extending those schemes to all public service pensioners except to <Col N="1732" /> say that it would be significant.  Consequently, it could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>Permanent and pensionable public servants are covered for income related pensions under the terms of their public service employment.  They are not covered by virtue of their PRSI contributions for retirement or contributory old age pensions.  The question of extending coverage for retirement and old age pensions to public servants has been under consideration and has been discussed with the trade unions.  This issue has also been raised in the context of the examination of pensions generally, which is being carried out by the National Pensions Board.  The board's final report is expected in the middle of this year.</P>

      <Quest>whether his Department have considered that claimants returning to work after a period of disability benefit should be allowed for a limited period to work a part week and claim a part week, particularly in view of the fact that this might reduce the overall claim on the Exchequer by people delaying their return to work.</Quest>

      <P>The purpose of disability benefit is to provide an income to people who are unable to work due to illness or disability. It is not normally paid to people who are capable of working part time.</P>
      <P>There are some circumstances in which a person can do some work and still claim disability benefit.  For example, a person on disability benefit who wishes to take up work of a therapeutic or rehabilitative nature can apply to continue to receive benefit.  Each such case is considered individually on its merits.</P>
      <P>I do not have any plans to extend disability benefit to other situations where the claimant is working.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail in these measures or to comment on the timing and frequency of mobile Garda patrols in the Maynooth area &mdash; it is a matter for the Garda authorities to make professional assessments as to what patrolling and other arrangements may be appropriate to deal with particular situations.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that he will continue to closely monitor the situation in Maynooth to ensure that all available Garda resources will be deployed to the best advantage there.</P>

One of these offenders has since been released.</P>
      <P>Offenders in this category are housed separately from adult offenders in Mountjoy female prison in accordance with the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, and in dormitory type accommodation with integral sanitation. They have access to a full range of medical, psychiatric, psychological, welfare, educational, work training and chaplaincy services.  I am satisfied that the conditions are suited to their needs. There are no immediate plans for the transfer of prisoners in this category from their present location.</P>

    <P>The group has already made an interim report and I have accepted the recommendations in it, the most important of which is that medical orderlies should be on duty 24 hours a day in the closed prisons.  The 43 additional medical orderly posts which are required to give this round-the-clock cover have been advertised and arrangements are being made for the implementation of the other interim recommendations, which include the setting up of a suicide prevention group in each prison, a review of procedures for identification of potential suicide risks and improving the speed of <Col N="1741" /> response to suicide attempts.  I have previously outlined to the House the various practical measures that are being taken to reduce suicide risks in prisons, including strenuous efforts to identify offenders who may be at risk and, where such offenders are identified, their being given special preventive attention by prison staff.</P>

      <P>Local improvement scheme grants may only be used for projects which qualify for funding under the terms of the scheme, viz., projects in rural areas involving the improvement of non-public roads, including farm roads, bog roads and minor land drainage works.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are advised that, when drawing up their list of proposed works for the year, care should be taken to ensure as far as possible that only works intended to be carried out and paid for within the year are included.  If it transpires that the full amount allocated is not required in the year, the authority is consulted and any savings are real-located to other local authorities which require additional funding for their local improvement schemes and can spend the money involved in the year.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied at this stage that there are enough schemes requiring funding under the local improvement scheme to absorb the £4 million allocated to this programme in 1991 and that the transfer of surplus funding in any local authority to other categories of road works would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>My Department have funds at their disposal for the support of youth services generally and services for disadvantaged youth in particular.  The youth service grant scheme is but one of the mechanisms by which these funds are channelled to the service providers, which are mainly, but not exclusively, voluntary youth organisations.</P>
      <P>The allocation in any one year under the youth service grant scheme takes many factors into account including the total allocation available for youth in general, and changes in emphasis between services funded through the youth service grant scheme and through other schemes, including special schemes for the disadvantaged. The grants paid to individual organisations under the youth service grant scheme do not, therefore, necessarily represent the full funding available to them in the youth service programme, nor do they fully reflect the priorities set out within the programme for the provision of services.</P>

      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that schools in an area co-ordinate their opening and closure dates at holiday times so as to ensure an adequate transport service.</P>
      <P>In the case of Sligo town, school transport schedules for the 1990-91 school year were drawn up following local consultations with school managers/ principals and transport liaison officers. These schedules were subsequently circulated to all schools well in advance of the 1990-91 school year and are adhered to by the majority of schools in the area.</P>
