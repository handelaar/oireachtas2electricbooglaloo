      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 10 and 11.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 20.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we have been told for the second month in a row that unemployment is at the highest level in this country's history as a proportion of the workforce, would the Taoiseach agree, now that he is considering the establishment of a number of committees, to establish an all-party committee of the House on employment to carry out an audit of all Government schemes that may prove to be an obstacle to the creation of jobs?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy <Col N="2" /> should raise that matter in a more appropriate manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise, Sir, that the matter is so urgent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that appropriateness and orderliness do not arise in the context of such a serious national crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many ways of raising that matter in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the Government intend, as a matter of urgency, to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to enable the Government and <Col N="3" /> the House to donate funds to famine relief in Bangladesh or Ethiopia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need at this stage for a Supplementary Estimate. Funds are being provided for three areas of distress at the moment, the Kurds in Iraq, Bangladesh and Africa, particularly Sudan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a Private Notice Question from the Labour Party on this matter was ruled out of order yesterday on the grounds that it lacked urgency.  The urgency was determined by the fact that the Ceann Comhairle's Office was informed that there are no plans to introduce a Supplementary Estimate, and a Supplementary Estimate would be required for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is leading to argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to put it to the Taoiseach that the response from the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple position is that there is no parliamentary, legislative or administrative problem in making funds available for these three areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach outline now or at some appropriate time what the full extent of that response will be?  There is widespread concern in the country about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has made his point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the general goodwill in this House towards the Brooke talks that are attempting to get underway at present, would the Taoiseach be prepared to make a statement to the House on the current problem that exists with this matter or would he undertake to brief the party leaders in Opposition on the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers is clearly not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that it is not strictly in order on the Order of Business, but I sought to raise a Private Notice Question yesterday which was refused on the grounds that it was not urgent.  I believe the matter is urgent and I am simply seeking a response from the Taoiseach that some consultation would take place with the parties in Opposition on this extremely grave position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Deputy that a statement by me at this stage on the matter would be far from helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That would surely depend on the content of the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would consider the possibility of asking for a summit of all EC leaders to consider the tragic position in Bangladesh.  It would be constructive to call for such a meeting at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like your guidance in these matters, Sir.  I would like to respond to these questions if they were put down in the proper way, and it is not strictly in order on the Order of Business. The position in regard to all these very distressed areas is that the Council of Foreign Ministers discuss these matters regularly and decide on action to be taken at Community level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach's concern to remain within the rules of order.  In order to proceed with the matter further I will raise it on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach when item No. 5 on today's Order Paper, which relates to the establishment of a select committee on crime will be moved, <Col N="5" /> together with the parallel committee on foreign affairs?  There have been several discussions among the Whips on this matter and the Taoiseach indicated to the House that he would proceed with it. When can we expect the resolutions to come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving on both those committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, in his dual role as Taoiseach and Minister for the Gaeltacht, if he is concerned or familiar or indeed agrees with the findings of a Bord na Gaeilge commission report stating that the number of native Irish speakers has declined to the critical level of 10,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Deputy McGinley had a relevant matter to raise.  He will have to raise that question some other time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach make a copy of the report available to Members of the House and to the Joint Committee on the Irish Language?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 29, to delete &ldquo;sections 3 and 4&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sections 3, 4 and 5&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to fill a gap in the Bill.  The provisions under the Bill provide rules for the recognition of foreign adoptions in a number of circumstances. First, they provide that where an individual or a couple are domiciled abroad and properly adopt &mdash; to paraphrase the section &mdash; according to the law of the country of the domicile, it would recognise that adoption.  The Bill goes on to say &mdash; again I am paraphrasing &mdash; that where an individual or a couple properly adopt abroad in a country in which they have habitual residence, we will recognise that adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains special provisions to deal with the recognition of adoptions effected by individuals or couples who are resident in Ireland and who, from that Irish residence, adopt abroad.  In the context of the Bill as originally published we changed the provisions with regard to the procedures to apply to the recognition of adoptions abroad completed by couples who are resident in Ireland and we removed what is known in international law as the connecting factor of nationality. That has thrown up an anomaly which <Col N="11" /> is addressed by the series of amendments which we are now discussing together.</P>
    <P>Clearly, under the Bill, if you are domiciled or habitually resident abroad &mdash;&ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; is really the continental terminology for domicile &mdash;&ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; would normally mean you are living permanently in another country.  On the continent they tend to use the concept of &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; in common law jurisdictions such as this country, the United Kingdom and the United States.  In Canada they tend to use the concept of domicile.  For example, an Irish person may be temporarily resident abroad.  He is not domiciled abroad, not living there permanently and does not have habitual residency, but equally he is not resident in this State.  A variety of people could be in that position, for example, members of the diplomatic service who are perhaps on a two or three years assignment to a foreign country, a newpaper correspondent who is living abroad for two or three years, an Irish business person who is working for an Irish company and who is on an assignment abroad for two or three years or someone who may not have been able to get employment in this country and whose family decided to live outside Ireland for two or three years. These people have no intention of living permanently outside Ireland.  They may establish a temporary residence outside Ireland for two or three years but it is their hope and intention to return to Ireland.</P>
    <P>If people who are resident outside this State or, to use the legal concept, who are ordinarily resident for a reasonable period of time but who have not established an habitual residence outside the State, adopt while they are abroad, it is important that there is a mechanism to recognise that adoption.  It is also important to ensure that the mechanism we put in place does not in any way disrupt the safeguards in the Bill with regard to people who are resident in this State and who adopt abroad, and that the safeguards which require home assessments to be carried out are not disrupted.  My <Col N="12" /> amendment seeks to include an additional section in the Bill which would read as follows:</P>
    <P>A foreign adoption (whether effected before or after the commencement of this Act) effected in, or recognised under the law of, a place in which either or both of the adopters were ordinarily resident for a period of not less than one year ending on the date on which the adoption was effected shall be deemed, unless such deeming would be contrary to public policy, to have been effected by a valid adoption order made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on that date or</P>
    <P>(b)  on such commencement,</P>
    <P>whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>To put it in simple terms, this would mean if an Irish couple who were living abroad for more than a year wished to adopt in the country in which they were residing and they properly followed the legal procedures in that country, that adoption could, upon it being completed, be recognised as valid in Ireland.  Without the inclusion of my amendment in the Bill that couple would be put in a legal limbo and it would not be possible to effect the recognition of that adoption under the other rules specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This amendment would provide a reciprocal rule for our domestic adoption requirement because in the context of the rules we apply with regard to residents' qualifications section 5 of the Adoption Act, 1964, which amended section 11 of the Principal Act of 1952 and inserted a new section in that Act, states that an adoption order shall not be made unless the applicants are ordinarily resident in the State and have been so resident during the year ending on the date of the order.  In other words, we regard our adoption board as being in a position to make an adoption order in favour of an applicant or applicants provided they have been ordinarily resident in this State for a year or longer.  I assume in that context that we would wish our adoptions <Col N="13" /> so granted and made in this State to be recognised elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What we are now saying is that we regard it as proper within this jurisdiction to make adoption orders in respect of couples who have been resident in this country for a year or longer and we equally recognise an adoption by an Irish couple who are living abroad for a year or longer and who properly effect an adoption according to the laws of that state.  My amendment provides for a reciprocal rule of recognition.  As I have said, it will remove an anomaly which could have arisen by virtue of the other provisions we have included in the Bill. By using the concept of ordinary residence and including the one year provision, someone who is temporarily resident in this State will not be able to evade our safeguards.</P>
    <P>In this context it is worth referring to the book entitled <i>The Conflict of Laws</i> by Dicey and Morris which is regarded as the major thesis on private international law rules.  Dicey and Morris refer to the difference between residence, habitual residence and domicile.  They refer to ordinary residence as meaning more than the simple concept of a residence.  They say that the expression connotes residence in a place with some degree of continuity.  There is a reference in Dicey and Morris to a case which distinguishes between the concept of ordinary residence, habitual residence and domicile.</P>
    <P>My amendment is really a technical tidying up of the Bill on Report Stage. It seeks to ensure that the small number of people &mdash; business people, diplomats or newspaper people &mdash; who are working temporarily outside the State and others who are unemployed and have to seek employment outside the State and who adopt while living abroad, can have those adoptions recognised in this State provided they properly comply with the laws of the State in which they are resident. Of course, the various safeguards specified in the Bill and the definition of what constitutes a foreign adoption will equally have to be complied with.</P>

We will be dealing later with some amendments in the Minister's name in which he has shown a remarkable capacity to meet reasonable arguments.</P>
      <P>As has been said, the provisions in this amendment may not apply to many people but, depending on how emigration develops and whether it becomes a permanent feature of life in Ireland, it might apply to more people.

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted the principle of Deputy Shatter's amendment.  While it is, as Deputy Shatter said, a technical amendment, it is also a very important one.  Our first responsibility must be to the children who are adopted and to ensure that they will not be left in a legal limbo in the future.  We also have a particular responsibility to Irish parents who live abroad temporarily but who are still regarded as Irish.  If such couples adopt children in another jurisdiction and meet all the legal requirements of that state it is imperative that when they return to Ireland permanently they can be assured that their children can become Irish citizens and are regarded under this legislation as being properly and legally adopted.  The Minister was forthcoming in his contributions at the Special Committee and I am glad he is continuing this approach on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In case we do not get an opportunity later, I would like to raise now this issue about home assessments. There seems to be a very genuine problem. The last time we discussed it the Minister said that resources had been made available to the health boards to carry out home assessments within a reasonable period, subject to what had to be done to have a proper home assessment. I have been informed by people who approached the Eastern Health Board that such home assessments will not be feasible except on the basis of a long waiting list where people may have to wait for up to two years.  Will the Minister at some stage indicate to the House that waiting lists will be reduced so that people who are anxious to adopt will not have to wait for such a long time? There are well founded reports coming from the health boards that there will be lengthy delays due to lack of resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague Deputy Richard Bruton.  There is a serious problem in the South-Eastern Health Board.  I have informed the Minister's office of the reluctance of the health board to get involved in home assessments. I am dealing with a case in which a couple applied on 1 April immediately news of this Bill was made known, and to date they have not had a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to the people in the health board and I have detected a serious note of reluctance.  The people involved are stressed and concerned by the attitude of the health board and I can confirm that attitude.  We were given various excuses to the effect that the health board had not been given a direction to participate in such home assessments and that they did not have enough staff.  The couple in question had not <Col N="17" /> been visited and had been informed that there may be a delay of another four weeks.  That is not the spirit of the Bill and I am sure it is not the Minister's intention.  It is very frustrating for any couple to be asked to wait two months before a social worker visits their home. This is a very serious part of the Bill and is something that will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we expressed concern about the co-operation of the health boards.  Having received direction from the Minister I thought their reluctance would have been removed.  Unfortunately the opposite is the case.  Like Deputy Bruton, I would like to know if the Minister is providing the health boards with additional resources to cope with applications for home assessments. In my area there was only one application and the health board could not deal with it.  Will the Minister respond to what could eventually be a very serious problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Therese Ahearn.  I understand the Minister has requested the health boards to give every assistance to people, particularly those trying to adopt Romanian babies.  In the North-Eastern Health Board area the social workers have already received that direction and are prepared to assist people proposing to adopt from Romania.  I know of at least three couples who have gone to the North-Eastern Health Board already and have been treated well.  The health board have obviously told them they would have to do a home study report, and obviously these reports take some time, as it would for a person adopting an Irish baby.  There is no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given the direction and the health boards are implementing it as far as I am aware.  Perhaps when replying the Minister will outline exactly what he said to the health boards so that they can implement his instruction, particularly in relation to Romanian babies because there are a number of people who are caught in this limbo and who now have to get home study reports. <Col N="18" /> The procedures in my health board area are working reasonably well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The next amendment which deals with the introduction date would give us an opportunity to talk about the Minister's criteria.  The Committee Stage debate has not yet been published but Deputy Dermot Ahern has just said that the Minister gave a commitment on Committee Stage to issue instructions to health boards to carry out the necessary home assessments under the legislation with the least possible delay.  We accepted that three months was an acceptable delay for this kind of procedure.  I have been approached by people who had difficulties with the health boards and I reassured them that the Minister had given a commitment to direct the health boards to initiate procedures even before the legislation was passed so that people would not suffer delays because of restrictions in the legislation. The Minister should now respond to the queries raised by Deputies Therese Ahearn and Richard Bruton.  We would not accept that some health boards are still resisting instructions from the Minister. Unless they are pleading inability due to staffing or finance shortages, there is a legal obligation on them to obey the Minister's instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Ahern said is correct and what my colleagues are saying is also correct.  A different approach is being taken by different health boards.  That is a real problem and it is leaving a number of people who wish to adopt abroad in something of a limbo. I have had reports from people who approached the EHB to be told in a relatively offhand way that there is a waiting list of two years and that perhaps somebody could start assessing them in two years' time.  I know of the case to which Deputy Therese Ahearn referred.  There is nothing party political about any of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that the Minister issued an instruction in March and that it is being complied with by some health boards and not by others.  It will create a problem for <Col N="19" /> the workability of the legislation if health boards do not comply properly with the legislation.  Following the completion of the Bill today, will the Minister again write to the health boards and make it clear what their obligations are?  There are often disagreements between this side of the House and the Minister about resources which are made available to the health boards, but this is not an issue about resources.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that those who wish to adopt abroad do not become pawns in a battle about whether health boards have adequate resources.  The point must be made that for many years health boards have assessed people for the purpose of domestic adoptions.  There has been a huge fall-off in the number of children available for adoption in Ireland and nearly all of the couples who seek to adopt abroad would in years gone by have adopted in Ireland and been assessed by health boards here for that purpose.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not confer new work on the health boards; it is simply saying that assessments are now to be carried out for the purpose of foreign adoptions, not domestic adoptions.  Many people are anxious that they be assessed and the assessment be carried out properly.  It is not reasonable to tell them that there is a six months or one or two year waiting list before they are even visited by a social worker for the purpose of carrying out an assessment.  I ask the Minister to make direct contact with the two health boards mentioned by my colleagues to find out where the logjam is and resolve it.</P>

I wrote to the chief executive officers on 26 March stating that &ldquo;health boards are to begin carrying out these assessments from 1 April next in anticipation of the early enactment of the legislation&rdquo;.  To be fair to the health boards and agencies, including the adoption societies, there is a certain amount of confusion given that it is unusual to start implementing the provisions of a Bill before it is enacted. Some people may be reluctant therefore to commence work until the Bill has passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Nevertheless, I wrote to the health boards recently asking them to name one person in each health board area who would be available to give advice to people on the procedures.

      <P>In page 4, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), where a foreign adoption was effected on or after the 1st day of April, 1991, and before the 1st day of July, 1991, and the Minister for Justice had received a request in writing from the adopters before the said 1st day of April, 1991, for an assurance in writing addressed to them as to the admission to the State of a child the subject of a foreign adoption effected in their favour, the adoption shall be deemed, unless such deeming would be contrary to public policy, to have been effected by a valid adoption order made&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) on the date on which the adoption was effected, or</P>
      <P>(b)  on the commencement of this Act,</P>
      <P>whichever is the later, if but only if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the Minister for Justice gave such an assurance as aforesaid,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the adopters are persons coming within the classes of persons in whose favour an adoption order may, by virtue of section 9 of this Act, be made,</P>
      <P>(iii)  the adopters were ordinarily resident in the State on the date on which the adoption was effected, and</P>
      <P>(iv)  the Board declares in writing that it is satisfied that the adopters are persons coming within the classes of persons in whose favour an adoption order may, by virtue of the said section 9, be made.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Special Committee I undertook to examine the question of bringing forward <Col N="22" /> an amendment on Report Stage to deal with those situations involving people already in Romania on 1 April or who were about to travel there at that time and who were unlikely to have their adoptions finalised before 1 April.  I accept that these are special cases and that special provision should be made for them.  Accordingly, I have brought forward a special amendment to facilitate the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 would extend the special procedure applicable to people who adopted before 1 April last to people who had applied to the Department of Justice before that date for immigration clearance for an adopted child and who subsequently received such clearance from that Department.  Where people with written immigration clearance finalise their foreign adoptions before 1 July next their adoptions will be recognised in the same way as adoptions granted to people before 1 April; in other words, their adoptions will be recognised if they are eligible to adopt a child under Irish law and the adoption complies with the terms of the definition of a foreign adoption set out in section 1.</P>
    <P>I consider it is essential that this special provision should be confined to people who applied to the Department of Justice for immigration clearance before 1 April and subsequently received such clearance. As far as I am aware, all foreign adoption authorities require documentary evidence from prospective adopters that an adopted child will be permitted to enter their country to live with them and that the foreign authorities will not consider an application for adoption unless the prospective adopters can satisfy them on this crucial point.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that the Department of Justice have not issued any immigration clearance to people who have applied since 1 April.  That Department have advised applicants that they are unable to issue these clearances until they complete the new procedures provided for in the Bill which involve having their eligibility and suitability established so as to ensure that their foreign adoption will <Col N="23" /> be recognised on their return to this country. It is clearly not in the interests of a foreign child to be adopted by an Irish person or couple in circumstances which would preclude the adoption from being recognised in here.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is consequential and will enable the adopters to apply to the Adoption Board for a declaration that they are eligible to be granted an Irish adoption order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister published his proposed amendments to the Bill on 15 March last he suggested a cut-off date of 1 April for the procedure which would apply to those who had completed or were about to complete adoptions. The new, and somewhat more involved procedure, was to apply from 1 April.  I made the point at the Special Committee meeting which I think met on either 28 or 29 March, that there were people in Romania with letters of authorisation issued by the Department who could not complete their adoptions before 1 April, &mdash; they may not have been able to complete them until mid-April or early May &mdash; and who would find themselves in a legal limbo or legal twilight zone.  When we discussed this matter with the Minister at a subsequent committee meeting the point was made that there were people who had received authorisations prior to 1 April, who had already booked flights, who had made plans to go to Romania some time during the month of May, who had family assessments carried out and who had complied with all the pre-adoption requirements of the Romanian authorities but who clearly, again, could not complete the adoptions before 1 April.</P>

    <P>Two formulas were suggested to the Minister, the first was that we simply change the cut-off date from 1 April to 1 July or that provision be made that those who received authorisations prior to 1 April from the Department be allowed to complete their adoptions and have them recognised under the simpler procedure. The Minister's amendment deals with in <Col N="24" /> as reasonable a way as possible, the difficulties in this area.</P>
    <P>This side of the House fully recognise that the procedure for the carrying out of domestic assessments by health boards or our domestic adoption societies, with declarations of suitability from the Adoption Board, should come into operation as early as possible.  There was a necessity for an interim measure to deal with people caught between the two positions, people who had undertaken all the arrangements to complete a foreign adoption but had not managed to have it completed.  The Minister's proposal makes provision for the inclusion of the date of 1 July which we sought prior to completing Committee Stage.  I deliberately withdrew my amendment on Committee Stage seeking the 1 July date to give the Minister additional time to think the matter over so we could do it on a consensus basis rather than a confrontational basis.</P>
    <P>I understand that as a result of the arrangements that have been made in recent days some additional letters of authorisation have been issued by the Department of Justice.  My information was that up to 1 April there had been in the region of 477 letters of authorisation issued by the Department of Justice.  One cannot be exact in this because one is getting back information from organisations and individuals who have been involved, but I believe there are in the region of 400 Romanian children in the country who have been adopted by either Irish couples or individuals.</P>
    <P>One problem that arose was that there were people who, prior to 1 April, sought a departmental authorisation to bring an adopted child into Ireland to whom the Department had not replied before 1 April.  As a result of the Minister's conclusions on the matter now being resolved, I understand that in the region of 30 or so new letters went out from the Department of Justice confirming to couples who sought a departmental authorisation prior to 1 April that if they now adopted abroad the child adopted would be admitted into the country.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that we have the 1 <Col N="25" /> July date and I am raising no issue about that.  This is not a matter on which I tabled any amendments and I do not intend to divide the House on it but I know from personal contacts with a number of couples that while we were debating Committee Stage and over the past two weeks, they had letters from the Department pre-1 April and literally did not know whether they should or should not adopt.  I told them that it had to be their decision, that I hoped we would agree on the 1 July date and that if they went in early May that should allow them time to complete an adoption, but I could not be certain at that stage that agreement would be reached.  Following today's events in the House there may be some couples who might consider going to Romania at the beginning of May who may now go at the end of May or the beginning of June.  Equally there may be some couples who, having got Department of Justice letters of authorisation only a week or ten days ago having thought it was not possible to go to complete an adoption, now would have finalised their paper work and would have put in place arrangements to go to Romania at the end of May or the beginning of June.  Again it may not be possible for some of those people to complete their arrangements by 1 July.</P>
    <P>I was anxious not to divide the House on this because we have reached agreement on all the issues in the Bill.  We are happy with this amendment having pressed for the 1 July date on Committee Stage and it would be peculiar now not to agree to that date now.  What we did not know was that there would be 30 new letters of authorisation issued and how long it would take to agree a 1 July date. On the assumption that we accept the 1 July date, the Department may get a feed back that some people could be caught in a hiatus.  If so, when the Bill goes to the Seanad if the Minister feels there is a need to change 1 July to 31 July in the context of the letters of authorisation that have already been issued &mdash; because this cannot result in more people going off hastily to adopt abroad without having done their paperwork &mdash; the 30 people <Col N="26" /> who only in the last couple of weeks received authorisations from the Department of Justice should be facilitated by having that 1 July date changed to 31 July.  We would agree to that and the matter could be accepted without debate or difficulty arising if the Seanad accept it.  However, it may not be necessary to do that.</P>
    <P>I accept the need to provide certainty in this area and the message should go out from this House today that couples who do not have letters of authorisation at this stage and are thinking of adoptions abroad should go to their health boards or adoption societies, have assessments carried out and go through the new procedure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have been able to reach agreement on this new date. I know of two couples who are at this moment in Romania, who decided to go regardless of what we did in this House and who already had letters of authorisation. I know it will come as something of a relief to them and their families to know the 1 July date has been agreed. Both couples expect adoptions in Romania towards the end of this month and it will mean their children will be recognised as adopted under this legislation on the assumption that all the legislative requirements will have been properly complied.</P>

      <P>I am interested in what Deputy Shatter had to say.  I made the very point on Committee Stage that even the cut off date of 1 July might cause problems later.  I instanced a case where a couple had been given a final court date of sometime in October, even though they had the letter of authorisation from the Department of Justice.  No matter what we put into the legislation at that time that couple still would have been left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I supported 1 April date because I felt we had to have a cut off date and we were probably better off having it early rather than late. If we put it back further and further we would have an avalanche of applicants who might not necessarily apply later.  I <Col N="27" /> accept that with the passage of time the 1 July date is probably now more relevant.</P>
    <P>I accept there will still be problems but no matter what we do in legislation, at the end of the day there will always be hard cases.  I think what we are doing in this amendment is the best solution.  It will leave out some couples but at the end of the day they will just have to go through the more rigorous procedure which is in vogue even for couples adopting Irish babies.  I support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. Consternation was created in the Committee when the Minister published his Press statement of 15-16 March announcing a cut-off date of 1 April.  Not that we had any objection to a particular date applying, but we were aware of many couples who had not brought the children back to Ireland before 1 April or were in the process of adopting but did not have the opportunity to get their air fare together or arrange their tickets or whatever.  We debated this at length on Committee Stage and the Minister was forthcoming.  He said he would look at some interim arrangement which would satisfy the points made by all of us, particularly Deputy Shatter.  I am satisfied that what the Minister is suggesting will meet the requirement.  There will be exceptions to every rule but I think this cut-off date has attracted sufficient publicity.</P>
      <P>The people who have contacted me are now aware that there will be changes. I am not sure whether the people recently issued with letters from the Department of Justice had originally made all the other necessary arrangements, but anybody who intends to go to Romania now is aware that legislation is coming into place with a new cut off date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest we forget what happens, I want to put on the record our appreciation of the work of the Irish Romanian Adoptive Parents Group who have regional bodies which advise adoptive parents. They have put in place a very detailed and relevant procedure.  They advised <Col N="28" /> members of their group that their documentation would have to include marriage and birth certificates, a Department of Justice letter of permission, a Garda report, a financial status report, a medical report and a social report.</P>
    <P>Also incorporated in the adoption order from the Romanian side are the child's birth certificate, the mother's birth certificate, the mother's marriage certificate, if married, mother's and/or father's consent and a social report on the mother, giving her background and her reasons for placing the child for adoption in Romania.  Both sets of documents must then be notarised.  The Irish documents are notarised in Ireland and again in Romania, while the Romanian documents are notarised there.</P>
    <P>At the court hearing all these papers are examined by a panel usually comprised of three judges.  The parents or single mother are present and preferably the adoptive parents.  If the latter are not present, the lawyer representing them should attend.  When everybody has presented the case satisfactorily to the Chief Justice, he will make an adoption order.  Then there is a further waiting period during which each side can change their minds.  When the adoption order is finally signed all the above-mentioned paper work is filed in the court and a synopsis is given, in which the adoptive parents are declared to be the parents of the child and new birth certificates are issued bearing the adoptive parents surname.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to spell out the procedure which has been followed up to now.  This formula was followed on the recommendation of the Irish Romanian Adoptive Parents Group.  People who adopted this procedure and satisfy the criteria contained in the legislation, but who had not brought children here before 1 April, need an assurance that their children will be formally and legally adopted <Col N="29" /> here.  It would be unwise for any prospective adoptive parents to set off with just a letter from the Department of Justice. The criteria I have mentioned were laid down before the initiation of this legislation.  These criteria, together with the provisions of the legislation should be sufficient to satisfy adoptive parents that what they have done is in accordance with law and that there will be no ambiguity about the legality of the adoptions in the future.  They must be assured that children adopted under this legislation will have the same status as any other adopted children, foreign or otherwise.</P>
      <P>People did not just get a letter, hop on a plane and come home with a child.  They went through a very detailed procedure. We must compliment them as a voluntary group who were concerned to make sure that children were available for adoption and who were also concerned with doing something about the social crisis in Romania.  Anybody who has seen these children must realise what an important step it was and how beautiful these children are.  We must welcome the fact that Deputy Shatter brought forward this legislation to regularise the future status and nationality of these children.</P>

      <P>If we need to make a case for extending the Committee system to deal with difficult legislation, the work of the Committee is as good an advertisement as any.  Perhaps we could bring this message back to our party whips in an effort to extend the system.  On every occasion when we have used the Committee system to deal with legislation, nothing but good parliamentary work has come from it.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be thanked for accepting the arguments made on Committee Stage about the degree of flexibility regarding the cut-off stage.  The time has come for the House to rally around and agree that what we have here is a good and fair formula.  The approach that has been shown indicates a degree of flexibility and there is certainly a full appreciation of the problems people have had to deal with and will have to meet in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> I welcome the amendment which sets out clearly the position from now on. Certain rules apply before 1 April, after 1 April and before July, and thereafter. Reports indicate that all is certainly not well on the Romanian front.  The sooner the better we have in place the post-1 July regime.  It is important that the Adoption Board and the health authorities here become actively involved in the process.  The original enthusiasm and efforts on the part of people in Romania to meet reasonable requests for adoption are breaking down and the blackmarket is entering the whole area.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall my concern about the roles played by different Departments in this procedure.  I appreciate that the question of aliens is a matter for the Department of Justice but I wonder whether we should describe as aliens children who are adopted.  The controls on the admission of aliens should apply to adults who come to this country. Children who come as babes in arms or accompanied by adults should be treated otherwise.  In the area of child care generally, and especially in the case of children at risk, there is a great problem finding out which Departments are responsible &mdash; Health, Justice or Education. I am concerned that similar difficuties may arise here.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Minister for Health is having a direct influence on the procedures adopted by the Department of Justice but difficulties could arise in the future.  I should prefer the Minister for Health to have entire responsibility in this area.  The letter required to authorise the bringing of a child to this country should emanate from the Department of Health or the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>I fully support the amendment and thank the Minister for being so forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter and the Minister for pioneering the resolution of this problem.  Every cut-off date will leave certain hard cases behind.  I know of people who are caught by the provision that the requests to the Department must have been in writing.  I <Col N="31" /> can understand their frustration in that this was just a single element in a process of assessment which they were undergoing. They would regard it as arbitrary that this point was picked out as the one which would decide who would benefit from the special procedure.  That was not indicated on 20 March when the Minister made his first statement on the matter. Some people had the good fortune to put in a written request before 1 April and we must feel for those who did not.  Since there will be certain hard cases where most of the homework has been completed priority should be given to those people who have been caught in a rather arbitrary way by this provision.  I recognise the Minister had to have some documentary basis for determining a cut-off. I appeal to him to ensure that the first priority in the health boards providing the assessment should be to people who were well advanced in the procedure under the old rules.</P>
      <P>There is one final question I wish to ask the Minister.  It refers to paragraph (iv)  of subsection (2) which states:</P>
      <P>the Board declares in writing that it is satisfied that the adopters are persons coming within the classes of persons in whose favour an adoption order may, by virtue of the said section 9, be made.</P>
      <P>The only small worry I have about that paragraph is that the Minister is now introducing a procedure whereby single people can adopt but in special circumstances and those circumstances are not specified in the Bill.  When I asked the Minister on Committee Stage what these circumstances meant, he suggested it would be a situation of a natural bond such as an aunt adopting a child after the death of the parents.  I want the Minister to satisfy himself that he is not arbitrarily cutting out single people who may have fulfilled, in good faith, all the other requirements but the board may say these do not meet the special circumstances which were envisaged.  Perhaps it is not a real fear but I would like to have a brief comment on it from the Minister.</P>

      <P>As soon as this Bill has passed both Houses, in clear and unambiguous language there should be published a list of steps that must be taken by prospective adoptive parents if they are contemplating a foreign adoption.  The catalyst for this Bill was the Romanian situation, but what we are passing through the Dáil and the Seanad is a foreign adoptions Bill that will apply not only to Romania but to many other countries as well.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment.  It is a positive and reasonable response to a section that could have been very contentious.  It shows a sympathetic and understanding approach on the part of the Minister.  It is very important that any applicants to the Department of Justice cannot argue that their application was unduly delayed by the Department of Justice which resulted in their not having received clearance for going to Romania.  The fact that all applications received before 1 April will now obtain clearance is a good response and, at least, we will not have couples who will feel aggrieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage fears were expressed that by changing any date the floodgates could be open to applications. By confining it to all those who had written before 1 April it eliminates any hasty decisions being made by any couple in deciding to go to Romania.  I hope this change will be made known to the couples so that they will not find themselves in a dilemma that they heard about it too late and could not have the adoption completed by 1 July.  How important is the 1 July date?  It applies only to the 30 or so people who have received clearance over the past number of days who had applied before 1 April.  Extending the date to 31 July or to August would not mean that people who had not obtained a clearance could hastily decide to go to Romania. I hope we will not have any problems <Col N="33" /> because of that cut-off date.  It is not all that important because it concerns only those applicants who have got clearance over the past few days from the Department of Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their support for this amendment.  Like the other side of the House, on this side of the House we are very sympathetic in our attitude on this matter and we were anxious that there would be a special procedure to recognise foreign adoptions for children who are already in the country. When we met on 16 March we decided on a cut-off date of 1 April.  I believe that was right and appropriate at the time.  It was very important that we would signal to the people that a law was about to be enacted.  It was not in anybody's interest that the procedure which was in place should continue indefinitely.  We are looking for a balance between recognising the adoption of children who were properly adopted abroad and, at the same time, ensuring that we have procedures in place that are in accordance with the very high standards of adoption in this country since the foundation of the State.  Nobody can deny that we have a standard of adoption procedure in Ireland that compares with the best anywhere in the world and we want to maintain that standard.  The parents who adopted children abroad are very anxious that that would be the case and that the procedures we have in place would be seen to be of the very highest standard.  I believe it was right to signal a date that was not too far away. Members in this House will recall that at one time a Government decided to stop house improvement grants and to cease applications after two weeks.  In those two weeks 69,000 applications were received in the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not comparing adoption with a housing grant scheme. The decision to adopt a child is probably one of four or five of the most major <Col N="34" /> decisions that people will make in their lifetime.  I would not wish to precipitate anybody into making a hasty decision by giving a date whereby people might be tempted to go abroad and bring home a baby and then find that it was not the right decision.  I think the date of 1 April was correct.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that there were so many people who had the procedures almost finalised and perhaps were awaiting travel arrangements to Romania, it was right that we should look at the date.  We have a fair compromise that satisfies what we set out to do; namely, to find the balance between recognition for children who are already in the country and, at the same time, ensuring that we maintain a very high standard of procedure for recognition of foreign adoptions.  This is very much in line with the procedure that already exists.  Because it will be necessary for people to have had their emigration clearance from the Department of Justice before 1 April, the date of 1 July is reasonable.</P>
      <P>I think it is fair to tell the House that I do not intend to change the date of 1 July.  I take the point that has been made that there will be some people whom it will inconvenience.  As Deputy Ahearn has said, it does not matter what date you accept, it will inconvenience some people.  It would be most unfortunate if people's expectations were raised that this procedure would go on until 31 July and then if there are other people who would be inconvenienced that it would be extended to a further date.  The Bill will be completed in this House today; it will then go to the Seanad and certainly it is not my intention to extend the date again.  It is important that the public are aware of that because we do not want to raise expectations.  We have got a good compromise and I believe it will satisfy the needs of the vast majority of people who had almost completed their arrangements by 1 April but had not completed an adoption order abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter and others that people who are contemplating adoption abroad should now seek proper <Col N="35" /> advice.  We will be meeting a designated person in each of the eight health boards on Friday.  That person &mdash; or somebody whom they will brief &mdash; will be in a position to give people advice.  People seeking advice on adoption procedures should go to their health board or to an adoption society, if the adoption societies are participating, or indeed &mdash; and perhaps Deputy Shatter was too modest to suggest this &mdash; they should get legal advice before they go abroad to adopt a child so that they will know the procedures and what will be necessary when the law is enacted.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to what he perceived as a lack of co-ordination in the activities relating to children between the Departments of Health, Justice and Education. Deputy McCartan will be aware that the Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Flood, was given the specific task of co-ordinating the work of the three Departments as it relates to child care and affects children.  I think everybody in the House will agree that Deputy Flood has done a tremendous amount of work in the short time since he was appointed Minister of State.  Certainly this should not be a problem in the future as we accept it was in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the issue of single persons wishing to adopt.  The special procedures will apply to single people who have adopted a child through foreign adoptions, provided they meet the criteria in all other ways.  Following the enactment of this legislation it will be a matter for the Adoption Board to decide on the special circumstances.  As I see it, the special circumstances will be closely related to the bonding between the single person and the child, but it will be a matter for the Adoption Board to decide on individual cases.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked that we outline a list of procedures.  While that is our intention, it is important that we wait until the Bill is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and is enacted before we publish a list of the criteria and procedures for adoption.</P>

      <P>(5)  The Board may act notwithstanding the existence of one or more vacancies in its membership.'.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that at the Special Committee I drew attention to the fact that the amendments accepted by the special committee would result in the Adoption Board having new responsibilities under this legislation and that I intended to bring forward an amendment <Col N="37" /> on Report Stage to increase the present membership of the board so as to facilitate meetings to process applications under the new legislation.  As currently constituted, the Adoption Board consists of seven members, a chairman and six ordinary members.  The membership is fixed by section 8 of the Adoption Act, 1952.  Subsection (1) of amendment No. 9 increases the membership of the board to nine.  I consider it is necessary to do this so that the board will have a greater number of members to call upon for meetings.  Section 8 (5) of the Adoption Act, 1952, states:</P>
    <P>The Board may act notwithstanding the existence of one vacancy in its membership.</P>
    <P>I consider it desirable to enable the board with its increased membership to act with more than one vacancy.  This is also provided for in subsection (1) of amendment No. 9.  The quorum for a meeting of the board is three members, including the chairman or deputy chairman.  Thus while this amendment would allow the board to act with more than one vacancy in its membership, the board will still be required to have the necessary quorum in order to meet.  The purpose of subsection (2)  of the amendment is to ensure that the term of office of the two additional members first appointed to the board will be co-terminus with that of the other members of the present board, whose term of office ends on 29 January 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no argument about increasing the number on the Adoption Board.  I am not sure whether it is necessary because a lot of the additional work will be administrative within the board as much as the board actually meeting.  I assume that if the Adoption Board require additional personnel, even temporarily, to meet the large amount of work that may arise in the 12 to 18 months following the enactment of this Bill, that will be provided by the Minister through his Department.  We are going to have hundreds of adoptions, perhaps 400 to 600, because not only will this Bill cover Romanian adoptions but people will seek <Col N="38" /> to register and have declarations of recognition from the board in cases of foreign adoptions.  Therefore I imagine the board will have a large influx of work for approximately 18 months after which matters will settle down considerably, and the board may need additional administrative staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I recall from the legislation, it is largely at the Minister's discretion that appointments are made to the board. Those appointed to the board over the years tended to represent different walks of life and different interests.  Indeed, I cannot remember any major complaints arising in regard to the personnel appointed to the board and I certainly have no complaints.  I have the highest regard for the Adoption Board over the years.  Indeed it had a very fine chairperson in District Justice Agnes Cassidy who served on the board for many years until her retirement and it now has another fine chairperson.  None of the people currently on the board, as far as I know, has had any major involvement over the years with foreign adoptions.  I have a suggestion, but the Minister is not bound in any way by it and it is entirely at his discretion.  In the context of the tremendous work being done by the Romanian adoptive parents group and their knowledge of the background to adoption in Romania and that the vast majority of initial matters to come before the board will relate to Romania the Minister might consider appointing someone from that group to one of the additional places on the board.  Over the years appointments to the board have been based on the general perception that the members appointed would be able to add some insight or common sense to the proceedings of the board.  The Romanian adoptive parents group have never had any political axe to grind and they have always been very anxious to make the point that they wanted this issue dealt with in a non-political party context.  They made public their problems and the needs in this area and sought to avoid scoring political points either <Col N="39" /> way.  This is just a suggestion but I hope the Minister will consider it.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister will be issuing instructions on the appointment of the two additional members to the board.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment briefly on a point raised by Deputy Bruton.  In the past the members of the Adoption Board have placed a restriction on the upper age limit of adoptive parents.  People must be 21 years at least in order to adopt but people aged 40 years or over are prohibited from adopting and as the Minister has said this was based on the scarcity of babies.  There is now no such legal restriction on the age except that persons be over 21 years of age, and I hope that people in their forties who wish to adopt will now be facilitated by way of a ministerial recommendation to the members of the board.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Ferris on this point.  I raised this point on Committee Stage.  I felt that undue restrictions were being imposed on parents whom I would consider very capable to adopt children.  As a matter of fact I would liken it to the third level education system whereby the number of places are related to the number of points, actually discriminates against many people going into a profession.  A great many people who would be excellent parents at the age of 40 should be considered at this time.  We now have so many people here who are anxious to adopt and at the same time, there is a crisis in Romania in that connection.  I hope the Minister will put this very important matter to the Adoption Board.</P>

      <P>Before we conclude let me say, on behalf of Fine Gael, that we are pleased that this Bill which we brought forward as a Private Members' Bill has achieved a consensus in the House.  We are pleased that the Bill has now successfully passed through the Dáil. <Col N="40" /> It would be our hope that the passage of the Bill through the Seanad will be completed during the course of this month.  We are pleased that people who now adopt abroad will be in a position to ensure that their children properly adopted abroad are treated in Ireland as adopted children and are treated no differently in Ireland than a child adopted at home.  We have done a good day's work on this Bill.  I would like to thank the Minister and the other parties in the House for their co-operation and assistance in bringing the Bill to this Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I moved a reasonable amendment that would deny the Bill a Second Reading for the reasons I listed.  I outlined the Labour Party's opposition to the method of introducing the Bill and to the scheduling of the debate on it.  It is important to underscore once again the absolute frustration of Opposition Deputies in this House, a frustration probably shared by many on the Government benches, in regard to what is ostensibly a very elaborate system of local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share the view that it is an elaborate system of local government reform but I daresay that in the next few weeks the Government benches will be singing to the tune of promises kept to bring in major reforms and put structures in place to guide local government and local democracy into the next century. The reality is far from that.  It is bad that we should begin the process of local government reform by running counter to the basic principles of democracy at national level.  It was most unfortunate, and unacceptable, that copies of this Bill should be handed to the party Whips only last Thursday when this week's business <Col N="43" /> had already been agreed by the party Whips.  It was most unfortunate that the explanatory memorandum of a long Bill should become available only hours before the debate was to begin.</P>
    <P>There are many interested parties up and down the country who have a passionate interest in local government. There are many interested organisations and individuals who work in local government, who want a say in this Bill and whose contributions would be worthy of consideration and should be taken into account.  However, the action of the Government in parachuting this Bill at the last possible minute and setting a time scale for its enactment which was designed to minimise contributions from the Opposition benches and minimise debate and proper scrutiny around the country has meant it is a bad day for democracy.</P>
    <P>It was said some time ago that people who like sausages and who respect the law should watch neither being made. Today people will be dismayed at the way laws are made here if what is in effect a decision of Cabinet is taken without amendment and without proper time for scrutiny.  I will make that point again before I go on to deal with the principal issues of the Bill.  The issues have been decided.  The Bill is before the House and Members on Government and Opposition benches have a responsibility to subject it to the maximum scrutiny allowed by the time and the method of introduction.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I mentioned the two overriding principles that affect local government and which are of fundamental importance from the Labour Party's point of view.  The first is the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> and the second is the principle of subsidiarity.  Those two concepts probably mean nothing to people outside of local government when stated in those bold terms but they are at the core of what most people who have looked at local government in recent years want to achieve.  They want real devolution of powers to communities so that they can have control over their own affairs.  That <Col N="44" /> is what we should be about.  Unfortunately that is not what this set of proposals will achieve.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by the Minister yesterday that real power was in some way being extended is a mere pretence, as one will see when one scrutinises the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A close reading of the Bill makes it clear that there are so many conditions attached to the representational functions of local government that the expressed intention in the Bill to widen the scope of local authorities is meaningless. For example, under this Bill no local authority can undertake any activity that would prejudice or duplicate activity arising from the performance or the statutory functions of any person within the functional area of the authority or that would, having regard to the activities or proposed activities of that person in relation to the area, involve wasteful or unnecessary expenditure by the authority.  Who is going to make these decisions?  These are the hidden barriers that are being put into legislation to thwart the ambition of empowering local government.</P>
    <P>What is meant by that?  Does it mean that in any county where one of the State's industrial agencies is operating, whether it is the IDA or SFADCo, the local community in that area is precluded from any industrial development activity?  Is that the Minister's intention? It certainly could be implied from the content of the Bill.  As it is drafted that section would prejudice existing industrial development efforts, not to mention the fact that it is being portrayed as giving new scope and authority to local authorities to involve themselves in new industrial or job creating activities.</P>
    <P>Precisely the same applies to tourism development and the development of sporting facilities.  In any area where the Minister for Sport chooses to intervene, the initiative of local communities or local government to act can be stifled. It can even be argued that a national organisation like the Arts Council can prohibit the involvement of local authorities in the development of art and culture that is a statutory body charged with <Col N="45" /> a particular function.  Is that the intention of the Minister?  Is that what we are to understand by broadening the scope and breaking the old <i>ultra vires</i> provision?</P>
    <P>As if all this were not enough, the Bill gives a general power to the Minister to prescribe matters in respect of which a local authority shall not exercise the additional powers conferred in this Bill. He is given the power to determine the amount of money which local authorities can spend on additional activity and to attach any condition he wishes to any grant to be made available to local authorities in respect of any of these additional activities.  The scope, when one looks at it in detail, for extra empowerment at local level is a lot shallower and hollower than the rhetoric the Minister sought to impress upon us last night.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister, under the provisions of this Bill, can ensure that local authorities have full and total regard to the policies and objectives of the Government or any Minister of the Government in carrying out these functions.  That makes a pretty kettle of fish.  A local authority, perhaps dominated by parties other than the one in Government, can be forced to have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government or a Minister in taking on any of these additional activities.  This provision effectively makes every Minister of the Government a potential dictator in relation to local government matters.</P>
    <P>Even though the Bill debars for the first time members of the Government and Ministers of State from being members of local authorities, they can influence a local authority to an extent far greater than any individual member. Having regard to all these restrictions and conditions it is quite nonsensical to argue that the <i>ultra vires</i> rule is being relaxed in any meaningful way and that the scope of local democracy is being widened. That quite clearly is a sham.  As I have said, it could quite rightly be argued that the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>The second principle I mentioned is that of subsidiarity, a word that has come into vogue in recent years.  In essence <Col N="46" /> the principle is a simple one.  It means it is desirable to carry out at local level every function at local level that is capable of being carried out at that level and to make all decisions at local level that are capable of being made at that level. It is a principle that nominally every Member of this House, or every party represented in the House, subscribes to. It is a very straightforward principle.  In the Northern context it can be called devolution, and it is bandied about by all parties in this House in relation to that position.</P>
    <P>What does this Bill do in relation to that principle?  Does it seek to move downwards real power?  Does it seek to divest the Minister of the stranglehold he has in relation to virtually every decision of local authorities?  Those of us who are currently members of local authorities know it is frustrating that in order to fill a pothole or fix a back door a local authority must have specific sanction from the Custom House.  This is a system that is designed currently to stifle initiative from any creative public servant at local level or imaginative council or councillor.  It is there to strangle them by surrounding them with so much bureaucracy and red tape that they just get frustrated and happily comply with the directions from the Custom House.</P>
    <P>How does this Bill seek to achieve that objective?  All the Bill does towards devolving powers downwards to local communities is to establish a vague framework under which the Government may &mdash; I stress &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; transfer some functions from the centre to local administration, but again this is hedged with so many restrictions and qualifications that it is virtually meaningless.  More importantly, no programme of devolution has been spelled out by the Government. Barrington and his expert committee wanted that.  Most people have identified in policy statements or discussion documents the powers that can be efficiently and effectively carried out at local level, with the best interests of the communities served at local level. We did not get a single clue from the Minister's statement last night, from his <Col N="47" /> press conference or from the contents of the Bill the nature of the functions this Government consider suitable to be devolved to local authorities.</P>
    <P>However, we have had some experience of the attitude of the Government to local communities in the last few years. This is, after all, the Government which rejected European Community funding simply and solely on the grounds that it had to be administered by local communities. They are a Government who, by practice over the last number of years, are centralist and seek to give all power to themselves.  They have worked consistently to stop real power from moving outside the close confines of Government Ministries.</P>
    <P>The advisory expert committee on local government reorganisation and reform, which were rightly praised by the Minister for the Environment last night, have done a tremendous job.  On behalf of the Labour Party I acknowledge, congratulate and welcome their report.  They set out in the report a wide range of headings under which there could be extensive devolution.  While the Minister paid lip service to the work they did, he was much less inclined to accept their recommendations lest to do so would weaken his position one iota.</P>
    <P>The specific functions and areas that the expert advisory committee thought could best be devolved to local communities included areas such as education. Most European countries already have local democratic control of education. The expert committee identified issues such as health, social welfare, transport and traffic, heritage and amenities, tourism, the police, courts and justice, consumer protection, development and information services, as being issues that could reasonably and effectively be devolved to local level.  However, the Minister is not prepared to make a single specific commitment on any of those issues.  Perhaps in the Minister's reply to the debate there will be a clearer picture of what the Government intend.</P>
    <P>Claims made in support of the Bill that there is to be a real devolution of powers <Col N="48" /> to local level are once again seen to be what they are &mdash; a sham.  All of that is underlined by the fact that the Bill confers on the Minister for the Environment an overriding power to make regulations. The Minister has that power virtually as he sees fit about anything that arises under the Bill.  He has the power to ensure that such regulations have the force of law, virtually on a <i>de facto</i> basis, because none of them will require a positive resolution of the Dáil.  The power is, therefore, an annulling order, but the Minister of State present knows well that the Government controls the agenda of the House.  Too many stark examples of that have been seen in recent days and months.  It would be virtually impossible, if the Government so chose, for the Opposition to have an annulling motion put before the House.  Under the provisions of the Bill the Minister will act and can act by fiat.  He can decide what regulations are to be made, what conditions are to be put in place and can ensure that they have the force of law. The general competence of local authorities, the issues to which local authorities must have regard in their functions, and so on, will all be directed by the Minister from the Custom House. The net effect of this provision is to centralise more and more power in the hands of the Minister for the Environment, while at the same time creating a veneer, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;veneer&rdquo;, that it is broadening the scope of local demoncracy. It is shameful that the opportunity is missed when there seems to be a consensus that the real way forward &mdash; not only in local government reform but also in the resolution of many of the fundamental issues that beset the country, from unemployment to the administration of efficient policies to combat poverty &mdash; is best found in strong local government.  The Bill gives a veneer of moving in that direction, but, as I have pointed out in the past few minutes, it is simply that, a veneer.</P>
    <P>I shall go on to other aspects of the Bill shortly, but at this point I should say that it should not come as a surprise that the Government are prepared to promote <Col N="49" /> legislation at this time and call it reform. As I said earlier, this is the Government that gave the promises of the 1985 local election manifesto &mdash; and I am sure that the mere mention of the 1985 local government elections will redden the cheeks of the Minister and the Minister of State.  The present Minister for the Environment was active at that time.  The present Minister for Energy, who in recent days has rushed to the defence of his colleague in Government, was also active and, indeed, was the principal architect of that manifesto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should consider for a moment some of the promises made to the electorate in 1985.  I shall quote from that manifesto:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will ensure that each local authority gains the maximum benefit from EEC Regional Funding and will introduce procedures whereby local authorities can make direct application for regional funding and receive such funds directly from the Community.</P>
      <P>We all know what happened to that promise when the EC actually offered to make money available provided it was applied for and administered by local communities.  In direct contradiction to the promises made in the manifesto, Fianna Fáil turned down these funds rather than allow local communities to have any say in their use.</P>
      <P>I have another good quotation for the Minister from the same manifesto, and if this does not redden faces on the Government benches I do not know what will.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will raise the annual housing output to 30,000 (including 6,000 local authority houses per year). The 50,000 unemployed building workers and their families and the 35,000 families waiting for homes can look with confidence to Fianna Fáil to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As anyone of the 25,000 people on the <Col N="50" /> housing list can testify, that is a particularly sick joke.  The latest review of housing was due to be published in April 1991.  I have no confidence that it will be seen in print this side of the local elections.  Even the Minister for the Environment and his Government colleagues could not shamefacedly meet the electorate with that promise and commitment hanging around their necks, given the reality of the past four years.  I am absolutely certain that when the figures are published they will show another dramatic increase in the number of families in urgent need of housing &mdash; an increase that will not be met by the 200 or so houses that are to be built in 1991 by all the local authorities combined and that certainly will not be met by what I describe as the Legoland policy of social housing, designed to cobble together a few good ideas that are peripheral to the real issue of building local authority houses for the tens of thousands of people up and down the country in urgent need.</P>
    <P>The same 1985 local election manifesto stated:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil views with concern the rapid deterioration of the county road system which represents 80 per cent of the public road network.  A special five year programme to assist local authorities to deal with the problem will be drawn up for the maintenance of county roads.  We believe that the preservation of the investment of over 60 years in county roads is essential.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, Fianna Fáil in Government have presided over the most substantial deterioration of the county road system in the history of our State. There are parts of Ireland where it is now virtually impossible to travel even a very short distance without running the risk of serious damage to one's motor vehicle. The condition of county roads has become a national joke, with pot-holing competitions replacing more traditional amenities as tourist attractions up and down the country.  I have heard of local authorities having recommendations put before them by distraught engineers who seek to put up signs saying &ldquo;Proceed at <Col N="51" /> your own risk&rdquo; because they cannot properly maintain the county road system. In order to save his face the Minister summons people to the Custom House and instructs them to do something about the problem between now and 27 June. However, in the space of three weeks the Minister cannot repair the damage done over four years.  He certainly cannot do so without providing money, which is the one thing he did not do when he met county engineers some weeks ago.</P>
    <P>In every area the Minister's promises have been recognised as completely shallow and completely without substance.  I wish to make another quotation from the 1985 manifesto so that the record can be complete:</P>
    <P>It is vital that substantial green belts be provided and maintained before our cities and towns become sprawling concrete zones.</P>
    <P>Within the last couple of months, while 150 acres lie derelict in Dublin city centre, proposals to rezone about 2,000 acres of Dublin's green belt for housing &mdash; enough for a new city the size of Limerick &mdash; have been tabled in the current review of the development plan for Dublin.  That is on top of the rezoning for 3,800 houses and 65 commercial developments by way of section 4 motions or variations in the development plan pushed through Dublin County Council since Fianna Fáil took majority control of that council in 1985.</P>

      <P>We can see what importance we can attach to promises from the Government or the Minister.  In the 1985 manifesto Fianna Fáil strongly attacked <Col N="52" /> the then Government's record on job creation, pointing to &ldquo;an all-time high level of 230,000 unemployed and emigration at 20,000 a year&rdquo;.  Has the Minister any sense of shame at sitting in a Government where 200,000 people have emigrated since he became Minister for the Environment and when, for the second consecutive month, we have the highest unemployment levels in the history of the State?  Despite driving 200,000 people out of the country, the Minister has achieved record unemployment levels; so much for the promises of the Government.</P>
      <P>My last quote is from the manifesto published by Fianna Fáil for the local elections in 1985:</P>
      <P>Since the Coalition Government came to power Fianna Fáil councillors on the eight health boards have opposed the savage cutbacks which are having a detrimental effect on the level of health care.  Fianna Fáil will continue to fight against the dismantling of our health services which it has taken so many years and so much hard work to build.  On return to Government we will continue the progressive development of our health services to ensure the highest quality of care is available to everyone, including those who are unable to provide it for themselves from their own resources.</P>
      <P>They were the cruellest of all promises and deceptions.  We had to deal with the horror stories of the last four years.  So well may the Minister turn away to talk to somebody else because he certainly does not want to hear the truth that promises from Fianna Fáil are worthless. Twenty hospitals have been closed, 4,000 beds were taken out of public hospitals and 5,000 health workers have been unemployed since those promises were made.  It is quite clear that, when it comes to promises, the Government have no credibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could give many more examples.  I could talk about the promise to restore financial stability to local authorities by repealing the Coalition Government's <Col N="53" /> Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, which the Minister promised to repeal on returning to office.  The Minister has been in Government for four years and it has still not been repealed.  However, I will give the Minister a chance to do so as I will table an amendment to this Bill and we will then see whether he will live up to this one promise to restore financial stability to local authorities.  That power was introduced by the then Government in 1983 when there was an emergency in relation to public and local government finances.  The Minister knows that the alternative to introducing it at that time would have been the immediate layoff of 4,000 local authority workers and corresponding cuts in local services.</P>
    <P>It is also well known that these local charges were introduced at that time and were stated to be &mdash; the records are there for the Minister to see &mdash; a temporary measure.  The reality is that, since being returned to office, Fianna Fáil have allowed local authority charges to double &mdash; where they exist &mdash; at the same time they have starved local authorities of resources and allowed staff and services to be decimated.  Local government today, six years after the list of promises I mentioned, is in an appalling and lamentable condition.  The Minister has statutory responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>In investigating the resources available to local authorities I tried, so far as it has been possible, to have recourse to the Government's published figures.  This has meant, to a considerable extent, relying on the comprehensive public expenditure programmes published by the Government every year up to 1989, the most recent figures to date.  These publications enable individual programmes and services to be examined rather than the aggregate sums found in the Book of Estimates.  I want to look at three major areas which reveal the following allocation of resources, and these are taken from the Minister's figures.  In 1984 we spent £295 million on roads, in 1985 we spent £315 million, in 1986 the figure was £330 million, in 1987 the figure was also £330 million, in 1988 the figure was £301 <Col N="54" /> million and in 1989 we spent £321 million. In 1987, when the Minister came to power, with the legacy of the promises I mentioned, we were spending £330 million on roads but by 1989 that had decreased &mdash; not taking account of inflation but in real terms &mdash; to £321 million.</P>
    <P>In 1984 we spent £255 million on sanitary services, in 1985 we spent £271 million, in 1986 we spent £270 million, in 1987 we spent £276 million, in 1988 &mdash; the first year in which the Minister was in office &mdash; we spent £155 million and in 1989 the figure was £160 million.  When the Minister came to office we were spending a sum of £276 million on sanitary services, but, after two years of his stewardship, the figure had collapsed to £160 million.</P>
    <P>In 1984, we spent £562 million on housing, in 1985 we spent £585 million, in 1986 we spent £627 million, and in 1987 we spent £698 million.  The last year before the Minister came to office we were spending just under £700 million on housing but, during the Minister's first year in office, that figure was slashed to £377 million and it was reduced further in 1989 to £296 million.  In two years he more than halved the housing expenditure budget in spite of giving pledges and promises to the unfortunates up and down the country living in grotty accommodation, caravans or rat infested hovels.  At the root of these figures lies what the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, called the charade of local government.  Indeed, in a recent article the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, referred to the shambles of local government.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that Fianna Fáil since 1987 &mdash; and in concert with the Progressive Democrats since 1989 &mdash; have systematically starved local authorities all round the country of resources.  The bottom line must be that all local government reform is absolutely meaningless if councillors, managers, community groups and concerned individuals are powerless to address problems or to seize opportunities because of the lack of resources.  The Minister saw fit last night <Col N="55" /> to try to deflect attention from this point. We were not supposed to mention funding as this is a Bill about structures &mdash; the Government are going to put nice structures in place and devolve power. As I have illustrated, that power is in a shambles already.  We were not to mention what is really the most important aspect of local government, the item highest on the agenda &mdash; if you ask any councillor in the land &mdash; that is funding. Without money to do the work there is no point in giving functions and responsibilities to anybody.  There is no point in telling county engineers to fix the roads when they are not given any money to do this work.  There is no point in telling local authorities to solve the homeless problem while at the same time the housing programmes are slashed.  The Government should be realistic and face up to these issues.  The Minister should try to address these issues in a concerted way and not hide from them.</P>
    <P>Under this Government we have seen the emergence of a housing crisis in every part of the country, the collapse of our road network and thousands of local authority employees losing their jobs. There are libraries which have not received new books for four years.  Fire brigade officers are worried about their capacity to respond to a real emergency. Derelict areas in our towns and cities have not been addressed.  There are no facilities for children in many local authority estates and no funding to put these facilities in place.  There is the huge problem of access for people with disabilities. All of these problems have been caused by a Government who are prepared to pay lip service to reform but who do not believe in allowing local authorities to have effective control over the affairs of their own areas.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some aspects of the Bill.  This Bill will establish a complicated and complex procedure for dealing with urban boundaries in a geographical sense but will preserve the power available to the Minister to deal with electoral boundaries, particularly in the county boroughs, in whatever way he chooses.  It is <Col N="56" /> important to make that differentiation. The Minister is putting elaborate but good systems in place to deal with boundary extensions but he has separated from those the power he wishes to keep to himself in relation to dividing electoral areas within county boroughs, nominating the number of members in county boroughs and deciding on the number of aldermen in each ward.  A number of questions arise from this state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister separated the power to change electoral boundaries from the general powers outlined in the Bill in regard to geographical boundaries? Perhaps the Minister will answer that question when he is replying to the debate.  Why has he chosen to establish a framework of boundary committees who can never be truly independent since they will all be appointed by him and remunerated by him as he determines?  Why has the Minister not chosen to follow the procedure, now generally accepted as appropriate in the case of Dáil electoral boundaries, of appointing a High Court judge or some other independent person to chair such committees?  Alternatively, why does he not adopt the procedure contained in a Bill from his Department, the Environment Protection Planning Bill, so as to allow nominated bodies to put forward the names of members of the boundary committees to ensure that they are not only independent but can be genuinely seen to be independent?</P>
    <P>In the absence of satisfactory answers to these questions the suspicion must remain that the Minister is no more committed to independence and the objective drawing of boundaries than he was in regard to Dáil boundary redrawings, on which he was forced to change his view by a majority decision of this House. Even though none of them is here to listen to me, I must say I find it surprising that the Progressive Democrats appear to be content to allow this situation of ministerial <i>carte blanche</i> to remain unchanged in this area.</P>

      <P>I am afraid it looks like <Col N="57" /> that.  This Bill is, of course, silent on the future of urban authorities.  We still do not know what plans the Government have for urban authorities.  There is reason to believe that once the local elections are out of the way they will be perfectly capable of adopting the less favourable model suggested by the advisory committee, that is, set up sub-committees of county councils to run the affairs of urban areas.  In effect this would abolish the urban authorities, the oldest model of local democracy in existence.</P>

Which option does the Minister favour?  He should put his cards on the table for once in advance of the local elections.  He should not tell us it is not true and keep his cards to himself as if it is a State secret.  The Minister should have a view on these matters.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge, in particular, the positive contribution of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Ger Connolly, in relation to this matter.  However, that is peripheral to what I am saying.  Essentially I am asking the Minister what his intention is in relation to these local authorities. These authorities consist of members of the Minister's party and every other party who have worked for many decades serving their communities. I am afraid &mdash; I put this down as a marker to him &mdash; that the Minister will not have the same cohesiveness in relation to urban development if he dilutes urban authorities with a huge rural hinterland which is not focused in the same way on the urban authority.  I put that down as a marker and I would welcome a debate on it.  We have nothing before us at present and I hope the Minister's intentions in this regard, if not addressed in the context of this Bill, will at least be the subject of some discussion document in advance of the local elections on 27 June.</P>
      <P>With regard to Dublin, all the signs are that the Government have no intention in the final analysis of dividing Dublin effectively into four separate local authorities. All that is proposed in the Bill is a clumsy and bureaucratic framework which seems almost to have been designed to enable reform in Dublin to be put on the long finger.  In spite of the fact that the reform of Dublin along the lines suggested here was first proposed in that infamous year of 1985 &mdash; the structure outlined in this Bill seems to represent little more than a slight extension of the proposals in the Local Government (Reorganisation) Bill of that time &mdash; page after page of this Bill is devoted to demonstrating to any democrat who wishes to peruse and read it carefully, exactly how the process of reform in Dublin can be delayed <i>ad nauseam.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> I want to refer briefly to the &ldquo;Sir Humphrey&rdquo; measures in the Bill.  We are all familiar with the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; programme &mdash; I am sure it is compulsive viewing for all of us in politics.  There is a famous episode in that series called &ldquo;The Middle Class Rip Off&rdquo; in which the Minister of the day and his senior civil servant, Sir Humphrey, grapple with a particularly difficult problem which is almost certain to cause offence to local councillors on a wide scale.</P>

      <P>I think you will find in the contribution I have made that I have dissected every section of the Bill, and it is my intention to do so.  If the Chair has some difficulty with my doing so in a humorous way, I am sorry but that is the way I will deal with this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a local government reform Bill we are discussing, not a television programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to television programmes in his contribution last night and the spokesman for the Fine Gael Party referred to several radio programmes, &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; among them, in his contribution last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will develop the point.  The problem related to doing something designed to cause offence to local councillors and Sir Humphrey's solution to soften the blow was brilliant and simple.  He coupled the councillors' acceptance of the Minister's unpalatable proposals with increases in their allowances and entertainment expenses &mdash; a small price to pay for the acceptance of something which is totally unpalatable.  I do not know whether or not there is a Sir Humphrey working in the Department of the Environment, but it is interesting that there are sweeteners in the Bill which do not deliver on the real meat that is required by every local <Col N="60" /> authority member up and down the country, the power to control their own authorities, to serve the community in a real and meaningful way.  Even Sir Humphrey nods.</P>
    <P>Who else but a bureaucrat who has completely lost the run of himself would want the Minister for the Environment to have the power to issue directions to local authorities in relation to twinning arrangements?  The Minister will have those powers also.  Of what is the Minister afraid?  Is the Minister afraid that Mullinavat will want to twin with Moscow, that Castlebar might twin with Capetown or that Portumna would want to twin with Peking?  Can anyone argue that this absurd provision has anything to do with local government reform?  Why must the Minister reach to control everything that a local council seeks to do? Does he not trust them to do anything without his guidance or the guidance of his Department?  The more one analyses this Bill, the more one comes to the conclusion that the Bill is considerably less than the sum of its parts and that the parts of the Bill have little or nothing to do with the major question of local government reform and the provision of essential services for the people.</P>
    <P>Throughout Ireland there are voluntary groups consistently working not only to address local problems but to harness the potential and dynamic that is visible on every corner of the country. This Bill says nothing to them or to the many frustrated and genuine local authority members who are committed to the improvement and development of their locality.  It says nothing to those who believe that industry and tourism development are intimately tied up with the issue of infrastructural development. It says nothing to the communities who are in despair about the state of the roads and a wide range of local issues and it says nothing to the neglected thousands of families awaiting a home.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not urgent.  In fact it is not needed.  The total sum of reform in this Bill is minimal.  The Bill requires substantial amendments if it is to have any meaning for people.  For years we have <Col N="61" /> promised communities the power to run their own affairs but, while the rest of Europe moves to empower local communities, we continue to hug power to the centre.  When the smoke has blown away, this Bill, like the Minister's programme for social housing and like the discredited Fianna Fáil programme of 1985 will be seen to lack substance, commitment and vision.  The Minister has crushed the great promise of new horizons for local government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  The previous two speakers referred to the record of the Minister for the Environment in the four years he has held office.  I have been observing that record at the close quarters of this House for the past two years or thereabouts, and the one thing that strikes me most forcibly about it is not just the lack of performance by the Minister in the areas for which he is responsible, but the contempt in which he holds this House in virtually every area of responsibility.  The Minister has studiously avoided bringing his proposals into this House and having good honest debate on them.  In each area the Minister has taken himself across the road to a hotel to announce his policies to a press conference and then avoided coming into this House to debate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The serious housing crisis has been mentioned.  I have no doubt that some time after the local elections, when the Minister gets around to counting the number of people who are on housing lists which have been or are being submitted to his Department he will find that the number waiting for housing is closer to 30,000 than to the 20,000 which the Minister claimed.  He will find that the number of homeless persons is over 5,000 <Col N="62" /> and not under 1,000 as the Minister claimed.  Yet the Minister has studiously avoided debating the issue of housing in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister three months ago produced a policy document to a press conference. Three months later, not a single iota of that policy has been implemented. Not a single extra unit of accommodation has been provided and only this week in anticipation of questions in this House yesterday, circulars have been issued to local authorities to give effect to those policy statements.  Those circulars merely repeat what was contained in the original policy document.</P>
    <P>Over a year ago we had another example of it.  The Minister announced an environment action plan.  A sum of £1 billion was to be provided for environment programmes over the next ten years.  When one strips away the public relations rhetoric which surrounded that policy document all that was contained in it was the Minister's capital programme for the next ten years, spiced up by the structural funds which will become available to his Department.  The high points of that environment action plan were the proposals to deal with smog in Dublin which certainly contributed to the elimination of smog in Dublin.  However, that has been done at a price, and the price has been paid by people on low incomes who are now paying more than double what they paid previously to heat their homes and who have been denied conversion grants to convert to low smoke fuels.  The smog has been eliminated at the price too of the 100,000 homes in Dublin city and county who are not connected to the gas grid for which the Minister is not providing any relief. We have had something similar in relation to local government.  One year ago we had a debate in this House about the postponement of the local elections. Since then, it has been a question of public statements being made by the Minister rather than a debate in this House.</P>
    <P>The debacle surrounding the circulation of the Bill is yet another <Col N="63" /> example.  Two months ago, on 7 March, the Minister announced his intentions with regard to the Local Government Bill.  It took him two months to produce the Bill and he then avoided circulating it honestly with the result that Members have not had adequate time to study and debate it.  While four days have been set aside this week for Second Stage, only two days are being set aside next week for Committee Stage, even though the Bill contains 55 sections in seven Parts. We will have little more than ten minutes per section.  That is not the way to deal with local government reform or with any issue of such importance.  Given that the Minister has such contempt for national democracy, we can hardly expect any better from him on the issue of local democracy.</P>
    <P>It seems we have a problem with the Minister.  Not only is he not performing in the Department but he has the worst record on housing for many decades, he has failed to reform local government as I will demonstrate in the course of my contribution, has presided over massive reductions in local government expenditure and he is not prepared to come into the House to debate the matter honestly.  I say this with respect but I think it is time we had another Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>We have been waiting for this Bill for two years.  It was first mentioned in the Programme for Government.  Anticipating a postponement of the local elections due to be held in 1990, it proposed the establishment of an all-party committee to examine local government reform.  The Workers' Party were quite prepared to participate in an all-party committee and very much regret that the Fine Gael Party did not agree.  That was a tactical mistake which may have had more to do with their concentration on apparent opposition than real opposition. To be fair to them they indicated at a very early stage that they were not prepared to participate in an all-party committee. The Minister had no excuse for trying to justify the nine or ten months delay in bringing forward a motion to postpone <Col N="64" /> the local elections by blaming Fine Gael and their unwillingness to participate in the all-party committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is the Minister knew, as far back as July 1989, that there was no agreement on a proposal to establish an all-party committee; yet, it took him until May 1990 to put something in its place and we did not get that until exactly one month before the local elections were due to be held.  In other words, the Government lost the best part of a year during which time they could have addressed the question of local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then came into the House to make a fine sounding speech about local government reform and set himself a timetable which he knew could not be met.  He indicated that the Government committee would report by the end of September 1990, that the legislation would be circulated by December 1990 and that it would be enacted by February 1991.  I do not often quote myself but I would like to quote one sentence from my contribution to that debate, I said: &ldquo;Quite frankly, I do not believe that this timescale is feasible.&rdquo;  I went on to argue that there was no necessity to postpone the local elections, that they could have gone ahead and that the Government <Col N="65" /> could still have proceeded with a programme of legislation to reform local government.</P>
    <P>It is said that the cruelest thing one can say to anybody is &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; but I did tell the Minister so.  The advisory expert committee reported at Christmas but it then took the Government two months to make up their minds on what they should do about that report.  They made their announcement on 7 March. It took them another two months to produce the Bill.  The Whips got working copies last Thursday and, as we know, it was not circulated to Members until Monday morning.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the substance of the Bill.  There are nine areas in particular that I would like to cover.  First, I would like to deal with the postponement of the local elections and the provisions in the Bill dealing with the local elections. Yesterday afternoon the Taoiseach stated quite clearly when defending the Bill that the reason the Bill had to go through was that the newly elected councillors would be elected to reformed bodies.  I wish to deal with that assertion.</P>
    <P>Second, I would like to deal with the functions of local authorities as the big claim made for the Bill is that it will extend and widen the functions of local authorities and that the old <i>ultra vires</i> rule will be dispensed with.  Third, I would like to deal with the system of local government in Dublin which will not be reformed by this Bill, which will remain essentially the same as it was in 1985 and which, for the foreseeable future, will be even more chaotic than it has been during the past six years.  Fourth, I would like to deal with the question of local authority boundaries.  The Minister claimed that we will now have an independent procedure. Fifth, I welcome the planning proposals contained in the Bill.  I wish to explain the reasons I welcome those proposals.</P>
    <P>Sixth, I would like to deal with the question of regional authorities.  Seventh, I would like to deal with some of the miscellaneous provisions contained in the Bill, in particular those relating to the appointment and tenure of office of city <Col N="66" /> and county managers.  Eighth, I would like to deal with the recommendations in the Barrington report which have not been addressed in the Bill.  Seventy five recommendations have been made in the report of the expert committee, 63 of which are either not going to be implemented or effectively reversed by the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to deal with local government finance not least because just before I came into the House I was informed that yet another householder in Cork, a prominent trade union official, Mr. Brendan O'Neill, has now been jailed for his protest against service charges, charges which the Minister for Energy, when director of elections for the Fianna Fáil Party for the local elections in 1985, promised would be abolished.</P>
    <P>When the local elections were postponed last year it was said one could not elect people to bodies which had their origins in the last century.  Yet the elections that are going ahead this year &mdash; those to the county and city councils &mdash; are going ahead to bodies who owe their origins to legislation which was passed in 1898.  The county councils and city councils are precisely the same bodies that this State inherited since the last century.  Let me quote the Minister, because he described it quite colourfully in his contribution this time last year, as an age when roads were the preserve of the horse and the idea of democratic government was regarded as new-fangled and a slightly dangerous notion.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of this Bill postpones indefinitely all local elections except those to the county councils, the four city corporations of Galway, Dublin, Waterford and Limerick and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  It also postpones the elections of bodies appointed by urban district councils and town commissioners, whether they are VECs or members of harbour boards.  There is no indication in the Bill as to the length of time for which these local elections are being postponed and the length of time for which these bodies will now continue to exist.</P>
    <P>Here I want to refer to the Barrington Committee report which dealt very <Col N="67" /> specifically with the question of the postponement of local elections.  It says that local government elections should not be capable of postponement by central Government by order except in a state of emergency and that local elections should be held on a fixed date.  Yet section 14 of this Bill postpones indefinitely the local elections to urban councils and town commissioners. Presumably the logic behind this is that the Minister has promised he is going to introduce further legislation at some stage to deal with sub-county structures, but how long are we to wait for this legislation?</P>
    <P>If the local elections had gone ahead last year the five-year lifetime of those bodies would be expiring in 1995.  I believe even if we are lucky it will be close to 1995 before legislation is through this House to establish new sub county structures.  Therefore, effectively we will have bodies who were elected in 1985 &mdash; which conveniently in many cases gave Fianna Fáil a majority on those bodies &mdash; continuing to exist for virtually a ten-year period.  How that can be described as democracy I do not know.  Of course, the reason is highly political.  The reason local elections were postponed last year had little or nothing to do with local government reform.  The local elections were postponed last year because Fianna Fáil did not want to face the electorate last year.  The Progressive Democrats had some slight difficulty with that.  They need local elections in order to tee up candidates for a future general election. They are not interested in the minor details of local government that would have to be dealt with by urban councils and town commissioners.  They are interested only in the larger bodies where they can elect people to county councils or city councils who will be able to get a high enough profile to be potential Dáil candidates at the next general election. Therefore, a compromise was worked out whereby the elections for the county councils and the city councils proceed and the rest of local government can wait.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the bodies who are going to be elected on 27 June and see to what <Col N="68" /> extent those bodies are reformed.  As I said, the bodies themselves are precisely the same as were established in the last century, so there is no structural reform to those bodies.  Let us look at the question of representational reform.  Has anything changed there?  It has not.  Let us look at the proportion of population which is represented by councillors and will continue to be represented by councillors after 27 June.  In County Leitrim there will be one county councillor per 1,228 population.  In the city of Dublin there will be one councillor per 9,668 population.  Those are the two extremes. In between, you can compare County Carlow with one county councillor per 1,951 to the county of Dublin which has 6,650, and on and on it goes.  One can compare the degree to which the level of representation between different parts of the country has become very unrepresentative and disproportionate since these bodies were established in the last century.  That should not come as a surprise to us because, of course, this country has changed enormously since 1898. For a start, it has become more urbanised. There have been very big shifts in population from some of the rural counties to the more urbanised areas.</P>

      <P>Therefore, there are degrees of unrepresentation.  Each of these councillors, whether in County Leitrim or the city of Dublin, has the same status.  Each has the same vote in Seanad elections.  Is it any wonder the Seanad is beginning to look and sound more and more like &ldquo;Grand Ole Oprey&rdquo;? The bodies who are to be elected on 27 June are bodies who are now quite unrepresentative and this Government have failed to deal with that aspect.</P>
      <P>The second area I want to deal with is the functions of local authorities.  The Minister has claimed these functions are going to be extended.  Let us again look at the Barrington Committee report. First, it recommended that Ireland, as part of the reorganisation programme, should ratify the European Charter of local self-government.  There is no mention of that in the Bill, and this Bill would have given the Government an ideal opportunity to ratify that charter.  The Barrington Committee recommended that the opportunity be taken to give constitutional recognition to local government.  There is no reference in our Constitution to local government, which explains why Governments can with impunity interfere with the system of local government and undermine it very seriously in the way this Bill does.  I did not expect the Bill would have made a proposal for constitutional change, but I would have expected that the Minister would have at least included that in his speech here yesterday evening if he was serious about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of subsidiarity was the whole basis for the Barrington Committee report, a principle of public services being devoted to the lowest practicable level at which they can be discharged efficiently and effectively. The Minister made no concession to the principle of subsidiarity in the contribution he made in this House; in fact, <Col N="70" /> the provisions of the Bill go very much in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes great play of the fact that the representational functions and general competence of local authorities are being extended and strengthened. Reading the Bill one is inclined to go along with that.  Reading the sections dealing with the representational function and the general competence of local authorities, one is inclined to say that this is marvellous, the powers of local authorities are being increased.  Reading the section dealing with reserve functions, one is also inclined to go along with the idea that the powers and functions of local authorities are being increased. Then we come to subsections where all the alleged new functions that are being given to local authorities are being reined in.  For example, section 3 provides that &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations for the general purposes or for any particular purpose of this Act&rdquo;.  If local authorities take at face value the new extended role which is allegedly being given to them, the Minister can make regulations to circumscribe it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 deals with the general competence of local authorities. Subsection (5) states:</P>
      <P>(5)  A local authority shall not, by virtue of this section, perform any function (including the incurring of expenditure or any liability, whether contractual or otherwise) which is conferred on the authority by any other provision of this or of any other enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the question of housing. Those of us who are members of local <Col N="71" /> authorities know how frustrating it is that a local authority cannot build a house without going back to the Department of the Environment for everything from funding to design and approval of the contract.  Presumably any other enactment under this subsection would relate to the housing Acts under which local authorities are required to refer at all times to the Department of the Environment. That will continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin has referred to subsection (6) which states:</P>
    <P>(6)  A local authority shall not, by virtue of this section, undertake or provide assistance for the undertaking of any activity that would prejudice or duplicate activity arising from the performance of a statutory function by any person in the functional area of the authority or that would, having regard to the activities or proposed activities of that person in relation to the area, involve wasteful or unnecessary expenditure by the local authority.</P>
    <P>There was much talk when the Fianna Fáil Government after the 1987 local elections abolished health committees. Let us suppose that after the passage of this Bill a local authority decided that they would like to take an interest in the health of the community and to establish a health committee to provide some representational leadership in the matter.  Under this subsection that would be prejudicing or duplicating activity which the Minister would claim is a matter for the health board.</P>
    <P>If existing legislation does not succeed in roping in the local authority, subsection (7) will give the Minister power to do so.  Subsection 7 (a) states:</P>
    <P>(7) (a)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, prescribe matters in respect of which a local authority shall not exercise the powers conferred by this section or in respect of which such exercise shall be subject to prescribed terms or conditions.</P>
    <P>Let us say that a local authority decide to <Col N="72" /> engage in some commercial activity, a joint venture for the establishment of some recreational facility.  The Minister can proscribe the local authority from engaging in that activity.  The general competence and representational role of local authorities is being taken away by these subsections.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is remarkable.  Local authorities will have to have regard to certain matters in performing their functions. Some of those matters are perfectly in order.  For example, local authorities must have regard to the law of the land, legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and their own financial resources.  That is perfectly understandable.  Will the Minister explain what section 7 (1) (e) means?  It provides that local authorities must have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government or any Minister of the Government in so far as they may affect or relate to their functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one thing for the Government to insist that local authorities must have regard to legislation enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas, but they must now have regard to the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  That is what this means.  Local authorities must have regard to the wishes of any Government Minister.  Let us consider the controversy that arose in the past month or so when the Office of Public Works wanted to build an interpretative centre on top of one of the Wicklow mountains.  Wicklow County Council said they did not want a centre there.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works says it is his policy and he wants the centre there.  Does that mean that Wicklow County Council cannot object and must have regard to the views of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the major question of the tolling of the western ring road in Dublin.  We have known since the beginning of 1989 that it is the policy of the <Col N="73" /> Minister that it should be tolled, to the point that he even advertised for tenders without the approval of the county council whose reserved function it is to make a tolling scheme.  He even awarded a tender and arranged for the erection of toll booths on the road before the county council had made a decision on the matter.  As it turned out, the county council instructed that the toll booths be removed and made it clear that they had no intention of making a tolling scheme for that road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Those reserved functions are to be taken from the local authorities under the Roads Bill, which we are to debate after the local elections, and given to the Minister and the National Roads Authority.  Even if that were not the case, this means that Dublin County Council could not instruct their manager to remove the toll booths because they would have to have regard to the policy of the Government and of any Government Minister in relation to the performance of their function.  It means that local authorities are being reduced to extensions of the arm of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin quoted the TV programme &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo;.  The whole system of local government is being reduced.  Section 9 deals with the transfer of functions to local authorities. The Barrington Committee recommended that a large number of Government functions should be devolved to local authorities.  These involve housing grants, group water schemes, driver testing, foreshore licences, non-commercial State harbours, non-national parks, the protection of historical and archaeological sites, the maintenance of public buildings and so on.  Those are matters which would be within the existing general competence of local authorities.  The report went on to deal with other Government Departments and listed heritage <Col N="74" /> and amenity, tourism, police and courts, consumer protection and social employment schemes as functions which could be devolved to local government.</P>
      <P>The intention of the report was that the legislation to be brought forward would incorporate the devolution of those powers.  Section 9 does not devolve any of those powers.  It provides that the Government may by provisional order transfer functions.  That provisional order would have to come before the Oireachtas.  We know what the agenda of the Oireachtas is like and how often we get an opportunity of confirming a provisional order of that kind.  The last thing Government Departments want is to devolve any of their functions.  This is dog licence legislation.  Unless certain identified functions are specified in the legislation to be devolved to local government it will not happen.  The whole practice of Government is increasingly to centralise powers.  That degree of centralisation is reflected in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate a list of the 12 persons whom I appointed as members of the Board of the National <Col N="75" /> Concert Hall Company for a five year term commencing on 23 April 1991.</P>
      <P>Details regarding the property of the company and its financial performance since its inception in 1981 are set out in the annual report and accounts of the company.

      <P>A confidential review of practices, procedures and management systems at the National Concert Hall was prepared in 1990 by the management services section of the Department of Finance at the request of my Department.  The review was circulated to board members on its completion in June 1990.  It would not be appropriate or in keeping with long established practice to publish that review which was prepared on a confidential basis.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, since its inception in 1981, the National Concert Hall continues to be an artistic and popular success, satisfying a wide range of tastes in musical entertainment and providing a public platform for both emerging and established artistic performers of Irish and international significance.</P>

      <P>It could mean a great deal.  There are two main concepts; there are a number of subsidiary concepts.  One <Col N="79" /> approach is to list all the things that will remain at national level and those that will stay at Community level.  Another approach is to list all the things that will never be ceded to the Community.  We are very far from agreement on the principle of subsidiarity.</P>
      <P>We would favour a system of subsidiarity, in other words, that those things which are best done at member state level be left to the member states to do, subject to the very important qualification that the legal limits must be fairly clearly defined and, secondly, that it would not mean a reversal of important common Community policies to national level &mdash; policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy.

      <P>We are strongly in favour of Community action in the cultural sphere and have been involved in a range of such activities.  One such instance is the European Community scheme of prizes for literature and translation which we are organising this year as part of our Cultural capital celebrations.</P>
      <P>We have recently supported a measure for a specific treaty article giving Community competence in the area of culture and this should help to increase Community action in this sphere in tandem with the member states.</P>
      <P>Through our membership of the Community's Committee on Cultural Affairs, we are involved in the formulation of the cultural policy of the Community.  The Community Ministers with responsibility for Culture meet during each Presidency to consider and decide on these matters.</P>
      <P>In relation to cultural property, the question of the effect of the internal market on cultural property is being considered. Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome allows for specific restrictions on trade in order to protect national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value. The Committee on Cultural Affairs is considering how best this and other measures might be used by member states to safeguard the cultural heritage in each state when there is free movement of goods generally.  The matter will shortly be put to the Council of Ministers of Culture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if you introduce a new Article into the Treaty of Rome covering cultural property there is a possibility that it could reduce the protection provided by Article 36, so far as our capacity to restrict exports of cultural property is concerned, in the sense that the two Articles would then be read together by the court?  Does the Taoiseach agree this is a danger and <Col N="81" /> further that cultural artefacts should not be subject to the disciplines of the internal market regarding free movement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there would be fairly widespread agreement on that.  We have worked with the Commission in tabling a specific proposal for a new Article. I would be reasonably confident that there would be fairly widespread agreement by the member states that the new situation of the free market will have to be coped with so far as cultural property and items of artistic and cultural interest are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there would not be total unanimity on that because a number of member states make quite a significant income from trading in cultural property that originated in other member states&mdash; I instance the art market in London as one example?  Does the Taoiseach agree that such interests would tend to use any new Article in the Constitution concerning culture to challenge the compatibility with the Treaty of Rome of any measures we might have in place previously defended by Article 36?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear on the scope of the Deputy's argument.  Our efforts would be directed to ensuring that we can maintain the existing controls we have under the National Monuments Acts, and the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945.  We would also be anxious to ensure that whatever would replace the existing Article would be more satisfactory from our point of view.  There could not be any question of it being in conflict with the Treaty of Rome because the intergovernmental conferences will bring forward proposals to amend the original Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach clarify whether the negotiations or discussions to which he has referred will make a clear distinction between cultural property which is, so to speak, being marketed and cultural property which is in the possession of various member states, for example the Elgin Marbles, which are an integral part of the cultural property of Greece or indeed some Irish Celtic artefacts which are in the possession of the British Museum?  In the logic of what he is saying, does he envisage that the ultimate conclusion of these discussions will make a distinction between the two kinds of markets and will provide for the return to peripheral countries in Europe of intrinsic elements of their own cultural property which were taken at different times and in different circumstances?</P>

      <P>This is an area where widely diverse views are passionately held; but the proposal we have put forward is not retrospective and deals with the movement between member states from now on.  The question of the return of artefacts to the countries from which they were originally taken is a much wider issue altogether and is not on the table at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>An analysis of the live register of the type described by the Deputy was carried out on a quarterly basis up to 1988.  Following a general review of the set of live register analyses, this analysis was replaced from January 1989 by a monthly analysis based on area of registration.</P>
      <P>The present area analysis gives totals of registrations in each county.  It has many other advantages by comparison with the former analysis, such as (1) it is linked to the end-of-month count of the live register; (2) it has a monthly rather than a quarterly frequency; (3) details for each of the 130 local employment offices are published within ten working days of the reference date and (4) separate details on persons under and over 25 years of age registering at each local office are published.</P>
      <P>The new monthly analysis provides, therefore, a more frequent, comprehensive and timely geographical analysis of the live register than was previously available.  A copy of the results for 29 March 1991, the latest date for which the figures are available, is in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The locational information requirements for policy purposes are well served by the existing analyses of the live register and I do not intend to request the Central Statistics Office to resurrect the analysis which was discontinued from the end of 1988.</P>

The problem here is that in a county like my own where the true rate of unemployment is about 20 per cent, because of the system we get figures that reflect about half of that.  Many unemployed persons are registered at Athlone employment office which is in County Westmeath, at Longford which is in <Col N="88" /> County Longford and at Carrick-on-Shannon which is in County Leitrim. Would the Minister of State agree that it is totally unsatisfactory that we cannot get accurate figures for counties in planning for industries and so on?  In the light of that information would he not agree that change is necessary?</P>

      <P>The change to improve the system was made in 1988.  Figures are also published now on a monthly basis rather than on a quarterly basis.  The previous system was subject to certain deficiencies.  I would add that many towns have expanded well beyond the original legal boundaries and in these cases the data in referring as it did to only part of the built-up town area, may not have been particularly useful or beneficial to anybody concerned.</P>

      <P>An analysis of the live register of the type described by the Deputy was carried out on a quarterly basis up to 1988.  It was discontinued from the start of 1989 following a general review of the set of live register analyses <Col N="89" /> being compiled by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>The decision to revise the then set of live register analyses followed interdepartmental consultation with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Labour, Social Welfare and Industry and Commerce.

The available data relates to the period January to September 1990, which is the latest period for which such data has been published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities.

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are very concerned about the problems of the young homeless and other children at risk and are taking urgent action to ensure that the welfare of these children is fully protected.  The Government have given special responsibility to myself as Minister of State at the Department of Health to co-ordinate and integrate the work of the various Government agencies in their initiatives for dealing with this matter. The Departments of Education and Justice are the two other Departments most directly involved.  I would like to outline the most important aspect of the initiatives in hand.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Bill, which is currently before the Seanad and is expected to be enacted by the summer, contains important new provisions to assist young homeless people.  It will impose a statutory duty on the health boards to promote the welfare of children up to the age of 18 years who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  It will also require the health boards to investigate the circumstances of homeless children and, where necessary, to make alternative accommodation available for them.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the early enactment of the Bill, health boards have been directed to ensure that there is sufficient accommodation available for homeless young people in the areas, in co-operation with the various voluntary and Church groups active in this field.  An immediate target is to increase to 64 the number of places for the young homeless available in the Dublin area and the first of the new places will come on stream in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations concerning a number of other projects in the Dublin area are at <Col N="92" /> an advanced stage and will result in a further increase in available accommodation. I have asked the Eastern Health Board and the other parties concerned to expedite their efforts and I expect that most of these additional places will become available in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Outside the Dublin area, a number of other initiatives for the young homeless are being supported.  Approval has recently been given to the Southern Health Board to build a new group home at Shankiel Road, Cork.  Funds have also been made available to develop a new unit for adolescents near Limerick.  My Department are in discussion with a number of other health boards about proposals for developments to assist the young homeless in their areas.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> makes specific provision for the implementation of the Bill, when passed, on a phased basis.  One million pounds was allocated towards the implementation of the Bill in this year's budget and further funds will be provided in future budgets in accordance with the terms of the programme.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, futile to provide additional places for homeless children without putting in place some support services to tackle the root cause of the problem; otherwise, the additional places provided will simply be filled as fast as they become available.  Accordingly, we have agreed to provide additional social workers to work with children at risk and ten extra social workers are to be recruited immediately.  Further recruitment will take place when a full evaluation of the problem has been completed.</P>
    <P>I have a particular concern for the children of travelling families since all the evidence suggests that they are at particular risk.  Accordingly, health boards have been instructed to review their plans for the delivery of health care to travellers and, in particular, to examine the need for mobile health care facilities.  In this regard I am also examining the role and structure of the Monitoring Committee on Travellers to see how they can <Col N="93" /> be made more effective and more responsive to the needs of travellers.  These are the main initiatives which are taking place under the aegis of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The provision of accommodation for children who get into trouble with the law is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education. There are some difficulties in this regard at present due to the shortage of places for young offenders, particularly young female offenders.  This is being tackled as a matter of urgency by the Department of Education and arrangements are well advanced to provide an additional eight to ten places for girls and 30 places for boys at the former Scoil Árd Mhuire premises in Lusk, County Dublin.  The first of this accommodation is to be available in September of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the first of this accommodation is to be available in <Col N="94" /> September of this year.  A new purpose-built school for 20 young female offenders is being planned for Finglas and will be completed in 1993.  I am advised that when all these facilities are in place there should be sufficient accommodation available for children appearing before the courts who require custodial care.  Again, of course, I would like to emphasise that the primary aim here is the prevention of crime in the first instance.  With this in mind the Minister for Justice has taken a number of initiatives in relation to the issue particularly with regard to the strengthening of the juvenile liaison officer scheme, establishment of the garda school programme and community projects organised in conjunction with the probation service. This whole issue is a matter of serious concern to me, to the Department of Health and to the Government.  That is why I have taken the trouble to outline to the Deputy and to this House some of the most important initiatives which are in hand at present.</P>
      <P>I am also taking a very keen interest in this issue.  There are frequent meetings of an interdepartmental group under my chairmanship which is considering a wide range of issues in relation to children and in particular is initiating a range of measures to solve the problem of homelessness among young people together with that of crime and its consequences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that of 26 young homeless people who applied for accommodation in Dublin in January only nine were placed appropriately? The most recent study shows that there are 400 homeless young people in Dublin and 74 in Cork.  The Minister's plan to provide places is grossly inadequate. Would he agree that there is no provision for specially disturbed children who are homeless?  Is he aware that research has shown that 25 per cent of young homeless people have been involved in prostitution and 70 per cent in abuse of alcohol, drugs and solvents? Would he not agree that what is needed here is a much greater budgetary commitment to this problem which has not <Col N="95" /> been addressed by the Government despite plans stretching into the distant future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not agree that the Government are not tackling this issue.  They most certainly are tackling it and evidence of this is the Government's decisions to provide £1 million in this year's budget, money which is currently being spent in the provision of places for young homeless people.  The Minister for Health and I, in operating this initiative to provide places for young homeless, have been in touch with each health board and have determined that we will provide, through the health boards and the voluntary sector, a specific number of additional places for young homeless people during the course of this year.  We have set targets in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since mid-1984 the number of places available to young homeless people has declined by 100?  Despite the Minister's projections there are fewer places for young homeless people and more of these people on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is very important that this whole issue be tackled in a co-ordinated fashion.  Certainly throughout the early part of the eighties this was probably not the case.  There was too much reliance on the voluntary sector, but that position is now changing. Each health board will be specifically involved in assisting with the provision of additional places.  This will be tackled on a co-ordinated basis, supported by resources provided in this year's budget. With that twin approach we will provide the additional places that are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the figures quoted by Deputy Bruton with regard to the total number of homeless people.  The figure of several hundred is taken from a report of some years ago which took into account all the contacts made by homeless people with voluntary organisations and health boards, particularly in the Eastern Health Board region.  The figures <Col N="96" /> appear high but they are the cumulative figures.  On one night, the Eastern Health Board carried out a physical check, through their own professional and trained staff who are informed on these matters, and found nowhere near that number.  However, the Minister for Health and I are concerned if even one young person is sleeping rough.  Our efforts in this regard aim to provide sufficient places for young homeless as well as providing the support staff to ensure that young homeless people will be reunited as quickly as possible with their homes instead of being left without any support in places accommodating young homeless people.  We want to provide a structure which will return young people who, for a variety of reasons, are homeless, to their own homes.</P>

      <P>There has been substantial progress in the development of services for people with disabilities based broadly on the proposals outline in the Green Paper. However, since the publication of the Green Paper, there have been two fundmental reviews of the services &mdash; the &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; report in the case of psychiatric services published in December 1984 and the report of the review group on mental handicap services which will be published later this month.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> envisages a seven year programme for the further development of community based services for people with disabilities, such as hostels, home help-nursing, day care and respite care facilities.  Legislation is not required to give effect to the recommendations contained in these reports in or indeed to the United Nations declarations on disability. However, my Department are at present considering, in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, how best the rights of people with disabilities can be promoted. With regard to mental illness, and the protection of people with a mental handicap, I am reviewing existing legislation with a view to bringing forward a discussion document on this matter.</P>

I am satisfied with the Government's policy for the next number of years as outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and if the Deputy reads it he will see that a very substantial amount of new services will be provided for the physically disabled, the mentally handicapped or those with psychiatric illness. There will be up to £90 million more spent on the current side over the next seven years and £100 million will be spent over the same period on the capital side.

      <P>Medical records are regarded as the property of the health board or hospital concerned.  As a general rule, a hospital will make details of the relevant medical records available to a member of the medical profession who requires them.  Individuals who have queries about their medical records should seek the advice of their general practitioners or the consultant who treated them.  Regulations under the Data Protection Act, 1988, provide for patient access to medical records held in automated data format on the following basis: (a) information shall not be supplied if it would be likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the data subject and (b) information may only be withheld or supplied by, or following consultation with, an appropriate health professional.  However, most medical records are kept in manual and not automated data format.</P>
      <P>An EC Draft Directive on data protection is under consideration at present. While it is still at an early stage, it is likely that it will cover manual as well as automated data files and will also cover medical records.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that a patient has every right to his or her medical records?  It is a personal relationship between the patient and the health board or the doctor.  It is now accepted that people have a right to access to records.  Will the Minister agree that it is time we brought in legislation to give people such access which prevents them at present from knowing details of their case and taking legal action if they feel it may be appropriate?</P>

      <P>Yes, as a general principle I believe that the patient should have easy access to their own records and <Col N="100" /> this is the case.  However, as I pointed out, in certain circumstances it might not be appropriate to give the medical record, for example, as outlined in the Data Protection Act, the information should not be supplied if it is likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the data subject.  While I said that most of the records are manual, the same criteria should apply to them as to those covered by the Data Protection Act.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy is that the use of generic drugs in prescribing and dispensing should be strongly promoted.</P>
      <P>As part of this policy, I recently introduced a national drugs formulary which is intended to promote the use of generic names in prescribing and dispensing.  I am hopeful that with the full co-operation of doctors this will lead to an increase in the general level of generic prescribing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The national drugs formulary has been issued to all general practitioners and to hospital and community pharmacists since March 1991. The overall objective of the formulary is to achieve rational use of medicines through safe, cost effective prescribing. The formulary sets out to encourage the prescribing of medicines only where they are essential, to provide an appropriate choice of medicine for the treatment of complaints presented by the majority of patients in the course of medical practice and to be a practical, speedy and useful reference source for prescribers.  It also encourages the use of non-proprietary &mdash; generic &mdash; names in prescribing except in the case of those preparations presenting availability problems, where the manufacturer or brand names may be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Because of the way the question was worded I had hoped he would have been a bit more specific about the percentage of drugs which were prescribed generically.  Would the Minister agree that it is very important to encourage the use of generic drugs in order to keep down the very high cost of drugs in the hospital services?  There are Irish control firms operating in this field and producing generic drugs.  Would he agree that all things being equal, business should be placed with these firms rather than with foreign multinationals where all the profits go out of the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I agree with the Deputy but the first fundamental principle has to be that the appropriate drug and medicine necessary for a particular illness is prescribed.  As I have often said in this House, there is an obligation on the prescriber to look at the volume of drugs prescribed.  He must ensure that sufficient drugs are prescribed <Col N="102" /> for the particular illness and that too many drugs are not prescribed.  On a number of occasions in this House my attention has been drawn to the number of drugs which are unused and which may be left in people's cupboards.  It is also fair to point out that this is not necessarily the fault of the prescribing doctor as a patient may not complete a course of tablets for one reason or another.  Having said that, the fundamental principle is that the correct treatment is prescribed for the patient.  Secondly, doctors should ensure that they are economic in prescribing drugs, both in terms of the volume and the brand of drugs.  I take every opportunity to encourage doctors to prescribe generic products or branded generic products which are made in Ireland where they are equally efficient for a particular illness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking each point the Deputy raised.  In regard to the drugs, the Deputy must recognise, as other Deputies do, that new drugs are coming on stream each year and the cost of drugs is increasing for the very good reason that there are new and very expensive drugs coming on stream.  I understand that if a certain type of drug is given to a person when a heart attack is imminent it will prevent the heart attack.  It costs £800 for one injection of this drug.  It costs approximately £4,000 per annum to treat persons who are HIV positive.  Unfortunately, the number of people with this disease is increasing.  Therefore, it is not fair to say that the drugs bill is increasing for other reasons.</P>
      <P>Having said that, of course we make every effort to reduce the drugs bill, which costs approximately £150 million per year, 10 per cent of the total cost of the public health services.  This year we succeeded in reaching agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries which will save the Exchequer £10 million in 1991.  As I have said, at the same time we are encouraging prescribers to prescribe generic drugs or branded generic drugs where appropriate for their patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Minister responded partly to my question about the need to try to channel as many prescriptions as possible through to Irish control companies. He referred to Irish made companies but I am talking about Irish control companies.  Is the Minister prepared to practise any discrimination in favour of Irish control companies as distinct from foreign control companies operating here?  There is a major distinction between the two and I think this should be made.</P>

      <P>I encourage doctors to use generic products because they are cost effective and also where they are equally efficient.  Naturally I would expect that like everyone else doctors would support home industry.  I do not know whether they make a distinction between a foreign owned company which is based here, gives good employment and produces a generic product &mdash; most <Col N="105" /> of them produce proprietary products &mdash; and an Irish company.  I do not think it would be reasonable to discriminate against foreign companies here.  All I can do is encourage people.  Both the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Ferris represent County Tipperary, the home of the indigenous drug industry in Ireland.  I am sure that, like me, they will use their offices to ensure that the products are supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Towards the end of 1989 I allocated additional resources to tackle the waiting lists for ENT procedures. I am glad to say that significant progress has been made in reducing the overall ENT waiting list for admission to Temple Street.  The waiting list has decreased from 1,228 in November 1989 to 439 in March 1991, the last date for which figures are readily available, a decrease of 64 per cent.  Almost all of the cases on the current waiting list are for tonsillectomy.  The waiting period for tonsillectomy has been halved during the last year.</P>
      <P>One thousand five hundred and seventy six ENT cases were treated in 1990 as compared to 1,172 treated in 1989 &mdash; an increase of 34 per cent.</P>
      <P>My Department and Temple Street Hospital have been discussing the hospital's priorities for 1991 and the tonsillectomy service will continue to be regarded as a priority in the allocation of resources within the hospital.</P>

Does he further accept that there is an emergency waiting list on which there are approximately ten children, all of whom will have to wait several months for a tonsillectomy operation?

      <P>I accept that there is a waiting list for ear, nose and throat procedures in Temple Street Children's Hospital, as indeed there is in every other hospital, not alone in Ireland but in hospitals throughout the developed world.  Waiting lists are a feature of hospitals and I am not aware of any hospital where there is no waiting list. As I have pointed out, we have taken measures to reduce the waiting list.  We reduced it by 64 per cent during 1990. We also increased the number of procedures by 34 per cent during 1990. Therefore, we are moving in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the only difficulty Temple Street Childrens' Hospital has in dealing with the waiting list for tonsillectomies is that they need a further permanent anaesthetist and that the application for that position is with his Department? They would need £40,000 to £50,000 for the next year or two to clear the existing waiting lists.  Will the Minister not agree that that small amount of money, and one position of anaesthetist, could and should be provided urgently for the childrens' hospital?</P>

      <P>In 1988 the hospital received £7.6 million by way of allocation. In 1991 they received £9.77 million, so they have had a substantial increase in funding.  Obviously, it is a matter for the hospital within their priorities as to how they spend that money amongst the various specialities. I know they had an ENT surgeon and when his term of office was completed he moved on.  Perhaps, in relation to ENT, <Col N="107" /> they might need further support.  Certainly, I will look into the question of the anaesthetist.</P>

Will the Minister give the true figures, not in percentages, in relation to the waiting list?  Will he agree that while there has been a reduction in the waiting list the reason is that many people, out of concern for their children suffering in school, have been forced to go private and take out loans from credit unions, other agencies and moneylenders to have their children attended to privately?  If one does not have money one must wait two years for an operation and if one has the money it can be done in two weeks.  Will the Minister address that problem?</P>

I have given the figure of 1,576 ENT patients treated in 1990, so it is obvious if the waiting list is only 340, there is not a long waiting list.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the ear, nose and throat unit at University Hospital, Galway which is the only one in the Western Health Board area, is grossly understaffed and under-funded; that it has now reached a position where it can only deal with half the patients referred to it; that it has the longest waiting list in the country; and in view of this unacceptable situation if he will outline the action he intends to take to remedy the problem.</Quest>

      <P>I have allocated in excess of £124 million to the Western Health Board this year for the provision of health services.  The provision and funding of the ENT service in the Western Health Board area is a matter for the board in the first instance.  The question of extending this service is for the board to decide in the light of their overall financial position and their priorities for service development.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, waiting times for patients depend on the medical condition of the individual patient, and waiting lists are kept under regular review by the consultants concerned.  Priority is accorded to each patient on the basis of medical need.</P>
      <P>In 1990, a total of 1,679 ENT inpatients were treated.  This represented an increase in throughput of 10 per cent over 1989 figures and an increase of 19 per cent over the number of patients treated in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> I am aware that the position with regard to waiting times for ENT patients at University College Hospital, Galway, has been exacerbated by the departure in early 1990 of one of the three ENT surgeons in the unit.  The Western Health Board did, however, appoint a replacement surgeon in February 1991 and I expect that this should improve waiting times over the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition, the day surgery unit for which I provided a grant of £200,000 is now fully functional and this too will help to increase the throughput of ENT patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Labour Court recently recommended the appointment of an additional registrar to the ENT unit in University College Hospital, Galway?  Will the Minister agree to make that appointment?  Is the Minister also aware that Comhairle na nOspidéal a couple of years ago recommended that there should be five consultants appointed to this unit in University Hospital Galway?  Does the Minister accept the finding and the recommendation of Comhairle na nOspidéal in relation to consultant staffing of this unit?  Is the Minister aware that the throughput in this unit is 20 per cent short of the throughput in the largest unit in the country, the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin, and yet they have twice as many consultants, twice as many beds and twice as many back-up staff?

      <P>The Deputy's question did not refer to what Comhairle na nOspidéal recommended so I do not have that information to hand.  In relation to ENT consultants, the Western Health Board appointed another consultant in February 1991.  We look carefully at comparisons between hospitals, looking for value for money, which is essential when one is spending the amount of money we spend on the service.  The consultants in the Eye and Ear Hospital are working from a number of locations.  I am not sure that any of them are full-time; they are <Col N="110" /> part-time.  However, we will look at the number of sessions and the number of patients treated <i>vis-à-vis</i> what is happening in the Western Health Board area.</P>

      <P>What action does the Minister propose to take to shorten the waiting list, the longest waiting list in Ireland, in the University College Hospital, Galway?  Instead of blaming the Fianna Fáil dominated Western Health Board what will the Minister do about it?  It is not right to say that there was a 10 per cent increase in the patients in 1990 when those numbers were allowed run down drastically in 1988 and 1989.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is incorrect in the figures he is quoting.  The number of inpatients treated in 1988 was 1,410 and the number of inpatients treated in 1989 was 1,523.  That was an increase, not a run down.  The number of patients treated in 1990 was 1,679, another increase, despite the fact that the hospital was one consultant short for most of the year because a consultant left.  The Western Health Board appointed a new consultant in 1991 and also opened a day surgery unit which will have a major impact on ENT procedures many of which can be performed in a day surgery unit.  The health board, with our support, are taking measures to ensure that there is an improvement.</P>

I do not have a copy of it with me but I have the figure for the numbers of people who attended the outpatients department. Despite being an ear, nose and throat consultant short the number of patients who attended the outpatients' department in 1988 was 3,031; 3,061 in 1989 and 3,644 in 1990.  Therefore, there has been a steady increase each year, as I said in reply to earlier supplementaries.</P>

      <P>The question of publication of the report is a matter for the hospital authority and I understand that this matter is under consideration by the hospital authority at present.

      <P>That is all the pity. Before Question Time I was dealing with the functions of local authorities which the Minister claims are being greatly extended.  While this may appear to be the case we find as we go through the Bill in some detail that they are not because of the extent to which the local authorities will be constrained by ministerial orders and the sub-clauses of the Bill which delineate those areas where local authorities may not act.</P>
      <P>A good example is Part VI of the Bill which deals with the establishment of committees and joint committees of local authorities &mdash; in itself a very good proposal</P>
      <P>Then we come to section 40 which reads:</P>
      <P>(1) The Minister may make regulations&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) as respects the area of jurisdiction of a committee or joint committee,</P>
      <P>(b) as respects the dissolution of a committee or joint committee,</P>
      <P>(c) specifying conditions, restrictions or other provisions which shall apply in relation to the delegation of functions to, or the revocation of a delegation of functions to, a committee or joint committee,</P>
      <P>(d) as respects the procedures, general administration and general finances of committees and joint committees,</P>
      <P>(e)  as respects such other matters relating to committees and joint committees as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, the Bill and the Minister's promotion for it states that the powers of local authorities are being extended, that local authorities may now come together and form joint committees to carry out specific functions between them, but then we come to the handicap the Minister is inserting &mdash; section 40 under which he will make regulations on everything from the areas the joint committees may cover to the functions of <Col N="176" /> the committees, to the dissolution of the committees, again puncturing the whole thrust of the provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Then we have the proposals in relation to Dublin.  I would like to remind the Minister of the comments he made in the House on 15 May 1990 when replying to the debate on the postponement of the local elections.  He made a number of comments relating to the organisation of local government in Dublin County of which, given the contents of this Bill, it might be useful to remind him.  He referred to what the previous Government did in 1985.  I quote from column 1666, Volume 398, of the Official Report of 15 May 1990:</P>
    <P>What was done?  Nothing, except to increase the membership from 36 to 78 and what followed might best be described as an exercise in illusion by Fine Gael.  The three counties of Belgard, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire/ Rathdown were conjured up for the local elections, and for that purpose only, having had a shadowy existence as electoral counties, something never heard of in Irish legislation until then. If there was ever a more half baked scheme for electing people from counties which never existed and still do not, that was it.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's description of the system of local government we have in Dublin County.  You can imagine my surprise when I find the Bill the Minister has brought into the House contains the very same structure for the organisation of local government in Dublin County. What he is proposing in practice is to leave in existence Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, to establish three area committees which correspond to the three electoral counties to which I have just referred &mdash; Fingal, Belgard as it was called then &mdash; the Minister is now calling it South County Dublin although it is West County Dublin &mdash; and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, all corresponding exactly to the three electoral counties the Minister described only a year ago as a half baked scheme for electing people from counties which never <Col N="177" /> existed.  The election which will take place in County Dublin on 27 June will be to exactly the same bodies that members were elected to in June 1985.  There is no change in the city council.  The county council, Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and the various area committees will continue to exist.</P>
    <P>I happen to know something about how badly that system has worked over the last six years because I have been a member of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and Dublin County Council. Dublin County Council was a farce.  We have 78 members and we never completed an agenda.  We rarely got beyond section 4 and material contravention motions largely due to the courtesy of members from the Minister's own party. The district committees, which were established and are being enshrined here as area committees, have never functioned properly.  They had some kind of limbo existence which will not be improved by the measures proposed in this Bill.  There has been continuing confusion between the respective areas of Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  For example, Dublin Corporation have houses built in the Dublin County Council area.  The tenants of those houses have no say in how those houses are managed because they cannot elect members to the body of which they are tenants and which is responsible for the management of the houses in which they live.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that what was needed in Dublin was a fundamental reform of local authority structures. What was needed in Dublin was the creation of a Dublin metropolitan council which would have overall responsibility for strategic planning in the greater Dublin area.  We have not got that.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us yesterday that he proposes to set up a region which will incorporate all of Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.  That is not what is required in Dublin.  What is required in Dublin is a metropolitan council for the greater Dublin area which could well include parts of north Wicklow, east <Col N="178" /> Kildare and Meath, which are, in effect, part of the greater Dublin area now, so there would be overall strategic planning.</P>
    <P>What is needed in Dublin is a system of local authorities based on the communities of Dublin.  The Barrington committee recommended in particular that there be some kind of authority for the Tallaght area.  That is ignored in the Bill before us.  The Minister has simply rubber stamped and put back into effect the bodies established in 1985 which have had six years to prove they cannot work, and we are being saddled with them again.  If anything, the Minister's proposals will add to the chaos and confusion in Dublin.  Not only will we have the existing authorities, we now have the area committees with overlapping responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council can devolve some of their functions to these committees, but then there is the catch.  You cannot devolve functions relating to estimates.  What really determines what a local authority do are the financial considerations.  Therefore, in effect, these area committees will exist as a kind of third tier of local government, adding to an already confused and frustrating situation.  If the purpose of this Bill and the structural reform contained in this Bill are confined to Dublin, I am afraid it has been very much an abysmal failure.  Part V of the Bill deals with the boundary committees.  The Minister is setting up an independent boundary committee to examine the boundaries of local authorities and make recommendations to him.  Let us examine this question of independence.  First the committee will be appointed by the Minister.  We have an unfortunate record that bodies appointed by Ministers, particularly by Ministers of the main Government party, are anything but independent.  I do not think the Minister can claim that the boundary committee he is proposing will be independent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, it does not <Col N="179" /> matter what the committee recommend because the Minister will make his own decisions ultimately.  The decision on what the boundaries of local authorities will be will be taken by the Minister.  The role of the committee is purely recommendatory, and it is quite wrong of the Minister to suggest this in some way will create an independent committee which will decide local authority boundaries.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of options.  We could have an independent committee which would decide the local authority boundaries.  We could have an independent committee which would identify the persons or the constituent parts which would make up that committee. As the Barrington Committee recommended, there could be an implementation commission headed by a High Court judge whose independence could not be impugned.  Before the Minister says that the intention of the Barrington Committee was for the implementation commission to have an overseeing role in relation to all local government reform, clearly an independent commission of that kind headed by a High Court judge could have a function in delineating boundaries.</P>

      <P>The Minister implied that I was casting a slur on the President of the High Court.  I was not.  I am stating that he, as Minister for the Environment, attempted to arrive at a situation where the Dáil constituencies would be gerrymandered. He is building into this Bill procedures whereby he will be the ultimate arbiter of the boundaries of local authority electoral areas.  The Minister's record of attempting to gerrymander boundaries does not leave me with any confidence about either the independence or fairness with which these boundaries will be altered.</P>
      <P>The regional structures proposed in the Barrington report are not defined in the Bill.  There is a provision for the establishment of regional bodies but they are to be designated.  The boundaries of the regions and the composition of the bodies will be decided by the Minister.  In his speech yesterday he said it was his intention to establish these regional authorities on the basis of the boundaries proposed by the Barrington Committee.  There is one very important difference.  The Barrington Committee recommended the rationalisation of the existing regional structure whereby there are different regional bodies for different purposes, i.e. regional health boards, regional tourism boards, regional divisions of State companies such as the IDA, and regional bodies with some role in relation to EC Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Barrington report recommended <Col N="181" /> that the entire regional makeup should be rationalised and that regional authorities should be elected democratically.  This Bill is a far cry from that.  We are getting yet another regional body, not to rationalise the existing bodies but to add to them.  The report recommended that initially these bodies should be appointed by the members of the local authorities within the region.  After a five-year period they would be directly elected. The question of direct elections to regional authorities has been ignored in this Bill.  Instead these bodies are to be elected by the county councils whose members will comprise them.  Deputy Mitchell drew attention to the provisions of this Bill which amend the 1985 Act. The effect of these provisions is that the procedures which have heretofore existed whereby minority or opposition parties on local authorities can come together in groups to make sure they have some representation on committees are being undermined.  It could be that a Fianna Fáil controlled council will simply decide that all five members of the regional authority will be members of that party.  That kind of thing has happened in the past.  There is no guarantee that the composition of the regional bodies will reflect in any way the political composition of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I welcome the provisions in relation to planning.  I am particularly glad that the procedures governing the use of section 4 motions for planning purposes are to be amended to provide that the motion will have to be signed by 75 per cent of the members for the electoral area to which the planning application relates and then have the support of 75 per cent of the members of the council in order to be passed.  I have called for the extension of that principle to the area of material contraventions. The Minister said yesterday the principle is being extended in the Bill.  The problem relating to section 4 motions has been given a lot of public attention but it is by no means the worst problem in the planning area.</P>
    <P>Most section 4 motions have been for one-off housing developments where a <Col N="182" /> political supporter of a particular councillor or group of councillors applies pressure to bring in a section 4 motion when planning permission has been or is about to be refused.  The philosophy behind this action was described by a member of Galway County Council as based on the &ldquo;God given right of a man to build a house on his own field&rdquo;. That philosophy underlies many of the section 4 motions on county council agendas.  The kindest thing that can be said about section 4 motions is that most of them have related to very bad planning. A survey carried out by An Taisce identified that not all county councils have been abusing the section 4 procedure. The abuse has mainly been concentrated in five or six county council areas.</P>
    <P>The worst abuse relates to material contraventions.  This is a much bigger league.  I have seen during the past six years on Dublin County Council the gross abuse of the material contravention procedure. Month after month Fianna Fáil members of that council granted planning permissions for large-scale developments which materially contravened the county development plan.  One hundred and thirty-one material contraventions have been passed by Dublin County Council since the 1985 local elections, of which 80 per cent were proposed or seconded by members of the Fianna Fáil group on the council.  By and large the Fianna Fáil group have voted <i>en bloc,</i> with some individual exceptions, to support those material contraventions.  The effect has been to give planning permission for about 4,000 additional houses in County Dublin.  Some of the contraventions related to very large developments.</P>
    <P>I estimate that the material contraventions which were passed by Dublin County Council had added something of the order of £150 million to the value of the property concerned.  It is fortunately coincidental that we are debating this Local Government Bill and the changes in relation to planning on the same days when a Private Members' Bill is before this House dealing with questions of ethics in Government and in political life. <Col N="183" /> I am convinced there is a close relationship between property, planning and politics in Dublin County Council.  In relation to some of the material contraventions which have been put before Dublin County Council I do not accept that the motivation behind those planning proposals was entirely out of the interests of development and planning in County Dublin.  There are very serious questions that need to be answered by the sponsors of those motions as to why they insisted on sponsoring those planning motions which, in many cases, were against the express recommendation and express report of the county manager and against the expressed views of the county engineers who have argued that in some cases they created traffic hazards.  The question arises as to whether there was a consideration of money, whether there were financial contributions to the party promoting those motions or financial contributions to the council members who were promoting them.  These are very fundamental ethical questions about local government that need to be addressed.  I am very pleased that the Bill does provide for a 75 per cent majority now for the passing of a material contravention motion because, at the very least, if the public of County Dublin elect even 25 per cent of the membership of the new council &mdash; people who are opposed to the abuse of the material contravention procedure &mdash; they will protect the county for the future.</P>
    <P>There is a number of provisions in the miscellaneous section of the Bill to which I would like to refer.  One relates to the procedures proposed in relation to the appointment and the tenure of office of city and county managers.  The Minister explained that the purpose behind this was to provide for a term of office for a city or county manager which would be something akin to the term of office and the procedures which exist for the appointment and the tenure of office of departmental secretaries.  I can see and understand the logic behind that.  We would all accept that anybody who holds office for a very long time can go stale <Col N="184" /> in it and that there is a desirability for turnover.  I am concerned that the question of tenure of office of city and county managers is being put in the hands of the Minister.  For example, section 47 (1) (a) states:</P>
    <P>a period of such length as the Minister specifies by order.</P>
    <P>The question that raises relates to the independence of city and county managers from the Minister for the Environment and the responsiveness of city and county managers to their own elected councils.  We already have a situation in Irish local government whereby much of the work of local government is, in effect, decided in the Custom House because of all the financial considerations and procedures established.  We have the separation of Executive and reserved functions and in most good working councils there is a good relationship between the elected council and the city or county manager.  In most councils, city and county managers are responsive to the wishes of the elected members.  I am concerned that the relationship between the city and county managers and the elected members is determined by ministerial order.  I am concerned that, as time goes on, city and county managers, because of the provisions of section 47, may become extensions of the Minister in the local council chamber.  It is not clear either what will be the position of city and county managers after the term specified by the Minister has expired.  Is it intended that they move on to another county or that they simply give up the job?  That needs to be spelt out and perhaps we will have a response on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Barrington recommendations have been, by and large, ignored in this Bill.  Barrington made 75 specific recommendations in relation to changes in local government. I have counted 63 of them which are not contained in this legislation.  It may be argued that some of those recommendations were of a longer term nature and that some will be contained in subsequent legislation.  I have mentioned some already that I felt should have been <Col N="185" /> included in this legislation.  For example, the legislation should have set out clearly what regional structure is envisaged.  It should have set out the provision for the direct election of regional authorities rather than the system that is recommended. Barrington recommended specifically the establishment of an implementation commission which would have overall responsibility for overseeing the devolution of powers to local authorities because he identified correctly the historic unwillingness of Government Departments to devolve any of their functions or powers to local level.  The way he saw around this was the establishment of an independent commission chaired by a High Court judge who would oversee it.  That is not provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of devolution of responsibilties from Government Departments to local authorities, Barrington specifically recommended that that should be given to the Department of the Taoiseach: that is not provided for in the Bill.  He made a specific recommendation about changing of the Limerick city and county boundary: I see no reference to that either in the Bill. Barrington recommended also that pending the establishment of sub-county structures the elections for urban authorities should be deferred but that they be deferred only for a fixed period.  Unfortunately, the Bill defers them indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the recommendation Barrington made in relation to local government elections, that they should not be capable of postponement by central Government: there is no provision for that in the Bill.  He makes recommendations in relation to chairpersons of councils, and that is not referred to in the Bill either.  The only matter which is referred to in the Bill about council chairpersons relates to their expenses rather than to their functions.</P>
    <P>Barrington made a number of recommendations in relation to the functions of council chairpersons, and they are not contained in the Bill.  He recommended <Col N="186" /> specifically that there should be structured arrangements to facilitate contact between local authorities and community groups.  There is no reference to community organisations in the Bill.  One of the specific demands made has been for a more structured way to involve local voluntary community organisations in the work of local government: this Bill makes no reference to that.</P>
    <P>Barrington makes a number of recommendations on the operational aspects of local authorities relating to matters such as staff training, the appointment of commercial auditors to audit the local authority accounts and the establishment of an efficiency audit group to review the performance of individual local authorities.  I would have thought the junior partner in Government would have insisted on this, given their recent talk about value for money in local government.  Again this is not provided for in the Bill.  In all, 63 of the 75 recommendations contained in the report of the expert committee have not been incorporated in this Bill.  The principle which underlines the report of the expert committee, the principle of subsidiarity, has been stood on its head and what we are getting is a far cry from what was recommended.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to deal with the question of finance, which of course is not dealt with at all in the Bill.  The expert committee were asked to examine how the existing system of financing local authorities might be rejigged in some way and they had a study carried out on it. As has been mentioned here before, unless the question of local authority finance is addressed seriously and local authorities know where they stand in relation to local authority financing, all the time spent talking about reform of the structures is wasted.  I want to raise this issue specifically because today we had another example of a householder being jailed for his protest against the payment of service charges.  Today, a Cork trade unionist, Mr. Brendan O'Neill was jailed and he becomes the fourth Cork citizen in the space of as many weeks to have been jailed for the <Col N="187" /> non payment of water charges.  I think the present Government owe us some explanation as to why they have not addressed the Local Government Financial Provisions Act 1983 and amended it as they had promised.  I cannot imagine any difficulties in Cabinet on this issue because I have a letter dated 23 May 1985 which is addressed to a senior representative of the Association of Combined Residents Association which is signed by Robert Molloy T.D., who was then Director of Elections for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, will the Deputy read the letter into the record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read it because I think it should be put on record.  Deputy Molloy said and I quote:</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to meet with the delegation from ACRA and I believe our mutual interest in the financing of local authorities will help towards the introduction of a more equitable system which will find greater acceptance in the community generally.</P>
      <P>I promised to reply to you setting out the Fianna Fáil position in three areas raised by you.  The following is the position in each case:</P>
      <P>1. Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to the new system of local charges and, on return to office, will abolish these charges and repeal the legislation under which they are imposed, namely the Local Government Financial Provisions No. 2 Act of 1983.</P>
      <P>In its place, we will introduce new legislation which will end the present unsatisfactory position and put local finances on a sound basis.</P>
      <P>This legislation will provide that Local Authorities will receive a guaranteed statutory contribution each year from the Central Exchequer.  This exchequer contribution will be sufficient to provide for a satisfactory level of necessary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new legislation will eliminate the present uncertainty whereby Local <Col N="188" /> Authorities cannot anticipate what the grant from the Central Exchequer each year will be and which has compelled County Managers to impose a new and unacceptable level of service charges against the wishes of the great majority of the local community.</P>
    <P>The legislation which will provide for the new statutory grant from the Central Exchequer will not contain any new power to enable elected members to introduce new charges.</P>
    <P>2. On the question of an amnesty for those who have not paid water or service charges Fianna Fáil believe this is a matter that must be dealt with by the local authority who levied the charges.  Under Coalition legislation the manager has the power to waive the charges.</P>
    <P>That was the position in 1985.  Fianna Fáil have been in Government since 1987 and no legislation has been introduced to amend the Local Government Act, 1983 which allowed the imposition of charges. I cannot see why there should be great difficulties in Cabinet between the two parties since the signatory of this letter is a Minister who has expressed considerable interest in matters of local government over the past two years and was a member of the sub-committee which produced this Bill.  He has been on the media over the past few days saying what a fine Bill it is.  It is a pity it does not include the amendment to the Financial Provisions Act, 1983.  I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage if we reach this part of the Bill during the limited time we have been afforded for Committee Stage so that we can see whether there is any real intention by the Fianna Fáil Party, in the form in which they survived after 1986, or by the author of this leter, who still retains an interest in local government to abolish service charges.  I was particularly shocked to hear the Minister for the Environment stating categorically over the weekend that there is no intention to amend the legislation or to abolish service charges, which was a specific commitment given <Col N="189" /> by Fianna Fáil in 1985.  Householders throughout the country took Fianna Fáil at their word but the party who promised to abolish water charges are now jailing the householders who refuse to pay them. This is a disgrace.  The Government should make contact immediately with Cork Corporation and make sure that no more people are jailed for this and the legislation should be amended to give effect to the promises they made on many occasions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion what we have before us is not a Bill to reform local government.  It gives the appearance of reform and of extending the powers of local authorities at one level but pulls them back at another level.  The overall net effect of the Bill is to concentrate even more power in the hands of the Minister and in the Custom House and to undermine and erode further the system of local government we have in this country.</P>

      <P>It amazes me that on a Bill such as this, and when we hear so much about there not being enough time allowed to debate it, the House should waste time with a call for a quorum.  I find it a contradiction for the Opposition to complain that four days are not enough to debate the Bill and then to waste precious time in this way.  I hope there will be no repeat performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputies on the other side of the House, I commend the Minister and the Government for bringing forward the legislation at this time.  As a member of a local authority, I am pleased that we should have a reform of local government. Whatever the cynics may say, the Bill represents the first critical evaluation of local government for more than 40 years.  I recognise that it is only the first step, that has been clarified by the Minister, and that wider reform is envisaged. To those of us who have made an effort to study local government and the difficulties attached to it, there is no doubt that it is not a simple issue to commence <Col N="190" /> consideration of local government reform.  The first step in such reform is to re-evaluate the structures of local government. As a general principle, I welcome the Minister's phased approach to this long neglected area of public representation that is close to all our hearts, particularly to those of us who are members of local councils.</P>
    <P>Deputies must know that the first commitment to reform local government was made by Fianna Fáil in 1971 when the then Government published a White Paper on local government reorganisation. Unfortunately, those proposals were not taken up by the Coalition Government in the seventies.  The Bill before the House today again follows a commitment made by the present Government to review the whole basis and operation of local government.</P>
    <P>In the wider context, the Bill also highlights what has been a constant feature of the present Government, whether demonstrated in economic issues or in various other issues, that they are not afraid to face up to the issues of the day. The Bill stands as a testimony to the Government's record of doing something about local government reform.  This is thoughtful and wide-ranging legislation that reflects the extent of consultation on local government that the Government sought and received in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>This time last year Fianna Fáil decided to set up a special committee to consider local government reform.  That committee met on 17 occasions between May and December 1990.  I was a member of that committee.  Much work and effort have gone into looking at local government, considering the needs of local government and examining the best way to serve the public who elect local authority members.  The Government also took independent advice from the Barrington committee.  I am satisfied that following all that consultation, the Bill before the House today is a fairly comprehensive first step towards local government reform.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all Members would agree that an overhaul of local government is <Col N="191" /> overdue.  The present system is more like local administration than local government, which is particularly frustrating for members of local authorities.  Some members of local authorities are due to stand for local election again in June. If it is expected to have local authority members of high calibre, then it is important to strengthen the powers of local councillors.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes the first steps to change the process that was moving towards a system of local administration rather than local government by assigning additional powers to local authorities and by removing the many constraints of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule.  That rule is outdated and old-fashioned and has greatly inhibited innovation and creativity at local level.  Of course, it is a hangover from the 19th century.  Dealing with it now highlights how antiquated our local system has been and how complicated the task of the Government, of the Barrington committee, and of anyone who considered the matter.  To attempt to reform local government is a complicated task.</P>
    <P>There is also more scope for reform, and that is to seek greater involvement of community groups.  In other areas community groups have become more important, and have a lot to offer the general public.  Community interests should be brought more into the process of local government.  An example in my own constituency occurs in the town of Ashbourne, County Meath.  Ashbourne has no form of local government of its own, despite having a population of 5,500, which would probably mean it qualifies under the present threshold provision. I am concerned that growing new towns such as Ashbourne &mdash; particularly those close to the capital city and to where the population is moving out from the city &mdash; do not get the individual attention they deserve because representations on their behalf are made by county councillors or voluntary organisations as distinct from local public representatives specifically elected from the town.  There is no doubt about the great <Col N="192" /> work done by voluntary local organisations, and we would all commend them for the work they do, for their commitment, and energy but, as legislators, we must not look to them to provide the only form of local development.  Instead, they should be involved in the process of local government and we should draw on their expertise and knowledge.</P>
    <P>As I have said, local government reform is a complicated business, especially after 40 years of neglect.  What I express here is a hope that appropriate supplementary tiers of local government will be established to suit the needs of developing areas such as Ashbourne, which I used as an example.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the sections of the Bill that relate to planning.  The planning process as constituted at present suffers from a lack of uniformity in approach. We have heard much today about the position in Dublin County Council and how the section 4 provision and material contraventions are dealt with by that council.  In County Meath we are concerned that there is no uniform approach to dealing with planning throughout the country.  In the Bill the emphasis is on the maximum input from local representatives, and I fully support this initiative.  In County Meath we had unofficially implemented a guideline that we would leave it to the local area to bring forward the appropriate motions in relation to planning, but it is important that this is enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In a county like Meath, particularly the south-eastern part of which is becoming increasingly attractive for once-off development, planning is a very big issue. We have heard much about the position in Dublin but in County Meath it can be said that the members of the local authority never abused any of their powers, particularly the section 4 provision and material contraventions.  Up to the end of last year there had been only three section 4 cases in County Meath; one in the sixties, one three years ago and one last September.  I am concerned that the public might get the impression that all county councillors are abusing their powers under section 4, but <Col N="193" /> that is not the case.  The opposite applies, and has applied in County Meath.</P>
    <P>Early this year members of Meath County Council were concerned that the policies and principles enshrined in the Meath county development plan were not being implemented in planning decisions.  Councillors found that planning permission was being refused to, say, farmers with 50 or 100 acres of land when it should have been granted. Councillors in Meath then decided to use the section 4 procedure.  Again, I stress that this is in no way related to the fact that the local elections will be held in June.  It is strictly due to the fact that the councillors have been under much pressure over the past number of years concerning planning applications.  They felt the policies set out in the county development plan were not being implemented.</P>
    <P>Councillors are concerned about consistency. Public representatives in counties such as Meath who do not abuse their powers are frustrated because they feel they are not listened to.  One must bear in mind that county councillors are elected by the people to represent them. When a person votes for a county councillor at election time he or she expects that councillor to be of some assistance when applying for planning permission, considering that he or she elects the councillor to the board which will take the decision on the planning application.  It is for this reason that I propose that there be a formal planning committee in every county.</P>
    <P>People from local authorities planning committees, such as Dublin and Cork, may ask why we do not set up such a committee in County Meath.  We attempted to do so last September-October but were told it would be outside the bounds of the legislation to attempt to discuss individual planning applications at a meeting of the county council. While other counties seem to be in a position to have planning sub-committees Meath County Council have received legal advice to the effect that they cannot have such a committee.</P>
    <P>There are inconsistencies in the county <Col N="194" /> in relation to planning decisions and inconsistencies between the different counties in that committees are relevant in some counties and not in others.  Planning sub-committees should be established formally so that councillors can be involved in the early stage of the planning process.  Part of the problem at present is that county councillors become involved at a very advanced stage of planning with the result that they are too often unfairly criticised regarding accountability and so on.  The people, having elected a local public representative should be in a position to ensure that that person has some involvement in their case from the start.</P>
    <P>In relation to the setting up of regional committees the Bill recognises that local authority planning, and other issues, cannot be hemmed in by fixed boundaries. In counties such as Meath, the one with which I am most familiar, we have a wider catchment area.  Our proximity to Dublin has a huge impact on planning and development, roads and the local economy.  It can be said that our close proximity to Dublin is a positive aspect, particularly from an industrial point of view in that we attract small industries to the county, but on the other hand there are huge implications for planning and development and roads.  Given the increasing importance of a wider role for local authorities, section 43 is a timely and welcome innovation.  There is need for greater inter-council or regional policy co-ordination on matters such as roads, planning, development, tourism, the environment and so on.  The Bill not only encourages this but makes it possible to put it into practice.  I look forward to the setting up of the regional authorities.</P>
    <P>I was a little surprised last night by Deputy Jim Mitchell's concern about the inclusion of Meath, Wicklow and Kildare with the Dublin region.  He was concerned on a population basis but I would look at it more positively.  Close proximity to Dublin has had a positive impact on County Meath.  There is a strong relationship between the counties surrounding the capital city and this should be recognised.  Perhaps it is because <Col N="195" /> Deputy Mitchell is a Dublin Deputy that he looks at the position differently.  To bring those four counties together on a regional basis would be a welcome step. For example, as regards planning there are huge discrepancies between Meath and Dublin.  A planning application may be granted for a bungalow on the Dublin side of the border while on the Meath side planning permission may be refused for similar development.  There are huge inconsistencies in these areas.</P>
    <P>Four national primary routes run through County Meath, the N1, N2, N3 and N4.  We all know that State funding is available for national primary routes. People leave the capital city on the route closest to them, travel the N1, N4 or whatever and then travel to the route they wish to take for the rest of their journey, whether to the north or west, crossing the regional and county roads in County Meath.  Therefore, about 20 miles outside the city there is very heavy traffic on the non-national primary routes and this causes great difficulties.</P>
    <P>I stress that Meath have a huge input in the funding of local roads but it is difficult to have an impact because of our close proximity to the city.  Apart from the traffic on the national primary routes there is a lot of cross traffic on the regional and county roads.  I hope the regional authorities will consider matters such as this and find solutions.  Contrary to what was said here last night I welcome the fact that Meath, Wicklow and Kildare which have a great relationship will be included with Dublin as one region.</P>
    <P>With regard to the relationship between local and central Government all agree that the Department of the Environment are obliged to become involved in far too much detail.  For example, I do not see why the Department should be involved in the detailed level of design and planning in relation to housing, as this often results in unnecessary delays.  I am sure the Department would be far happier if they could tell a local authority that they would give them funding for 40 houses which the authority could design and plan <Col N="196" /> themselves, including getting tenders. They could also be told that if they are able to provide 41 houses from the money, the Department will be delighted but that if they can only provide 39 houses it will be the problem of the authority. This would be a better system.  I recognise that the Department have a central role to play but there are areas where they should rely on the local knowledge to expedite matters and to bring greater efficiency to the making and implementation of decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides for the transfer from central to local government of certain functions which would result in greater efficiency and I think we will see this as time passes.  Apart from housing there are group water schemes, grants and subsidies, sewerage schemes and many other areas in which the Department have a role but, within their present brief of planning and the allocation of plans, a great deal of time would be saved if the Department availed of local knowledge and the expertise of local representatives and institutions in detailing areas of Government policy and action.</P>
    <P>One point which troubles me in relation to the estimates for local authorities is the manner in which the accounts are drawn up.  It is difficult for most public representatives &mdash; even accountants &mdash; to decipher the Book of Estimates.  We all do our best to figure it out and we make a fair attempt at doing so but life would be a lot simpler if the normal accountancy balance sheet system was used which would also give a clear picture to county councillors that the projects for which they pass expenditure are implemented further down the line.  It is difficult to establish how much money is being spent on any project because part of it is under the heading of administration, engineers, roads, staff, maintenance and so on.  If the system could be improved it would be of great benefit to local public representatives.</P>
    <P>I also think there is no reason for a local authority not employing private contractors to supply local services if they are cheaper.  Our aim is to increase efficiency in local government.  In County <Col N="197" /> Meath there was uproar when a decision was taken by the council at the end of 1989 to privatise the refuse service; people went as far as coming into the council chamber and dumping refuse on the councillors sitting in the chamber at the time.  In spite of the objections, three months later when the private system came into operation, people were delighted with the service and did not look back.  When the refuse collection was the responsibility of the local authority there were many complaints; people did not want to pay as they said they did not use the service as it did not pass their doors.  We were all plagued with complaints regarding the refuse service but since it was privatised nobody has complained.  People are now getting better value and, from our point of view as legislators, the local authority are not losing huge sums of money as they did when they were responsible for it.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 5 of the Bill for annual reports for local authorities is welcome.  Another area impinges on the status of local government, the position and powers of the county manager.  Managers are referred to at various points throughout the Bill; they are &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; a central part of the whole apparatus of local government.  By and large, they are an efficient part of that apparatus.  However, this brings me back to the theme of answerability and the need for a sub-committee system, to which I referred earlier.  A case can be made for a more formal and direct working relationship between officials and public representatives.  As it is, the relationship between the manager and local representative is too loose and vague and part of this looseness derives from the way in which the 1978 legislation has developed.  There are cases where councillors, as I said earlier on, have too little input in the formulation of estimates and indeed subsequently ensuring that the decisions and the wishes which they felt were implicit in the estimates are implemented later on in the year.</P>
    <P>Unless the relationship between the manager and the public representatives or the county councillors is formalised <Col N="198" /> the grey area which has been developing since 1978 will become even greyer.  The present system all too often puts officials against county councillors or <i>vice versa</i> as if they were two opposing interests. Obviously this is of no assistance to the reputation or effectiveness of local government or indeed to the impression which it creates for the public.  Everything must be done to ensure that the relationship between the county councillor and the public official is mutually beneficial and, most important, will be for the betterment of the people whom the council serve.</P>
    <P>Every means possible should be used to ensure that local government is not only an integrated operation but, most important, that it is seen to be so.  I am sure we all agree that there is a good case for treating local government in Dublin as a separate concern.  The Dublin region has seen remarkable growth in recent years and the local government structures rooted in the 19th century are inadequate to meet the development planning structures and the needs of a modern capital city.  The division of the region into four councils, as proposed in Part VI of the Bill, is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill marks an important step in the reorganisation of local government. It is easy for some to be critical given the complexity of the task but the Minister achieved a major advance and, as he indicated in recent days, it is just the first step.  Not only does the Bill stand on its own but it is also part of a larger piece. Those of us who are members of local authorities welcome this reform of local government and the local authorities which we represent.  The needs of 1991 must be based on legislation of 1991 and not on legislation of 1988.  The Bill is realistic and relevant and I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a Bill against the background where local authorities throughout the country are unable to fulfil their legal obligations to the public.  At present there are 30,000 people nationwide waiting for housing <Col N="199" /> and many of them have been waiting for three or four years.  In my own city alone the figure is close to 2,000 people on the waiting list and I forecast that, by midsummer in Cork city alone, 2,000 people will be awaiting housing.  On top of those figures there are people in inadequate local authority housing, living in houses which are too small or which have no bathrooms.</P>
      <P>I was amazed yesterday in an answer to a question I tabled to the Minister to hear that there is no crisis. How can the Minister be so blind as to say there is no crisis when young children are walking our streets homeless?  That is the background to our approach to this co-called reform of local government.  We are so disorganised at local authority level that on the one hand we are not funding the capital programme for housing and the Department of the Environment are not allocating sufficient funding for the capital programme.  The Department of Social Welfare are paying out enormous amounts of money in supplementary welfare allowances to people who are living in hovels and slums in cities and rural areas.  I want to give an example, and I can stand over these figures.  Over a period of one month £45,000 was paid out in supplementary welfare allowances to people in Cork to subsidise their rents. People who pay £70 per week for a hovel are subsidised to the tune of almost £60 by the health board; the health board have no choice but to subsidise these unfortunate people who need help. Because of the failure of the local government system, money which could be spent on building houses is going into the pockets of landlords, some of whom are so unscrupulous they would make Rachman look like the St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this is happening the Minister has reduced the allocation to the capital programme.  In 1985 the allocation for housing was £585 million; in 1986, £620 million and in 1987, £698 million.  When the present Minister took office he halved the allocation to £377 million in 1988 and reduced it further to £296 million in 1989. <Col N="200" /> That is the background to the present problems.  These problems cannot be solved by reforming the structures; they can only be solved by reforming the funding of local authorities.  The Minister has walked away from these problems.  He has walked away from the thorny and vital question of funding local authorities. He is a stale Minister and should resign. He has been in office for four years and he is tired.  The points I have made are accurate.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Estimates and the spending by the Department of the Environment.  In 1989, the latest year for which I have figures, at a time of crisis, the Minister underspent by £2.5 million the amount provided for maintenance of local authority houses.  At the end of the day he gave £1.632 million back to the Minister for Finance.  When a Minister behaves in such an inefficient manner at a time of crisis he should resign.</P>
    <P>I want to refer further to the background to the current housing crisis in local authority areas.  Two months ago amid a great fanfare of trumpets, television lights and great hype, the Minister announced a new housing policy. However, we are still waiting to hear now he will implement some of the provisions of that much heralded housing policy. The Minister admitted at long last that he did not bother to check the legal implications of some of those provisions, that he has run into major legal difficulties and that it is unlikely many of the proposals will be implemented in the short term.  It is about time that bungling Minister got out of office and let somebody else do the job which needs to be done. That is the background to the present problems in the housing area.</P>
    <P>The problems in regard to roads and sanitary facilities have been well documented by previous speakers, I do not intend to repeat them as time is limited. The Minister has failed the people of Ireland in regard to roads, sewerage schemes and the environment, even to cutting the grass in housing estates.  This Bill refers to reform of the structures of local authorities but no reference is made to reform of financing local authorities. <Col N="201" /> This is where the Minister is ducking the issue.</P>
    <P>Democracy is not working in the case of local authorities at present.  This Bill is supposed to be about local democracy but there has not been much that is democratic about the way it has been handled so far.  I was expected to stand here today and speak on the Bill from an informed viewpoint.  However, I only received the Bill at lunch time on Monday and I had to get advice on certain aspects yesterday &mdash; I am not an expert on all areas of local authorities.  The Minister has tried to push through this Bill at a time when we should be giving serious and detailed consideration to all aspects of local government.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Bill, 1991, as initiated by the Minister for the Environment, is a stone age solution to a 20th century problem.  Local authorities, both management and elected members, have waited with anticipation for this Bill. However, I believe they have been betrayed and let down badly because the Minister has not considered fully the most vital aspects of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been starved of cash and stripped of their powers since 1977 with the elimination of domestic rates and the ongoing dilution of the rates support grant which was promised by the Government as full compensation for the losses incurred by the abolition of domestic rates.  Local authorities have been under siege for many years as a result of the gradual reduction in real terms in financial support from the Government. They have had to eliminate or reduce seriously their services to the public. They have had to sack staff and introduce socially unacceptable demands on the people living in their areas.  For example, the service charges introduced in the early eighties have now proved to be socially unjust because some local authorities did not have to introduce them due to their strong commercial rate base. However, other disadvantaged local authorities were forced to impose those charges and increase them as the years went by.</P>
    <P>My local authority in Cork city were <Col N="202" /> faced with the choice of either gradually increasing service charges over the years or sacking staff, with the consequent social implications in a city already beset by unemployment.  We were forced to increase charges over the years while, at the same time, there were no service charges in Dublin city.  At present people in Cork are being jailed because of their failure to pay service charges.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come when the Minister should look at the service charges.  Unfortunately his response to this issue to date has been pathetic, cold hearted and callous.  Despite the promises already well catalogued by previous speakers, his only commitment has been to more of the same.  Deputy Gilmore put his finger on it earlier when he read out the commitment given by the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, when he was a member of Fianna Fáil and they were in Opposition, to eliminate service charges.  Those people who misled the public at that time have betrayed them again by their U-turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government Bill, 1991, is a major failure and disappointment in that it does not deal with the financing of local authorities.  As we speak here today, another protestor against service charges has been jailed in Cork prison.  His protest is a political one against the deception of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government who promised to abolish these charges but never did.  Brendan O'Neill, a trade union activitist in Cork, is a political prisoner, a victim of the political deceit brought about by both Government parties in their naked greed for power.  The Minister has a responsibility to intercede in what is happening.  This so-called reform Bill does not address the problem of the financing of local government.  Deputies in their contributions should not try to get away with the statement that it was <Col N="203" /> the Fine Gael-Labour Party who introduced these charges.</P>

      <P>Cork Corporation were left with Hobson's choice &mdash; the choice of sacking people, reducing services or continuing the service charges.  They had very little choice.  The local authorities anticipated great powers, greater responsibility and a greater role but instead their role has been further eroded by the advent of the Roads Bill, which will be discussed shortly, and by this Bill. When we are building so few houses why do we need a national building agency who are duplicating the role of local authorities?  They have left a legacy in my city of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a cowardly, gutless Bill initiated by a power grabbing Minister. It displays all the marks of the worst type of political chauvinism.  It has funked all the major issues relevant to the proper development of local authorities.  These issues are, the financing of local authorities and the development of regional authorities with powers.  We have fewer powers and local authorities will remain <Col N="204" /> the glorious powerless talking shops they have been in recent years.  Bodies which cannot cope with the social problems of their areas such as the development of housing and the upkeep of roads are now powerless to deal with other issues of modern-day living such as the development of adequate education facilities, industry and tourism.</P>
    <P>There is no recognition that there must be a link between the local authorities and the Garda in an area.  In relation to the role of local authorities in industrial development and tourism we must oppose the way in which the regional authorities are being set up.  I understood that regional authorities would have a role in the development of industry and tourism but there is no detail in the Bill on the role of the regional authorities. The IDA have failed the regions, and regional development in this Bill is a total charade.</P>
    <P>Unemployment outside of Dublin has increased at a greater rate than in Dublin. We require strong regional authorities responsible for industrial development in their areas.  That theme is not developed in the Bill.  Local people are better equipped to deal with local problems because of their greater knowledge of local problems but there is no lessening of centralised power in this Bill.  The Minister and the Minister for Finance will keep all the powers in Dublin and Dublin will continue to pull the strings.  We are the most centralised country in western Europe.  We are more akin to an old-fashioned east European state with all the attendant defects and inefficiencies. This has been brought about by the greed of Ministers for political power and their retention of the right to distribute political patronage as they wish.</P>
    <P>One of the major recent scandals is the manner in which European Structural Funds are being controlled by the hungry, greedy hands of the Department of Finance. There is strong evidence to suggest that these funds have been distributed in recent years on political expediency rather than on regional needs.  This is hard to quantify because the monitoring <Col N="205" /> agencies set up by the Minister for Finance do not have the resources or the expertise to adequately monitor the spending of these moneys.  I trust neither the Minister for Finance nor the Minister for the Environment, because the evidence so far on the spending of Structural Funds is worrying.  Looking at the 1989 Estimates I am worried at the way lottery funds were distributed from the Department of the Environment to local authorities. It is a slush fund.</P>

The role of the local authorities in the development of the regional reports was meaningless because the national plan which was supposed to evolve from the regional reports was submitted to Brussels even before the regional reports were submitted to the Department of Finance.  The monitoring committees will be ineffective and unable to monitor in a proper manner the distribution of hard won EC Structural Funds for the proper development of the regions.</P>

    <P>What is and will be required during the next few years is strong, powerful regional authorities with expanded responsibilities and powers with direct access to Brussels and Europe.  Issues could be raised with the decision makers <Col N="207" /> in Europe by these regional authorities so that funding for regional projects could be paid directly to them rather than to central Government.

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Bill.  There has been much whingeing and crying about the amount of time allocated for this debate.  At least Fianna Fáil in Government have had the courage to bring forward a Bill to reform local government.  During the years different political parties argued that there was a need to reform local government and to bring it into the twentieth century, and given that our society in the nineties is so much different from that of 100 years ago and that each member state of the European Community has tried to reform local government, it was time some Government had the courage to implement radical and major changes.  I compliment the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, for the work they have put into this Bill.</P>
      <P>One must take the hypocrisy of the Fine Gael Party with a grain of salt. Deputy Mitchell finally admitted yesterday that there was a need to reform local government and stated that Fine Gael intend to suggest some wide ranging reforms during the next five to six weeks.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> However, I must compliment the Labour Party. When it was suggested that an all-party <Col N="210" /> committee be established at least they agreed to participate whereas the Fine Gael Party ran from the idea.  I also compliment the Labour Party for producing a wide ranging and very good document. Some of their suggestions and ideas were taken on board by the Minister and included in this Bill.  I compliment that party for making their views known to the public.  Their members have a deep interest in local government.  I await with interest the publication of the Fine Gael document on local government.  They obviously did not have the courage to take part in the all-party committee or to face up to some of the unpalatable decisions which might have had to be taken.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Allen who referred to section 4 motions.  I was a member of the Fianna Fáil committee who examined local government reform. When it was suggested that section 4 motions be abolished, I objected strongly.  Just because Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council or Galway County Council, are abusing this provision is no reason the section should be abolished.</P>
      <P>There are county councils such as the one on which I have served for 11 years &mdash; and Deputy Yates has been on it for nearly as long &mdash; and I cannot recall any section 4 motions in that time, certainly there has been no abuse of section 4. Therefore, I think the Minister is right not to abolish that completely despite pressure from some quarters, and he has come up with a worthwhile compromise, so to speak, that is, that a section 4 motion must be put forward by a certain number of councillors from the area in question and then a certain number of the total council have to support it before it can be passed.</P>

    <P>For years I have felt there is a strong need to reform local government.  The councillors themselves have not the powers they should have and the county managers have too much power.  My county manager might not be too happy to hear me say that, but it seems county managers and the officials have always <Col N="211" /> directed the councils whether at estimates time or any other time of the year. I am baffled to realise that at estimates time we spend hours and days discussing, say, £10,000 or £15,000 and balancing the books, yet six months afterwards the county manager or the officials are able to find £100,000 or £200,000 out of excess revenue to solve some problem that may arise.  The presentation of the estimates and the procedures observed are cumbersome and very difficult for an ordinary councillor to follow.  The accountancy of a county council should be the same as applies in any firm or business, based on income and expenditure with no miscellaneous items or hidden agenda.  A proper accountancy system should be introduced in the local authorities, one that would be easily understood, so that we would know where moneys were spent and if the full amount was not spent for, say, programme 1 or programme 2 the surplus moneys would come back to the council and the councillors would decide where that money would be spent.  At the moment there is a good deal of transferring by officials from programme to programme that the councillors are not aware of and that is due to our present auditing system.  I am not blaming the auditors but, as somebody said today, they are always four or five years behind in auditing local authority expenditure. Surely you cannot observe proper accounting procedures or ensure everything is above board on such a system.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</P>
    <P>This is only the first phase of local government reform, the aim being to allow us to proceed with the election to county councils and major boroughs at present.  By this time next year we will be discussing far more wide-ranging measures to ensure that we will have elections to the smaller bodies.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say at his Press conference last week, and the Taoiseach say last Sunday, that as a result of any reform of local government, we will have in a year or so the same local authorities as we have now or perhaps even a higher standard of local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> I support the concept of retaining urban councils.  They have played a major role in representing the people of the towns and their environs.  I would also like to see town commissioners upgraded to urban council status where the population justifies it.  At the moment, town commissioners are merely implementing agents of county councils and seem to have no real teeth or power.  I hope that in future towns such as Gorey in County Wexford, for example, will have an urban authority.  It is also important that urban councils continue to be rating authorities, otherwise they are only implementing agencies of county concils.  I welcome the Minister's commitment during the past week that they will continue to hold their present status and powers.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill to extend urban boundaries and set up a commission to consider the extension of those boundaries is welcome.  As Deputy Yates knows, we have been seeking for many years to have urban boundaries extended in different towns in County Wexford. In Enniscorthy where we come from we have the farce that Enniscorthy Urban Council have built numerous houses, in Gimont Avenue, Moran Park, Slaney View Park, Father Murphy Park, Mile House and other areas, but these houses are in rural sections of Enniscorthy.  As a result the people there cannot vote for Deputy Yates or for me or any other member of the council who may have helped them to get housing or have done other work for them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The people there are very aggrieved that they are unable to vote for whatever representative they wished to vote for in urban council elections.  The Minister is going to do something about that and a section outside the present urban areas is to be designated for urban status.  I would like to see any major town thus extended to a radius of perhaps two or three miles. Of course, this can create difficulties for members of county councils and officials if it is to mean they will lose their rating <Col N="213" /> income.  However, the Minister should spell out clearly that urban boundaries will be extended and we will not have to spend meeting after meeting year after year discussing this question.  Someone told me recently that it took from 1957 to 1987 to extend an urban boundary somewhere in Minister, perhaps Cork. We do not want that system to continue and to have to wait years for an urban boundary extension.  Now is the time to do it.  The commission should report as quickly as possible and recommend the necessary extensions.</P>
      <P>Regional development has been mentioned. To a certain extent I welcome the Minister's proposals to have a regional body, but being regional and big is not always being beautiful.  Wexford has been losing out to the rest of the region in relation to regional bodies such as the South Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation and the Southern Health Board. We are being linked into Waterford which is favoured for the headquarters of regional bodies.  I cannot for the life of me understand why.  I would like to see Wexford selected for some of those headquarters. For example, Kilkenny has the headquarters of the health board but when any Cabinet in the last 15 or 20 years have sat down to talk about regional or subregional structures they seem always to consider Waterford in this context. I ask them to consider Wexford or some county that has not regional status, for the headquarters of the new regional body.  Perhaps the Minister of State here, Deputy Connolly, will take that on board.  I know he is very committed to that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financing of local authorities has been mentioned.  Some of my political colleagues from the county, particularly Fine Gael representatives, have been saying on radio that they did not participate in the all-party committee because finance was not included.  That is not exactly true.  They wanted the national tax system to be looked at, not just the financing of local authorities. That was one of the reasons they opted out.  I am not sure that councillors really want to implement any type of financing <Col N="214" /> regulations.  No councillor wants to grasp the nettle of imposing increased water or refuse charges.  I include myself in that.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> It is a red herring to claim that councillors want the right to introduce taxes.  They want power, without the unpopularity that goes with it.  That is reasonable enough since we are all politicians competing for votes.  I am happy that the Minister has taken the first step towards the restructuring of local government.  The committee of which I was a member stated quite clearly that we did not want any type of property tax or poll tax to be introduced.  We are all aware of what has happened in Britain regarding the poll tax.  This country has a high rate of unemployment which brings its own problems if people have to meet extra charges. Working people are paying high taxes already.  A property tax or poll tax would further penalise those people.  I would rather see better value for the money which is made available to local authorities.</P>
      <P>When the Barrington committee looked at the financing of local authorities they found very little wrong with the structure. They questioned the rate support grant and brought in a fiscal committee from London to look at the overall system. The rate support grant was the only problem and the committee have been asked to look for a fairer and more equitabe system of distributing it.  I hope that when money is being distributed on a fairer basis Wexford will again benefit.  It seems that we have not been getting our share of the rate support grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several speakers have referred to An Bord Pleanála.  I am not sure that An Bord Pleanála in their present form are serving any great function.  The general public have lost faith in them and I have received many complaints from people who have been awaiting a decision for up to a year.  If just one person objects to An Bord Pleanála a development can be held up for a year or more, with consequent loss to the local community.  The <Col N="215" /> Minister must look seriously at the operations of An Bord Pleanála with a view to speeding up decisions.  Perhaps it should be broken up into regional divisions.</P>

I am not against individuals objecting but some objections are ridiculous, unwarranted and cause severe delays.  That view is held on all sides of the House.  The Minister might consider how improvements might be made in the system.  When politicians telephone An Bord Pleanála nobody there seems to know what is happening.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a number of advantages which will accrue to local authorities.  I welcome the fact that the chairman of a county council will have an allowance to enable him to operate properly.  I should like to see an allowance extended to councillors.  Many Deputies would not support that view but I have argued my case at a number of parliamentary party meetings.  Councillors should be facilitated by a telephone allowance, a postage allowance, stationery and other expenses incurred in the day-to-day operations by a county councillor, an urban councillor or a town commissioner.  Membership of local authorities is becoming more and more the preserve of the well heeled.  Ordinary working class people have difficulty in getting time off work and find it practically impossible from a financial point of view to sustain membership of a local authority.  In many cases a county councillor has almost as much work as a Deputy.  He has to travel all over the electoral area to visit various community groups.  I welcome the proliferation of people involved in such groups who are interested in what is happening in their area but it is becoming more and more difficult for councillors to serve them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Times have changed since then and 20 years later we are only setting about reforming local government.  Many of the objectives contained in that document were very good and some of them have been included in the Bill.  This shows that it was difficult to get any type of agreement even within political parties for the reform of local government because councillors, TDs, and politicians generally, had their own ideas on how local government should be reformed.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has set reform in motion.  Local government reform, as the Taoiseach said yesterday will go on for the next ten years.  In Britain, where their local government system was reformed in recent years, they are now reverting to some of the original ways local authorities were run.  They found that some of the structures they set up were too big, too unwieldy.  They established regional councils, county councils and district councils.  On a visit there last September we found that they were at loggerheads with each other because one authority had a power which another authority considered they should have had.  There <Col N="217" /> appeared to be a lot of infighting, disillusionment and dissatisfaction with the tiers operating in England at that time.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Mr. Michael Heseltine recently announced he is having another look at local authority reforms.  Obviously, it is very difficult to get the right balance to satisfy everybody.  I hope the Minister, in his first attempt, has got it right and that this time next year we will see further reforms before the urban council elections.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, for introducing this very welcome and wide ranging reform of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Browne as a loyal Government backbencher has to put a brave face on this Mickey Mouse Bill and he has done so with great loyalty to his colleagues. However, I have more latitude in outlining what is the real truth behind this Bill. The Bill is a major disappointment and it does not deal with many of the problems that I, as a local councillor since 1979 &mdash; both as an urban councillor and a county councillor &mdash; am faced with. This Bill does nothing for housing, roads or in relation to giving revenue raising powers to local authorities.  It fudges and funks all the major issues of local government, and, therefore, it cannot be taken too seriously.  What it does, however, in a sinister way in relation to some of the sections, is to give more power to the Minister in some cases and in other cases tips the balance of ministerial control to a greater extent than exists.  We will be opposing the Bill on Second Stage and we regret very much that no meaningful attempt has been made to reform local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the abolition of domestic rates in 1979 local government has not functioned with real authority.  It has been a puppet of central Government.  That is true of road building, where they are dependent on road grants from the Department of the Environment and it is true of housing where 100 per cent of the finance is provided by central Government.  In those <Col N="218" /> cases it is local government by diktat: local government via the Custom House. In my view the Bill does not change that.</P>
    <P>In as small a matter as the changing of speed limits, local government is strangled by having to go to central Government to get approval from both the Department of the Environment and the Garda authorities.  On a small issue such as that local authorities cannot be entrusted with extending 30 mile per hour speed limits 50 yards or 100 yards.  No effort has been made in the Bill to deal with that and therefore, we cannot say that the Government are seriously committed to reform.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to Part VI, sections 36 to 40.  I am particularly concerned about the sub-committees of councils.  A system was set up after the last local elections in 1985, of which the Minister will be aware, whereby there would be a <i>pro rata</i> allocation of places for minority parties.  On Wexford County Council there are 21 councillors and Fianna Fáil got 11 seats and, therefore, had the majority.  We opted not to give Fianna Fáil total control of all the sub-committees such as the sheep dipping committee, the library committee and so on and my party who had six seats were allowed a <i>pro rata</i> representation.  I cannot see under Part VI, where that same <i>pro rata</i> consideration can apply.  In other words, an attempt is being made to give dominance to the largest party, Fianna Fáil, in relation to the sub-committees.  When summing up on Second Stage perhaps the Minister will confirm whether this is the intention or whether he will support Committee Stage amendments to allow the <i>pro rata</i> system apply to all sub-committees, joint committees and committees set up by councils.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Mitchell, referred to sections 3 and 12 where the Minister has powers both in relation to electoral boundaries and general powers. I am concerned that this is undemocratic and unaccountable.  I will put down the marker that on Committee Stage we will be dealing with those provisions in some detail and proposing amendments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> In relation to finance it is my view that unless some method of local revenue is introduced we will not make progress. The only way this can be done in a way that is non-confrontational is that allowances be given through central taxation for any new tax introduced.  In other words, a credit should be allowed for local authority tax receipts against income tax liabilities.  Unless an imaginative measure is brought forward that allows for local taxation in that way, local authorities will not have the resources to do anything from removing bends to improving local services.</P>
    <P>In rural areas one of the biggest issues is roads.  We all know that the state of our non-national roads, our county roads, urban and regional roads is a public disgrace.  They are a source of derision for tourists and people who are trying to carry on business here.  Enormous damage has been done to the transport sector because of our inadequate roads.  It is simply a case of inadequate resources being spent.  When, as my party's spokesman for roads and transport, I investigated this problem I found that Fianna Fáil introduced a discretionary road grant in 1988.  This grant started off at £30 million and this year it is £70 million.  The Minister always says he is a great man, the first person to introduce grants specifically for minor roads.  Only yesterday, at Question Time, he was bragging again that he had introduced £80 million of grants.</P>

      <P>They would not be allowed to subtract the money they are spending but motor tax receipts would be allowed to go towards ensuring that the necessary resurfacing cycle for roads would be restored from the present level, which on average is every 32 years, to a reasonable level of around nine years.  There is no point in going around with scut trucks and jeeps belching smoke putting in a little bit of chippings here and there in the run-up to the local elections as a solution to the problem of potholes.  The roads should be resurfaced properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that total receipts from motor taxation, drivers' licences and so on is £160 million. Most local authorities think they would be worse off if they were allowed to keep those receipts instead of getting the road grants, which would be abolished, but what they are forgetting is that the national roads authority will now get the finance for the national primary and secondary routes, which comes to about £160 million.  If that is taken from the £240 million and the remainder allowed to go to fund the non-national roads, local authorities would be much better off.  Unless we have additional investment of at least 25 per cent in our county roads for a three to four year period to build them up to the previous level, some roads will be lost for all time.  This problem must be addressed, but I regret to say there are no proposals in this Bill to <Col N="222" /> provide adequate finance, only a greater and increasing dependency on the goodwill, or lack of it, of central Government to fill potholes.  If local authorities are not trusted with that job &mdash; and they are not trusted with the extension of speed limits &mdash; how can they be taken seriously?</P>
      <P>I will now deal with housing.  It is important that what I say to the Minister I say to his face and not behind his back. Of all the issues that frustrate the local councillors who were elected in 1985 and where central Government have failed them most, is the provision of local authority housing for those who cannot provide it for themselves.  It is simply shameful and negligent that this Government have omitted any reference to housing in this Bill or to give more powers to local authorities to acquire run down houses or more powers to raise revenue to put towards house maintenance, the renovation of old houses or taking them over and renting them, or towards mainline construction of local authority houses.  This is at a time when we have particular problems with homelessness, particularly juvenile homelessness, and the growth of over 7 per cent over a ten year period in the elderly population, which is due, thankfully, to increased life expectancy.  It is incredible that there is no initiative in this legislation to give more powers and more resources to local authorities to deal with this.   There are other issues relating to housing where initiatives could be taken but are neglected.  It is a scandal that 6,000 local authority houses do not have bathrooms and toilets.  The State is the landlord, yet people are expected to survive without those facilities and there is no reference to this in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to make some specific proposals on housing for the elderly. There are cases of elderly people, an elderly widow or an elderly bachelor, living on their own; perhaps they own their house, it could have been a vested council house which has been bought out, but it has no facilities.  They cannot get help from the council to provide such facilities.  The Minister should have introduced a scheme whereby the local authority could buy the house and refurbish it and give it to them rent free for the rest of their lives but when the elderly person passed on the house would revert to the local authority who could allocate it to some other elderly person.  Local government needs to be changed from a system of administration into a system of creative management.  That is not happening. There is nothing in the Bill about housing initiatives for the elderly or anything else that would inspire confidence in what is being attempted.</P>

Deputy Browne, my constituency colleague, rightly said that the record of all parties in Wexford is exemplary on the non use of section 4's.  In the one case of a section 4 decision, the manager appealed it to An Bord Pleanála and won.  A hard look at the issue of rezoning and other planning issues is needed.  In my own county these matters are dealt with by using section 29 (d) whereby particular cases can be rezoned with the agreement of the local authority officials.  I think that is the best way to proceed.  However when section 4 is used at least five councillors should be required to sponsor the motion, two of whom must be from the electoral district to which the decision relates, and a two-thirds majority being required.  There should be a facility in terms of local democracy where by a petition people could lodge to have that decision reconsidered. There should also be a cooling off period whereby the county manager would be afforded the opportunity to make an interior report.  Unless we have a thought-out position which allows limited use of section 4 to give people the opportunity to have their say, we will not be serving local democracy well.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála have had planning scandals and has been proved disreputable in different cases.  I have found that An Bord Pleanála are totally unaccountable, undemocratic and lacking in any transparency.  If you ring An Bord Pleanála about a particular case you will be told fairly curtly that they do not know when they will have a decision or when an inspection will be carried out.  If you press further and ask as politely as you can if the inspection will be made or a decision reached within six months or by Christmas, or Easter, they will answer that they could not possibly say.  That is no way for anyone to do business.  I believe a legal time limit should be set whereby only in the most grave and complex circumstances could an appeal go beyond six months and whereby all issues shall be determined within that period.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say that there should be a facility whereby local councils, either unanimously or by a four-fifths <Col N="225" /> majority, could overturn decisions of An Bord Pleanála.  I am not satisfied that the board are final arbiters in all matters, and there should be some facility whereby unanimity would apply either in conjunction with the management or the members but whereby An Bord Pleanála would not have the final exclusive say in all cases.  The present position is unsatisfactory in terms of vexatious appeals to deliberately hold up the system, the slowness with which the board operate, and the fact that the board are completely unaccountable in the final analysis.  I am not satisfied, because what was set up to be independent and fair has turned out to be slow, cumbersome, and lacking in any semblance of democracy or accountability.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to Dublin and give my views in relation to reform.  I shall not go into the nitty-gritty of the matter, other than to say that in my view one of the biggest problems for the people of Dublin and in the land use of Dublin is the transport problem.  We all know that whether one comes from the north, the south, or the west side of Dublin, it is taking longer to get to work each morning. On the inner city cordon 55,000 cars enter each morning, carrying some 76,000 people.  Ireland has one of the lowest levels of car ownership <i>per capita</i> in Europe, so all the indications are that the number of cars will increase in Dublin and throughout the rest of the country. In total there are, I think, 800,000 cars in Ireland.  There is a crying need for a Dublin transport authority to plan to resolve Dublin's congestion problems over a period.  Traffic flows are down to slower than ten miles an hour during morning and evening peak rush-hours.</P>
    <P>That position is unacceptable, but it will get worse.  There are no plans in place to resolve the problem.  Dublin will come to a standstill unless there is planning to resolve the problem.  More businesses and more leisure centres will move out of the centre of the city and relocate. The population of inner city Dublin is dwindling &mdash; that is a known fact &mdash; and that needs to be reversed.  It is seriously remiss in any local government reform to <Col N="226" /> make no reference to the establishment of a Dublin transport authority.  There should be a concerted improvement in public transport.  In my view that should be based on a lifeline system, a mass transport system, whereby the city can build on the successful proven track record of the DART system.  If one considers the DART corridors from Greystones into the city and from Howth into the city one realises that more than 50 per cent of the people who go to work from those areas do so by use of public transport.  Seven thousand people leave their cars at home.  The DART system works; it is predictable.  Buses account for only 25 per cent of public transport on other routes &mdash; in other words, on the non-DART corridors &mdash; for people going to work.  On non-DART corridor routes only a quarter go to work by public transport whereas more than half go to work by public transport on the DART corridors. Buses get caught up in the same traffic jams and the same congestion as do cars.  Therefore, people ask what is the point of taking a bus &mdash; they might as well take their cars and have door to door service.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem will cost money.  It may cost £300 million to £400 million.  There may be eligibility for EC support.  There has to be concerted action to move away from the situation whereby Dublin Corporation have responsibility for the eastern by-pass; The Dublin Port and Docks Board talk about their particular problems of port access; the Garda deal with law enforcement; the Department of the Marine have responsibility for Dún Laoghaire port, and the Department of Transport are responsible for one company, Irish Rail, through DART, and another company through Dublin Bus.  With such scattered, disparate planning and thinking, is it any wonder that there is such a mess?  Until such time as the Dublin transport authority is reconstituted as was originally established in a Bill in the House in 1985, there will be no progress.  I appeal to the Government to take Dublin's transport problems seriously.  In my view, they are the biggest transport problems facing this <Col N="227" /> country and need to be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>A minor point I should like to take up with the Minister of State is that there is no reference in the Bill to the work of the archives services.  I am sure all Deputies would have received representation from the Society of Archivists in the Irish sector.  They wish to have the archives service set up on a statutory basis as part of any local government reform.  That would give the service the opportunity to develop.  Information is now held on floppy discs, on manuscripts, and on other files, that in years to come will be invaluable in terms of the history of local government and so on.  Unless there is now a conscious policy decision to legal and statutorily protect that information it could well be neglected in the future.</P>
    <P>I now turn to what I consider to be the most serious aspect of local government reform in so far as it concerns the Government's hidden agenda.  That relates to the non-holding of urban council and municipal elections &mdash; urban councils, some of the corporations, and the town commissioners.  No good reason has been advanced for not holding those elections. I am not too young that I do not have some cynical thoughts, and I am well aware &mdash; from the Presidential election and from other elections &mdash; that the largest party in the Government have done consistently badly in relation to floating urban votes.  The measure is a deliberately cynical attempt to minimise the turn-out in city areas and maximise the party's traditional vote in rural areas. That is shameful.</P>
    <P>That is only step 1. Step 2 is the abolition of urban councils and town commissioners where possible.   I am completely opposed to the deferring of those elections and to the abolition of those councils.  The councils have stood the test of time.  I come from Enniscorthy Urban District Council myself.  I was first elected to that council in 1979.  If Ireland follows the British example and sets up district councils covering wider regions, the smaller provincial towns will be submerged in wider district councils.  Their <Col N="228" /> identity will be lost.  What has happened in small provincial towns is that municipal authorities have acted as focal points in protecting and developing the towns. Whether by seeking a tourist office or a FÁS office, whether by making representation about the downgrading of a head post office, or whatever it might be, the urban council has been a democratic forum to which the local community could make representation.  The urban council can in turn be a voice for those people.  The Minister of State knows that much of his time has been taken up by deputations from people on urban councils. He has been gracious enough to receive many of them and to invest much of his time in them, the outcome of which I shall talk about at another time.</P>

      <P>Well, we could do with a few more pounds for housing, as the Minister of State says himself.  He has left housing short on a few occasions, and we are getting a little impatient.  I shall come back to that matter another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I make is that provincial towns are already losing out in relation to commercial development.  Most businesses of a large size are now deciding to go to the larger regional centres such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Sligo.  They might go one slight tier below those larger centres, but the provincial towns are losing out.  Arklow is an instance of a town that is losing out very heavily, whereas I would be very confident about the future of Bray.  Those areas will be extinguished if their focal point and engine for development, namely, the urban councils, is submerged. These councils have served us well for over 140 years, going back to the British times.  They have been efficient units of administration and it would be totally wrong and undemocratic to abolish them.  What will happen when these elections are over?  The Government will say:&ldquo;The urban councillors were elected in 1985; the system is very undemocratic; <Col N="229" /> they do not have a mandate whereas the new councillors who will be elected will have a mandate&rdquo;.  The Government will set up district councils and bodies, but that will be the rock on which local government will perish, and I will do everything possible to resist it.  There is no way that the problems of rural areas at present represented by county councils can be uniformly dealt with by a homogeneous product of a district council.  This has been tried in Britain but has proved to be a failure.  For example, the people on Enniscorthy Urban District Council do not care who is on Wexford County Council but they care a lot about who is on Enniscorthy Urban District Council.</P>
    <P>If the Government even back-track and hold the urban council elections next year it will be a mistake in so far as that the two elections should be held together. There is an overlapping of issues.  I feel very strongly that the hidden agenda of this legislation is the abolition of urban councils.  I would say bluntly that the Minister, Deputy Bobby Molloy, has a record, going back 20 years when he was Minister for the Environment in a previous Fianna Fáil Government, of wanting to abolish urban councils.  I see his dark hand in this legislation and I will do all in my power to ensure that my party resist it.  I know there are many Members of this House who have never been on an urban council, have no affinity for them and have little understanding of them.  It would be a very retrograde step to abolish councils that have stood the test of time and have not only performed well in terms of governing locally but have provided a basis on which other State agencies can be lobbied.</P>
    <P>There are some good measures in the legislation but it is not a major piece of legislation.  It has no new initiatives in relation to extra revenue-raising at local authority level.  It does not develop urban and municipal councils in the way I would like to see them developed.  It does nothing to establish a roads fund to deal with non-national roads.  It has no new housing initiatives and there is nothing that would ensure creative management as opposed to the system of public <Col N="230" /> administration that exists.  Therefore it fails the test.  It is fairly innocuous apart from some of the insidious provisions in relation to joint committees of councils. Therefore we will be opposing the Bill as a failed and botched attempt at serious local government reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to take up a couple of the points dealt with by Deputy Yates.  Secret agenda are always very attractive in politics.  They are like conspiracy theories.  They can never be proved to be wrong and you do not have to produce a scintilla of evidence that they are right.  You can make all sorts of assertions about hidden agenda, but the reality is that there are logical reasons that the two elections will be held separately, and that has been made clear already.  The concern which has been voiced by Deputy Yates is little more than scare-mongering.  There is a reality which Deputy Yates and his party seem to have ignored, a reality that members of other parties have been aware of for the last 20 or 25 years, that is, that there are great suburban masses around even the smallest of our urban towns but many urban district councils represent areas only at the centre of influence of their towns.  Clearly some alternative system to bring the hinterland &mdash; not the rural part of the county &mdash; under the control of a democratically elected institution is well worth considering.  However, that is an issue for another day.  I would simply make the point that the hidden agenda is always attractive because you can deal with innuendo rather than with facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point Deputy Yates raised was about bathrooms, and I agree with him in this regard.  The issue of bathrooms is quite extraordinary.  It is nothing short of a national scandal that there are houses in this State owned by public housing authorities which do not have the fundamental aspects of civilised living. That is a scandal, and it is a scandal that Deputy Yates' party did nothing about this when they were in power.  We are, albeit a little later than we should, doing something about this.  Two million pounds has been provided this year in the <Col N="231" /> social housing programme for the provision of bathrooms, and that is only an initial allocation.  I am very pleased to put on the record that a substantial amount of that sum is going to County Wicklow. Almost £100,000 is going to the town of Bray and £30,000 to Arklow.  I commend the Minister for his good sense and I thank him for providing that money for County Wicklow.  I will be asking him for twice that amount next year and I will be making a lot of noise if I do not get it.  The Minister and the House will be pleased to learn that we have already started in Bray to put the bathrooms in place.  A number of contractors have been lined up, houses have been surveyed, contracts have been signed and I understand that building will commence before the end of this month, certainly before 26 June.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates also referred to repairs to houses owned by old age pensioners. It made me scratch my head and wonder if Deputy Yates ever reads his post. Again in the social housing programme there is an extraordinary initiative in this area, as there is in other areas of housing. Deputy Yates seems to be a little confused about the appropriate way to deal with these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go back as far as needs be.  You need not worry about that. I will go back just as far as it takes to prove how extraordinary the hypocritical comments from Fine Gael have been.  It was bizarre in the extreme for Deputy John Bruton, Leader of Fine Gael, to suggest yesterday that there is no urgency surrounding the issue of local government reform.  He said it is not a matter that requires precipitate action, that we could take another 30 years to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The issue of local government has been the subject of discussion, reports, documents and studies for well over 30 years.  Concern about the local government system goes back to the early days of the sixties.  At that time two reports were produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute governing the problems which existed even then with local government funding and the relationship between funding and the structures of local government.  Following presentation of those two reports in the Department of Finance the Department did what Departments of Finance all over the world do, they appointed an inter-departmental committee. Throughout the sixties this very fine body of persons dealt with the whole issue of local government finance and taxation.  No fewer than five separate reports were produced by that committee, some of them excellent reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An early report dealt with the whole issue of rates and the rating system. There was a report dealing with the valuation system and another dealing with the importance and impact of exemptions and remissions on rates and also with the alternative systems of local finance and taxation.  There was even a report on the agricultural grant and a final report was produced on the grants system and the way money was delivered from central Government to local government.  Three of these inter-departmental reports were so good that the Department of Finance took the unusual step of publishing them. They handed them out to the politicians of the day and to the public to read.  Two of the reports were circulated internally <Col N="233" /> within the Civil Service but were never released to the public.</P>
    <P>As the sixties progressed and as we stood on the threshold of a new decade, a number of factors began to focus more and more attention on the organisational as well as the financial aspects of local government.  These factors included demographic change, notably the growth of Dublin and the depopulation of towns in rural Ireland.  Technologial change, in particular change in communications and transportation systems, was a second factor, the growing public interest in participation and in people democracy was a third factor.</P>
    <P>In 1971 and 1972 two further important documents dealing with the whole area of local government were published.  The first of these, published in 1971, was a Government White Paper on the Reorganisation of Local Government which dealt with the whole issue of the organisation, structures and functions of local government.  It was not one of the best White Papers ever published but it did address the issues which were felt at that time to be foremost in terms of organisation and structure.  The White Paper on local government reorganisation was comprehensive, tedious in some parts, odd in its language, but comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The first part of the White Paper examined the system of local government as it then operated, looked at the historical basis of local government and what has changed since the foundation of the State.  It was a little short on analysis; it did not look at our history in local government since the foundation of the State.  We have systematically stripped local government, demolished small local authorities, systematically centralised local government and systematically removed it from its sphere of influence and relevance.  For all its faults, the White Paper on local government looked at the system of local government as it was going into the seventies.  It looked at the purpose of local government, its statutory provisions and its relationship with central government.  It also looked at the functions of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also looked at the <Col N="234" /> functions of local authorities, the objectives of local authorities, reorganisation, including basic issues such as the optimum size of local government units, multi-purpose authorities and the general operations of the system.  Possible patterns of local government, including regional authorities and town hinterland authorities, were discussed and that is why I am surprised at the contribution of Deputy Yates who seems to think that the idea of a district other than simply the urban council is a new one.  It is an issue which has been discussed in local government for 30 years.</P>
    <P>The county structures and the changes needed in them, in particular the out-of-date boundaries, and the whole idea of the regions were dealt with in the White Paper.  It also dealt with the Dublin area, other large towns, the Gaeltacht and a number of other statutory bodies.  The first two parts of the local government White Paper, 1971, dealt fairly comprehensively &mdash; although I would find some fault with it &mdash; with the structure of local government which existed then and which is still our structure today.</P>
    <P>The third part of the White Paper &mdash; in many ways the most important part &mdash; dealt with a whole series of issues which still need to be dealt with today.  It dealt with the issue of controls on local government by central Government.  It really is quite extraordinary when you try to list the number of different types of controls on local government.  One of the members of the Radcliffe-Maud report committee visited Ireland while the report was being produced and came to the conclusion that, without any shred of doubt, local government was more centrally controlled in Ireland than anywhere else.  That is why I think that some of the criticisms hurled at this Bill are perverse because, at the very heart of the Bill, is the stripping away of some of the most central and pernicious control mechanisms that exist.</P>
    <P>The question of the restatement of the powers of local authorities in a positive way, as opposed to the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine was dealt with in Part III of the White Paper of 1971 and it is dealt with again <Col N="235" />&mdash; for the first time in statute &mdash; in this Bill.  Surely anybody who is interested in local government and who has a shred of generosity would recognise that that is a very welcome and central element in the Bill?  The question of the restatement of the powers of local authorities in a positive way, as opposed to the negative way that the local authority powers were stated, was dealt with in the 1971 White Paper and legislative change was promised then.  The constitution, membership and the procedures governing the local authorities were dealt with and, finally, under this heading it looked at the staffing, the question of modernisation, the whole audit system and its oddities and the question of centalised services, in particular the provision of centralised computing services.</P>
    <P>All that was dealt with in 1971 in a White Paper and it is a scandal that in 1991 the Leader of the Opposition suggests that there is no need to hurry in relation to any of this.  He seems to think that we can dawdle for another 20 or 30 years.  As Mr. Tom Barrington said, one of the problems with local government is that it is like an ancient monument, nobody is willing to demolish it but we are quite prepared to stand by and let it fall asunder, piece by piece.  If we follow Deputy John Bruton's advice that is precisely what we will be doing with local authorities: we will betray the very thing which many Members regard as not just a central point in political life but an important point in how the State and the public relate to one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>A series of changes were proposed at that time which have still not occurred and they are needed now.  At that time changes were listed as being vital in the area of the functions of local authorities.  What is the appropriate function for a local authority and what level of local authority should fulfil those functions? If changes in the structures of the local authorities were suggested as being vital then, how much more vital are those changes at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes in the operation of local authorities and questions about the capacity of local authorities to operate effectively and efficiently were raised then and those questions are still with us today.  Indeed, they are more pertinent now, 20 years later, than they were then.  The conclusions in the White Paper were fairly low key.  We do not need to be dramatic about the changes needed in functions, structure and operations to make local government more relevant.  The reality is <Col N="237" /> that, apart from changes taking place in the health boards and road authorities, nothing really fundamental was suggested in 1971.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, however, suggested that consideration should be given to deciding which functions are appropriate to local government and which functions are appropriate to central Government. In that way they could decide in regard to functions currently operated by local authorities, particularly councils, for example, the provision of houses, which should be paid for by central Government and which should come from the coffers of local government.  That is still an issue today.  The other suggestion was that the local authorities should be regarded as development corporations and that this role should be enhanced.  That suggestion was made in no less than five separate reports since 1971 and we still have not seen it.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;structures&rdquo; the White Paper came up with quite controversial proposals.  I will mention some of them because I want to illustrate the continuity of need which has existed for 20 years and the fact that we are still scratching the surface and no more.  To hear anybody describing this Bill as being in some way a threat to local democracy when all it does is to push, in a fairly tentative way, along a path which was outlined 20 years ago, is incomprehensible. The system of local government, it was suggested at that time, would be based mainly on counties.  In fact, one of the features of that White Paper was that it continuously equated large with efficient.  I would contend that large does not necessarily mean efficient and that one of the things we should be doing &mdash; the Minister is moving in this direction in the Bill &mdash; is moving towards the concept of multiple tiers or several different layers of local government.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in the White Paper, too, that regions should have an important place in any re-organised system of local government.  The Minister has suggested precisely that in the Bill and is moving in that direction in a statutory way for the first time.  Also suggested was <Col N="238" /> the setting up of a single authority with jurisdiction over the entire Dublin region.  As the Acting Chairman who comes from Dublin will be fully aware, the concept of a metropolitan authority for Dublin would not be accepted by any of us nowadays.</P>
    <P>It was proposed that town commissioners should be abolished and that it would be appropriate to transfer many of their functions to urban councils or county councils.  New forms of towns and local bodies were also proposed.  It was suggested that special arrangements for co-ordination were needed at that time in Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  In the case of ordinary communities it was suggested that some form of grassroots level local government change needed to take place.  It was also suggested that we needed to create a system whereby area committees who would normally be based in towns and their hinterlands could involve voluntary bodies and bring people from residents' associations into local government.  That is a very good idea and I cannot understand why 20 years later we have not moved in that direction.</P>
    <P>That White Paper suggested, too, that several harbour authorities in the case of smaller harbours should be abolished and their functions taken over by central Government.  That is a recurring theme in local government reform documents.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Operations&rdquo;, it was suggested in the White Paper that it should be the objective of the Government to allow local authorities the greatest possible discretion in the exercise of their powers and to concentrate central controls on key points only.  The Minister has returned to that philosophy in the Bill.  It was suggested that it would be an important change to restate in broad terms the permissive powers of local authorities.  We should remember that this was recommended in Chapter 14 of the White Paper which was issued 20 years ago and that we are still only talking about doing this.  It was also suggested that the laws relating to the constitutions, membership and procedures of local <Col N="239" /> authorities needed to be modernised and simplified.  I will not go any further.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that many of the measures the Minister is now starting to put into place in 1991 were proposed as far back as 1971.  How can any serious politician come into this House and suggest that this is precipitous action?  How can the leader of a party stand up here and suggest that we need another couple of years to discuss these issues?</P>

      <P>The White Paper also referred to a separate White Paper on the issue of finance, an issue which was dealt with in some detail by the previous speaker.  In fact, a White Paper on the issue of local government was published in 1971.  I know it will embarrass some of the Deputies on the benches opposite to hear that that White Paper was well balanced but it was not without faults. No White Paper ever produced by any Government in this State has been without faults.  However, that White Paper was absolutely savaged by Fine Gael when it was published in 1972.  They put the boot in and were destructive in the extreme.  We all inherited the consequences of that destruction.  However, Fine Gael were closest to inheriting those consequences because when they came into Government in 1973 they were faced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will speak slower then.  I would point out to the Chair that other speakers were allowed to range fairly wide of the mark in this debate.  I am dealing with the issue of local government reform.  I do not wish to sound impudent <Col N="240" /> but I am the only speaker who has dealt entirely with the issue of local government reform.  I am putting this in context and I beg the indulgence of the Chair to allow me to do that.  We cannot resolve the issue of local government reform in a day, a week or a year; local government reform is an ongoing issue.  It is organic and it has to be given time to grow and develop.  I, too, have to be given a little time to grow and to develop my points.</P>
      <P>After it was published in 1971 that White Paper was circulated to local authorities for discussion.  Work progressed on the White Paper on finance and it was published in 1972 against a growing crisis in local government at that time. Members of this House will well remember 1972 when Dublin Corporation were abolished for not setting an adequate rate and the corporation in Bray suffered the same fate shortly afterwards.  Local councillors from all political parties in those local authorities were saying at that time that reform of local government was needed urgently.  How can anyone come into this House, 20 years later, and suggest that this is not an urgent matter now? As I was saying, even as the White Paper on finance was being published in 1972 two local authorities, Dublin Corporation and Bray UDC, were moving towards dissolution.  In both cases commissions were set up to replace the local authorities.  I think most people would accept that those were tragic years for those two authorities.  That was certainly the case in the town of Bray and I know from experience that it was the case also in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drafters of the White Paper on finance had the benefit of five reports from the inter-departmental committee on finance and taxation.  They also had the benefit of two ESRI reports.  As a consequence, perhaps its recommendations are far more comprehensive and detailed than the recommendations on re-organisation.  The main recommendations continue to make interesting reading even to this very day.  I have absolutely no doubt that the recommendations which were incorporated in the 1972 White Paper, imperfect though <Col N="241" /> some of them were, could be dusted off and introduced even today.  Obviously many of the recommendations would need to be refined but if they could be approached now on an all-party basis and in a non-partisan way they would go a long way towards solving the core problems which are bedeviling local government at present.  These recommendations were not refined and they, like the White Paper on reorganisation, became a political football in the run-up to the 1973 general election.  Fine Gael and, to a lesser extent, Labour, bear the responsibility for what happened next.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on finance contained over 40 major recommendations and conclusions. It is difficult to capture in summary form the findings of that White Paper but it is worth trying to do so. The paper concluded, and I quote: &ldquo;It is essential that local government should have power to levy local taxes and that such taxes should be capable of meeting a significant proportion of local expenditure&rdquo;. The White Paper went on to deal critically with the valuation system at the core of the problem of local finance.  It suggested that the existing valuation system be reformed urgently.  It went on to discuss the arrangements for the transfer of responsibility of functions from the Minister for Finance to the then Minister for Local Government.  It suggested that the Minister for Local Government should prepare a series of measures for practical reform of the valuation system with provision for bringing valuations ultimately up to full current values.  As Members of the House will remember, the valuation system was effectively negated in 1978 when we &ldquo;abolished&rdquo; the rates.  However, the same valuation system continued to operate up to very recent times in the case of agricultural land when it was struck down as unconstitutional. That is a measure of just how out of line with reality the valuation system was.</P>
    <P>The system of remissions and exemptions was also highly criticised.  The paper concluded that the existing provisions should be repealed and replaced by a modern code.  It suggested that rate <Col N="242" /> reliefs, new grant house reliefs and a variety of other reliefs should be either abolished or limited.  It argued for the phasing out of a whole series of exemptions. It also argued that the State should be treated for rating or local government revenue purposes like any other property owner.  What is the current importance of those suggestions?  The current importance is that had we listened to those suggestions in 1971 the hiatus which has bedevilled local government and central Government throughout the seventies and which caused a problem from the very early days of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government of 1973&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not trying to make a partisan point.  These issues should have been dealt with at that time and all of the parties here bear a responsibility for not dealing with them.  When Fine Gael were in power we put the boot in, and when we are in power they put the boot in and so on.  That does not rebound to the credit of any of us.  We all come here and beat our breasts about the importance of local government but when it comes to doing something practical we can never get away from our capacity to put the boot into each other.  That is the curse of politics. It is a pity we lost two decades and none of us can say that the other party bears all the responsibility.  We are all responsible.  Let us learn from our mistakes and go forward from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal arrangements to allow local authorities introduce a waiver system were suggested as far back as 1971.  These systems would have helped to humanise rates and create interim measures which would have allowed us to overcome <Col N="243" /> them.  They were subsequently introduced when the service charges came in in 1985.  Chapter nine of the White Paper dealt with the expansion of autonomous local sources of local finance.  When Deputy Yates referred to local finance I was surprised he did not refer to this or to the fine papers produced by the inter-departmental committee, or to NESC Report No. 80, or to the Copeland-Walshe report, or any of the reports that dealt with the issue of finance.</P>
    <P>Chapter nine of the White Paper of 1972 dealt with the expansion of autonomous sources of local finance.  In general it proposed that the maximum possible amount of revenue should be derived from a variety of local authority charges for services, professional fees and other non-tax sources.  This proposal was based on the good principle that those who can be identified as drawing direct benefit from any service should carry at least a portion of the cost of that service, rather than the whole cost of that service being borne by the taxpayers in general.  Specific recommendations included the maximum possible amount of revenue being derived from local authority service charges and from fees for professional services.  It suggested that a critical review of the level of existing charges by local authorities should be carried out on an on-going basis.  It suggested that local authorities be given a general power to charge for services and to undertake trading services ancillary to their normal functions.  We had an interesting example of this happening recently in Wicklow where the county council and a private developer used the services of the labour personnel of the building service of Wicklow County Council to build expensive private houses on sites owned by the council. That was very imaginative.  It is a pity we have not tried to use our imagination a little more in local government, because even within the constraints of existing local government law we can push the frontiers out.  The provisions in the Bill will assist local authorities push the frontiers out faster.</P>
    <P>Steps were to be taken to ensure that <Col N="244" /> the subsidies from rates for particular services would be visible.  In other words, if a company were getting a specific subsidy it would be made transparent somewhere in the accounts so that people could judge whether or not they were getting value for the money they were foregoing.  Local authorities were to be required to review their level of charges at regular intervals.  The White Paper also suggested that local authorities be required to make economic charges for water and sewerage schemes.  It was not a new idea that came up in 1983.  The idea had been around for some time.</P>
    <P>The White Paper suggested a variety of other charges.  Those proposals were vigorously rejected at that time by the Opposition parties.  I mention the vigour with which Fine Gael attacked those proposals because in 1983 we were accused of being nihilistic and destructive when we made political play out of the same point that Fine Gael had made in 1972. The same party revised those proposals less than 15 years later as an interim measure pending the long term resolution of the local government funding issue. That is what was done in 1983 and is what was always done with local government, longfingering the issue.</P>
    <P>Chapter ten of the White Paper dealt with another controversial issue &mdash; the question of central Government grants to local government.  What was said then is just as relevant today when talking about reform.  The Minister's Bill is only phase one of the first chapter of a series of reforms needed in local government. Chapter ten concluded that the existing system was unsatisfactory, recommended that the system of grants be simplified and that dependence on grants should be reduced by expanding local government finances on the one hand and by converting the grant to a block grant and giving local authorities more autonomy. That was 20 years ago.  Any member of a local authority would endorse those sentiments now.</P>
    <P>Alternative taxation systems, including a poll tax, were examined in the White Paper and rejected out of hand.  Local income tax, a local sales tax and site <Col N="245" /> valuations were also examined and dismissed. The chapter concluded that the Government had been forced to the conclusion that in the circumstances it was not possible to provide supplementary sources of local taxation suitable from a local and national point of view and which would provide substantial revenue in all areas.</P>
    <P>The great problem for anyone interested in local government is that people talk about the need to reform local government finance.  When I hear fellow councillors talking about the need to reform local finance I ask them what they mean by it and they invariably mean that the Government should give more money to the local authorities.  That would not be a reform but simply pushing more opium into the system.  Reform is about thinking of ways to get back to where local authorities can stand on their own feet and be, to a greater extent than they are today, independent of central Government.  The worst thing that ever happened here is that we created a system which separated the concept of spending money at local government level from the necessity to raise funds.  The clowns in Dáil Éireann can raise the funds by raising taxes and people with no responsibility feel they can spent it.  That is not local government.  The essence of local government is that there is a direct and specific relationship between the provision of services and the funds for those services.  Those who suggest that reform can avoid that are deluding themselves.</P>
    <P>The balance of the White Paper of 1972 dealt broadly with the efficiency issues and the means of limiting the burden of local finance on local taxpayers.  Proposals included the examination of the functions in order to distinguish between which functions were local and which were central so as to establish clearly the functions which should be the subject of grants and those which should be funded entirely from local charges.  Improvements in accounting and audit were proposed as was a move to programme budgeting.  Measures to improve the capacity of local elected representatives <Col N="246" /> to exercise financial control of local authorities were also proposed.</P>
    <P>As I suggested what is absolutely vital is an efficiency audit outside of individual local authorities.  We should have a group of efficiency auditors who could be called into play by the elected representatives. I am not happy with the way some cases are dealt in my local authority but I do not have the time or the professional competence to disentangle the myriad of accounts with which I am presented in response to questions.  Councillors on other councils have this problem.  I hope the Minister will seek in the not too distant future &mdash; this would not require legislation &mdash; to appoint an efficiency audit group who can be called into play by the elected representatives to ensure that we have efficiency and effectiveness and that the taxpayers get £1 worth of value for every pound spent in local government.</P>

      <P>I fear there is no relief for Members of the House.  Last night I indicated, when dealing with the provisions in Part II of the Bill which deals with the registration of Members' interests, that there are a number of fundamental flaws in the Bill.  However, before returning to the Bill I would like to deal with another issue, that is the way this debate was reported on RTE, in particular on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme.  Two matters were dealt with in that report.  First, it was suggested that a proposal had been made that political parties be funded by the taxpayer. <Col N="247" /> Deputy Howlin was at pains to point out this morning that that was not part of the Bill.  Second, the RTE presenter referred continuously to Fianna Fáil opposition to the Bill.  The Government are opposing the Bill and I would remind RTE that this is a two party Government.  Fianna Fáil are opposing the Bill on the basis that it has many defects which were outlined last night.  This was ignored in the report carried on RTE this morning.</P>
      <P>Another issue ignored by RTE is the registration of Members' interests with which I dealt at some length last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That forms a central part of the Bill.  It was not rejected in principle last night but rather because it was suggested that the matter could be dealt with by way of statute.  As I pointed out last night &mdash; this point was also ignored by RTE &mdash; the question of whether this issue should be dealt with by way of a statute or order or under the rules of the House was addressed very thoroughly in 1981 by Fine Gael and Labour.  In their Programme for Government at that time they promised to introduce a statute but following discussions between them they concluded, as both the Minister for Finance and I concluded last night, that the best way to deal with the issue of registration of Members' interests was by way of amendment to the rules of the House. The Minister for Finance indicated &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle is aware of this &mdash; that the matter has been before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for some time and the fact that there has been no progress is not because this side of the House are opposed to the principle. I hurl back any inputation that we are opposed to that principle in the face of the national broadcasting station.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the issue is before the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="248" /> Privileges at present.  The Minister suggested last night that the matter could best be handled as it is handled in the European Parliament, the German Bundestag, the Israeli Knesset, the Japanese Diet and the British House of Commons but it is not the way it is dealt with in The Netherlands where the scheme is operated on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>Another relevant point is that the Coalition Government, who were in office until 1987, spent some considerable time considering this issue and I give them credit for that.  They teased this matter out and came to the same conclusion I came to last night, that the best way to deal with the issue the registration of Members' interests was by way of an amendment to the rules of the House.</P>
      <P>Another myth peddled this morning is that the Minister pushed the idea that we should consider funding the political parties from the Exchequer.  I have very mixed feelings about that.  However, the Minister said something entirely different last night.  He responded to a suggestion made by Deputy Gay Mitchell that we should look at that issue.  The Minister said, quite rightly, that if other parties in this House put forward proposals they would be considered.  There is a heck of a different between that and a suggestion that the costs of the activities of political parties be met by the taxpayer.  I hope the errors will be corrected.</P>
      <P>I now wish to turn to the Bill.  Last night I dealt with Part II of the Bill which dealt with the registration of Members' interests.  I have no problem with that; indeed, I would favour such a register but would argue that the objective of the Bill is not achievable as it is set out and because a series of problems will have to be surmounted.  However it can be achieved by making a relatively simple amendment to the rules of the House.  I suggest that this is the most appropriate way to go about it.  I am aware that this view is shared by Members of the other parties represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to deal with Part III of the Bill which deals with the registration of <Col N="249" /> income and expenditure of political parties.  Sadly, we cannot legislate for good; we can only create a political climate where people can act in a positive way.  In a very good contribution last night Deputy Howlin made the point that the Americans regulate the funding of political parties.  With respect, I know a little about this.  Last year I spent some time observing the mid-term Congressional elections in a number of US states.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was not. However I spent some time examining the way they raise funds.  One campaign in particular sticks in my mind and that was the extraordinary battle between Jessie Helmes and Harvey Gantt in North Carolina.  Jessie Helmes stood for what he called North Carolina values and Harvey Gantt stood for progress and democracy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary thing is that it seemed easy to walk around or avoid what looks on the surface to be a very good structure to prevent political corruption by way of contributions and kick-backs to political parties.  Jessie Helmes found himself in an extraordinary situation where the largest building in North Carolina was filled with people who made phone calls all day looking for $10, $15 and $20 contributions which do not have to be notified.  One can make as many of these contributions as one likes. That is one way of getting around procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Howlin, I do not believe the procedures he proposed will help but I do not blame him for trying. Unless we put forward proposals, examine and tease them out we will never know what is good, bad or indifferent. Having examined the way the law operates in this regard in other states is strikes me that the proposals put forward here <Col N="250" /> will be about as useful as a colander for holding water.  For example, we have no problem knowing who the leaders of parties are although one or two of our minor leftish parties perhaps have some difficulties in knowing who pulls the strings. We know the address of party headquarters, the names and addresses of officers, the normal fiscal period, the financial secretary's address and a whole series of things that are set out in section 20 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The one issue we do not know about is contributions and that is the core issue Deputy Howlin was getting to.  I do not believe the issue of contributions is as pernicious in this House or in this country as some people suggest.  I give full credit to Deputy Howlin for making the point clearly yesterday that he does not believe there is wide-scale corruption within the contribution system.  I, for one, never accept contributions.  It is a principle I have established.  I do not know how we are going to create in statute what Deputy Howlin is looking for, but the provisions set down here are very easily avoided. They are not what they set out to be. They are not protecting us from people who would do evil things.  For example, there is no problem in avoiding the provisions of this if one sets out to do so. Multiple contributions are not dealt with here.  One can make contributions of £50 today, £50 tomorrow and £50 the next day and it mounts up fairly fast.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Bill is being opposed by the Government not because the principles involved in this Bill are not good. Some of the principles which this Bill seeks to progress are good.  The problem is that the manner in which they are addressed in this Bill is not efficient and will not be effective.  I commend the Labour Party for dedicating a portion of their limited Private Members' Time to this, as one Deputy from that party said last night, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of ethics here.</P>
    <P>I object to the suggestion that a Bill governing ethics should apply to Government only, to Ministers, Ministers of State and the Attorney General.  Ethics should apply to everybody in public <Col N="251" /> office.  If an interest is to be taken in the issue of ethics a line should not be drawn at the 166 Members of Dáil Éireann or 60 Members of Seanad Éireann.  An ethics debate is needed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not here throughout the entirety of it.  The point I make is that this ethics issue needs to be examined in a way which goes far beyond this Bill's examination.  All office holders and all Members of Dáil Éireann and the political parties in Dáil Éireann need to consider this issue from time to time.  The opposition from this side of the House to this Bill comes not because of any problems with principle but because of very serious problems with the practicalities of the Bill.  Where this matter has been thrashed out at Government level not just recently but going back over the last ten years one issue has been studied in detail.  When Fine Gael and Labour were in Government they had precisely the same view as to how we control the issue of interests, that is by regulation of this House.  I do not blame them for trying to score the odd political point on it or for trying to take the high ground on it, but let us just deal with the factual situation.  The issue is a serious one which needs to be dealt with seriously.  The problem is the Bill is so full of flaws that it cannot be commended to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, I stand to support this very important Bill.  In a <Col N="252" /> sense it is a historic Bill which should be accepted wholeheartedly by all and sundry and without a shadow of doubt by the Opposition and Fianna Fáil, because a legislator is one who makes the laws of the land and must be seen above all else to be honest.  If we are not seen to be honest by the people on whose behalf we legislate, then democracy is on rocky soil. The problem in Ireland today is that large numbers of people are questioning the honesty of politicians.  When once again we are knocking at doors or in pubs or wherever at election time I am sure we will hear the throw-away but insulting remarks that are very offensive to us politicians, such as, &ldquo;Sure you are only in it for what you can get out of it&rdquo;.  That is very hurtful but we cannot run away fom the fact that people feel that we are not all above corruption, we are not upright citizens of the State.  Above all they believe we have powers or channels open to us that leave us above the law on many occasions.</P>
      <P>One classic example of people's perception of what we are is the fact that thousands of people out there believe that one need not bother, that a politician will soon fix one's parking fine.  That opinion is widespread and people come to politicians to have their fines fixed. The logic then is that, if we fix their fines, as they believe we can, we ourselves never have to pay fines.  I assure the House that is not so, unfortunately.  I am supposed to be a law abiding citizen as is nearly everybody else but on accasions I err and let the meter run out and so on, and I can assure people that fines have to be paid.</P>
      <P>This image of us is bad for democracy. Recent publicity about politicians who have been able to avoid prosecution for allegedly, say, driving under the influence of drink, reinforces the view the public have of us that politicians do not have to go to court because they are politicians and somehow there is a law for them and a law for the rest of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The curse of land rezoning and material contraventions very often results in adding substantial value to property that on some occasions is owned <Col N="253" /> by politicians or known to be owned by politicians' friends or members of political parties.  That does nothing to enhance our image; in fact, it is extremely damaging for it.  It is another contribution to the confused views people have of us. As happens in housing estates that a few bad apples get a place a bad name, so it is in politics but unfortunately in politics when the mud sticks it is very difficult to come up looking whiter than white. However, I believe sincerely that the vast bulk of public representatives are honest and hard working people.  Therefore, it is more important than ever, given the huge gulf that exists between ourselves with our relatively good incomes, status and standard of living and those of the armies of unemployed and lowly paid, that we should be prepared to expose our interests and directorships, if any, as provided in this Bill so that the public can and will believe us when we say our only interest here as public representatives is to create a better society for all our people and we are not just in it for what we can get out of it.</P>
    <P>We can be proud that there have been no major scandals or incidences of corruption of the type which have afflicted other parliaments.  I am thinking of recent scandals in Japan and the Netherlands. The more this Government refuse to take on board the principles outlined in this Bill, the more suspect we will be in the eyes of the public.  Have we anything to hide?  The Minister for Finance might answer on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  If we have nothing to hide then we should support the Bill.  The public should not be encouraged in their suspicions as to what the life of a politician is all about.  We as a nation have never been scandalised by events such as the Learfan aircraft manufacturing scandal that shook the Netherlands.  We have never had cases of senior Ministers, Taoisigh or Heads of State bringing our State into disrepute by having to resign in disgrace, as happened recently in Japan.  A scandal is unfolding in the United States involving Senators who were in receipt of substantial contributions from wealthy financiers.  The <Col N="254" /> Senators felt obliged to come to the rescue of the financial backers by interceding on their behalf and trying to call off investigators.  We should be grateful that such issues have not arisen here but we can never be complacement.  This Bill presents us with a golden opportunity to remove the suspicions people have of us.</P>
    <P>Official gifts exchanged between Ministers or Heads of State should never be seen as anything other than the property of the State.  The cost of gifts presented on behalf of the people of Ireland is invariably borne from the State coffers. The exchange of gifts is not a personal act but rather an indication of goodwill on behalf of the people.  Gifts received should be accepted by the recipient on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>The exchange of gifts very often commemorates historical events.  The Office of Mayor of Dublin was instituted in 1229, while from 1641 the holder of the Office was entitled to add the prefix &ldquo;lord&rdquo;.  Isaac Butt became the first freeman of the city in 1896, but Dublin has a very long history, as indicated by the celebration of the millennium in 1988. Many famous people have played a part in Dublin's history and numerous gifts must have been exchanged, yet if one visits the Civic Museum in South William Street one finds no items identified with the mayors, lord mayors or freemen of the city.  Where have these gifts gone? The people have lost out because they were not preserved for the benefit of the city.</P>
    <P>I agree with much that Deputy Mitchell said last night.  His party seem to have a problem in that people run away when they see them coming in case they will be asked to subscribe a few bob for the party.  I am delighted to say that we in The Workers' Party do not experience that when we ask for a few bob.</P>

      <P>Fundraising is time consuming and people feel they should be devoting their energies to more important political activities.  This Bill is an attempt to put in place a legal framework <Col N="255" /> to ensure public accountability.  There is an overwhelming need to set high standards in high places.  This country is an exception in that we do not limit the gifts which public office holders can receive, nor do we expect our legislators to declare their financial interests.  The case for reform in both these areas has often been made and it is only a matter of time before a structure is put in place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the indication by the Minister for Finance regarding State funding for political parties.  Deputy Mitchell referred to the fact that we should have some controls over the amounts of money that political parties and individuals within political parties can spend.  We have to send our members to rattle tin cans in places like public houses and to go from door to door and from church to church.  Certain of our opponents who have access to quite substantial sums of money can effectively make a presentation at election time which is disproportionate to the amount of work which has been carried out.  There is a need to balance the books and to control the amount of money that parties and individuals are allowed to spend.  I presume that the Minister for Finance was speaking yesterday on behalf of the Government. Surely the disbursal of Exchequer funds is better than below-the-counter dealing in political donations.  The continuing allegations that succcessive Governments made political decisions that were beneficial to commercial interests would not arise if political party finances were open to public scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that Mr. Michael McDowell, Chairman of the Progressive Democrats who as we all know, represent the other half of the Government, is opposed to the public funding of political parties.  All Members of this House receive public funding, the State pays our telephone expenses in Leinster House, and pays wages of our secretarial assistants, and we receive our allocation of 1,200 envelopes pre-paid every month.  Salaries are paid to TDs and Senators and we have the various other facilities provided to <Col N="256" /> Members of the House.  Even the Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad receive State funding.  We are very lucky also that we receive not only a salary for coming to work but also £25 per sitting day for walking across the threshold of the building. That places us in a position that would make many a trade union member in outside industry envious.  Perhaps the Progressive Democrats' opposition has something to do with the ease with which they can still raise money from, for example, their friends in the corporate sector.  One wonders what happened to the earlier radical ideas to publish the names of donators of over £1,000 to the Progressive Democrats.  Or, perhaps, the opposition to public funding relates to the declining political fortune of the Progressive Democrats and their fear of losing out in the proportionality system that operates in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The section of the Bill which deals with gifts to office holders has a glaring omission in the range of office holders covered by the Bill.  For example, the Office of President is not included.  Such an important public office should be included in the legislation.  There is an assumption that politicians are corrupt, that corruption in political circles is widespread but I, for one, do not accept that that is the case.  Politicians need to protect themselves from such allegations.  The best way to do so is to introduce measures in this House that set out rules in relation to receiving gifts and to declaration of interests.  Unfortunately, this House has refused to do so in the past but I hope this Bill will spur moves to open a process of accountability.</P>
    <P>For over two years a proposal has been before the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileages to set up a register of financial and other interests of Members of the Dáil.  For some reason this proposal has not been dealt with to date.  The Minister for Finance came into the House last night and stated expansively that these are matters entirely for the House to decide, a responsibility given to this House by the Constitution.  One must ask then when the proposal which has beeen before the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="257" /> Privileges for over two years will be dealt with.  Will it be dealt with next year or in the lifetime of the next Dáil, or, in the next Dáil session?  Is it the case that those who hold public office find that receiving gifts is a long standing tradition?  If that tradition brings into question the advisability of those in office receiving expensive gifts from either other foreign governments or business interests, and create an atmosphere of being bought for political favours given in return, at least, the system should be reformed to protect honest and hardworking office holders.  I would like to mention the instance of the famous gifts given to the Taoiseach, to his wife and to certain members of the Cabinet in 1983 by a Saudi prince at an official function in Iveagh House.  Whatever about the gift-giving tradition as such, we cannot allow an impression to be created that favours are bestowed by the Government of the day in return for very expensive gifts.  I have no doubt that, for instance, the dagger and some other items, will find their way into our museums eventually.  The Taoiseach is on record as saying that in due course the dagger will find its way into proper custodial care and will be well and truly looked after.</P>

      <P>In other countries the political leaders have seen it as a wise move to limit and regulate the gift-giving tradition. In the USA, for example, all official gifts which are valued at over $140 cannot become the property of the President of the United States.  In fact, the US operates a system of whisking away all gifts to be catalogued and valued.  Each year, they publish for all to see in the official Federal register, a list of gifts received.  Why can such a small country as the Republic of Ireland not follow this example?  I recall the case of a senior American official who, on returning from Japan, brought home a gift of a small wrist watch and being sacked for having had the audacity not to <Col N="258" /> declare the gift.  Equally in the United Kingdom they have very strict rules for gifts given to the Prime Minister and Government Ministers.  They place a monetary value of £50 on gifts which are given to the Prime Minister or to Government Ministers and which they may keep.  When the gift is in excess of £50 in value it becomes the property of the Office and not of the person.  There is a subtle and important difference between the gift to the person and the gift to the Office.  I ask sincerely why we cannot have such a system?</P>
      <P>Needless to say, The Workers' Party will be supporting this Bill.  There are very important reasons the Bill should be supported, not least of which is that, for example, listeners to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, following the last election were stunned one morning to hear the usually mild mannered Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan completely lose his cool when an interviewer asked him the kind of simple straightforward question that nobody should be embarrassed to answer, least of all Government Ministers.  The question posed was: &ldquo;Does Tony Ryan contribute to Fianna Fáil?&rdquo;  If we had the type of register we are seeking that information would have been readily available.  If there was accountability and if £1,000 gifts which were being received were recorded then there would be no need for any Minister to be embarrassed, to lose his head and subsequently go on to kick up such a stink that almost cost a man his job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not mention the RTE interviewer.  The question was in the context of the very favourable arrangements that the Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, made to keep Ryanair in business. The irony of this row &mdash; which started off as being a simple question &mdash; was that <Col N="259" /> within 24 hours Guinness Peat Aviation issued a statement confirming that they did, in fact, contribute to Fianna Fáil, and to three other parties in this House. Why was the Minister so agitated?  If the proposed Bill had been enacted there would have been no need for the Minister to become excited at such a straightforward question because the record would have shown that Guinness Peat Aviation, through their boss, had made contributions.  That person is not the only one who makes contributions to political parties and everybody knows that Fianna Fáil are not the only recipient of corporate funding particularly at election time.</P>
      <P>I recall that one of the mining companies in Donegal insisting on The Workers Party receiving money, which was unsolicited, and placed it in an account.  We had a great joy giving the money back to them; we did not accept it.  At that time it came out quite openly that these companies were making contributions to all the political parties &mdash; they had a ball in every court.  When the Minister was asked a straightforward question he got very agitated but he never said whether Dr. Tony Ryan contributed to Deputy Brennan's own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am talking about a contribution from GPA.  If GPA, through one of their board members did not so contribute was it not the straight and simple thing for the Minister to have said so.</P>
      <P>The matter of accountability for financial contributions to the individual politicians, and the amount of money an individual politician is permitted to spend either seeking election or throughout the year is an extremely sensitive and topical issue.  There are international comparisons to show why we should not continue as we are, and why there is every reason to introduce this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Labour Party on the amount of work they put into this Bill <Col N="260" /> and I will support them when the vote is called.  This Bill once and for all will help allay the fears of people that politics is a dirty business.  I would be very encouraged by an indication from the Fianna Fáil Party that they no longer wish to be misunderstood, if that is the case, that they are happy to forget the period when TACA were involved in collecting so much money for the party, and that their links with industry, commerce and trade are purely on a political footing and decisions taken by various Ministers, or by the Government, are not a <i>quid pro quo</i> or political payola for the people who are providing the financial resources to back the party.</P>
    <P>I take great offence and I know Members on this side of the House and all honest politicians take offence, at the slanderous allegations made against politicians. People express their views on politicians in a nasty and throw away manner.  Ministers, TDs, Senators, and all politicians time and time again enforce those fears by their behaviour and by not being open and declaring their interests in land, property or business.  We can no longer continue to behave in this way.  I instanced the case of GPA, but the most dangerous incident of all was the alleged relationship between the Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke, the Broadcasting Bill and those involved with Century Radio.  When one casts one's mind back to the Broadcasting Bill one has to forgive the public who accused us of being semi-corrupt politicians.  If the public see such apparent political preferences for business people who are known to be party members or supporters then we will never be able to hold our heads high.  I ask the Government to accept the principles of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded to us to debate the wider issues relating to the ethics in Government and Public Office Bill.  I compliment Deputy Howlin on bringing it forward. However, I cannot let pass much of what Deputy Burne said in his contribution. Whilst he stated he was not making any slanderous allegations against politicians <Col N="261" /> and that he resented the public at large making cynical and slanderous statements about politicians, he more or less did that by innuendo when he instanced Ministers' performances in their respective portfolios.  He questioned why the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, became so annoyed when asked about funding by GPA.  I could put a similar point to the Deputy, and ask why the leaders of The Workers' Party became annoyed when very substantive and well researched articles were written in the early eighties about covert funding of that party via bank robberies or from a famous incident when millions of forged £5 notes were discovered.  Associations were made in the public media with that party.</P>

      <P>We can all engage in innuendo and make slanderous allegations about how one funds one's political operations but suffice to say that the allegations levelled at The Workers' Party in the public media have never been substantively refuted.  We just had blunt denials and, perhaps with the connivance of certain people in the media, the matter has been conveniently swept under the carpet.  It was not the tabloid press who made these allegations; they were made by journalists for whom I have considerable respect and who at times made allegations against other parties.  They could not be considered to be partisan in their coverage of the proceedings of this House or, indeed, of the political parties of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy should address the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The essence of the Minister's argument in his opening address was that what the Bill was endeavouring to achieve need not necessarily be achieved by statutory basis or by legislative means, that essentially the issues covered by the Bill could be dealt with under the auspices of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and under the rules of the House.  Indeed, some measures in the Bill are already on the agenda of that committee, particularly in relation to the registration of political <Col N="263" /> party funding, the registration of particular interests of Members outside the House, and so on.  The Minister correctly made the point that the Bill is not necessary or appropriate.  There is a certain implication in the Bill that there is widespread corruption going on, or that a tremendous number of gifts is being handed to Ministers, which is leading to corruption.  There is no evidence to substantiate that.  Indeed, Deputy Howlin went to lengths to deny that implication. I agree with what Deputy Roche said last night; I never cease to wonder at the capacity of politicians to constantly beat themselves with a stick.</P>
      <P>There are many other areas of public administration and public life for which one could pose the same arguments that have been heard in relation to the Bill. The public service is one clear example. Any member of the public service can from time to time be compromised in his or her dealings and there can always be conflict of interest and so on.  Why restrict the provisions of the Bill to office holders, to Ministers, the Attorney General or the Taoiseach?  Why should the Bill not apply across the board?  Furthermore, one must bear in mind that although the issue was contained in the programme for Government from 1981-86 and the Labour Party and Fine Gael agreed at that time to bring in such a measure once those parties came into Government they failed to deliver.  The issue was quietly swept under the carpet and was left there without implementation.  What a wonderful conversion there is once those parties are back in Opposition.  For the sake of publicity or whatever Members can start to move Bills of this kind.  However, if they get back into Government such Bills are put to the bottom of the list and never find their way on to the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a code of conduct already in existence for Ministers.  A Government procedure instruction spells out a code of conduct on gifts and conflicts of interest. Ministers are fully aware of their positions and their duties and responsibilities. We live in a democracy, we have a free news media, we have free comment and <Col N="264" /> we have a free Press.  More important, the Dáil is supreme in these matters. Every Minister has to come before the Dáil and has to have the confidence of the Dáil.  Quite distinct from the Government, every Minister must have the individual vote of the Dáil even when first appointed, and subsequently might have to withstand motions of no confidence and so forth.  Every Minister has to have the confidence of the Dáil at all times in the discharge of his or her duties.  That is a very important point.  The electorate have ultimate control of that issue.  Given that we are in a democracy and a free world, the electorate can analyse for themselves, can assess the performance of Ministers and the manner in which they conduct their business, and can vote accordingly at regular intervals in general elections.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is also too cumbersome. Section 2 (2) has already been mentioned.  That section offers and escape route for everything and is the Bill's major weakness.  It excludes any gifts made to an office holder by a personal friend, by a member of the family of that office holder, or by the spouse of the office holder, for purely personal reasons.  Because of that section and many other sections, the Bill cannot be enforced and could never be enforced.</P>
    <P>The Minister also pointed out that the Bill is inappropriate in an EC context. Some EC Ministers might get on much better with each other on a personal basis than they do with other Ministers.  Under section 2 (2) who would determine whether a gift was received because a Minister was a personal friend?  That provision would be very difficult to sort out and enforce.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, one should also understand that in some cultures the giving of gifts is part of establishing relationships with other states, with other Governments, and so on.  It is almost part of the political behaviour of Far Eastern countries in many ways.  Very often that can be frustrating because it means that it takes so long to get things done, but it is part of the culture of those countries.</P>
    <P>The method envisaged by Deputy <Col N="265" /> Howlin in the Bill could be cumbersome &mdash; to bring in a valuer to value the gifts would be rather ridiculous if the value was about £250.  I am not confident that the process works well in the United States.  The United States has its own problems, and Ireland should not look automatically to the United States or to Europe for the solution to every problem and every issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that towards the end of the Minister's speech he brought up the funding of political parties.  That issue was contained in the final paragraph of his speech and generated a considerable degree of public interest.  I agree with the Minister that consideration should be given to the funding of political parties.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that already allowances of a sort are paid to political parties specifically in relation to parliamentary activities.  That provision goes back to 1938 under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, which provided for the payment of annual allowances to the leader of the largest Opposition party and to the leader of the second-largest Opposition party only.  That Act was amended by the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1960, which provided for times when there would be one Opposition party only, two Opposition parties, or three or more Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>The legislation was again amended in 1973 to provide for the payment of an allowance to be leader of the Government party or parties, the allowance to be paid to the leaders of qualified parties only.  A &ldquo;qualified party&rdquo; is one that contested the previous general election as an organised party and had not fewer than seven Members returned at that election. In the present Dáil there is one qualified Government party, Fianna Fáil, and three qualified Opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, and The Workers' Party.  The Progressive Democrats are not a qualified party as they had fewer than seven Members returned at the previous general election.  The allowances were increased by the Oireachtas <Col N="266" /> (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act in line with increases recommended for parliamentarians in report 30 of the review body on the public sector.</P>
    <P>As matters stand now, political parties are being funded in respect of their parliamentary duties: Fianna Fáil receive £118,422, Fine Gael get £169,000 and the Labour Party and The Workers' Party get £95,442.  I make that point to illustrate that already there is a precedent of a sort for funding the activities of political parties.  What the Minister is advocating in many respects is consideration of an expansion of that position on a broad basis of funding political parties <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>There are several difficulties.  People have already asked whether the taxpayer would be satisfied or happy to fund political parties.  The issue is a little broader than that.  It is an issue that transcends that in many respects.  Democracy itself is work funded.  I agree with the concept of funding political parties.</P>
    <P>One of the great deficiencies in our system &mdash; and I have made this point in the Dáil before &mdash; is the lack of secretarial and research backup for individual political parties and for individual parliamentarians. Such provision is nothing short of appalling.  Funding towards that would be very desirable and welcome.  It would have a very beneficial impact on the performance of our parliamentarians. Because our system is so centralised and bureaucratic, the public representative is very often at a disadvantage.  He or she is constantly faced with expert advice from people in the public service or local authorities, be they planners, engineers, or whatever.  Those people are carrying out research full time.  They produce documentation for public representatives. There really is a case to be made for public representatives to have access to independent expertise and research.  At present that depends on the activity and energy capacity of each individual parliamentarian to pursue his or her own research.  Two or three aides who would concentrate on research are needed.  In <Col N="267" /> that way there would be better performances in the Dáil and the public would get better value for money because alternative viewpoints would emerge as against the viewpoints from local authorities or Government Departments.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of transport policy in cities and counties, in many respects councillors, and indeed Dáil Deputies, are at the mercy of planning departments or of a particular school of thought on a given issue.  In third level colleges, universities and so on there are many different views on issues such as transport policy, waste disposal or whatever, and it is important that public representatives have the capacity to gain access to that type of information.  At present, with the help of a secretary, they spend so much time on constituency work, dealing with correspondence and so on, that there is very little time to engage in research. A very strong case could be made for funding political parties and targeting that funding towards research with a view to improving the performance of Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell said last night that funding of political parties should be in proportion to the strength of the parties and the strength of a candidate's first preference vote in the last election.  The only difficulty I would have with that is that in many respects it could be seen as reinforcing the existing political strength in the House.  It would make it very difficult for Independents or new groupings to emerge.  I am speaking against myself and my own party in this respect because obviously we would benefit to the greatest extent under the arrangement mentioned by Deputy Mitchell.  When living in a democracy other parties and groups must have an opportunity to emerge. Some other <i>modus operandi</i> should be developed in relation to funding.  The <i>status quo</i> could be copperfastened forever if party political funding were to relate solely to the achievements of the last general election because issues very and crises emerge.  If we go back over history, political parties have been <Col N="268" /> formed and have developed and grown on the basis of a single issue at a particular time.  Cognisance must be taken of that and whatever system is developed should be flexible enough to accommodate such a scenario.  I took part in a debate recently on the question of glasnost in eastern Europe and whether there would be glasnost in Ireland.  It was respectfully suggested that there would never be glasnost or perestroika in Ireland if the system of funding that people are talking about was brought in.  That is one reservation I would have in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the question of research, but the Bill does not deal with that issue.  It is a matter that should be considered by all political parties.  Deputies who have said that the taxpayer would not be satisfied with this idea have been political point scoring, and it is a rather cheap point to make at this stage.  The Minister's suggestion is worthy of consideration by all parties in the House.  It is important to note the context of his statement.  He was merely opening up an opportunity for debate and not laying down any sacred laws or coming down definitively on one side or the other.  He merely made the point that the issue is not addressed in this Bill and that perhaps it should be addressed on an all-party, non-partisan basis.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on the record that money does not in itself win elections. Underpinning the debate here &mdash; it has not been directly said &mdash; is the idea that if you have money you will be elected, but that is not true.  In my short time in politics I have witnessed people entering into the fray of general elections or local elections and spending a lot of money, sometimes £30,000 or £40,000, but not getting elected and not even making an appreciable impact on the electorate. That is worth bearing in mind.  Irrespective of the number of posters you print, the number of advertisements you take in newspapers or the number of leaflets you produce and distribute, you may not win an election.  The electorate are too wise to be codded in that way. To be elected a candidate must have a <Col N="269" /> certain degree of support in a local community and certain qualities that appeal to the electorate irrespective of how much money or resources they have at their disposal.  The notion is beginning to emerge that if you have plenty of money you will get elected but that is erroneous, and there are plenty of examples around the country which would bear out my point.  That should be borne in mind when debating matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that there could be serious constitutional difficulties with aspects of the Bill, particularly when dealing with the register of Members' interests and so on.  Under Article 15.10 of the Constitution each House of the Oireachtas has the exclusive right to determine its own rules and procedures. Questions concerning Members' private finances seem to be covered by that article. While other matters pertaining to Oireachtas members, such as the electoral system, allowances and so on, are governed by legislation, the basis for such statutory control is explicitly laid down in the Constitution.  By enshrining provisions concerning Members' private interests we would be running the risk of being in breach of the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution.  That is a matter that should be addressed by the Labour Party and by Deputy Howlin in winding up the debate.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the issue which gave rise to the introduction of this Bill, the implication that there is something inherently corrupt in Irish political life. There has been no public demand for this Bill.  I have not received one letter or one phone call from my constituents urging that a Bill of this kind be introduced. The reason it was introduced &mdash; and this has been borne out by some of the speeches we have heard tonight &mdash; was basically to throw more innuendo at the present Government and at certain Ministers, and that is particularly sad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider those issues.  Century Radio were set up as a result of a demand from the electorate for a multiplicity of broadcasting networks. The Deputy does not look at it from that perspective.  The Opposition or the people from the left look at it from one narrow perspective: what is in it for a Minister or a politician.  They do not look at it from a public point of view.  The policy underpinning that legislation was a very popular one with the people, basically to give people a choice in broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respects, at no time did I interrupt Deputy Byrne.  I would respectfully ask him to allow me the courtesy of continuing.  I was making the point that it depends on what perspective you take of the matter.  Many people would consider the air transport legislation as maintaining competition in the airways and that if Ryanair went to the wall we would be back to the old days of Aer Lingus monopoly and high air fares, which would have a detrimental impact on the tourist industry, jobs and so on.  The same applies to broadcasting; there would have been a monopoly despite the fact that the people were way ahead of the Legislature by supporting <Col N="271" /> illegal radio for over ten years.  Eventually, the Legislature caught up with them and legislated for a multiplicity of broadcasting services and giving people choice of access to different news and information gathering.  Of course, other Members of the House did not want to look at it that way, they said the legislation was brought in to feather someone's nest.</P>
      <P>Airlines have been the losers as competition increased, they are losing money.  Deputy Byrne does not represent rural Ireland, The Workers' Party are thin on the ground there which probably illustrates reaction to their views on these issues, and the great fear in rural areas is that regional airports could close or suffer irreparable damage if we do not maintain the Ryanair operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a very strong policy basis underpining that decision but again the allegation was made that somebody's nest was being feathered. However, as I pointed out, money is being lost wholesale in that operation as it is a very expensive business.  Any objective economic analysis will make the point that Ryanair are losing a lot of money and that regional airports are in some difficulty.  This is all in the context of the Government's policy to promote the tourist industry and to create an extra 15,000 jobs per annum in the industry.</P>
      <P>Whose nest has been feathered in the broadcasting area?  It has not proved profitable for many people, it is a great hole down which money has gone.</P>

      <P>Quite a lot of money was lost in the area of private broadcasting and the people who got the licences, with respect, are probably wishing they have never received them and would be delighted if someone could bail them out. There has been very little rational debate in all these areas, it is a question of slanderous allegations.  There has been very little objective analysis of these issues and perhaps Deputy Byrne, in being drawn out on this Bill, is giving his real reasons for supporting it as opposed to those he advanced earlier.  He likes to have a good bash at Fianna Fáil and their Ministers.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister said, there is food for thought in his contribution. The question of funding political parties should be discussed on an all-party and non-partisan basis in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the privilege of making a short contribution on this Bill.  In principle, I am in favour of what the Bill sets out to do and we all understand the reasons for introducing it.  I have reservations about some of the details but more about that later.  We all accept that people in public office should be protected in a number of ways.  First, they need to be protected from themselves in the sense that there is always a tendency for people on the other side &mdash; whatever side that is &mdash; at any time to use information or to imply certain things and, for political purposes, to exploit a situation which may be damaging to the other person.  That will apply as long as politics are politics and as long as we have the adversarial system which, of course, is democracy; we must accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the local authority system there has been a declaration of interests for a number of years which has worked very well.  I can honestly say that in my time, over the last ten or 15 years as a member of a local authority, I have seen that system assiduously applied.  When a discussion arises on a subject in which a <Col N="273" /> contributor may have an interest it is crucial at that point to declare the interest.  There are pros and cons because in one section of the Bill there is a proposal to declare liabilities and debts in excess of £1,000.  I do not know about other Members of the House, but I can assure you &mdash; from my personal knowledge of politicians over the years &mdash; that it would be very difficult to find one who did not have a liability of at least £1,000 in some shape or form.  It may be useful to disclose that information to this House, for example, to local authorities or health boards but it may not be beneficial from the point of view of the politicians concerned or political parties to have that kind of information made public because the fact that a person owns property or a business means that it may be used against him; so too can a liability be used against someone in public office. For example, in the rezoning of land if it becomes publicly known that a person has a financial liability there are people outside the political system who will automatically see it as an opportunity to achieve their own particular objectives.  The pros and cons need to be carefully assessed and weighed up before we opt for one side or the other.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the declaration of interest and the register but, when that information becomes public knowledge, a person attempting to achieve an objective may well use information they got through the system to achieve it having regard to the strength or weaknesses they see in the party or politician at whom they are looking.  I do not want to go into it in too much detail but I have had the doubtful pleasure of discussing with people involved in public life that very possibility, the vulnerability of being liable and having that knowledge made public.  The danger which could then arise is that the public figure might be an usable commodity to the advantage of the unscrupulous person who is totally outside public life.  It is then that the person outside public life can call the tune.  It is a dangerous and difficult situation.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the system in the United States.  I mean no disrespect <Col N="274" /> but I am rather dubious about it.  It is well known that business and politics work hand in glove in the United States.  It has been written and talked about for the last 50 or 60 years and we have read and heard a lot about it.  There are advantages but there are serious disadvantages and on countless occasions we have read about the disadvantages.  The danger is that when you have disclosure to the broad masses outside which perhaps gets into the hands of unscrupulous people, then all sides of the House are left open to attack, not from the people inside but from those outside who may well decide to use information for their own benefit.</P>
    <P>I understand why the declaration of the interests of a family is contained in the Bill because there is something similar in relation to the Companies Bill which was put there for a very good reason.  There may well be difficulties in this area if the spouses of people involved in public life have to declare their interests in private businesses.  I would have no difficulty including such information in a register which would be held by the Clerk of the Dáil or the Clerk of the Seanad, as the case may be.  While I accept that the public are entitled to have access to information, some members of the public may put pressure on the spouses of Members of this House, thereby putting them into a difficult position.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the funding of political parties.  It is timely that we should be addressing this issue.  Some people are in favour of public funding of political parties while others are definitely against it.  Those who say they are against the funding of political parties by the state do so on the basis of the public's reaction to the use of taxpayers' money to fund political parties.  There are various reasons the general public have an aversion to such a proposal.  However, if people want a democratic system they should be prepared to pay for it.  If we want to have a democratic system, then we must ensure the system can be funded legitimately.</P>
    <P>I do not see why political parties should not be funded by the State.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I am not making <Col N="275" /> an allegation, but it is a well known fact that political parties receive donations from people in all walks of life.  People are entitled to make such donations. However, if political parties and democracy have to depend solely on this type of funding, the time may come when a few people who make large contributions could exert a disproportionate amount of influence on a certain political party.  This applies to all parties in the House at any given time.  I am not making an allegation against anyone in the House.</P>
    <P>As time goes on the need can be seen to provide some kind of structure where legitimate political parties can be funded by taxpayers' money, for which they would be accountable.  Political parties cannot continue to rely entirely on funding, for which they have always been grateful, from private individuals, collections, etc., because the demands on political institutions are far greater now than they were ten or 15 years ago and the need to provide a steamlined service for the public is much greater now than it was ten or 15 years ago and vastly greater than it was 25 or 30 years ago. The demands being made on political institutions are growing all the time.  The need to fund political parties is also growing all the time and, despite what the public might say disparagingly from time to time about politicians, unless they can be legitimately funded by the State, then political parties will have to rely more and more on the other type of funding about which allegations have often been made in this House.</P>
    <P>While I am on this point, I should like to say that both individuals and businesses have made contributions to political parties for the very good reason that they recognise the democratic system.  A different system of Government is operated in some other countries and the people there do not have the right to vote in elections, change Governments, or remove them from office.  People in this country have that right and both private individuals and business people recognise that they are part and parcel of the democratic system and that the political system <Col N="276" /> is a natural progression of business, enterprise and life in a country.  For that reason these people have made contributions to political parties in the past and will no doubt continue to do so.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged from time to time &mdash; unfortunately the system leaves itself open to this &mdash; that people who make contributions automatically expect favours.  It is wrong to say that, even on a limited basis.  Just as there has always been abuse of every system, there are always exceptions to the rules.  There will always be people who will try to manipulate others and allegations will be made about people in public office and outside it.  We should not assume that this is the general practice and that every time someone makes a contribution to a political party they automatically expect some kind of recompense by way of planning permission, a Government contract, etc.  It does not always happen that way. People make contributions for no reason other than they agreed with something that was done or said.</P>

      <P>There are positive and negative aspects and once information is made available everyone should be equal.  One cannot equate every argument with the argument about the alleged rich and the poor.  We cannot make a decision on every issue which comes before us on the basis of whether we are on the side of the rich or the poor.  There are other matters which also have to be taken into account.  Questions about wealth or influence are neither here nor there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure many poor people have contributed what they could afford to political parties or systems.  It is as big a sacrifice for the poor to make a contribution to a political party as it is for a wealthy person.  I do not think the issue of whether one is rich or poor arises in this context.  The theory is that if we all get enough information we can destroy each other; we will have so much information on each other that no one will be <Col N="277" /> able to enter public office, say anything or go into business.  If a poor person gets a local authority house someone will suggest that he got it by unfair means. That is not the way the system works and it should never be brought down to that.  I am surprised Deputy Byrne should make such a suggestion.  Deputy Byrne is a fine public figure and he should not resort to such tactics.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill in principle. However, I have some reservations about certain sections for the very reasons I have outlined.  Section 4 of the explanatory memorandum states that &rdquo;... where the Secretary receives notification, either from an office holder directly or from the Committee, of the making of a gift, he shall proceed to ascertain the value of that gift ...&rdquo; It then goes on to refer to valuation, etc.  It continues:</P>
    <P>However, an office holder may agree to pay to the Minister for Finance the amount by which the value of the gift exceeds £200; in those circumstances the Government may refuse to accept the gift and, upon the payment being made, the gift vests in the office holder.</P>
    <P>That section attempts to meet all possible eventualities but it is singularly unsuccessful in dealing with any of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about opportunities which we lost in the area of local government reform in the seventies. I was doing this not in a sterile way but in trying to illustrate that there is a capacity in the local government system, with a little bit of wit and a good deal of political goodwill, to change the system dramatically without necessarily involving any major changes in funding or involving any major changes in the roles played by the various elements in Government.  I was referring to the White Paper of 1972 which dealt with the finances of local government and saying that that White Paper was a fine document but one which, like so many other good documents, got caught up in the maw of political debate, and at the end of the day nothing was done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with chapter 10 and the controversial issue of central Government grants to local government, which is a problem to this day.  We all know that the system of funding local government is less satisfactory than we would have desired it to be, and that inadequate as the funds are which transfer from central to local government, they transfer with so many strings attached that the capacity of any local authority to make creative use of those funds is entirely negated. Although schemes are set up by this <Col N="279" /> House and arrangements are made by the Minister, local authorities have to wait until the money trickles down and have to get involved in administrative arrangements between central and local government which wastes the resources of the State.  The chapter concluded that something needed to be done about grants, that we needed to operate a system of block allocations within which there would be a great deal of freedom for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In section 9 the Minister is equipping himself with powers to devolve functions on the local authorities.  I hope he will provide the finance for that too.</P>
    <P>Alternative taxation systems were considered and it is interesting that the whole issue of poll tax was examined and was ruled out administratively and politically. Local income tax, local sales tax and site valuation ratings were all examined and rejected.  The chapter concluded that the Government were forced inextricably to the conclusion that there is really very little latitude to change the financial structures of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The balance of the White Paper dealt, broadly speaking, with efficiency issues. Some changes were proposed, including a move to programme budgeting in the local authority areas.  We moved at that time to programme budgeting in those areas and I do not know if it was an improvement.  Many members of local authorities would suggest that it was a distinct disimprovement.</P>
    <P>While the 1971 White Paper on reorganisation contained points with which many could quibble, points which I publicly criticised, with the benefit of hindsight I think that White Paper and its companion on finance represented the best shot we have ever had at restructuring local government at a critical period and putting it into a state which would allow us to work for the benefit of the country.  Both documents deserve calm and informed debate.  By and large calm and informed debate is the last thing they received.  There was a characteristic <Col N="280" /> knee-jerk reaction in many local authorities. Councillors of all parties, including our own, were responsible for this. The Opposition parties during the course of the general election campaign, which quickly caught up with the debate, had a destructive field day rejecting every proposal out of hand without proposing suitable alternatives.  This collective irresponsibility condemned local government to two decades in the wilderness.  I do not suggest that there was anything unusual about that.  Unfortunately that is the way politics are fought in this country. When one is in Opposition it is easy to propose everything and to destroy things put forward by Government and when one is in Government it is difficult to understand one's action in Opposition let alone the actions of those who oppose one.</P>
    <P>There was a more thoughtful response from one quarter, the Institute of Public Administration.  The Institute, then at the height of its prestige, looked at the issue of local government reform and what we needed in essence from our local government.  A committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Professor Basil Chubb charged with the task of preparing a response to the White Paper. Major figures in the area of local government, including Tom Barrington, Des Roche, Michael Flannery, then county manager of Wicklow County Council, and Richard Haslan, then county manager in Limerick, and now a lecturer in public administration in Cork, were on that committee.  Many of the people on the committee at that time had played a distinguished part in the evolution of thought on public administration here. The committee's report, while not an official document, represents a major contribution to the debate and its recommendations which I have dubbed elsewhere as being the father of the latest advisory committee report, makes interesting reading.  There is a continuity between the propositions made by that committee and the latest advisory committee report.  The advisory committee report can be traced directly to the Bill before us.  The Bill has roots going a long <Col N="281" /> way back.  The issues that are dealt with in the Bill have been well debated and it is not, as Deputy Bruton suggested here last night, premature to move those issues at this stage into law.</P>
    <P>The local government document issued by that committee opened with one of the best discussions on the general principles of local government to be found anywhere.  These included proposals that the scope of local government should be progressively broadened to cover the widest possible range of public services with a view to decentralising government. Some commentators in this House made the valid point last night and earlier today that in a very small country there is still an extraordinary degree of centralisation, an extraordinary distance between the people and Government.  It is extraordinary that as other states are moving towards decentralisation, towards a better relationship between the state and people, this State has been inextricably locked into a colonial system of public administration which really belongs to a 19th century colonial power. They suggested that one of the major reasons for progressively broadening local government was to afford the opportunity for real decentralisation of government.</P>
    <P>The second argument the committee put forward was that decentralisation would facilitate access to government by the people for information and the redress of grievances.  Every public representative here knows the abnormal pattern of complaint behaviour, where anybody who has a complaint against any public body will seek out councillors, TDs, Senators, town commissioners and so on, and lay the complaint before them. Everybody in this House knows that the arrangements that pertain here are abnormal and that although handling of constituency cases is a fundamental part of any democratic system, it goes to extremes in this case.  Deputies know that the multi-seat constituencies mean that not only does one party compete with another but Deputies of the same party compete with each other for the constituency service task.  We know that this <Col N="282" /> is wasteful, that it wastes the time of the public sector agencies who must, as Deputy Barry Desmond pointed out in this House in a paper he circulated not too many years ago, handle the same issue time and time again from different representatives.  It is also demeaning to the people to have to go and knock on a series of doors to get their rights.</P>
    <P>In 1981 I did an analysis of the case loads of 115 TDs serving in this House. Some of the results were published in the paper &ldquo;The High Cost of Complaining Irish Style&rdquo; and in they were quite shocking. It was my first real introduction to politics.  I was a civil servant, a mere humble academic at the time.  It struck me forcibly time and again as I spoke with Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil backbenchers that public representatives were on a treadmill and many of them had talents which they wanted to use in this House as legislators but they could not do so as they would be judged on their capacity to deliver a letter about housing, a drain or a pothole.  We all know that is the truth.  The reason we have that abnormality is that our system of public administration is centralised and removed from the public.  Ministers of various Governments have made efforts to redress this during the past ten to 15 years but we have a long way to go.  One way of giving the people a proper service and properly representing them is by decentralising Government and pushing functions away from the centre.  We have ready made bodies who can handle those functions and they are the local authorities. As I said, this was suggested as far back as 1982.</P>
    <P>The third reason put forward for being conscious of the need for changes in public administration at local level was citizen participation.  The point has been made already by a number of other Deputies that our local government structure is essentially a Victorian or late 19th century administrative system.  The attitudes which informed public debate in the late 19th century are different from the attitudes which inform public debate in the 20th century.  People want to have their views represented.  This is done on <Col N="283" /> one level in the Dáil and at another in the local authorities but the views of a wide range of voluntary bodies do not find an expression in local authorities.</P>
    <P>I attended a public meeting last night to discuss a proposal that a road be constructed through the Glen of the Downs, an abhorrent proposal.  The meeting was attended by the representatives of various local groups and by people who have a very good track record in journalism and on environmental issues.  The question was asked, why did the local authority not come to talk to them about that matter?  It was pointed out by one person that there is no way that this can be done. Decisions are handed down and local authorities do not encourage participation. As we are all aware, there is a huge network of voluntary organisations, specialists and enthusiastic people with knowledge and experience, yet the system does not encourage participation in the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>The fourth point made was it would enhance the capability and performance of local government as a force for economic, social, environmental and cultural development.  Those words were written in 1971 and they are as crisp, as clear and as relevant today as they were when they were first put on paper.  The document went on to argue that &ldquo;present day conditions demand not fewer and larger authorities but representative authorities&rdquo;.  The Minister is arming himself with the power to transfer functions to the local authorities and to broaden the range of local authorities not to narrow it. I take issue with Deputy Yates who made reference to a secret agenda.  He may know something that I do not but I do not see a secret agenda in this.</P>
    <P>A three tier system was suggested with an apparatus for decision-making at regional, county and district level.  Such a proposal is also made in this Bill.  It has been proposed that we take the first step to create a relevant system of local government which would take us through the rest of this century and on into the 21st century.  The Minister's proposals are in line with what was proposed in the document, <i>More Local Government.</i><Col N="284" /> It proposed a new system which should make provision for associating nominees of voluntary bodies with electoral bodies at one level of authority.  This is not yet visible in the Minister's proposals but I suggest it could be achieved very easily under the structures he has proposed.</P>
    <P>The document went on to suggest that the system should be devised with a view to aiming at a uniform delivery of services and flexibility.  Finally, it argued that in the new local government system strong emphasis should be laid on local autonomy, on a partnership between local authorities and central Departments rather than on domiance of local authorities by central Departments.  If we examine section 9 of the Bill we will see that the Minister has proposed a provision which will allow us to do precisely that.</P>
    <P>Having set out the principles, the report went on to examine, once again, the structure and operations of the system.  A three tier structure, with a fourth element, community involvement, was one of the major proposals of the document.  It is a great tragedy that that proposal was never discussed and that the document has been on the shelf gathering dust for 20 years.  It was proposed that at community level there should be community councils representing voluntary organisations and the people at large and that these bodies would not be formal statutory decision-making bodies. However, they would play an important role in communications between the people and the statutory agencies.  It was also suggested that they be allowed to nominate a member to the district councils, the district councils being the first sub-county level of statutory local government.</P>
    <P>I have seen something akin to this operating in Austria.  The city of Vienna has city, State and district governments with some unpronounceable German titles and provision has been made for local involvement.  For example, planning matters are first discussed at this level and ideas can be thrashed out before the formal decision-making process is entered into.  People there feel that they <Col N="285" /> have an input in those things which affect them.</P>
    <P>I could give two extraordinary examples in my own constituency to highlight the need for public involvement.  A proposal to locate a factory in the village of Kilcoole was misunderstood.</P>
    <P>The statutory agencies did not explain to the local community what they had in mind.  As far back as November 1989, I asked both the council and the Industrial Development Authority to explain what they had in mind to the local community who feared that they would have another chemical plant on their doorstep which would present them with problems.  Out of this debate and misunderstanding litigation followed and, ultimately, the factory was lost without a rational debate having been held or the people of the village having been treated like mature adults with a capacity to sit down and understand complex matters and see them through.  There was a breakdown in communications, not on the part of the people, who had a right to defend their interests, but rather on the part of the statutory agencies and the proposers.</P>
    <P>Another problem has arisen with regard to the proposal to locate an interpretative centre and a visitor's centre at Luggala.  The people of Roundwood were not consulted.  However, the Office of Public Works do not have a mechanism to consult with people but they are going to have to learn to evolve such mechanisms.  If we had accepted what was proposed in the document, <i>More Local Government,</i> in 1971 we would not now be facing these problems but rather would have a clear set of communication channels between the public and the decision-making bodies.</P>
    <P>The document also suggested that the first level of statutory formal decision-making bodies should be district councils which would correspond roughly with the existing county electoral areas.  Typically, these would be centred in towns and would cover not just the town but the town hinterland.  Perhaps this is what Deputy Yates was referring to when he questioned the delay in holding urban elections.  I am not sure if his fear has any <Col N="286" /> basis but I would make the point that we need to review the boundaries of urban authorities.  As we are all aware, towns, in particular those on the east coast, have grown very dramatically in recent times. Deputy Yates instanced the case of the town of Bray which, thankfully, is booming and expanding and very rapidly. However, there are many attendant problems and part of its hinterland is neither in the town nor the county.  Something needs to be done about towns like Bray.  The relationship between the town hinterland and the town needs to be represented better in local government.</P>
    <P>Had we taken the idea of district councils based on the existing urban councils and built on it in 1971, we would have resolved many of the problems that towns, particularly in the greater Dublin area, have had in the last ten years of growth and development.  Membership of these district councils would be made up in the majority of cases by members elected through the ordinary local government process, as I have mentioned. In the position that was first put forward there was also a suggestion that district councils who were below the statutory level would be able to nominate members.  Would that not be sensible for us at least to consider now?</P>
    <P>Under the proposals county councils were to retain their central position and the report recommended that no substantial changes should be made in the status or functions of the county councils, including county borough corporations. County councils would remain the planning and executing authorities for the major local government services for housing, roads, sanitary services and so on.  The document went on to suggest that county councils would in time become the administrative centres for a broad range of public services and a system of committees on the analogy of a VEC or county committee of agriculture would provide a linkage between the services. An executive board comprising the county manager and county officers of the services concerned would attend meetings of the county council and the county manager would be given general <Col N="287" /> responsibility for the co-ordination of the public services in his area.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill contains miscellaneous provisions.  Somebody indicated tonight a mistrust of the concept of special committees and joint committees. The concept of special committees and joint committees need not be negative. It can be used as was proposed in the document <i>More Local Government.</i> It can be used progressively to improve the delivery of services, to create a more efficient and more effective local government. That is surely what we all want to achieve.</P>
    <P>Above the county level the committee envisage a third level of local government, the regional authorities.  Here the report recommended that formal statutory recognition be accorded to the regional pattern which has emerged from the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  This would mean giving statutory authority, powers and duties to the regional development organisations as a necessary step towards establishing regional centres for four categories of essential functions (a) strategic major planning, (b) economic development, (c) co-ordination of public service generally and (d) provision of certain services.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing in this Bill a framework in which regional development organisations can be recreated with a statutory purpose and a statutory function. We all know that the RDOs which were set up in the sixties played a very positive role but that ultimately, because successive Governments in which all parties in this House have participated failed to give them a statutory basis, they withered away and became little more than talking shops.  They had no statutory functions.  They could not recruit their own staff.  They could not decide their own budgets.  They were dependent on the charity of the donating councils.  They were dependent very much on the enthusiasm of the members, and no matter how much enthusiasm they could muster, after 20 years of sticking it out in the wilderness, the enthusiasm was on the wane, the RDOs withered away and <Col N="288" /> now they are gone.  Abolishing the RDOs letting them slip was a mistake.  The mistake was not letting them slip; it was in not increasing them, not building on them, not giving them a statutory basis. That argument had been around for 20 years, and I am pleased beyond my capacity to express it, that the Minister in this Bill has taken powers to create new RDOs on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>On the structural side, the report recommended special arrangements for the Dublin area which are not unlike the proposals in this Bill.  It suggested that the district county regional structure would accommodate the needs of the county boroughs and the Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>On the operation side, the report was critical in the extreme of the system of control of local government by central Government.  I mentioned that one of the members of the Radcliffe-Maud Committee when preparing the great report on local government reorganisation in Britain in the sixties visited Ireland and found that beyond a doubt the Irish system of local government was the most restrained, restricted and controlled system of local government in the world. In a document I have which looks at the control mechanisms which are available on an administrative basis through the statutory agencies in this State, the one thing that is dramatic and jumps off the page is that since the State was founded we have used every bit of administrative ingenuity at central Government level to expand the control mechanisms on local government.</P>
    <P>We give hundreds of millions of pounds to State-sponsored bodies.  We are quite prepared to hand out millions of pounds to voluntary agencies.  Last week we had a debate here on Cheeverstown House; we handed out £20 million to a private charity.  We have nothing like the levels of controls on those agencies, charities, private operations, State bodies, that we operate on local authorities.  It is extraordinary that we have established a rigorous, wide scale system of checks and controls on local government which has its roots in the 19th century.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> Many of the central controlling attitudes which pertain in the central Government departments to local government are throw-backs to former age.  The attitudes really are the folk memory in the Custom House of the 19th century.  They went in with bricks and mortar.  There is a centralist attitude there &mdash;<i>aprés moi le deluge;</i> after me the deluge; that is the attitude central Government administrative bodies take to local government.  We are not prepared to give 5p to a local authority without some string attached to it.  Not only is that fundamentally stupid because it prevents people who might be able to do something relevant to local needs do it but it is fundamentally stupid because all the controls that go with those strings cost money.</P>
    <P>Local engineers do work which is then inspected by engineers from the Department of the Environment, and even though a plan has been discussed at local level, it has to be discussed yet again by administrators in the Department of the Environment, then it crosses over to the place where all wisdom resides, the Department of Finance.  Somebody who could not find the location of the project on a map says, &ldquo;gilly-gilly&rdquo; and it is then put in train.</P>
    <P>Consider a VEC building a school. Take the 12 or 13 different steps they have to go through with the Department of Education.  That adds not just tens of thousands of pounds but, over the years, millions of pounds to the cost of projects does not improve the projects one whit. This structure was based on 19th century attitudes and it exists to this day.</P>
    <P>The document <i>More Local Government</i> saw the control system as having four fundamental and pernicious ingredients. The first is a large, very detailed corpus of law on the Constitution, powers, duties, finance, staff etc., of the local authorities; second, detailed financial controls which seem to have no relevance to the 20th century; third, administrative controls which have even less relevance and, finally, controls by courts and by quasi-judicial bodies.</P>
    <P>The consolidation of existing law was <Col N="290" /> proposed in 1971.  Much of the existing body of law was seen as expendable.  It was suggested in the document that the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine in particular be swept away and replaced by a comprehensive enabling statute empowering the local authorities to act in wide terms.  That is precisely what the Minister, Deputy Flynn, is proposing in this Bill.  It is the first time I have seen the concept of <i>ultra vires</i> mentioned in a statute before this House, it is the first time I have ever heard anybody giving legal expression to the necessity to abolish the concept of <i>ultra vires</i> and restating in a positive way the fundamental powers of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The document suggests that financial and administrative controls should be liberalised. In general, the report recommends that the relationship between central Government and local government should be one of partnership rather than the relationship between controller and the controlled.  Anybody reading the report of the Advisory Committee on Local Government Reorganisation and Reform which was produced in December 1990 and released in March 1991 will be struck by its close relationship with the document <i>More Local Government.</i> Anybody who takes the Bill we are examining today and then goes back to the advisory committee report and then puts the two side by side with <i>More Local Government</i> will see that for the first time we are moving in the direction that the specialist committee of the IPA suggested in 1971.</P>
    <P>Through 1972 and 1973 politics displaced reform, expediency dethroned logic.  The White Papers presented an ideal opportunity to political parties to pillory the Government.  I am not saying that had we been in Opposition we would have been any better.  That is the reality. We all score points off each other and the good things which should be done are left undone.  The 1973 general election called a halt to the reform movement. The new Government realised as well as everybody else the plight into which local government was sliding, but they were <Col N="291" /> trapped in a sense by their own rhetoric of a few months earlier and that rhetoric rendered them paralysed.  I remember this well because I was then an official in the Department of Finance.  Honest efforts were made to work out how to extricate ourselves from this mess.  Many valid solutions had already been rejected. U-turns could not be done and those solutions could not be represented.  A rather pathetic little document was produced by the then Minister for Local Government in 1973 which rejected the proposals put forward in the White Paper, as the Government were quite entitled to do.  It ignored the recommendation in the IPA report which I regard as less sensible and put nothing effective in place of all these recommendations.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition Government of 1973-77 took office the ball was at their feet in regard to local government reform and they kicked the ball to touch.  Increasingly during that period the crisis in local government mounted and displaced concern for the structural side of the problem. The obvious thing was to implement at least some of the proposals in the 1972 White Paper or bring in some of the proposals put forward in the five excellent reports which had been produced by the interdepartmental committee on local government finance and taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government instead got involved in tinkering with local finances.  First they made an honest effort to address some of the problems.  They introduced the housing subsidy paid to local authorities to help tackle the problem of growing rents.  Then they became involved in the systematic removal of health charges from the local rates.  These were at best stop gap measures.  The Government of the day were obviously not armed with prescience and could not possibly know we were entering a priod of hyper inflation which would particularly affect local government.  Local government is more sensitive to inflation than virtually any other activity in the State because of the high labour content of services.</P>
    <P>Aware of the growing storm, the Government commissioned the ESRI to produce yet another report.  That report, <Col N="292" /> the Copeland Walsh report, returned to very familiar ground.  The problems in the valuation system of local finance were outlined, the impact of remissions and exemptions was addressed and yet another rating system in the reform mode emerged as the recommended system for local finance, with a nod in the direction of the possibility at some stage of a local income tax.</P>
    <P>The Government were now in a corner.  In September 1976 the Cabinet took a momentous step and decided that the rates would have to go; they would be phased out over a number of years. The decision to abolish rates is interesting because it is inextricably linked with the concept of local government reform.  The popular conception is that the decision emerged from the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1977.  This is not true.  The idea had been around for some time.  I understand it was publicly discussed for the first time as far back as 1973 when the late Deputy George Colley suggested in an RTE programme that since the rates could not be reformed they would have to go.</P>
    <P>By the 1977 general election the three major parties were agreed that the rates were to go.  The only difference related to how soon.  Early in 1977 the Government took the first step and started to shift the burden of domestic rates from the householder to the shoulders of the Minister for Finance, the Exchequer and ultimately the taxpayer.  I say this in no recriminatory sense.  I want to establish with clarity once and for all that if abolishing the rates was a fallacy and a fundamental error, it was a fundamental error into which we all walked with our eyes wide open.</P>
    <P>The next major step in local government was the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, which transferred the burden of rates from councils to the Minister for Finance and, in effect, to the general taxpayer.  This Act introduced in sections 10 and 11 additional swinging controls on local government.  The provisions put into effect with a striking vengeance the philosophy that he who pays the piper calls <Col N="293" /> the tune.  The Taoiseach of the day, Jack Lynch, said that ultimately if the central Government taxpayer is to pay for local government services the central Government taxpayer will have to call the tune.</P>
    <P>By 1978 when the domestic rates were abolished the bulk of local authorities were heading into a financial abyss.  The 1978 provisions merely helped them on their way.  It is not that there is anything truly unique about the concept of central Government transferring resuorces to local government.  We have an idea that because the Department of Finance <i>via</i> the Department of the Environment fund the operation of local authorities the Department of Finance should control each and every action of the local authorities. That does not necessarily follow. Fund transfer from central Government to local government without strings works well in The Netherlands.  The problem here is that there is such a dearth of resources available to the Exchequer that it could never painlessly transfer to local government the level of resources which cash hungry authorities demanded, particularly when the pleasurable decision to spend at local government level was being removed from the uncomfortable reality of having to raise the cash to fund the spending.</P>
    <P>Extremly high levels of inflation and escalating local costs meant that in the early eighties the parties in Government found reform of local finances back on the agenda with a vengeance.  The imposition of service charges introduced originally by Labour as a management function became the next &ldquo;band aid&rdquo; to be applied to the major wound.  Introduced, I think, by Deputy Spring and brought into effect by Deputy Kavanagh, service charges were said at the time to be an interim arrangement.  Those of us with a sense of history will recall that income tax was introduced on this island as an interm arrangement.  It was introduced here and throughout the rest of the United Kingdom as a temporary expedient to fund the Napoleonic wars.  Somebody forgot to tell Revenue.</P>
    <P>Having introduced service charges, the Government commissioned the NESC to <Col N="294" /> produce another report on the financing of local government.  The report proposed a series of actions which were not unlike those already proposed in the Copeland Walsh Report.  In 1985 the Coalition Government of Deputy FitzGerald also went on to produce their own rather sad little document, a policy statement on the reform of local government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true and I am not dealing with the history of local government, I am dealing with the history of local government reform and I am dealing specifically with the tragic failure of successive Governments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I would like the Deputy to come to the Bill, please.  The details can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  As I said, there was a further report, the details of which I will not deal with, NESC report No. 80.  That report came to the same conclusions as had been reached by previous reports.  The Government of the day now had before them two separate sets of propositions, one dealing with finance and one dealing with reform, but they took no action.  This brings us up to the period which led to the production of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current set of proposals as I have <Col N="295" /> sought to illustrate are not, as they have been portrayed, something which has been parachuted on this House without consideration.  Each and every aspect of the Bill before us has been considered time and time again for the last 30 years. Thirty long years of discussion has gone into the issue of local government reform and has brought us to our present position regarding local government reform. Criticisms, therefore, that the current proposals are precipitous are perverse in many ways.  In particular, they are perverse when they are uttered by the Leader of the Opposition.  Fine Gael not only failed to make progress in the reform area when they were in power but they also refused to contribute to the preparation of the current proposals.  Deputy Spring, quite rightly, drew the Taoiseach's attention to the issue yesterday that it was not other Opposition parties who refused to participate in the process, it was only the major Opposition party that refused to participate in it.  The point I have been making when we dealt with the long history of local government reform documents and the failure to implement those local government reform documents was a simple one, and it is this: if local government reform is to continue to be a political football we will make no progress, we will go nowhere, we will involve ourselves in circulatory discussions and we will go around in ever-decreasing circles and we know what happens then.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Local Government Bill, 1991, have two major sources. At a political level a Cabinet committee worked on this issue from April 1990 when it became obvious that there would not be the capacity for an all-party approach to the issue.  This committee was assisted by an expert advisory committee chaired by Dr. Tom Barrington. Dr. Barrington has been the doyen of academic research in public administration in this country for many years. The most progressive documents produced on local government have been produced under his hand.  The document I will refer to <i>More Local Government</i><Col N="296" /> was produced with Dr. Barrington as a leading force.  Therefore there is a continuity in the thinking we have before us, and it is not just inaccurate but perverse to suggest that the ideas in this Bill have been conjured out of thin air.  They are the result of a long period of discussion.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, therefore, well based.  It deals with the functions of local authorities in Part II; it deals with the elections of local authorities in Part III, the reorganisation of Dublin in Part IV; the issue of boundaries in Part V; the committees issue &mdash; which I have already mentioned &mdash; in Part VI; and a variety of miscellaneous functions, most notably regional authorities, changes in the management system and changes in the planning and development area, in Part VII. The suggestions made by some Opposition speakers that the Bill is in some way dangerous, that it gives greater power to the Minister or that it in some way compromises the democratic nature of local government only serve to show how seriously out of touch with reality some of the leading Opposition spokespersons are.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with certain aspects of the Bill and, in deference to the ruling of the Chair, I will leave specific details to Committee Stage.  The functions of local authorities are dealt with in a global way in Part II.  Sections 5 and 6 represent a permissive extension of the functions of local authorities.  Section 6 is particularly welcome in that it extends a general competence to the local authorities.  The importance of this section is that it provides the first major statutory diminution of the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine.  I would like to dwell very briefly on the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine.  This doctrine springs out of the very nature of local government.  Somebody here commented in the last two days that one of the fundamental problems that local government has in Ireland is that it has no constitutional base; it is the creature of statute, the toy always of Government.</P>
    <P>It was suggested, a long time back, that something we could consider doing was giving, in one of the many referenda we have held, a statutory basis to local <Col N="297" /> government that view is also proposed in the advisory committee's report. Section 6 is of particular interest to anybody who is a student of local government systems.  The concept of <i>ultra vires</i> operates as a dead hand on the creativity of local government.  In fact, this section fulfils an undertaking which was given as far back as 1971 to relax the stranglehold of the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine.  Because local government has no constitutional basis in Ireland, they are creatures of statute. Under the <i>ultra vires</i> concept a local authority may not do anything unless it has specific legal authority.  I am aware that the doctrine has been softened up somewhat in recent years, that it does not operate to the letter but it operates close enough.  There have been some relaxations over the years and something akin to the provisions of section 8, where local authorities can undertake activities which flow from existing powers or which are ancillary to statutory functions, has pertained; nonetheless, the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine, until the time this Bill is enacted, applies.  Even with the more liberal interpretation, a local authority has to be very conscious of the limits imposed by the law.  Going beyond those limits, even for the common good, not only leaves the local authority open to an injunction but it also means that the officials and the elected councillors of the local authority involved run the risk of surcharge by the auditor.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me understand why anybody would see anything pernicious or potentially dangerous or seek to portray this section as being anything but welcome.  Yet I sat here for the two days and I have listened to people who know better raising the hare that this is in some way dangerous.</P>
    <P>Section 7 also has been portrayed as a brake on the freedom of the authorities. However, when you examine section 7 it will be seen as a reasonable and rational provision aimed at ensuring that a local authority does not make a decision to abandon one statutory function in the pursuit of other functions.  This has not happened here in Ireland but it has happened with local authorities elsewhere <Col N="298" /> that they have unilaterally decided to downplay their involvement in one functional area &mdash; something unattractive &mdash; and to get themselves involved in spending the resources of the local authority in other functional areas which are more order-of-the-day or have a little more PR to them.  Section 7 is no more than a prudent suggestion that if we do release the strings there is at least there in law the capacity to make sure that specific functional areas are not overlooked.</P>
    <P>Let us look at a particular functional area that could be overlooked, for example, the issue of housing repairs or maintenance.  This is a thorny issue in every local authority in Ireland.  It is also an issue which local authorities could decide, for whatever reason, to downplay while they are doing something else with their scarce resources.  If that were to happen it would be right and prudent that a mechanism should exist to put them back into balance.</P>
    <P>Again, for some incomprehensible reason section 9 has been attacked.  That is a very progressive section.  It provides for the devolution of functions by Ministers and in effect gives to Ministers the right to surrender functions to local government.  In the 1971 White Paper, in the 1972 document <i>More Local Government,</i> and in the 1985 policy statement of Government as well as in many other publications, the idea of Ministers transferring powers and functions to local authorities has been discussed and Ministers were urged to take steps in that regard.  For the first time we have made a statutory provision that will allow that to happen but, perversely, people are coming into this House and criticising that provision.  This section, which has been criticised by some Members, for goodness knows what reason, is aimed at providing the mechanism for the transfer of functions.  There is no secret agenda behind this section.  It is a very sensible section and will be used well.  If it is not used well, Members from the other parties in this House, if the Members of this party do not do so, will bring it to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill tightens up electoral <Col N="299" /> law.  The only controversial element in this part is that it has been suggested that there is something sinister in the section particularly about the proposition to postpone the urban elections.  There are good reasons on this occasion for postponing them.  The future geographical cover of councils operating at sub-county level has never been examined.  There have been discussions but there have been no examinations.  As I have said, many towns go beyond their geographical area so that the proper representation of the population of the hinterlands and the relationship between the towns and their hinterlands need to be considered.  The advisory committee's report is excellent. If people have not paid attention to it, they should start doing so now.  It offers two alternative views of the sub-county authorities of the future and those alternatives at a very minimum deserve examination.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the Dublin area.  It provides for a rational structure in statute and I am not sure there were many serious points put forward in opposition to this part of the Bill.  Part V deals with the issue of a boundary commission. I would have thought there would have been a general welcome for the proposals being put forward by the Minister but again I am at a loss to understand how anybody can portray the Minister's surrender of the statutory powers he currently has regarding the boundaries of local authorities as anything other than a positive step.  The Minister has decided in his generosity to surrender powers which have vested in the central authority since the 1898 Act.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with the issue of joint committees and committees of local authorities. Again it is hard to understand the opposition that has been raised to this section which provides that specialist committees and joint committees can be set up.  Members of these committees can, among other things, draw expenses for their attendances and what in the name of goodness is wrong with that? Why do Members suggest this is a sinister and manipulative item, an item for a <Col N="300" /> secret agenda?  It is clear and simple.  If somebody sees something wrong with it let him say so and not beat around the bush.</P>

      <P>I have one point to make on Part VII.  This part has been welcomed in detail by many of the Members who contributed to the debate.  The controversial use of section 4 of the 1955 Act in planning cases has been widely discussed and was certainly widely discussed here today.  I for one believe that on each and every occasion that councillors have to resort to the use of section 4 on a planning issue, it is an admission of failure.  I welcome the introduction of more stringent measures to govern the use of section 4.  Section 4 was never intended to be used in the planning process, but was intended to give back some democratic element of control to the elected representatives.  It emerged, as did the 1955 Act, after 15 years of debate on the balance of power between the local authority's members and the manager. I welcome the decision that is implicit in what the Minister is doing here to curb the use of section 4 because, as I have said, in so far as it is used in the planning process, it is almost inevitably an admission of failure.  The Minister also deals with the issue of regional authority. This issue has been around for a long time.  The concept of regional agencies co-ordinating the activities, particularly those activities which go over the county boundaries, is a very good concept and I cannot understand why anybody would find this section of the Bill objectionable in any way.  This, together with the remaining elements in Part VII of the Bill are progressive, forward thinking and developmental oriented.  It is good and should recommend itself to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very much in the nature of politics that we all get involved from time to time in shadow boxing.  From time to time we <Col N="301" /> all get involved in hurling abuse, not too barbed, across the House.  The Local Government Bill, 1991, is very progressive; it has been brought before us by a very progressive Minister.  It is a good Bill and there is a great deal in it which commends itself to logic and to anybody who is interested in local government.  I suggest, but perhaps I may be out of order in so doing, that it would be far better for the spokesperson from the benches opposite to be a little less hypercritical of the Bill and a little more constructive, and to look on the Bill as the foundation of the local government system of the 21st century.  They should use their talents and experience and their tremendous individual capacity to improve what is already an excellent piece of legislation instead of scoring points and trying to destroy the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly commend the Local Government Bill, 1991, to the House and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Padraig Flynn, on bringing it forward.  It is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, like myself, has sat here for four hours but it is a pity he has just left because I wished to pay a personal tribute to him.  I wish to pay tribute to him for the way he has handled the public representatives who have been called on to visit him in the course of their duties as legislators and performing the role of public representatives. I want to put on record&mdash; and I hope the Minister of State will read it &mdash; that I appreciate the way he always listens to the case being made by the public representative.  Indeed one gets positive results when one has the opportunity to sit down and discuss a problem with him.  The Minister's understanding of the role of public representatives comes from his many years membership of a local authority before he was elected to the Dáil.  The Minister benefited from the experience he gained when serving on a local authority in his constituency. Indeed, I had the pleasure in the past week of proposing that he be formally invited to Tipperary Urban Council to open a major scheme of refurbishment <Col N="302" /> for which the Department were responsible. The scheme was one of the best approved by the Government or their predecessors.  One of the Minister's colleagues in Government some years ago sanctioned low-cost housing throughout the country but when he realised that an error was made public funding was invested to bring the houses up to a proper standard.  The fact that that was done should be appreciated.  That is an example of what local authorities, or urban district councils, can do with a little financial assistance from the Department.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill was controversial. First, when the Minister published it he announced that it contained very important and major reorganisation of local government.  Yesterday the Taoiseach explained the curtailment of the debate by saying that sufficient time had been given for the debate because the Bill was not very important; it was straightforward legislation that could be debated in a couple of hours on an afternoon either before or after Private Members' Business.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Roche for his well researched speech.  He did take some time to deliver it, but it was well researched.  The Deputy dwelt on the history of local government reorganisation and reform, which I would not attempt to do.  It was appropriate to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>However, many of the improvements the Deputy said were identified by various local government experts as being necessary will not be found in the Bill.  I have read the Bill in detail since I received it on Monday and studied the explanatory memorandum which I did not receive until lunchtime on Tuesday. I have tried to interpret what the Minister was about in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt for one minute that there is a need for local government reform.  As a matter of fact, I have advocated and fought for it.  Governments of all hues have failed to address the issue. The Minister had a golden opportunity to introduce reforms.  Local elections were postponed last year for the purpose of <Col N="303" /> allowing the Minister, his departmental officials, the Department of Finance and all the special committees, to examine the matter.  One all-party committee failed to get off the ground, through no fault of the Labour Party.  However, there were other committees of experts and a committee of Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  If anybody knows anything about how local authorities function, backbenchers of all parties do.  We were reared in them.  We came from them and we are proud of that.  That is why the Minister will find most of our names on the ballot papers for local authority elections, whether they are elections for county councils, urban councils, corporations, or town commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not address the problems we have all identified.  I have been a member of the Tipperary South Riding local authority since 1967 &mdash; 24 years &mdash; and up to the present I never found anything wrong with the structures or the role of the authority in carrying out my functions as an elected member.  There was co-operation between members and the manager, staff officers and the staff in the various sections, including the housing section.</P>
    <P>The acting chairman has had long experience on local authorities, as I have, and I am sure he will agree that none of us ever had any difficulty representing the people who elected us or in delivering a service until we confronted the problem of finance.  That problem is not addressed in the Bill.  The Government took back to themselves the power to determine what local authorities can spend and in what areas the funds should be spent. Local authorities are now completely dependent on central funds for most of their work.  That is what is wrong with local authorities; that is what is wrong with local government and that problem has been identified by all politicians.</P>
    <P>People elect us to a body that they realise no longer has the power it had because of the structure of its finance. That arose, as Deputy Roche said, from all-party agreement that domestic rates be abolished.  That was one problem. <Col N="304" /> There was then the 1977 Fianna Fáil promise to abolish car tax and other sources of revenue that were of benefit to local authorities.  That left local authorities drained of any autonomy.  To crown it all there was the infamous court case that decided that agricultural rates not only were to be abolished but were illegal.  Local authorities were left with absolutely no avenue of self financing to determine their own future to plan.  That has left local authorities pauperised to this day and left all of us floundering around at estimates time or when allocating funds at electorate area committee meetings trying to determine how to spend whatever few pounds we get from charges &mdash; which are unpopular and have resulted in some people going to jail &mdash; or from rates on business premises in small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are completely dependent on the Minister for the Environment and his Department, the Department of Finance, and the European Structural Fund, to give the balance for major roadworks, infrastructural development, by-pass work, and all major development in our county.  What is wrong with local authorities is that we cannot raise our own finance.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and we admit it, that people do not want to grasp the nettle of deciding how local authorities should be financed.  I remember the day not so long ago when one could go to a council meeting and put down a resolution on the agenda requesting the council to carry out a particular function in one's area, as prescribed by law, in the knowledge that the local authority had the finances to match that request.  Councillors were able to deliver the services to the people who elected them.  Once that system was removed there began a tinkering with democracy.  Now people request things that local authorities cannot deliver. They are frustrated, we are frustrated, and the Department find that the demands from each local authority grow and grow.</P>
    <P>In spite of the improvements announced by the Minister in response to questions yesterday and in spite of the <Col N="305" /> increased funding coming through from Europe &mdash; the Government still take the credit for that but we do not mind so long as we get the money &mdash; there is very little discretionary money available to local authorities.  If one goes now to a local authority meeting and tables a resolution directing that certain work be carried out one is immediately cautioned by the manager that there are no funds to match that resolution, that if the resolution is carried the work cannot be carried out.  Managers say that members may agree to resolutions proposed and debated but they do not have the funds to carry out the work.  At times, in their kindness managers may say that if the resolution is passed it will be referred to the area roads meeting.  Members know what an area roads meeting is like.  You meet in your own electoral area and literally spend the few pounds you collected by way of water charges or local authority rates on businesses.  This is where reform is neded but it is not forthcoming in this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will point out provisions in the Bill that will permit him to carry out that reform.  There is no evidence that the Coalition partners in this Government are prepared to address the problem of local authority financing.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe in the democracy of local authorities.  We believe in delivering a service at local level and in local representation.  We have published documentation on the functions and roles of local authorities as well as their financing.  The Minister said he has no intention of reintroducing property tax or rates.  If central Government take upon themselves the responsibility of providing the majority of finance to local authorities for the foreseeable future, each county council are entitled to know at the beginning of each year how the allocations are to be made, whether they are to be based on the population in the area, on the value of the pound in terms of rating structure or on the number of national primary routes running through a county?  We have said in our document that we would accept <i>pro rata</i> allocations to local authorities based <Col N="306" /> on any system used by local authorities abroad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche complimented the <i>ultra vires</i> section which will give local authorities, for the first time ever, powers to do certain things.  In Part II, section 6, one of these powers is spelled out.  It states: &ldquo;A local authority may, subject to the provisions of this section, take such measures, engage in such activities or do such things in accordance with law (including the incurring of expenditure) as it considers necessary or desirable to promote the interests of the local community&rdquo;. That is a magnificent section, but to implement it the local authority need money.  The position is the same here as with all legislation.  Even when we change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; making it obligatory on agencies, whether health boards or local authorities, to do certain things, they plead inability to do so because of a lack of funds.</P>
    <P>It is laid down in legislation that dental services be provided in health board areas, but the health boards plead inability to do so because they do not have the funds.  You can legislate for health boards to provide funding for people in nursing homes, as we did and we were delighted to do so, but now the health boards are pleading inability to implement the legisation because they do not have the funds.  What use is section 6 if the funds are not available to implement it?  Section 6 (1) (b) states:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of this section a measure, activity or thing shall be deemed to promote the interests of the local community if it promotes, directly or indirectly, the social, economic, environmental, recreational, cultural, community or general development of the functional area (or any part thereof) of the local authority concerned or of the local community (or any group consisting of members thereof).</P>
    <P>That would be a great provision if the funds were available to implement it, if we had an assurance that the Government, in centralising, as Deputy Roche <Col N="307" /> said, in an almost obscene way, many of the roles and functions of local authorities, would provide the necessary funds.  The local authorities are capable of carrying out these functions but cannot do so because they are restricted in terms of funds.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the Bill.  I will read another section to convince the House of our concern.  Section 3 (7) reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  by order, amend or revoke any order under this Act (other than an order under section 1 (10) but including an order under this subsection), and</P>
    <P>(b)  by direction amend or revoke a direction under this Act ...</P>
    <P>The only order that is excluded from the superior power of the Minister &mdash; by order he has power to wipe out the whole Bill if he likes &mdash; is the one referred to in section 1 (10) which reads: &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as, by order or orders made by the Minister,&rdquo;.  The Minister is excluding an order he makes to bring in the Act but he can by order amend or revoke any other order under the Act.</P>
    <P>This is not legislation that would upset anyone.  A one line Bill would have sufficed. The Minister could have brought in an Act to say he has power to abolish the Act.  It is as simple as that.  The Minister is conferring power onto himself and it will be voted in this House.  Is that democracy?  Regulations would be circulated to Opposition spokespersons and would be brought before the House to ensure that that legislation is effective, but an order may not be brought before the House, it would be lodged in the Library.  That is the power the Minister is taking onto himself.</P>
    <P>This is a high-handed dictatorial section.  I have never seen such a section in legislation where the Minister has the power to wipe out everything with the stroke of a pen.  He can amend or revoke any order once he has made an order to <Col N="308" /> bring in the Bill.  That is an extraordinary power for any Minister in any democracy. I accept that the Executive arm of Government must, and will at all times, act in the best interests of the people.  I am not suggesting that this Minister will use these extraordinary powers, although most Ministers at times attempt to do so; neither am I suggesting that the Minister is immune from temptation.</P>

      <P>I will deal with some of the other areas in the Bill.  Since Christmas I have heard a lot about this Bill and have read the report of the special committee. I felt that this Bill might have dealt with the role of the members and manager and the functional area.  In this Bill the Minister has the power to extend functional areas, to change boundaries and representation within boundaries.  I listened to Deputy Roche who said that areas are getting bigger, which is true, but up to now boundary changes were made as a result of consultation between <Col N="309" /> local authorities and an inner local authority within the area.  For example, Tipperary South Riding came to an agreement with Cashel Urban District Council and with Clonmel Corporation; there was no problem.  I would not object to the Minister having power in this area if two local authorities could not agree to an extension or division of boundaries. However, county councils functioned within existing legislation and did it successfully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with everything except finance.  We advocated the introduction of a land tax because of the abolition of rates, in particular agricultural rates, which were of benefit to the people who paid them.  They had a very good record in regard to payment. The agricultural community are often maligned in various debates regarding what they pay but the system of rates had a 99 per cent collection and payment.  It was a great system because the ratepayer received a service, the minor roads serving him and his neighbours were serviced and the county road structure was also looked after out of the ratepayers' money.  That was important as he felt he had a right to make an input.  The only prople who created problems were the IFA who protested and paraded outside the council chamber on estimates day on the basis that we were spending too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that system was declared unconstitutional we suggested the introduction of a land tax which became law.  Unfortunately, the Fianna Fáil Government promised to abolish it when they returned to office.  I have always advocated a land tax because it allows for a percentage of money to flow to the local authority, <Col N="310" /> which was a welcome measure in that it gave finance back to the local authority. That meant the Government with which our party were involved had, unfortunately, to introduce charges, as they are unpopularly known.  The problem about charges was that they were not developed as a temporary funding system, indeed the Minister has confirmed that the system will continue.  If this is not the case he should say so now before the local elections because in 1985, Fianna Fáil said they were totally opposed to the new system of local charges, that on return to office they would abolish them and repeal the legislation under which they are imposed, namely, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983.  That was their manifesto in 1985 as well as many other things which we might still quote because they are relevant and people want to know, coming up to local authority elections, what they are doing about it.</P>
    <P>Charges were brought in to urban areas only because the urban ratepayer at that time was paying rates.  This did not apply to the commercial urban ratepayer but to the privately rated occupier of houses in urban authorities.  The rates were described as including water and sanitary services, refuse collection and sewerage systems.  It was discovered when they abolished the rates that they were then forced to introduce legislation in 1983 which replaced that funding for essential services.  That was all the then Minister, Deputy Spring, did in 1983, he extended water charges to urban authorities which, up to then, had their fee included in the domestic rates.  County councils, for the 24 years I have been on them, have been charging for water&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies in respect of every party.  There was always a charge because the rating structure was slightly different.  It was on the basis of fair play that they were extended to all users of the service.  When the legislation went through we were concerned and there was a major debate within our own party <Col N="311" /> about it.  We foolishly accepted that the charges would be temporary and that a waiver scheme would operate.  The matter was debated in this House and in the Seanad and we identified the categories which would be exempt. However, later on, managers saw a loophole in the legislation and added a second tier waiver.  They began to identify the income of the category holders and whereas a person living on the dole would normally have been excluded from paying service charges if they had five or six children which brought their income to more than £100 per week, in my constituency that applicant will not get water rates relief.  If they were married but did not have any children on the same income they would be provided with water for a nominal fee of £5.  The application of the waiver scheme is unfair and I ask the Minister to address the problem and lay down guidelines under the legislation by way of amendment or regulations which would remove some of the anomalies in it.</P>
      <P>There is a housing crisis regardless of whether the Government will admit it. I have complimented the Government, their predecessor, the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, on their major programme of refurbishment, which is a credit to them. However, the finance available for local authority housing new starts is totally inadequate for the needs of the country. Something like 30,000 local authority houses are needed by all local authorities, urban, corporation and county council. The Minister has given us sufficient funds this year to build 23 houses in County Tipperary, in the administrative area of South Tipperary County Council.  At present there are about 200 applicants approved with another 150 being processed, 90 per cent of whom will also be approved.  Something like 400 people are in need of a house and we have money to build 27.  In the Tipperary urban area we have hundreds of applications for OPDs and family houses but they are not getting any money to build houses this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> There are problems in the areas of local authorities, legislation and finance. Indeed, there are problems in every area for which the Minister has responsibility. I am concerned that we do not seem to regard this as a crisis.  The Minister published his social housing programme, there are innovative ideas in it which I welcome.  I also welcome the reintroduction of a mortgage subsidy to assist people to leave local authority housing and to purchase private housing.  That system applied before but the Government abolished it because they thought it was a bad system.  They now see it as an incentive for people in local authority houses to buy private houses.  In reading the social housing programme I am worried that there does not seem to be a role for local authorities.  As an example, Clonmel Corporation are not involved in the joint ownership of houses which indicates that there are undercurrents about the future role of these councils.</P>
    <P>I am a member of an urban council but I do not have a problem in relation to the Minister's identification in the Bill about the postponement of any election in an area provided there is a good reason for it.  I would have no objection to the extension of urban councils into urban and district councils, but, I would resent the total abolition of urban councils.  I would resent it very much if Clonmel Corporation, which has a statute going back hundreds of years, was tampered with.  I would have no objection to an increase in their powers or administrative area. However, again, I would object if Cashel Urban Council, an old council which represents a town with the status of city handed down from Irish Royalty, were abolished.  I would also resent the abolition of Carrick-on-Suir Urban Council. If the Minister checks his records he will see that Carrick-on-Suir Urban Council have a record second to none on housing.</P>
    <P>I mention this point because in the social housing programme these councils seem to be excluded by the Minister from participating in some of the innovative proposals in regard to local authorities. This is why I am concerned about the <Col N="313" /> Minister's proposals.  The Minister visited my constituency recently to reassure Fianna Fáil councillors, particularly those on Clonmel Corporation who had threatened to resign if he had plans to abolish their corporation, that he has no such plans.  He also told the Fianna Fáil members of Tipperary Urban Council that he had no plans to abolish that council. When the Minister was asked what plans he had for the councils which would be elected next year he said nothing.  Will they be urban and district councils?  Will Clonmel District Corporation be a rating authority?  Will they have the power to strike a rate and continue to have their present powers in regard to housing?  If I read the housing programme correctly, it says that they will be able to look after burial grounds and sanitary services but they will not have any real powers.  If their powers are to be changed I would welcome an assurance from the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be too specific but the Minister will have power under the Bill to postpone elections in some areas.  Why does he want the power to postpone elections in the case of certain urban and district councils including Clonmel Corporation?  If these councils will have the same powers as they have at present why does he not want them to be elected?  It is because he will give the additional powers and different administrative areas?  Perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to reply to this question. If they do not have a role in the social housing programme, what role will they have?  Obviously county councils will <Col N="314" /> become very powerful bodies.  I would not like district or sub-councils &mdash; I do not know what they will be called &mdash; to think that they are merely talking shops. They should not have to depend on the councils, and their principal function in relation to housing should not be taken away from them, as they are able to identify the housing needs in their areas.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to previous local structures, for example, the county committees of agriculture.  These extraordinarily good bodies prepared the documentation and plans for agricultural development in their local areas. However, in time half the members of these committees were selected and half were elected until eventually they were abolished altogether.  The same happened in the case of the local health committees which were set up under the 1970 Health Act to make recommendations to the health boards.  The necessary legislation to abolish these committees has not yet been introduced.  Therefore some of these committees still meet legally on a formal basis.  The chief executive officers in the various health boards decided that they should be abolished as they had no role.  However they had a role in the promotion of the health needs of the people in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will come clean and tell us his plans for local authorities at district council and corporation level. Otherwise it will be an election issue.  We are all democrats and we should like to know the Minister's plans for these bodies.  The Minister also referred to regional structures.  This was welcomed by Deputy Roche who said that the Minister would be making a major breakthrough by giving statutory powers to regional structures for the first time ever. He referred to SERDO and the marvellous work they had done in representing the councils and engineers.  He                                                                                said that one of the problems with this body was that no Minister had given them statutory powers and they were abolished. The Minister is reintroducing some sort of regional structure which we understand, will have statutory powers.  How <Col N="315" /> will these regional bodies be elected?  Will they be nominated or selected?</P>
    <P>This brings me to the section of the Bill dealing with committees and sub-committees. Like Deputy Yates, I hope the present system, which is an improvement on the system which enabled the larger parties to decide everything in many councils, will enable smaller parties to have a say in the nomination of people to these committees.  The Minister's proposals in this regard are not spelt out sufficiently in the Bill.  Will that proportionality be continued?  I am glad to see the Minister nodding his head.</P>
    <P>I have several reservations about this legislation, many of which relate to the powers of the Minister.  I have tried to identify the areas about which we are concerned.  There are many glaring anomalies in the Bill.  Perhaps it is evolving legislation and it will enable the Minister to make additional changes over the next five or ten years or however long the electorate leave him in office.  I hope that whatever documentation is published by the Government at election time will contain proposals which people can believe. Many people believed the promises given in the last Fianna Fáil manifesto about local authority finances and the abolition of charges.  There are people in jail in Cork today because they believed those promises; they were told that these charges would replace other taxes.  At that time Deputy Bobby Molloy said that Fianna Fáil would restore financial stability to local authorities by repealing that Act.  He also identified other central areas such as unemployment, emigration and the local health services.  Fianna Fáil have not kept any of the promises they made in 1985.  Unfortunately, this makes people suspicious of genuine political parties.  We always try to sell our proposals to the best of our ability but sometimes people's imaginations can be stretched to the limit when some councils have no charges and other councils which have charges put people in jail for non-payment.  This makes one wonder whether there are different rules or different people in different areas.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="316" /> dispel some of these doubts.  Otherwise this legislation will be undemocratic and will give extraordinary powers to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to our concerns about the proposals for Dublin.  Dublin has been identified as an area in need of special attention administratively and electorally.  Dublin is a city with thousands of people living on the periphery in isolated, poorly serviced communities while its centre is marked by dereliction and neglect.  Dublin city has experienced a massive decline in population over the last 12 years.  Many areas are blighted by poverty and unemployment.  When Deputy Tully was a Minister he started the process of urban renewal.  That has continued but there are still tremendous needs in the area.  The city is choking to death with traffic and journey times across the city get longer and longer.  There seems to be disagreement between the Minister and the Minister of State as to how to approach this problem.  I hope they will reconcile their differences and deal with the problems because the fabric of the city is under threat.  Public transport is seriously under-developed and the speed and the amount of traffic in the city makes many housing estates unsafe.</P>
    <P>While the centre of the city is neglected, pressure continues to build for development on the outskirts.  This has led to the section 4 abuses.  There is no political party, except perhaps the Labour Party, who are exempt from blame in relation to section 4 abuses.  We have used section 4 motions occasionally in my constituency correctly in consultation with the management and the planning officer.  Perhaps the Minister has tried to address this in the legislation.  I would not like the powers of local authority members to be eroded but there was an obvious public demand for change in this area.  Let us see how this works on the ground and if the elected people in an area wish to take on the responsibility for suggesting rezoning in areas which are not included in the development plan for the area.</P>
    <P>There is pressure building up for rezoning the green belt between the city and <Col N="317" /> the mountains, around the lakes at Lucan, Swords, Malahide and Portmarnock. The virtual ending of public house building in the city has created a housing crisis for thousands of families and for the homeless.  There is a backlog of refurbishment work in Dublin local authority areas.  In Tipperary we have achieved a good standard in relation to refurbishment work, an example which could be followed in Dublin.  The process of revitalising Dublin must include listening, consultation and harnessing the input of Dubliners.  If we are to make any progress in this area we must learn from past mistakes and rebuild the city so that it enhances rather than hinders people in their daily lives.  Dublin should be a city which meets the needs and aspirations of all its citizens, a city which offers a good life to all.  Dublin should no longer be divided by class or income and public amenity should transcent the anxiety for private profit.  We should have a balance between private and public transport. There should be a democratic Dublin transport authority put in place with a mandate to give priority to public transport. They should be able to plan public transport, traffic management, parking, and roads development as part of an overall strategy.  This city needs a public transport system which will transport people efficiently to wherever they wish to go with the least possible damage to the environment.  There are suggestions with regard to reopening inner city railway lines and extending them.  We would like those kind of dynamic projects to be taken up under the direction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Housing is one of the key areas of urban renewal.  There is a demand for inner city housing from families originally from the inner city, from single people of all ages and from people without private transport and so on.  Housing associations backed up by groups similar to those that exist in Scotland, in Glasgow particularly, can play a major role in a partnership between public, voluntary and private sector organisations.  The Minister's housing programme covers this area and I welcome that.  I hope that the <Col N="318" /> change with regard to section 4 motions will mean a halt to this rezoning scandal in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Local councils should be elected for areas like Tallaght, Lucan, Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and Swords and they should have the powers and resources to tackle local problems.  There should be local authority offices in shopping centres so that people can walk in off the street to deal with statutory requirements, whether car tax or whatever.  The nearer that sort of service is to the people the better.  There are district offices in county council areas but they do not give the broad facility that should be available in local authority offices.  The Minister should look at the possibility of decentralising local authorities within their administrative areas.  In a constituency like mine many people are 40 miles or more from the administrative town of Clonmel.  We could address some of these needs without legislation, but with a little ingenuity and imagination from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking the Bill is a disappointment. It gives the Minister extraordinary powers.  The Minister can almost gerrymander electoral areas in the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  I hope the Minister will not go down that road because it could and would lead to unhappiness, at least within the Opposition parties and among members of Fianna Fáil. I hope our reading of this section is wrong.  We are prepared to listen to the Minister.  If he can reassure us, it will remove some of our doubts about this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche criticised the media interpretation of what happened yesterday and last night on other legislation. The media have been as kind to this legislation as they can be since the Minister launched this as a very important piece of legislation and the Taoiseach said it was not so important after all and wanted to know why all this fuss about the amount of time needed to debate it.  This Bill gives rise to the possibility that we will have elections on 27 June.  I have <Col N="319" /> already knocked on some doors in rural areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not talking here about potholes but rather about the fact that our county and minor roads which service agricultural communities have not been maintained.  They are a disgrace for the simple reason that we do not have the money to maintain them.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not address the question of local authority finance.  If the Minister does not come to grips with this matter all the restructuring in the world will not do.  I can function under the existing structures of local authorities and that is the reason I am putting myself forward for election again.</P>

      <P>I have been amused by some of the comments made on this Bill <Col N="320" /> on the Opposition benches.  I was amused in particular by the comments made on the Order of Business yesterday afternoon when they ranted and raved about the amount of time allocated for this debate.  At the same time they criticised the Bill and argued that there was nothing in it.  If that is the case, then far too much time has been allocated.  However they are saying the direct opposite but they cannot have it both ways.  This defies all logic.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach pointed out yesterday, this Bill is only the first step in reforming local government.  Listening to some of the speakers one would think that the Bill deals with roads.  It does not but has to do with the reform of local government and the way local government operates.  It is a bit rich that the members of the Government who were in office until 1987 are now talking about roads, given that they allocated only £8 million per annum for roads.  We increased this figure to £50 million per annum on coming into office.  Indeed, a sum of £65 million was allocated last year. I have not seen Fine Gael make any concrete proposals to reform local government.  To be fair to the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, at least they were prepared to participate with the Government in an all-party committee to examine the question of local government reform.</P>
      <P>When it did not prove possible to establish such an all-party committee the Taoiseach decided to set up a Fianna Fáil committee comprising backbenchers of the party.  Deputy Ferris lauded him earlier for making this move.  I was very pleased to be a member of that committee who dealt with the question of local government reform in great detail. In all, that committee met on 20 occasions and spent a number of days in England examining the way in which local authorities operate there.  We are serious about local government reform. However I do not think that the other parties in the House are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a greater degree of local democracy in England but this Bill is the first step in giving the <Col N="321" /> members of county councils more powers and in removing them from management. Few reforms were proposed during the period 1982 to 1987.  It is very easy for the Opposition parties to criticise us now but it should be remembered they introduced service charges.  Deputy Ferris admitted that these were introduced by Deputy Spring.  We have a problem with service charges in Waterford city and I and my party have been reminding people of that fact but they do not believe us.  It has now been put on the record of the House tonight who introduced the local service charges.  I have no problem with these charges and supported their introduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reasons for the delay in bringing forward the Bill have been outlined already and I do not intend to go back over that ground again.  One of the reasons the Bill has to be enacted fairly soon is that major changes have taken place in Dublin.  I do not intend to dwell on these, as my colleagues from the Dublin area will refer to them, except to say that it is extremely important that the three county councils are set up in the Dublin region in Fingal, south Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the county council in Dublin is too large.  I do not think the Opposition have any problems with that proposal and it is my belief that they have similar proposals in mind.  The Minister had adopted a very wise approach.  He has not tried to say that from the close of business on day one Dublin County Council will be no more and that from <Col N="322" /> day two we will have three new county councils.  I am glad that the Minister has not tried to adopt such an approach. Instead he is approaching the matter in a very sensible manner, has decided to let the position evolve and intends to introduce furher legislation later on.</P>
    <P>One of the Bill's strengths is that it proposes that many functions should be returned to the local community.  Section 5 (2) (a) states that a local authority may communicate to other local authorities the views of the local community.  The present arrangements between local authorities need to be strengthened as there will always be something in one local authority which will affect another &mdash; for instance, smell, smog and noise know no county boundaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important therefore that the different councils liaise with each other.  We in Waterford city face a particular problem given our closeness to the Kilkenny County Council area.  There is one problem which does not affect them but affects us.  I am not criticising that local authority as they are doing all they can in co-operation with us to alleviate the problem.  It would be far better if it was possible for these statutory bodies to come together to deal with such problems, and the Bill makes provision for this.  That provision will be of tremendous benefit to the counties which surround Dublin: Louth, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare.</P>
      <P>I also welcome section 6 to which Deputy Ferris referred.  He was worried that inadequate funding will be provided, but that section will allow the local authorities to promote the interests of local communities.  I am aware that many of them already do this.  They have promoted various projects within their regions even though they were not set up to carry out this function.  I am delighted that this legislation recognises the work they have been doing.  Many of these have set up community workshops, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ferris is worried about the money involved.  It takes very little seed <Col N="323" /> capital to get this underway and FÁS are playing a part in this.  Many jobs are being created in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been tragic events in Bangladesh as a result of the cyclone that occurred there at 1.45 a.m. last Tuesday.  A wave 25 feet high swept over a large part of that country.  When one bears in mind that some 20 million people are living less than five feet above sea level and that the wave in question was 25 feet high one can visualise the extent of the damage.  Floods which occurred in that country in 1988 killed 10,000 people.  When all the evidence is in, this flood will probably prove to be even more severe in its consequence.</P>
      <P>That country is in deep poverty.  For every 1,000 children born 184 die before they reach age five.  They are a race who unfortunately have become accustomed to natural disasters.  There is considerable doubt as to the true cause of the disasters of flooding that occurred in Bangladesh. Traditional environmental wisdom suggests that the flooding of this very low lying country is caused by the inundation that comes as a result of the deforestation of the Himalayas.  On the other hand, there is a proposal to erect a major sea wall which is being aided by the World Bank at a cost of £4 billion to prevent the sea inundating the country, but some fear that that may make the situation worse in the sense that it may prevent water coming down from the Himalayas escaping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are suggestions that at the moment somewhere in the region of 150,000 corpses are to be seen heaped against sandbags in the Bay of Bengal as a result of the tragic events in the last week.  There are cyclone shelters but they are not adequate.  On one island, Kutubdia, the cyclone shelters can accommodate 20,000 people but there are <Col N="324" /> 90,000 living on that island.  Clearly, there is urgent need for a co-ordinated programme to deal with that problem, first to provide emergency food aid. Much of the food aid available at the moment is not getting through.  For example, water is being distributed from helicopters in plastic containers and these plastic containers are breaking up on hitting the ground and the water is lost.  A proper logistical system needs to be put in place to distribute both food and water to the people who are dying.  There have been major outbreaks of diarrhoea among children as a result of lack of proper facilities and that needs to be attended to.</P>
    <P>As a long term measure steps need to be taken to ensure that adequate cyclone shelters are available.  Also a scientific examination needs to be carried out of the extent to which deforestation in the Himalayas is the cause of the problem and the extent to which lack of adequate protection from the sea is a problem.  We need to bring together scientific resources to ensure that the right solutions to the problems are put forward and not false solutions to what are not the actual problems. That is why I suggest that Europe as a whole needs to pool its resources as the largest trading bloc in the world to help solve this problem.  I believe the best way for Europe to do that is through an EC Summit.</P>
    <P>Finally, this problem is added to the many problems of growing world hunger. We could have a crisis of world hunger similar to that in 1974 given the food shortages in the Soviet Union and Africa and the huge disruption of this very rich rice growing area in Bangladesh.  I hope the Minister will agree that an urgent EC Summit initiated by the Taoiseach will be seen to be an appropriate co-ordinated response to this awful problem.</P>

      <P>My thanks to Deputy Bruton for giving me the opportunity of putting on the record the situation as we see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, thanks to <Col N="325" /> the partial restoration of the communication system with Bangladesh, more precise, although still far from complete, information is now coming through on the tragic aftermath of the cyclone and tidal wave in Bangladesh which took place on 30 April.  It is now clear, unfortunately, that it caused even more damage than was initially estimated.  A tidal wave of 25 feet exceeded the previous record high of 20 feet.  It swept the entire coastal belt of Bangladesh, affecting at least 15 million people in the area and leaving many populated islands completely submerged for eight hours and more.</P>
    <P>The death toll has been confirmed officially at 125,000 and this unfortunately must be regarded as a minimum and likely to rise.  Local media estimates are reported to have put the number of deaths as high as 150,000.  Several million people have lost their homes and are in immediate need of drinking water and food.</P>
    <P>Apart from thirst and hunger there is a serious danger of disease such as typhoid and cholera.  An outbreak of diarrhoea, one of the biggest killers of children in the developing world, and which predated the cyclone, is also widespread.  It is regarded by medical experts as likely to make the population more prone to dysentry and acute respiratory infections.</P>
    <P>The Government of Bangladesh quickly initiated their own relief operation but in view of the scale of the crisis realised that they would be unable to cope on their own and issued an appeal for international assistance.  The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, has also appealed through the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation (UNDRO) to the international community to respond as generously as possible to the plight of Bangladesh.  UNDRO has undertaken the principal co-ordinating role in the relief effort, which has initially focused on the worst hit areas of Chittagong, Cox's Bazzar and the Islands of Noakholi.</P>
    <P>Other specialised UN agencies such as <Col N="326" /> UNICEF, WHO and WFP are collaborating with UNDRO.  The Bangladesh Red Crescent, the League of Red Cross Societies and many other NGOs are also involved in the relief effort.</P>
    <P>UNICEF has already distributed 2,500 emergency water treatment kits; 56 major emergency kits adequate for nearly 300,000 people; four million oral rehydration packets aimed at combating dehydration caused by diarrhoea and a plane load of water purification tablets. The World Food Programme has allocated 7,000 tons of wheat and vegetable oil and pledged 13,000 tons more.</P>
    <P>Due to the far flung nature of the disaster and the fact that not just part of the mainland, but many islands went under water, the relief operation is particularly difficult to carry out.  It is, however, beginning to become more organised and more people are being reached with supplies.</P>
    <P>The enormity of the disaster and the fact that the total extent of the damage cannot yet be fully assessed makes it still impossible to put an overall figure on what exact assistance is needed.  Very substantial financial assistance will, however, be required to meet both the immediate and the long term needs. While at the outset of the disaster cash was the most immediate requirement, and more is still needed, specific requirements of relief materials &mdash; shelter, food and medical supplies &mdash; have now been identified.</P>
    <P>The international community has reacted positively to the disaster, reflecting its sympathy with the burden of suffering which the people of Bangladesh have to bear yet again.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to us, allocations totalling in excess of US $130 million have been made by Government both to the UN agencies and to non-governmental organisations in cash and kind.  A number of countries have also provided helicopters to help relief workers reach those in need.</P>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy Collins, stated already in the Dáil last week, part of the £200,000 disaster relief allocation will go to Concern and UNDRO.  The <Col N="327" /> remainder will be allocated to other relief agencies whose applications for assistance are now being considered.  The leading Irish agencies which have long standing links with Bangladesh have reacted to the crisis quickly and effectively. In total, the Government and Irish relief agencies are involved in providing relief valued at more than £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>Several agencies, I understand, are planning to issue appeals for Bangladesh. I am confident that the people of Ireland will respond with their usual generosity.</P>
    <P>This crisis has been compounded in the last 24 hours by a tornado, which brings home the extreme vulnerability of Bangladesh. The one very small source of satisfaction is that the early warning system and the few cyclone shelters which had been established prior to the tragedy are believed by experts to have mitigated the number of casualties.</P>
    <P>I can understand that the Deputy wishes to encourage further action to relieve the suffering of the people of Bangladesh, but I do not share his view that calling an emergency EC summit is the best way to do this.  Of its nature a summit takes time to organise and time to bring the Heads of State and Government together.  On past experience, this could take nearly a month or more.  This is a long time in terms of the suffering of the people of Bangladesh.  The immediate needs are to expand and accelerate relief efforts on the ground.  I note that the last emergency summit held in April, which did discuss and make wide ranging decisions in relation to Kurdish refugees, had been called almost a month earlier to discuss the Gulf War and its political and economic consequences.  When the Kurdish crisis arose, it was added to the agenda.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said this morning, major disasters are discussed regularly at the Council of Foreign Ministers who decided on action to be taken at Community level.  The next Council meeting is scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, 13 and 14 May.  I would like to assure Deputy Bruton that we will take all appropriate steps possible to ensure that <Col N="328" /> attention continues to be paid to this very grave situation by the European Community and the international agencies.</P>

      <P>I thank you for permission to raise this case and I thank the Minister of State for coming here to listen to my plea.  On 17 March 1983 a Palestinian refugee was arrested by the Jordanian security police and charged with offences alleging membership of an outlawed political party, namely the Islamic Liberation Party.  He faced a possible ten years in prison.  He was released on terms before trial and fled to this country.  He has remained here ever since his arrival on 3 March 1984.  His status as a Palestinian refugee was registered with the United Nations at Amman in Jordan on 18 November 1967.  His passport from that country has not been renewed and he is without means of travel abroad.  He is, in fact, stateless.</P>
      <P>Over the past seven years while in Ireland he has been without work or support by the Department of Social Welfare. He has been unable to obtain a work visa because his status within the country has not been settled.  He is being maintained in very poor circumstances by his family who periodically, send him money for support.</P>
      <P>On his arrival here he applied for residency, citizenship, political asylum or whatever the Department would be prepared to facilitate him with.  Needless to say, he was unfamiliar with the rules, regulations and laws of this country and sought what guidance was available to him from the Department and other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The party of which he was a member in Jordan was basically a populist antiroyalist party and because it was antiroyalist it was not tolerated in Jordan.  In his application for political asylum he has been supported by the Irish Red Cross Society and has had his case investigated by the United Nations High Commission in London.  I understand they have reported to the Department that his case <Col N="329" /> is sustainable and that he should be supported in his application for consideration here.</P>
    <P>Throughout this time he has continued to report as required to the aliens section of the Department of Justice.  All his inquiries to date have led to a blank wall at the Department and he remains in effect stranded, stateless and without the opportunity to work or to seek it.  His position has become more hapless, if that is possible, because recently he has been advised that his elderly father is seriously ill.  He needs to travel to see him at home before he passes on but he cannot leave here because if he does he faces the risk of persecution if he returns to Jordan without Irish citizenship and the support and protection of the Irish State.  Equally if he travels without documents and without assurances he has no prospect of returning.</P>
    <P>Aliens here are never very high on any political agenda or manifesto.  Our own illegals abroad have received huge Government attention and this is as it should be.  We need to give attention to those unfortunates who come to Ireland of the welcomes as a resort.  The Department must become more open and deal more compassionately with the needs of aliens who come here out of desperation. In particular, the position of this man must be addressed without further delay. It is inexcusable and unforgiveable that a person who makes a reasonable, sustained and supportable request must wait seven years for a reply from a Department.</P>
    <P>All this I put to the new Minister of State at the Department of Justice in correspondence on 18 February last.  I understand my correspondence and his representations have failed to resolve the difficulty and it is in those circumstances that I have come to the House to raise this case.  I hope that doing so will lead to some respite being offered, some hope being tendered and some favour being given to this unfortunate gentleman who does not have a home to return to and who now wants to take out Irish citizenship and to take up residency here. He has spent seven long and lonely years <Col N="330" /> here and he is happy with residency.  He needs a favourable response from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to respond to what has been said by the Deputy and to put on record the facts of this matter.  This young man applied for and was granted a visa for entry to Ireland in March 1984.  He was given permission to pursue a course of studies here until September 1985.</P>
      <P>Our Department next heard from him in December 1987, when he applied for Irish citizenship.  In his letter applying for citizenship, he did not claim to be a refugee but stated that he wanted to become an Irish citizen because he was a Palestinian refugee, registered with the appropriate United Nations authority; he had been in Ireland for more than three years; according to a doctor's report, an infection in his leg, which he had suffered as a result of a road traffic accident in May 1983, could recur and he would prefer to be treated in Ireland; and because of what he described as the hidden discrimination he faced, in the country, whose passport he carried, he would prefer to settle in Ireland.  He did say in the letter that he had been jailed for one month in 1983 for what he described as his political opinions, but did not advance that fact as a reason for seeking citizenship.</P>
      <P>In reply, it was explained to him that he would have to fulfil certain conditions, as laid down in the relevant Acts, before he could be considered for citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1988 he approached the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, through the Irish Red Cross, about refugee status.  The UNHCR replied that, on the basis of the information supplied he had not, in the opinion of UNHCR, established a claim for refugee status.  In April 1989 he submitted a claim for refugee status to my Department.  His claim was referred to UNHCR which in response raised futher queries about the grounds on which refugee status had been claimed.  Further <Col N="331" /> information was obtained from the applicant and forwarded to both UNHCR and the Department of Foreign Affairs, both of whom have given their views on the matter.  Unfortunately, it is still not possible to reach a decision on the application due to a number of inconsistencies in the information supplied by the applicant which are evident and which will have to be resolved before a decision can be made.  I do not propose to say anything further on the matter nor to confirm any further information from where this person has come or the State in which this person alleges he would be persecuted.</P>
    <P>The delays which have occurred are, of course, a matter of regret but have been caused by the necessity to ensure that before a decision is made all of the information has been verified in so far as possible.</P>
    <P>I trust this puts the matter in context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to raise this <Col N="332" /> important issue with the Minister and I look forward to a favourable response.  I regret that I find it necessary to raise this issue once gain.  Last week I attended a very hostile public meeting in Swords to discuss the educational requirements in the area and, particularly, the delay in starting the new Fingal Community College. At this stage I should like to compliment the principal and staff of the school who have achieved excellent results with the students under most difficult and trying conditions.  What would they have achieved with proper facilities?</P>
      <P>I was a member of County Dublin VEC in 1985 when we advertised for and appointed a principal to the new Fingal Community College.  School started in September and pupils were accommodated in the old vocational school and today there are 407 students.  The school consists of five permanent buildings, one small remedial room, 17 prefabs on the area assigned for a play area in the old school, two cubicles for 250 boys, three cubicles for girls and an outdoor assembly area of 450 square metres.  I ask the Minister to try to imagine the problems in the corridors, which are three and a half feet wide, in rainy conditions.</P>
      <P>When one thinks of Swords one immediately envisages green fields and open spaces.  This rural school is unique. There is no one square metre for recreational purposes on that site.  This school is slowly becoming an embarrassment and is seen as a poor relation to other schools with better facilities.  It is, indeed, becoming more difficult to sell the good record of the school to parents given the lack of facilities.  I fought on the VEC in the late seventies and early eighties to eliminate the stigma attached to VEC schools.  Thankfully, this has been removed with the advent of community colleges.  It is up to the Minister to ensure that this does not return and provide the necessary finance to build a State school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been informed in recent years that the delay was due to difficulties in securing the adjoining site from the board of management.  On 1 May 1990 I was told by the Minister in the House that <Col N="333" /> agreement had been reached with the owners of the property.  In view of this why has it taken so long for the schedule of accommodation to be drawn up; the first operation in the planning process in the Department.  It shows a lack of commitment by the Government to this school and to Swords.</P>
    <P>The people of Swords are amazed at the delay given that shopping complexes and hotels in the area can go through the planning process and commence building within two years.  The people of Swords feel &mdash; and I tend to agree with them &mdash; they have been too quiet on this issue in the past.  Other areas that took a more militant attitude got their schools much quicker and I regret this very much.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister this evening to give a commitment that his Department will provide the necessary finance to build that school and ensure that the pupils of Swords, the catchment areas of Donabate, Rolestown and Santry who are depending on that school can look forward to justice and equality, something which is missing.  I ask the Minister to give some hope to these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the proposed Fingal Community College in Swords.  If I may, I would like first to give some brief details of the background to the project in order to put the matter in context and illustrate the careful planning that goes into all such building projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 the Department approved the establishment of a new post-primary school in Swords.  It was intended that the school which was to be a community college under the auspices of County Dublin VEC should be temporarily accommodated in the old vocational school in Swords pending the acquisition by the VEC of a site for the new building. A site comprising 2.61 acres adjoining the old vocational school was identified in 1987 as being the most suitable location for the new community college.  In November 1987, the Department agreed a purchase price with the owners of the <Col N="334" /> site.  However, the land was subject to an endowment fund and, because of this, consent for the disposal of the site by the governors had to be obtained from the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  The Commissioners refused this request in June 1989.  The Department appealed the decision via the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  This appeal was also turned down in November 1989, and the reason given for the refusal was that the Commissioners considered that the amount the Department had offered to pay was not enough.  Following further consultations with the valuation office it was decided to increase the Department's offer and finally in May 1990 the consent of the Commissioners was forthcoming.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy well knows, the planning of a school cannot commence until a site has been identified and purchased. At this time also, in common with other major projects, it became necessary before proceeding any further to review the project in the light of declining demographic trends which had become evident thoughout the country.  The Deputy will appreciate that such reviews, which are a regular part of the planning process, have become increasingly important in recent years because of changing population trends.  It is of course imperative that all building is fully justified by long term projections of pupil numbers.  Following the review of the Swords area, it was agreed that 500 pupil places should be provided at Fingal Community College for both the short and long term.</P>
    <P>The current position therefore is that the overall schedule of accommodation is now being prepared by the building unit in consultation with the County Dublin VEC taking both existing and new accommodation into account.  As soon as this schedule has been agreed, the VEC will appoint a design team who will then commence architectural planning.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the frustration of the Deputy because of the continuing delays about this school and I will take on board the legitimate points he made about the condition of the existing building. <Col N="335" /> However, I hope the Deputy will appreciate, with all due respect, there has not been undue delay in proceeding with this project.  The delay was due to site acquisition difficulties.  I am anxious to see the project proceed to construction as soon as possible.  I fully appreciate the difficulties being encountered by the school. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, brought those difficulties to the notice of the Department, as has Deputy Ryan.</P>

      <P>I wish to make the case for a college of music in Galway.  I am glad that the Minister of State, who is from my own constituency, is here because he will also be aware of this problem.  We are the only province in Ireland that has not got a school of music. Two such schools are located in Munster and one in Dublin and in total they cater for over 6,000 students.  There are not enough places to cater for the demand. There is a great demand for a music school in Galway and a local committee are working on this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, Galway city is renowned for its culture.  World renowned artists are brought to Galway each year by the Music For Galway group, Galway Arts Festival, and Pan Celtic Festival.  We can cite also the success of the Taibhdhearc and the Druid theatre companies.  Galway city and <Col N="336" /> county are renowned for traditional music and culture.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have this request referred to the Higher Education Authority and then to refer it back to the Dáil. I will be supporting his case locally and will be glad to help him out as usual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The sheer atmosphere, ambience and location of Galway city would seem to make it the perfect venue for the establishment of a college of music for the west.  I support Deputy McCormack's viewpoint.  It is ironic that the western seaboard counties, which are the cradle of Irish music should be left without a college of music for so long.  I believe there are compelling educational, cultural and economic reasons for the development of a fully fledged college with a full range of courses for the whole time and part-time training of musicians and teachers to perform and to teach the full spectrum of vocal and instrumental skills.</P>
      <P>The uniqueness of the school, however, would be its particular emphasis on the traditional mode, thereby enhancing the status of Galway as the music capital of the celtic world.  Galway would seem to be the perfect venue, poised as it is at the gateway to Connemara and half way between the Donegal and Kerry Gaeltachts and at the edge of the rich musical heritage of Clare.  At present, as Deputy McCormack has said, we have three colleges of music, two in Munster and one in Dublin.</P>

      <P>There are no courses in music in UCG or the Galway. Regional Technical College.  Indeed, I agree with both Deputies on the desirability of providing a school of music in Galway.  In fact when I sat on the benches opposite I made the case on numerous occasions for the establishment of a school of music in Galway.  Unfortunately the situation that pertained then <Col N="337" /> pertains now, that is the resources are simply not available in the context of the Department's priorities for expenditure on both the capital and current sides.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan £75 million will be spent on capital works in the third level area.  About £7 million of this will go to University College Galway and the Galway RTC.  In association with the provision of 3,600 additional places in universities under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a further £15 million will be spent on capital development and about £2.5 million of this will go to UCG.  Further capital allocations, which have yet to be determined, will be provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to upgrade or replace substandard accommodation in third level VEC colleges. The moneys are committed to areas of priority where funds are long overdue and therefore it is not possible to find the additional resources on the capital side to provde accommodation.  I regret to say also that the shortage of financial resources in the Department means that it is not possible at this time to make any commitment to funding on the current side.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the case for a school of music in Galway.  There are many committed and determined people in Galway and in the west generally.  We would all like to see this development take place, but unfortunately I cannot give the House any commitment at this time simply because of the lack of resources.</P>

I do not think there is any need for a study.  If we could provide the money for the accommodation and the teachers at this point in time, the school <Col N="338" /> of music could proceed.  That is not possible and all the studies in the world will not change that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are a number of parents in the Limerick, Shannon, Newport and Ennis areas in the mid-west region who have children with language disorders.  They have come together to ask the Minister for Education to establish a language disorder unit in the region because this is the best way of helping their children.  The children are within the normal range of intelligence, but some of them cannot understand the spoken word, while others cannot pronounce words correctly. They suffer from the verbal equivalent of dyslexia which I understand is called dysphasia.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be familiar with this problem because I understand he was instrumental in founding a unit such as this in his own constituency.  The format of such a unit would be as follows. A small group of seven, eight or nine pupils would be taken by a qualified primary school teacher who would be assisted all day long by a speech therapist. The cost would be quite low because in Limerick, as in other cities, there are many empty classrooms as the school enrolment declines, therefore there would not be a classroom cost.  Second, there are a number of primary school teachers on a panel and a teacher surplus to need could be reallocated to a school to carry out this very necessary work.  I understand also that Mid-Western Health Board have budgeted for the appointment of a speech therapist.  There would be no call on extra State funds if the Minister, on the advice of the Minister of State, could see her way to establish this unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to agree in principle to the setting up of this unit tonight.  The Minister could examine the submission she has received from the mid-west branch of the Language Disorder Support Group.  After an examination of the submission I hope the Minister will agree to set up such a unit <Col N="339" /> in Limerick and to have it in place on I September 1991 after the school holiday.</P>
    <P>The treatment in a special unit such as this is not long term.  If treatment is of benefit it will benefit the child within a 12 month period.  Therefore a unit that would cater for seven, eight or nine children would very quickly fulfil the needs of a larger group because the turnover is quite rapid.  As the children are not outside the range of normal intelligence special schools for mentally retarded children are not suitable.  However their speech difficulties make it impossible for them to benefit from the ordinary classroom teaching in the primary school. Spending time in a special unit would enable them to fit in to the ordinary class in a very short period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very recently received the request referred to by the Deputy and am arranging to have the matter fully investigated by my Department's inspectorate.</P>
      <P>Already, my Department have sanctioned five special classes for language/learning-impaired children in the Dublin area.  A sixth class is located in Galway.</P>
      <P>In addition to these special classes, facilities for language disorder also exist at Ballinteer, for pre-school language-disordered children, and in special classes at Temple Street and the Mater Hospitals.  The Hospital facilities are for children suffering from more than one handicap, including language disorder.</P>
      <P>Facilities are also available in various other types of special schools and classes for the handicapped as in many cases the children suffer from additional disabilities such as hearing impairment, emotional disturbance, physical or mental handicap or reading disability, and the language disorder may not be the primary cause of referral in such cases. A preferential rate of capitation grant and pupil-teacher ratio applies to the special classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I completely agree with what the Deputy has said.  I agree that a very small amount by way of resources is required, <Col N="340" /> but that such provision could have a significant impact.  It is evident that there is quite a number of children with speech impediments around the country who could come on significantly if they were given a reasonable level of support and specialist attention.  The provision of a speech therapist is a matter for the Department of Health through the Mid-Western Health Board.  Certainly I assure the Deputy that my Department will co-operate with the Department of Health in providing the necessary accommodation and other facilities if, as the Deputy says, speech therapists can be found.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties that has been encountered is that of finding speech therapists.  I know that in another health board area an agency are finding it difficult to fill a position for which they have the funding.  I agree with the Deputy, and I would certainly be most anxious to have continued development in that area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to Galway. Unfortunately, there has been quite a controversy in Galway, unfortunately Deputy McCormack has left the House.</P>
    <P>We want to move forward to provide the kind of services the Deputy talked about.  These should be provided in the normal school environment for children who, as the Deputy has said, may be slow learners but who are capable and competent given the specialist resources referred to by the Deputy.  I concur fully with the Deputy, and will certainly endeavour to respond to this specific request and have that kind of class put in place.</P>

      <P>Strokane school dates back to 1845.  It was closed briefly at the height of the great famine, reopened in November 1847, and has been open ever since. The present school building dates from 1891.  It was completely refurbished last year at a cost of £60,000 to the State and a local input of £18,000.  The school has 50 pupils and two teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A school bus operating to Stokane for 15 years or more was withdrawn this Easter.  It was carrying 25 pupils, 16 of whom were under ten years old and lived <Col N="341" /> more than two miles from the school within the traditional catchment area. So what, then, was the problem?</P>
    <P>The Department regulation that states &ldquo;to the nearest suitable school&rdquo; was the problem.  Someone got out the tapes and discovered that nine of the pupils involved lived 100 to 300 yards nearer another school in another parish, Culleens.  So they were disqualified for transport, even though the rollbooks, still extant, dating back to 1860, show that the children of those townlands always went to Stokane.  All of that was done by the Department presumably to save money.  What happens now?  The children can make their own way to Stokane, keeping up the tradition of 150 years, or, as the Department seem to suggest, they can switch to Culleens.</P>
    <P>If they do take the latter course, from September there will be ten suitable children from the traditional Stokane catchment area eligible for free transport to Culleens national school.  One new school bus route, not wanted by anyone, will be created to replace the route with which everyone was happy for the past 15 years. The savings to the Department, which started all of this merry-go-around, will be precisely none.</P>
    <P>However, the implications for Stokane, there since the famine and repaired last year at a cost of £78,000, could be dire.  Very soon it could become a one teacher school, and after that it would inevitably have the lock put on the door.</P>
    <P>The Department have their regulations, but they also have their moral obligations.  Such an eventuality for such a school like Stokane was never envisaged when the regulation in question was drafted in 1973.  I ask the Minister to treat this as an exceptional case and to restore the transport, at no cost to the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The school transport service from the Tullylynn and Carns area to Stokane national school, County Sligo, was terminated at the close of the school for the Easter holidays.  That action, which was taken in accordance with the terms of the primary school transport <Col N="342" /> scheme, was due to a decrease in the numbers of eligible pupils using the service. Under that scheme in order to retain a service there must be an average of at least ten eligible children travelling daily from a distinct area.  Those classed as eligible are children between four and ten years of age living two miles or more from the nearest school and attending that school.  Children over ten years of age must be living at least three miles from their nearest school to qualify.</P>
      <P>In this case the number of eligible children being conveyed during the Christmas 1990 and Easter 1991 terms was seven.  None of the remaining approximately 17 children using the service is eligible for transport to Stokane school, as the Deputy has said.  They are therefore in receipt of fare paying concessionary transport subject to accommodation being available on the school bus and to no extra cost being incurred by carrying them.  Fare payers may not be taken into the reckoning for the establishment or retention of a school bus service.</P>
      <P>The question of the correctness of the Department's decision in discontinuing the service in accordance with the scheme is not being disputed by the school authorities, that is to say, that neither the question of distances to schools nor the number of eligible children is in dispute locally.  It is being argued locally that most of the fare payers could conceivably opt to go to Culleens national school, their nearest school, because the service has been terminated and the Department would have to pay for a service to Culleens instead.</P>
      <P>My Department will examine the issue if and when ten eligble children from a distinct area request to go to Culleens.  It has not been our experience in the past, however, that children change schools <i>en masse</i> because of the availability of school transport.  Individual parents do exercise their right of choice, but transport is not a primary factor in their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment of Stokane national school had been declining before the service in question was taken off, that is not <Col N="343" /> in dispute.  I am aware of the point made concerning refurbishment of Stokane school in recent years, but, of course, those works would not have been undertaken in any case if they were not necessary.</P>
    <P>The school authorities have raised some points on which further clarification is being sought from Bus Éireann.  Preliminary information is that there would not be sufficient eligible children to justify the establishment of a transport service from the area in question to Culleens national school.  However, I take the point that the Deputy has made this evening, and I am prepared to consider the case again in view of what he has said.</P>
    <P>I have one comment to make in conclusion. When I sat on the Opposition benches I was at a loss to understand many of the Department's regulations and often wondered why they could not be changed.  However, when one tries to change the regulations from this side one runs into many serious difficulties.  The issue is very complicated but we will consider this case again.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I shall take first the question of Johnstown vocational school.  Indeed, you allowed me to raise this matter on 6 December 1990.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, was present then, too, and indicated that a decision would be made &ldquo;shortly.&rdquo; This evening I should primarily like to know what is the definition of &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows well the history of this problem.  Since the sixties there have been ten prefabricated classrooms there. On many occasions I have described this school as being largely a shanty town of prefabs that are now in very bad repair. Various reviews have been carried out on the revision of this school going back to 1982.  The latest review has delayed the process somewhat.  Nevertheless, a decision on whether to advance from <Col N="344" /> stage 4 to stage 5 in order to give this school the go-ahead now rests with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In addition, I must point out that during the course of construction of the school temporary accommodation will be required for pupils and teachers.  A proposal has been made by the vocational education committee and the school authorities to the Department of Education for a small sum of money to be made available to refurbish the old primary school at Urlingford in order to provide temporary accommodation for pupils during the course of the school's construction.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to review this case, to let us know what is the up to date position and to grant immediate sanction for the construction of this school, an undertaking which for historic reasons has dragged on for so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his very reasoned case.  Johnstown, County Kilkenny, is a single school post primary catchment area catered for by a vocational school.  The school has a current enrolment of 317 pupils and accommodation for 300 pupils, much of which is in prefabricated buildings, as the Deputy has said.  An extension proposed for the school is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  In common with all other projects in the Department's second level building programme the project at Johnstown vocational school was subjected to review in the light of 11 relevant factors, including the most up to date statistical data and demographic trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department have had discussions on the matter with representatives of County Kilkenny Vocational Education Committee, with particular refernce to the estimated long term enrolment trends in the catchment area and agreement on the number of pupil places to be provided has now been reached.  As a result of the agreed change in the projected pupil numbers to be catered for, revised plans have been prepared by the VEC's design team for the project.  These revised plans, and related <Col N="345" /> documentation, have been submitted to my Department and are under examination. The question of the further advancement of the project will be considered when the revised plans have been fully examined.  I accept that the delay with this project, as indeed with most post primary building projects, is much longer than anticipated &mdash; something similar applies in my own town of Gort &mdash; but that largely is due to the reviews that have to take place and also, in no small measure, to the fact that money for the post primary building programme is very scarce at present.  Consequently, much of the work that we would like to proceed with is delayed.</P>

      <P>Again, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to thank you for the opportunity to raise the question of Ballyhale vocational school and the need for an extension to that school or the erection of a new school at that location.  As the Minister is aware, Ballyhale is a rural area of south Kilkenny and the school serves a very vibrant rural community. Enrolment at the school has been in excess of 200 pupils anually and it has achieved considerable success in academic, cultural and sporting activities. A full range of subjects is provided under the auspices of Kilkenny VEC. The school also provides post leaving certificate courses such as a full time two-year course in hairdressing which is recognised by the Department of Education technical branch and the City of Guilds in London.  This course is unique in the south east and draws pupils from five neighbouring counties.  At present the pupils are housed in a conglomeration of permanent but mostly temporary accommodation with grossly inadequate facilities.  The conditions for teachers and pupils are seriously below standard and are appalling in times of bad weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that there are serious financial difficulties in the country. Indeed, no Fine Gael Deputy can be lectured about fiscal rectitude, and it is unique for Deputy Fahey, and his party, <Col N="346" /> to be talking about that now.  Nevertheless, allowing for financial responsibilities and scarcity of finances in the post-primary building sector, I ask the Minister to take an initial step and give some hope to these people who have put up with inadequate facilities over the years.  Perhaps he would allow the immediate release of funds for the purchase of a site so that the school authorities can see light at the end of the tunnel and that the construction of a new school will be considered in the context of the financial allocations for the coming year.  What is urgently required is the provision of funds to purchase a site. This would allay public concern that the Department of Education are dragging their feet on the issue.</P>

      <P>I am not going to respond to any lectures on fiscal rectitude at this hour of the evening.  I am very familiar with the hurlers from Ballyhale, having played against them on a few occasions.  How many miles is Ballyhale from the nearest post primary centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The nearest post-primary centre is at Thomastown, four or five miles away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The school has a current enrolment of 212 pupils.  My Department had approved the provision of a permanent extension to cater for 200 pupils overall at the school to replace existing temporary accommodation.  Architectural planning of the project had reached an advanced stage when difficulties regarding the acquisition of additional property adjacent to the school building were encountered.</P>
      <P>Also, as with other major projects, my Department are reviewing the project for Ballyhale vocational school in the light of the most recent school enrolments, primary and postprimary, and demographic trends.  In those circumstances, the question of sanctioning the purchase of a site additional to the existing school site must await completion of the review of all aspects of the proposed project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I asked about the distance <Col N="347" /> from the nearest school is that from experience in my town of Gort we found &mdash; I give this as a personal view rather than an official one &mdash; that to go ahead with a 200 pupil vocational school would not have been in the best interests of education in the area.  That is a personal view, and I wonder if it would be in the best interests of education in the area referred to by the Deputy to go ahead with a single 200 pupil school in this day and age.  I would be glad to talk with the Deputy, or any other Deputy, about the <Col N="348" /> advantages of larger schools, even though it would mean pupils having to travel a couple of extra miles.  In Gort we decided to abandon the school which was at a very advanced stage of planning and opt instead for a community type development with a larger school.  People are much happier with that and we are waiting, as are the people in Kilkenny, for construction work to commence.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at this stage to provide precise data on waiting lists for orthodontic services.  The health boards are at present assessing children in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department in 1985 to determine treatment need for fixed appliance orthodontic therapy.</P>
      <P>In 1989 £300,000 was provided for orthodontic services.  A special allocation of £3 million was made in the 1990 budget to bring about an improvement in dental services.  As a result, approximately 2,500 children were put on courses of orthodontic treatment by 31 December 1990. A further special allocation of £3 million for dental services was made in the 1991 budget of which £1 million was earmarked for orthodontic treatment to meet the ongoing costs of treatments commenced in 1990 and to provide for new starts in 1991.  It is expected that up to 4,000 courses of treatment will be on-going by the end of September 1991.  The level of orthodontic service provided by the health boards has been affected by difficulties in the recruitment of consultant orthodontists.  It is proposed to advertise these posts again within the next fortnight with improved conditions of service and it is expected that they will now be filled.  This would allow for a major improvement in existing service levels.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to recent allegations made in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which suggested that patients attending <Col N="115" /> St. Luke's-St. Anne's hospitals are suffering distress due to shortage of beds and theraputic radiographers.</P>
      <P>At persent, certain services at St. Luke's have been restricted, not due to a lack of funds or beds, but rather due to severe difficulties in recruiting radiographers. There are vacancies for three radiographers and two further radiographers will be resigning shortly, bringing the total number of vacancies to five. The hospital has had major difficulties in recruiting therapeutic radiographers for the past two years despite repeated advertising both at home and in the UK. At present, there is an intake of eight students every three years to the school of therapeutic radiography at St. Luke's-St. Anne's.  My Department are giving urgent consideration to a proposal to provide an intake of students to the school every year.</P>
      <P>Patients requiring urgent treatment are never turned away from St. Luke's and St. Anne's hospitals.  However, I understand that a problem has arisen on a small number of occasions at the hospital, whereby patients who had been booked for admission for radiotherapy have had to be sent home due to non-availability of beds at St. Luke's.  This is an unacceptable situation which is related, not to a shortage of funds, but rather due to management problems concerning the booking system and the allocation of beds between the two campuses.  The board of the hospital are presently considering a common admissions procedure for the two campuses.  Senior officers of my Department have taken this matter up with the management of St. Luke's-St. Anne's to ensure that effective measures are taken to prevent problems of this nature arising again.</P>

      <P>There will be no extra persons entitled to free hospitalisation, since this entitlement is already available to the entire population.  However the revision of eligibility for public hospital services from 1 June next, as announced in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> will result in the availability to the entire population of consultant services also, subject only to the modest statutory charges.

Where a patient opts to be a private patient of a consultant he will, of course, continue to be liable for professional fees.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 134 together.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the development of services for the elderly. The scope of the programme is designed to: expand home nursing and other support services for the elderly and their carers living at home; extend respite facilities to relieve the families caring for dependent elderly at home; provide specialist assessment and rehabilitation units associated with the main acute general hospitals; and ensure adequate numbers of extended care beds in those boards experiencing a rapid increase in the elderly population.  All health boards have been asked to prepare plans to implement the above commitments.  The provision of 12 additional beds in the Sacred Heart Hospital, Carlow for assessment and rehabilitation of the elderly will depend on the priorities of the South-Eastern Health Board and the amount of money made available under the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 58 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the criticism of the health board dental service made by the Health Board Dental Surgeons Group of the Irish Dental Association which I believe to be unwarranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990, an additional special allocation of £3 million was made to the <Col N="125" /> health board services, specifically to bring about an improvement in the adult dental services and in orthodontic services for children.  About 24,000 adults benefited from the improved availability of routine dental treatments bringing to nearly 42,000 the number of adults who received routine courses of dental treatment during 1990 while a further 34,000 adults received emergency treatments.</P>
    <P>Two and a half thousand children began their courses of secondary orthodontic care in 1990 as a result of the special budget funding.  All of the health boards have been asked to carry out reviews of their orthodontic waiting lists in accordance with the Department of Health guidelines.  I believe that it is essential that the vacant posts of consultant orthodontist be filled if we are to develop an efficient orthodontic service and therefore these posts will be advertised again shortly with revised conditions of service.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that most health boards have now adopted a school based system for the delivery of dental services to schoolchildren.  This approach aims to examine all children in specific classes and to provide treatments if necessary. The classes chosen are usually first or second and sixth standards.  These classes were chosen with preventive treatments in mind and to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  All children can avail of an emergency service, which is usually available on demand.  In 1990, over 180,000 children received routine courses of dental treatment while a further 75,000 children received emergency care.</P>
    <P>A further special allocation has been made available for the dental services in 1991 and I am confident that the improvements achieved in 1990 will be sustained this year.</P>

      <P>The present funding arrangements for hospitals are not based on a costed case-mix system.  In the case of the public voluntary hospitals an individual allocation is made by my Department; that allocation is determined largely on an incremental basis, but takes account of the individual role of each hospital.  In the case of health boards, an overall allocation is notified and it is the responsibility of each board to strike an appropriate budget for their own hospitals.  However, the health board hospital budgets must be consistent with the overall health board service plan which is discussed and agreed with my Department.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the allocation methodology for acute hospitals needs to be refined in the context of resource allocation for the health service in general. Work is continuing in my Department on developing the appropriate mechanisms to enable budgets to be determined prospectively on the basis of agreed output expressed in case-mix terms.</P>

No recommendation has been specifically rejected. <Col N="132" /> The report is being considered by my Department and the management of the hospitals concerned.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal proposals of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group in relation to better management of the hospital workload recommended in their interim report that each hospital (a) should introduce, if it did not already have, an effective admissions policy involving the active co-operation of consultants, nursing staff and management; (b) should have an <Col N="133" /> effective bed management policy in operation to ensure maximum utilisation of available bed stock, including the appointment of senior nursing personnel as bed managers to operate this policy; (c) should arrange its bed complement so as to reflect demands made as a result of its case mix and, in particular, to introduce an appropriate number of protected one-day and five-day wards; (d) should have an observation ward adjacent to the A &amp; E Department under the overall administrative control of the A &amp; E consultant; and (e) should ensure that discharge planning begins at the point of admission and is a structured process involving the key disciplines as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have received reports from all the hospitals concerned and from the Eastern Health Board outlining the progress they have made in implementing the good practice recommendations contained in the interim report of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group.  The process of implementation was assisted by the efforts of a special sub-group of the group, who were available to support the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, for the most part, hospitals took steps to put in place all possible measures in advance of the anticipated pressure of the winter season and that these good practice measures are very valuable in ensuring that hospitals manage their workloads in a more effective manner.</P>

      <P>I fully accept the desirability of having in place uniform national eligibility criteria for all community care services.  An important step in this direction is the commitment given by the Government in <Col N="134" /> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to ask the chief executive officers of health boards to carry out an early review of the methods of assessment used for medical card eligibility to ensure that these procedures are uniform and consistent throughout the country. This review will take place shortly.</P>
      <P>Apart from the awarding of medical cards, there are certain community care services in respect of which there are no statutory eligibility criteria, and the criteria operated in practice may, therefore, vary from area to area.  My Department are at present examining how this issue can best be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 91 and 102 together.  I would refer the Deputies to previous statements which I have made to the House in relation to DES and in particular to my statement on 6 December 1990 (Official Report, volume 403, No. 6, columns 1597-1601).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the report on DES cosponsored by the Council for the Status of Women and DES Action, I was formally presented with a copy of the report last Thursday, 2 May 1991.  I welcome the publication of the report which I have studied with particular interest.  The Council for the Status of Women have had meetings with officials of my Department and with the previous Minister of <Col N="135" /> State at the Department of Health in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the steps already taken are a positive response to provide for the needs of those affected by DES. At the same time myself and my officials will continue to monitor the situation and will maintain contact with the council on an ongoing basis.  Indeed, when receiving the report, I invited representatives of the council to meet with me for further discussion on the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Regarding the registration of DES cases, because of the lack of medical records, it would prove extremely difficult to establish a register of those persons who may have been prescribed DES during pregnancy in the period between the 1940s and early 1970s.</P>
    <P>However, as I indicated previously, I am concerned to ensure that appropriate medical care would be provided to daughters and sons who may be affected as a result of their mothers having taken this drug.  To this end, my Department have worked in co-operation with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in the production of a comprehensive information leaflet on DES for distribution to medical practitioners. This will assist in identifying those people who may have DES related problems and ensure appropriate medical care.</P>
    <P>In addition a special unit has been established at the National Maternity Hospital to whom those suspected of DES related problems may be referred and where appropriate care and treatment are available.  The referral of patients to this unit will, of course, assist in identifying those affected as a consequence of DES and provide useful information on the extent of the numbers of those involved.</P>

      <P>I am aware that fees charged by some consultants exceed the level of cover provided under VHI plans.  However, the VHI for a considerable time have been actively engaged in negotiations with the consultants with a view to resolving this problem.  As a result the VHI introduced their full cover system for professional fees from 1 March 1991.  Consultants who participate in the scheme will receive increased payments from the VHI and in return will not charge additional amounts to patients.  Substantial numbers of consultants have already agreed to participate in the new scheme and the numbers participating are expected to increase steadily.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recent report of the Economic and Social Research Institute entitled <i>&ldquo;Unemployment, Poverty and Psychological Distress&rdquo;.</i>  I was pleased to be able to provide financial assistance towards the cost of this study and I am having the detailed findings of the report examined in my Department is so far as they relate to the health services.  I might add that the linkage between unemployment, low income and levels of illness is well recognised.</P>
      <P>My Department are addressing this issue in a number of ways.  It is clear that prevention is better than cure.  This is truer in the health area that in most other areas.  The major causes of death, such as cancer, cardiac and respiratory illnesses, are to a significant extent determined by the choices people make about diet, smoking, alcohol, exercise and stress.  My Department have an active health promotion unit who are continuing to tackle this situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to availability of health services, 35 per cent of the population are medical card holders who have full eligibility for all health services.  Income guidelines are available to assist the chief executive officers of the health boards in deciding on applications for medical cards.  These guidelines are not statutorily binding and the chief executive officers have discretion in cases of hardship to issue a medical card even if the income is above the guidelines.</P>
      <P>A range of factors such as family size and medical conditions are taken into account.  The chief executive officers also have discretion to waive the statutory charges for public hospital services for non-medical card holders in cases where payment would cause undue hardship.  In view of these discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, I am satisfied that no one is denied essential health services due to inability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations are also being made to <Col N="138" /> provide that a person who would otherwise be eligible for a medical card cannot lose this entitlement solely as a result of availing of the family income supplement or the social employment scheme.  The carer's allowance has been extended to eligible people caring for chronically disabled relatives in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>A wide range of community and institutional health services are available. There has been a long-standing recognition of the need to invest in community care and this is reflected in the moneys now being invested in this area.  The process has already been underway &mdash; as witnessed by last year's budget which provided a special allocation for the elderly, mental handicap and the dental services. An additional £8 million has been earmarked this year for the community-based care programmes in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These are targeted at those in the greatest need and will be focused on the elderly, the mentally handicapped, the dental services and child care facilities.</P>

      <P>The programme of activities of the health <Col N="140" /> promotion unit is a broadly based programme which encompasses a range of issues such as lifestyle, drugs, AIDS, alcohol and smoking.  These issues are addressed in a variety of settings including community, educational, occupational and recreational.  The role of exercise is an important determinant of good health and accordingly features in a number of health promotion initiatives by my Department's health promotion unit.</P>
      <P>The lifewise course is a community based health and fitness programme for adults which is being piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  One of the major components of the programme is an exercise routine where participants are led through a series of exercises designed to develop strength, stamina and suppleness.</P>
      <P>The lifewise programme has proved very successful in the mid-western region and a number of other health boards are currently planning to provide lifewise programmes in their respective areas. Training programmes are currently taking place for lifewise tutors for these boards.  The lifewise programme is adaptable and has been used in educational and occupational as well as community settings with various groups such as parents, the elderly, the disadvantaged and in schools.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit in conjunction with Cospóir and Thomond College of Education, Limerick, are currently developing health-related physical fitness materials for use by physical education teachers as part of a comprehensive health and fitness programme.  The piloting phase of this programme is well advanced and is expected to be completed later this year.</P>
      <P>The intersectoral approach which is necessary in the development of health and fitness programmes is also evidenced in the support of the health promotion unit for Cospóir's &ldquo;Be Active, Be Alive&rdquo; programme.  These programmes are organised to encourage people, particularly those who do not participate in any form of physical activity or sport, to lead a more active lifestyle.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> As part of their contribution to the World Health Organisation's healthy cities project, the health promotion unit will also part-sponsor the healthy cities walking project which is being co-ordinated by the Dublin Healthy Cities Committee and Saol Plus.  The project will be launched this autumn.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit also produces materials on fitness and exercise as part of their information programme. A new leaflet on losing weight for better health contains information on aerobic exercise for weight loss purposes.  The unit's Better Health Guide also contains information on the importance of exercise for health and fitness.</P>
    <P>An important element of health and fitness is healthy nutrition.  I will be launching, in a matter of weeks, an ambitious five year action framework on nutrition which aims at improving the nutritional status of the population generally with particular reference to vulnerable groups.  Deputies will recall the very successful healthy eating week in the Dáil which emphasised the importance of good nutrition and how it can be achieved with modifications to existing dietary habits and cooking methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a copy of the report referred to in the question.  It provides a detailed overview of the social and economic fabric of the north inner city of Dublin and will be of considerable assistance to the different statutory and voluntary agencies working in the area.</P>
      <P>The report reveals that the rate of children in health board care in the area is higher than the rate for the Eastern Health Board generally and for the country as a whole.  It suggests that this may be due, in part, to the fact that the area has a higher than average rate of children born to unmarried mothers.  There is research evidence that unmarried mothers have greater difficulty in coping with the demands of child rearing and that their children face a higher probability of being placed in care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of Government policy in relation to child care is to enable children to be cared for within their families wherever possible and to provide place support services to families who <Col N="143" /> may need additional assistance or who may be at risk for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>In the case of the north inner city a number of services exist within the community to assist families who may encounter either short term or longer term problems.  For example St. Vincent's Family Resource Centre caters on an intensive basis for children under three years.  There are two neighbourhood youth projects in the area staffed by health board employees who work with children in the six to 16 years age group. There are two residential hostels in the area &mdash; Tabor House and the St. Vincent de Paul project, Amiens Street &mdash; which provide residential care and day programmes for young people in difficulties. In addition, the Talbot Day Centre works with young substance abusers in the 13 to 19 age group.  Day activities and courses are also organised for women on self-development and self-assertiveness, parenting skills, health promotion, cooking and sewing and a variety of other topics.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of general practitioners per head of population in the area, the report indicates that while the rate is somewhat below the average for the city as a whole, it is higher than the rate for the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>Information available would suggest that the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device was not officially marketed in Ireland and that agencies under the aegis of my Department were not involved in any <Col N="145" /> aspect of the supply or fitting of the device to women in this country.</P>
      <P>When problems concerning the use of the Dalkon Shield were identified in the mid 1970s it was withdrawn from the market.</P>
      <P>The Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust was established in 1985 by the United States District Court to administer, settle and pay Dalkon Shield claims.  The manufacturers of the Dalkon Shield, A H Robins &amp; Co. Ltd., were directed by the court to institute an international campaign to advise women who wished to pursue a claim for compensation to make appropriate application.  While neither the company, nor their Irish agents had ever supplied the Irish market, it was concerned that some Irish women may have been fitted with the device.  The company therefore conducted an extensive media campaign which involved the major public media including the national press.  The Irish Medical Organisation and other key medical bodies were also contacted.</P>
      <P>A voluntary body known as the Irish Dalkon Shield Association was established in 1986 to, <i>inter alia,</i> act as a liaison body for persons in this country claiming to be affected by the Dalkon Shield, to ensure that all Irish women who were prescribed this device are/and were made aware of the consequences to their health and to provide a counselling service for sufferers.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the most appropriate channel for women pursuing claims is to contact the US Claimants Trust.</P>

Indeed I have been at pains to support and encourage them in every way possible, financial and otherwise.

      <P>The possibility of including a question on disability or handicap in the census of population has been considered on a few occasions in recent years.  The conclusion was that the census could not provide the type of information which would be needed to assess reliably the extent and nature of disability in the community. It was considered best that the health services should compile and keep up to date registers of persons with disabilities. These registers would provide overall quantitative and qualitative information <Col N="147" /> as well as individual particulars for use by those administering services &mdash; something that could never be done as part of a census of population.</P>

      <P>A range of initiatives are in place to control the abuse of alcohol and smoking among young people.  In relation to alcohol, in 1990 I launched a Drink Awareness for Youth (DAY) programme following its successful pilot test.  This programme, developed by the Health Promotion Unit in conjunction with the National Youth Council, seeks to equip young people with the personal and social skills necessary to help them to make responsible decisions about alcohol use.  The programme is aimed at 13-19 year olds and is available throughout the country in conjunction with a training programme for youth leaders.  To date over 350 youth leaders and others have been trained in the use of the materials and a number of statutory bodies have also expressed a keen interest in incorporating the materials into their training programmes.</P>
      <P>For the younger 10-15 year age group, a new video on alcohol &ldquo;Handle with Care&rdquo;, developed by the Health Promotion Unit and the Catholic Communications Institute was launched in 1990 with an accompanying teachers' guide for use in a school setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of health boards have school health education programmes in place, which address <i>inter alia</i> the question of <Col N="148" /> alcohol use.  In addition a range of alcohol related materials is available free to the public from the Health Promotion Unit.</P>
    <P>A multi-disciplinary programme &ldquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers?&rdquo; is available in health boards throughout the country.  The programme, run by trained facilitators, aims to equip concerned professionals and interested members of the public with the knowledge, skills and motivation to tackle drug issues at local level.  Alcohol receives strong emphasis in the programme.</P>
    <P>On a broader front, I accepted a recommendation of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion that a national policy on alcohol should be developed.  I recognise that the use and abuse of alcohol by young people is an issue that requires the co-operation of many sectors of society.  The national policy, which is currently being developed under the aegis of the Advisory Council, will examine the broad range of economic, social, cultural, educational and legal factors involved.  Special emphasis will be placed on the issue of youth and alcohol and the role of families.  Submissions from interested health professionals, organisations and members of the public have been solicited through advertisements in daily newspapers.  I am confident that this national policy will provide the framework within which this important health issue can be dealt with effectively.</P>
    <P>In relation to smoking, as the Deputy is aware, my Department pursue a combined strategy of legislation and education to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The current public anti-smoking campaign being run by the Health Promotion Unit contains elements targeted specifically at young people i.e. radio advertisements and posters.</P>
    <P>In Spring 1990, I launched a &ldquo;Health Is Lookin' Good&rdquo; Poster Competition for Schools.  The competition generated enormous interest with over 14,000 entries being received from both primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  All children entering the competition were supplied with a booklet containing information on the main health themes of smoking, alcohol, <Col N="149" /> healthy eating, exercise.  The bulk of the entries were on smoking.  The winning entries on the themes of alcohol and smoking were of a very high standard and have been reproduced in 1991 as posters for distribution by the Health Promotion Unit to schools, health boards and other outlets throughout the country.  The competition is being run again this year by the unit.</P>
    <P>Material for schools, in magazine format, has been developed by the Health Promotion Unit and the Irish Cancer Society on the issue of healthy choices.  Smoking is one of the topics covered.  The Health Promotion Unit and the Irish Cancer Society are currently developing in conjunction with young people, a peer-led anti-smoking programme.</P>
    <P>On the legislative front, under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, I increased the penalties for the sale of cigarettes to young people under the age of 16 and also made it an offence punishable by fine, to sell cigarettes in anything less than packets of ten, with the intention of making it more difficult for young people to buy cigarettes.  The Regulations which I introduced in May 1990 under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, prohibit smoking in any part of a primary or secondary school (including the school yard) except that smoking may be permitted where specific facilities other than classrooms or recreation rooms are provided for staff to smoke.  Restrictions on smoking also apply in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Under earlier legislation, as the Deputy is aware, advertising of tobacco products or of events sponsored by tobacco companies cannot appear in comics or other publications directed primarily to persons under 18 years.  The Deputy is also aware that in the budget in January this year, the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes was increased by 10p. Research suggests that price increases lower cigarette consumption among smokers in general but particularly among young people.</P>

      <P>The group reports to the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment, the group have reviewed a number of general aspects of the administration of Government Departments and recommended a system of delegated administrative budgets. Administrative budgets were introduced on a pilot basis initally but are now being applied across all Departments and Offices.  The group have been involved in monitoring the progress of a hospital review initiated last year.  It has undertaken an efficiency review in the Department of Defence and is considering a report arising from that review.  It has not issued any report to date.</P>

      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts set out three ways in which a person, not born in Ireland, may acquire Irish citizenship. These are through registration in the foreign births register of the birth abroad of persons whose parents or grandparents were Irish citizens, declaration of acceptance of post-nuptial citizenship by the spouse of an Irish citizen and by being granted a certificate of naturalisation.</P>
      <P>The foreign births register is maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs and, therefore, any questions concerning the register should be addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> In the case of those applying for post-nuptial citizenship applications can be made either to Irish diplomatic missions or consular offices in the case of persons living abroad or to the Department of Justice in the case of persons resident in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the case of those applying abroad I am informed that 561 such applications were made and referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs last year.  Of these 222 were passed to the Department of Justice for acceptance, queries were raised in the case of 124, 13 were refused while 202 were awaiting attention at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In the case of those applying to the Department of Justice records are not maintained in such a way as to enable a figure for the number of applications in a year to be given but 204 applications were accepted during the year.</P>
    <P>The number of files opened relating to applications for certificates of naturalisation and the number of certificates issued in 1990 were 374 and 179 respectively.  A file can, however, contain more than one application and the certificates which issued in 1990 do not necessarily refer to applications received in that year.  The computation of the exact number of applications received in 1990 and the number of certificates which issued in 1990 in respect of those applications would require the diversion of a disproportionate amount of scarce staff resources, as records are not maintained in such a way as to facilitate the ready extraction of this information.</P>

      <P>I am aware that people wishing to adopt children abroad had been experiencing difficulty in obtaining home study reports required by the foreign authorities.  This matter has been addressed in the Adoption Bill, 1990.  That Bill imposes a statutory duty on the health boards to carry out assessments of the suitability of prospective adopters.  The health boards have already been asked to begin carrying out these assessments in anticipation of the early enactment of the legislation. The boards have also been requested to nominate contact persons for the purposes of the new procedures.</P>
      <P>The new procedures will facilitate the adoption of foreign children by suitable people.  At the same time it must be appreciated that the assessment reports will take some time to complete.  The assessment of the suitability of the proposed adopters provides an important safeguard for the welfare of the child and the standard of the assessments to be undertaken by the health boards will be equivalent to that applicable in the case of a domestic adoption.  Our concern must be to ensure that foreign children are not regarded as second class children. This approach is fully in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141, 145, 146 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the extension of eligibility for category 2 health services to those currently in category 3, with effect from 1 June next.  The principal effect of this change will be to extend eligibility for free consultant services, as a public patient, to the entire population. Every person is already entitled to avail of a public bed.  Where a person opts to be the private patient of a consultant he will, of course, continue to be liable for professional fees.</P>
      <P>The programme also provides for the introduction, on a phased basis, of modifications to the arrangements for admission to public hospitals.  Public patients will, in general, be accommodated in public beds while private patients will be accommodated in private or semi-private beds.  Emergency cases will be admitted in whatever bed is available.</P>
      <P>A Bill to amend the relevant legislation to give effect to these commitments will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the new admission arrangements, health boards and voluntary hospitals have been required to draw up plans for the designation of public and private/semi-private beds and for a three-year phased implementation of the new system.  These proposals are now being examined by the Department of Health, who are responsible for co-ordinating the overall phasing and for monitoring the new arrangements as required under the terms of the programme. As this examination is not yet complete, I cannot at this stage confirm the number of beds which will be designated as private or semi-private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance charges which are at present payable for private and semi-private beds will remain in force after 1 June.  These charges, which are subject to regular review, are as follows at present: <Col N="164" /></P>

    <P>Under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981 the following are notifiable <Col N="165" /> infectious diseases: Bacterial meningitis and acute viral meningitis.  I am aware, that concern has been expressed recently regarding an alleged increase in the incidence of meningitis.  The notification of infectious diseases received by the Department does not support the concern expressed, as the increase appears to be in the viral forms of meningitis. This may be due to an increased number of cases submitted to lumbar puncture in which bacterial infection is not confirmed.</P>
    <P>My Department, with a view to evaluating the position regarding bacterial meningitis, have issued a circular to each director of community care and medical officer of health asking them to advise medical practitioners, both primary care and hospital doctors, in their areas to be aware of the possibility of cases of bacterial meningitis presenting themselves, and of the need to notify such cases to the DCC and MOH as a matter or urgency.</P>
    <P>One of the medical officers of my Department is closely involved with the various health boards in an on-going monitoring of the situation countrywide, and this, together with local arrangements between DCC and MOH's and medical practitioners, ensures a high level of reporting of the disease.</P>

      <P>I have received a number of submissions favouring a change in current Government policy on the Shannon stop from Deputies and other public representatives, local authorities, commercial associations and organisations representing business interests in Dublin and elsewhere in the country and also from private individuals.  The main thrust of these submissions is that a change in current Government policy to allow transatlantic flights direct into Dublin would lead to a significant increase in tourist traffic from North America into Ireland. I should also mention that I have received a large number of submissions in support of the <i>status quo.</i></P>
      <P>I have given my views on the Shannon stop policy on a number of occasions recently and I would refer the Deputy to my composite reply to Questions Nos. 17, 20 and 22 of 13 February 1991; Columns 86 to 94 of the Official Report refer.  The position remains that there is no change in Government policy in relation to the mandatory stop at Shannon.</P>
      <P>I should mention, however, that I have given commitments to the Fly Dublin Direct Committee and to the Shannon Status Committee that in the event of concrete proposals being made to me by any US airline for significant new or expanded services to Ireland which would require a change in existing policy, I will discuss these proposals with them before any decision is taken in the matter.  No such proposals have been received by me to date.</P>
