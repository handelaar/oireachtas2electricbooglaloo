      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a schedule of information requested by the Deputy on reports of the National Economic and Social Council published since 16 June 1987.</P>
      <P>Reports of the NESC in final form only are received by my Department to enable them to be submitted to the Government, laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published in accordance with the Constitution and terms of reference of the council.</P>
      <P>The NESC are a forum for discussion of the principles relating to the efficient development of the national economy and the achievement of social justice and to advise the Government on their application.  The NESC reports are a valuable input to Government policy formulation.  The detailed consideration of recommendations in the NESC reports is a matter for the Departments concerned.</P>

      <P>The dates of first appointment of all members of the National Economic and Social Council are set out in a schedule which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report. The term of office of members will expire on 16 November 1994.  There are four civil servants on the council as indicated in the schedule.</P>
      <P>I do not see any need to change the manner of nomination of persons to the council which has been agreed with the social partners.  I am satisfied that the existing membership of the council, particularly the membership by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, adequately represents the interests of unemployed persons.  The concerns of the existing membership about unemployment are clearly reflected in the various reports of the council.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received representations from the National Youth Council in respect of a statement made by him to Dáil Éireann on 30 January 1991 relating to the attendance of the council's representatives at meetings of the National Economic and Social Council; and if he will outline his response to these representations.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 14 February 1991, I received a letter from the Director of the National Youth Council about the matter referred to in the question.  I subsequently received a letter dated 18 February from the Deputy on the matter.</P>
      <P>In the correspondence referred to it was stated that the National Youth Council had two representatives at 35 of 50 meetings of the National Economic and Social Council in the period 7 September 1984 to 21 July 1989.</P>
      <P>The attendance records, however, show that there were 57 meetings of the National Economic and Social Council during the period in question and joint attendance of the National Youth Council representatives occurred on only 24 occasions.  In fact, in the period from March 1987 to July 1989, the period with which as Taoiseach I am most familiar, joint attendance by the NYCI representatives occurred in only three out of 24 occasions and the council were unrepresented at four meetings.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise, however, that it was not on the basis of non-attendance that the NYCI's representation was reduced to one in October 1989, when the membership of the NESC was reconstituted. As I have said in the House in the past, the Government had only six places to allocate to independent members and we wanted to assemble as broad a cross-section of community representation as possible.  The Government and social partners consider that one representative from the NYCI is adequate, particularly as a representative can always send an alternate to a meeting. Other equally important representative bodies such as the ICOS and the CIF have only one representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that on 30 January the Taoiseach stated in the <Col N="1434" /> House that he did not believe the two representatives from the NYCI ever attended together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Official Report will show that is what he said.  Will the Taoiseach further indicate that he has now admitted the NYCI representatives did attend together on 24 occasions?  Will he, therefore, have the grace to admit that the statement he made on 30 January in this matter was incorrect and withdraw it as it represents and is seen by the National Youth Council of Ireland as a slur on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very much a red herring.  What I conveyed to the Dáil on a number of occassions when we discussed this matter was that I could not give the National Youth Council more than one representative because the Government had only six places to allocate and of those there were so many important bodies of one kind or another to represent that it seemed to me perfectly adequate for the National Youth Council to have one of those six places.  That was the main thrust of my argument.  I went on to say, and it was only by way of comment, that I did not think the National Youth Council would be deprived in any significant way because as a general rule only one representative had attended and it appeared that was adequate from their point of view.  Therefore, it is not really a relevant argument. The real difficulty is that when the Government have only six places there is a careful balance preserved overall in NESC and it was not possible to give more than one seat to the National Youth Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the entire purpose of these representations was to elicit an admission from him that he made a misleading and damaging statement about a well respected voluntary organisation?  Will the Taoiseach agree that the purpose of these representations was not to argue <Col N="1435" /> whether they should have two seats or one but simply to get him to retract a misleading and damaging statement he made about an organisation, indicating he did not believe the two ever attended together at a meeting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 6, 8 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The first point that needs to be clarified is that the decision I announced on 14 February 1991 in respect of the Goodman Group under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, was not acceptance or approval of the rescue package in spite of widespread assertions in the media and elsewhere to that effect. The decision to accept or approve the rescue package was for the High Court under the terms of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a decision, specifically under the 1978 Act only, to allow a proposal <Col N="1442" /> notified to me under that Act involving a change in control of the group, which is no longer controlled by its former owner. This proposal arose from the package put together by the examiner and approved by the court.  In taking my decision I had to consider the substance of the proposal, that was to enable 60 per cent control of the group to change from its then owner to the bank group.</P>
    <P>Given that this proposed change in control did not entail any increase in the market share of the existing group, I felt that there were not sufficient grounds to refer the case on competition considerations, especially as the Fair Trade Commission had relatively recently reported on the relevant position of the group.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, in order to protect competition, I made orders under the 1978 Act, preventing the transfer of the assets of Master Meat Packers (Bandon) Ltd, and of DJS Meats Ltd to the Goodman Group, until the four other Master Meat plants are disposed of as going concerns to unconnected third parties. These orders are still in effect.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is probable that the alternative to the proposal notified to me would have had negative implications in the short term at least.  The alternative was probable liquidation.</P>
    <P>Because of these considerations I considered that there were insufficient grounds to refer the proposal to the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>My role did not involve passing judgement on the commerciality of the restructuring proposals and I made this clear in my statement.  I express no view therefore on the question of the company being able to satisfy the financial commitments involved.</P>
    <P>Price fixing will be made unlawful under the new Competition Bill, which I hope to publish shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it is really a semantical difference to suggest that the question of control has been transferred from the principal to the banks, as the banks themselves have agreed that Mr. Goodman <Col N="1443" /> remains cental to the entire operation?  Is it not inconsistent for the Minister to have quite properly raised the fears of a monopoly and now that the monopoly continues to exist, to fail to do anything about it?  Is not the import of the inordinate profits that are imposed now by the deal worked out with the banks, which was designed to ensure that the international banks got their pound of flesh for their own imprudence, that margins to the producer in particular must be reduced, that therefore the farmers will pay for this deal, and that if price fixing went on in the past, it is likely to go on in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a long series of questions.  It would have been better if they were put individually rather than together in the manner in which they have been put.  In so far as I can think back to the start of them, the first one was to ask me whether or not I thought it was semantics that control had changed in this group.  It is not semantics at all. Sixty per cent of the voting equity in the company is now in the ownership and control of somebody else.  Whoever has 60 per cent of the equity and a majority on the board of directors exercises control. The situation is different from what it was previously.  It could not be described as semantics that that has happened. As far as I recall, the Deputy said that in the past I expressed concern at the fact that this group had such a large market share and he asked me why, when I had the opportunity to do something about it, I did not.  I would refer the Deputy back to my reply.  I did not have the opportunity to do anything about it. I had jurisdiction to answer one specific question or proposal put to me under the 1978 Act, which was whether to allow the change of control from Mr. Goodman to the banks.  I had no jurisdiction to do anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot properly tackle one question relating to control by answering it in terms that are irrelevant to that question but which relate to competition. If I were to do so and that was seen to be the case, as it would be, then my decision would be open to challenge in the High Court.  I pointed out in my reply that so far as competition and the protection of competition is concerned, I made an order on 11 April 1990 requiring this group to dispose, as a going concern to unconnected third parties, of four master meat plants, before they would be allowed to legally acquire two which they appear to have gone into possession of already.  That order is still in effect.  It expires on 10 April 1991.  If it is not complied with by that date the whole transaction has to be renotified to me <i>de novo.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present market share of the Goodman group is some 43 per cent, that that is giving rise to extremely serious concern among the farming community, that it is not in the public interest; and that he would have been quite entitled to refuse the application to refer the matter to the Fair Trade Commission, resulting perhaps in liquidation as he suggested it might?  Did he consider the advantage that might well have flowed from that, which would have led to a break up of this conglomerate holding 43 per cent of the market share, which he regards, I think, as unsatisfactory?f Why did he not do that?  He was perfectly entitled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out already, I am not entitled to make a decision on one matter for the purpose of achieving my objectives in another matter which is not connected with the first matter.  If I were to do so, I would show that I was taking the wrong matters into account in making my decision and I am quite sure that in those circumstances, my decision could be challenged in the High Court and could perhaps be declared invalid as being an excess of <Col N="1445" /> jurisdiction or as being <i>ultra vires</i>.  This group at the moment, including the Master Meats Group and DJS Meats, has about 42.3 per cent of the market.  If the other two groups were removed its market share would be somewhere between 31.5 per cent and 32 per cent.  It is not possible, therefore, to say what precisely its market share will be until 10 April when, if it has not complied with the terms of the two orders I made on 11 April last, the whole matter will have to be renotified.  The effective market share at that stage will be under 32 per cent, which I regard as far preferable to the market share it had while controlling all three groups.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the Minister's comment that Deputy Rabbitte asked him a series of supplementaries rolled into one and that he had difficulty in responding to them for that reason, I will address my questions one at a time and hope the Chair will facilitate me in getting separate replies.  The Minister said his concern was short term employment and the danger of liquidation of the group if he had referred it to the Monopolies Commission.  Does he not see the same danger in the future because of the company's ability to achieve the targets which have been set?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have many more concerns than short term employment.  That is just one of them.  In this case I had to consider whether the common good was adversely affected by allowing the removal of control of this large group from Mr. Goodman to another group.  I concluded that the common good in the widest sense was not adversely affected by allowing that to happen.  So far as the commerciality of the proposals is concerned and the ability of the group or the company to satisfy various financial commitments involved, I would refer the Deputy to the second last paragraph of my reply where I have chosen my words very advisedly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations was initiated to reinforce the multilateral trading system and enhance its ability to respond to today's trading needs.  The traditional areas of negotiations, such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers affecting merchandise trade, have been supplemented by what are termed &ldquo;the new subjects&rdquo;, such as international services and trade related intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>All countries dedicated to free and open trading have a strong interest in a successful conclusion to the negotiations as this should ensure greater stability in the world trading system.  In such an eventuality, Irish industry would benefit directly from increased access for its merchandise trade to all third country markets under more predictable and transparent conditions.  In particular, it should benefit from the boost which a successful round will give to the European Community in terms of the allround increased prosperity which will follow and our aspirations for an enhanced share of the Single Market.</P>
      <P>Similarly, a successful conclusion to the negotiations in the &ldquo;new subjects&rdquo; should ensure greater transparency and certainty in the application internationally of rules governing trade in services. Standardisation and liberalisation in rules over a range of sectors should provide a more secure operational environment for Irish exporters of services activities.  New rules on intellectual property rights should remove many abuses in international trade such as counterfeit or illegal uses of trademarks and infringements of certain types of copyright. Again, they can only serve to better the interests of bona fide traders in international markets, including, obviously, many Irish concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small open economy with a significant trade surplus, an open and fair multilateral trading system is clearly to our advantage.  A successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round should give us a clear set of rules for international trade into the next century.  Failure could lead to increased protectionism, particularly in the US, and a likely decline in world <Col N="1448" /> trade, resulting in fewer and less open markets for Irish exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the list of benefits will largely accrue to us anyway with the advent of 1992 in the European context, whereas the benefits outside Europe will not be as significant as the amount we will lose by the dismantling of the CAP and that which we will have to concede in the GATT negotiations on agriculture?</P>

      <P>If the Single Market is achieved in the way we are anxious that it should be &mdash; and I am hopeful that it will be so achieved &mdash; that will give us and everybody else in the Community tremendous opportunities.  It would be very wrong for us to be inward looking or regional in this respect.  If we were, it would encourage other trading blocs or regions to look similarly on the future and that would be disastrous.  I am anxious in particular that the United States and Japan should not look upon it in that way and that the Pacific rim countries should not approach the future of world trade in that way.  It is to our benefit as part of the European Community and as an individual country to have the freest and most open trading possible in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree, outside the merits or demerits of an open economy, that we will be major losers following the conclusion of the GATT negotiations because we will be losing substantially in the agricultural sector, while any gains in the industrial sector will largely be available inside the European framework?</P>

      <P>I do not necessarily agree.  The Deputy puts a suggestion that the agricultural negotiations will inevitably have to go in a particular way.  The agricultural negotiations, effectively, are only starting now because no agreement could be reached even to open the negotiations at ministerial level in Brussels in December and it would be pre-juding the matter at this stage to say what way they will go.  The Irish negotiators are very conscious of the importance and very high value of agriculture to the Irish economy. That has been borne in mind in the negotiations to date and will continue to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In undertaking the Review of Industrial Performance 1990, my Department came to the conclusion that there was scope for further reorganisation of State agency structures, notwithstanding the significant level of reorganisation that has taken place in recent years, as detailed in paragraph 10.3 of the review.</P>
      <P>The Department set out a number of possible options and indicated which one they felt would be most appropriate.  The recommended structure would involve the location of all existing developmental functions and supports within one agency with specialised services remaining with other agencies.</P>
      <P>While there was general agreement on the need to rationalise State agency structures among those consulted by my Department in preparing the review, there was no consensus as to the most appropriate form in which such rationalisation should take place.</P>
      <P>I set out in my preface to the review the changes which I decided should be made in the first instance including giving IDA sole responsibility for overseas industrial promotion; integrating the equity support activities of IDA and NADCORP more closely, and merging the marketing support services provided by Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I also indicated in the preface, I intend to keep under consideration the possibility of further reorganisation taking into account the findings of the review and the relative failure of efforts to date in developing a strong indigenous industry.  However, I do not wish the substantial issues which arise in relation to the nature, extent and form of our industrial policy to be subsumed in a debate solely about institutional aspects. I will, therefore, be giving this matter <Col N="1453" /> further thought in the context of the wider issues; I will be referring to these in replying to other questions on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Is there any precedent for a Government Department responsible to the Minister making one recommendation in public in a Government publication and the Minister taking a different view?

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine there are precedents for a Minister and a Department taking a different point of view.  I would hope there are.  It is very unhealthy if a Minister is only expected to rubber stamp whatever his Department come up with, and that is not my way of operating.  The review was carried out by the Department. I let them at it.  It is a matter for them to do the review.  When they finished the review I considered it and wrote a preface to it in which I gave my own thinking in relation to these matters. So far as this recommendation is concerned, which I did not accept, I gave a lot of thought to it.  I find that while 79 per cent of industrialists surveyed in connection with this review considered that there were too many State agencies, more than half of those surveyed were opposed to the establishment of one integrated multi-purpose agency.  I shared the view that one single super agency or one agency that alone would disburse grants and act as a development agency would not be appropriate.  I thought that the sort of skills that had been built up over many decades in relation to marketing, export support, technological <Col N="1454" /> matters and so on were best left with some of the agencies concerned even if it were necessary and appropriate to try to cut down the number of those agencies. However, to have one super agency being the sole disburser of grants or financial incentives in the country would, I thought, be wrong.</P>

      <P>As the Minister stated, he gave a mandate for the overall industrial development for overseas industries to the IDA and, indeed, the midwest region.  I concur with the Minister as to the logic of it.  Is the Minister happy with the current approach in the mid-west where there is no office for industrial development for overseas projects and the staffing is co-ordinated from the Dublin office? Does he think the mid-west region is getting a fair crack of the whip at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, because all the work on the ground in that region which would be done in other regions by IDA staff in a regional office is done by the Shannon Development staff who have been established in the region for a very long time and are very experienced in terms of their local knowledge.  To prevent any difficulties or overlaps arising between the two agencies in their respective overseas and domestic capacities, a co-ordinator was appointed whose principal job is to co-ordinate relations and communications between the agencies and to ensure that there is a high degree of liaison.  So far as I can see the coordinator is achieving his objectives and is working very satisfactorily.  There is a high degree of liaison and co-operation between the agencies.  I do not, therefore, think that the region is at any disadvantage. If anything it will now be seen to be at an advantage.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I would use the words, &ldquo;unproductive competition&rdquo; but there has been an excessive proliferation of agencies.  There is an element of overlap which I am trying to reduce.  That is widely recognised by some of the agencies themselves but particularly and overwhelmingly by industrialists or would-be industrialists who find it very difficult to have to deal with such a wide range of agencies.  In so far as there is any element of competition arising, I would certainly seek to discourage it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that in business uncertainty is the enemy of good planning?  Would he further agree, therefore, that it is highly undesirable that having conducted a three year review, reaching some preliminary conclusions, that he should then announce that he is undertaking a further review of industrial policy and institutions?  In view of that would the Minister not agree that it has created an atmosphere within both the industrial promotion agencies and in the business world that people do not know what <Col N="1456" /> exactly will be the long term industrial policy or institutional structure of industrial policy?</P>

      <P>No, a matter as wide-ranging as industrial policy must be kept constantly under review, particularly when we live in a world that is literally changing from day-to-day and where external factors have an enormous input into our economic affairs.  Therefore, I see nothing wrong in saying that we will keep these matters constantly under review, particularly when I think all Members of the House would have to agree that we can hardly claim that over the last 20 or 25 years the instruments of industrial policy in Ireland have been successful, particularly so far as indigenous industry is concerned.</P>

That is where the real difficulty with industrialists lies.  In the same section of the review the Minister refers to the Irish marketing agency and again it is referred to in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Development.</i> Can the Minister say if this will require legislation and, if so, when we might expect that legislation?

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 58 on 5 December 1989, cols. 66, 67 of the Official Report, particularly to the statement that the management of the Companies Office is continually reviewing existing procedures, including the installation of new technology.  While the volume of work has been increasing substantially in recent years, I am informed <Col N="1458" /> that reductions in staffing levels in the Companies Office have somewhat stabilised in recent months.  With a view to addressing the increased workload and thereby improve its service to the public, several initiatives involving the installation of new technology are being taken by the Companies Office.  Most recently, considerable investment is being made in the installation of a document processing system involving the storage on computer of document images.  I am informed that new companies incorporated from May 1990 have been scanned on to the system and an image of each of their Memorandum and Articles of Association is now available on demand.  A high speed scanner is currently being tested which, when put into production, will enable the &ldquo;imaging&rdquo; of all new documents received and their availability for inspection within ten days of delivery.  These images will, I understand, be accessible remotely by means of facsimile machines.  I am hopeful that when the document image processing system is fully operational, Companies Office service to the public will improve considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply concerning new companies incorporated since 1990, but is the Minister aware that the situation is chaotic in the Companies Office as it stands before that, especially arising from the imposition of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986, that there are tens of thousands of returns strewn on the floor in files because there are not enough staff to deal with them; that in fact, if one asks to inspect a file in the Companies Office one is charged a fee of £2, and yet the prospects of getting an up-to-date file, I am reliably advised, are remote; and that the most recent legislation we have put through the House will increase the imposition on the Companies Office?  Is it not high time the Minister took a radical step concerning the staffing levels at the Companies Office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in the staff in the Companies Office of some significance which should <Col N="1459" /> be noted by the Deputy given that the overall number of staff in my Department has had to continue to decrease.  The Deputy will also appreciate that unlike the position of a few years ago there is now considerable electronic aid available to the staff concerned and to the public, and that when this new system is fully operational, which I understand will be by the end of this year, the difficulties, which I accept have been experienced in the last year or two, should very largely then be overcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Obviously some charge has to be made in respect of the inspection of files.  The fact that a particular file may be hopelessly out of date is not necessarily the fault of the Companies Registration Office; it may be the fault of the company itself which may not have filed the returns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 22 together.  Work in my Department is well advanced on the preparation of draft legislation to give effect to Council Directive 87/102/EEC on consumer credit.  The general intent of this legislation will be to lay down rules which will, as far as possible, apply to all agreements under which credit is provided for consumers, including moneylending agreements.</P>
      <P>The main effect of these rules will be to ensure that the consumer, when taking out a loan or otherwise availing of credit, will be given the maximum amount of information possible so that he or she is fully aware of the commitment being undertaken.  The legislation will also lay down rules in relation to such matters as early repayment by the consumer, repossession by the creditor of goods sold on credit, the use of promissory notes, liability for faults in goods sold on credit etc.</P>
      <P>Moneylending is one of the forms of consumer credit which is at present governed by detailed legislation.  It was necessary to review this and other relevant legislation in the light of the measures now being prepared.  In particular I am considering, in consultation with the Minister for Justice, the extent to which the special nature of moneylending as a form of credit needs to be recognised in the new legislation.</P>
      <P>In regard to (d) of Deputy Bell's question I would point out that the European Community Directive does not contain any provision with regard to setting a limit on rates charged for credit.  Some of the provisions of the Moneylenders Acts do relate to maximum rates; this issue is being addressed in the review of those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to (b) and (c) the proposed <Col N="1461" /> legislation will provide for appropriate penalties for breaches of its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for such a detailed reply and for giving us the up-to-date information.  Would the Minister agree that, in the replies to the question I put down on the subject of moneylending to the Ministers for Social Welfare and Justice, they were indicating that the delay in introducing legislation and effective regulations on moneylending was because of delays in the Department of Industry and Commerce?  May I ask the Minister when he expects legislation to be introduced in the House and whether it will put a limit on the interest chargeable on loans by moneylenders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loath to say exactly when legislation will be introduced because I have found from experience that if one makes a promise in all good faith one may not, due to circumstances outside one's control, be able to fulfil it.  I am informed that the work is well advanced on this matter and that there are prospects of the necessary legislation appearing quite soon.  By &ldquo;quite soon&rdquo; I do not mean a matter of weeks; it will probably be a couple of months.</P>
      <P>So far as the question of putting a limit on interest rates is concerned, the Deputy may be aware that under the existing Moneylenders Acts, I think in particular the 1933 Act, there is a limit on rates in percentage terms.  However, difficulties have arisen in regard to this because it is not clear and will have to be worked out by the courts whether the interest rate referred to is a true interest rate or whether it is a flat rate of interest.  There is also a lack of clarity as to the extent to which additional charges may be made for expenses.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Combat Poverty Agency have indicated they believe there are about 500 illegal moneylenders and about 140 legal moneylenders operating in the State?  Does the Minister accept that, as the Moneylenders Acts have been under review since 1987, legislation which would restrict the operations of both legal and illegal moneylenders should be introduced as a matter of urgency so that the issue of additional charges such as collection and service charges which are used by both the legal and illegal moneylenders to boost their rates could be addressed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that this matter has been under review for the past couple of years but it is very complicated. As well as a very detailed and complex European Directive which approaches this issue from a point of view which is somewhat different from ours we also have to take into account the existing legislation here and the manner in which it works.  As the Deputy is probably aware, there have been a number of prosecutions over the past number of years and a number of convictions.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is not enough for the Oireachtas simply to make the regulations ever more stringent on licensed moneylenders.  To do this would just mean fewer licensed moneylenders and more unlicensed moneylenders. A fairly delicate balance has to be achieved and considerable efforts are being made in my Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Justice and Social Welfare, to try to achieve this balance.</P>

May I ask him again to indicate if it is intended to include in the legislation a restriction on the amount of interest charged by moneylenders?

I have already answered the Deputy's second question in my reply to a supplementary from Deputy Bell.  So far as licensed moneylenders are concerned, there is a very strict limit at present in percentage terms on rates.  Deputy De Rossa referred to a case of an unlicensed moneylender.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the way in which the activities of the National Development Corporation and the IDA are to be integrated, in accordance with his statement in December 1990, and if such integration will involve any change in the statutory independence conferred by the Oireachtas on the board of the National Development Corporation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my preface to the <i>Review of Industrial Performance, 1990,</i><Col N="1467" /> I drew attention to the large number of promotional measures which are undertaken by different State agencies in the form of direct financial support of companies and in the provision of advice and information.  In that context, I was conscious that the increasing use of equity by IDA in assisting companies meant that there are certain overlaps between IDA's role and that of the National Development Corporation.  Indeed, in the context of the review I also indicated a decision to move within the next three years to a situation where up to 50 per cent of financial supports to medium-large indigenous industry would be in the form of equity or other remunerating forms of aid.  Such a development could, of course, tend to increase the degree of any existing overlap.</P>
      <P>For this reason, I indicated that, in order to provide a more cohesive and integrated approach to State equity investment in enterprise, the activities of NADCORP and the IDA would be more closely integrated.  The manner of integration is currently being examined by my Department, I intend to have this examination completed in the near future and I will then make an announcement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The statutory independence of NADCORP, to which the Deputy refers, can, of course, only be changed by legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the purposes for which NADCORP make equity investments are different from the purposes for which the IDA make equity injections to companies as part of a grant package?  Will he agree that the culture of the two organisations in regard to their motivation for making equity investments is different as one is a venture capital body and the other an industrial development body?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there has been a certain difference in approach by the two bodies during the short period they have been jointly in existence but that does not create any major problem in trying to bring them closer together in <Col N="1468" /> order that the State would have one &mdash; rather than two &mdash; investment holding bodies of this kind.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I wish to request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest, namely, the decision of the United States and its allies to launch a massive ground war in the Gulf at a time when Iraq has given a <Col N="1573" /> commitment to comply with the United Nations security Council Resolution 660 by withdrawing from Kuwait; the need for the Irish Government to seek a ceasefire and a negotiated end to the conflict in view of the appalling human, economic and ecological consequences of a prolonged war; the need for the Government to reconsider their decision to provide overflight, landing and refuelling facilities for US military aircraft, especially as it is now clear that this war is not covered by any United Nations mandate.  The situation has changed dramatically in the period since the Dáil last debated the matter on 19 January.  Information is now available regarding the operation of the war and the nature of its objectives which were not known to Members of the Dáil at that stage.  In view of this, and especially in view of the launching of the ground war and indeed the news today that Saddam Hussein has begun a withdrawal from Kuwait and, despite this, the fact that the United States and its allies are intent on maintaining the war, it is essential that the Dáil should again discuss the matter.  I therefore urge you to agree to my request.</P>

      <P>I gave you notice a Cheann Comhairle, under Standing Order 30 of my intention to seek the suspension of public business to discuss an important motion which is as follows: That this House views with extreme concern the land war in the Gulf and the decision of the coalition forces to reject the peace plan put forward by the Soviet Government without any serious attempt at negotiation; that this House furthermore recognises that the military objectives of the coalition forces in the Gulf now <Col N="1574" /> clearly exceed the objectives laid down in successful United Nations resolutions. Accordingly this House repudiates the unequivocal statement of support for the land war issued by the Government and demands that the Government ally itself with those countries in the United Nations seeking a negotiated settlement rather than a military victory.

      <P>Sir, I am not denying the fact that you circulated points which indicated the basis on which Standing Order 30 requests could be adjudged, but to find out when exactly they can be accepted seems to be a grave difficulty.  One would have thought this issue of the Gulf War needed to be addressed again by the Dáil.  In any event, I ask you to address that issue at this point.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has made a statement outside this House on the Gulf War, apparently supporting the land war, may I ask him if he will take an opportunity in this House this week to make his statement in the House and enable the Dáil to debate the matter, especially in view of the changes in the situation that have taken place since 19 January when this House took a decision?</P>

      <P>I am trying to be in order, Sir, but a number of events have taken place since we last discussed the Gulf conflict.  On the occasion of our putting down questions the situation was entirely different from what it is now. Even as late as last week the progress on the UN Resolutions was not at the position it is now.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, has given in the name of the Irish people a statement pledging unequivocal support for the Allies, will he now speak in the Dáil and justify his statement?</P>

      <P>The fact is that Deputy McCartan gave the reference, the date and the report of the House which indicated the promised change in the legislation, and despite that you still ruled it out of order.  On a previous occasion recently when this issue was debated also, the Taoiseach indicated that he would implement some system whereby promises made by Ministers in this House at Question Time or in debates in relation to legislation would be drawn together and brought to his notice.  In the interests of clarity, let me ask if that system has yet been introduced by him and when will it be operational?</P>

In any case I have accommodated the House <Col N="1594" /> by giving the position about the legislation if there is any doubt as to whether it is promised or not.  In this particular case, before all this argument developed, I indicated to Deputy McCartan that I would ascertain the position on the legislation for him.  What more is required?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>During my contribution last Thursday I stated that the Sugar Bill was part of an ongoing policy by this Government to privatise our commercial public enterprises, a piecemeal approach to this very important issue.  I stated then and I repeat now that a major debate is required both in and outside this House regarding the benefits to this State of such an approach.</P>
      <P>I strongly oppose this Bill because it proposes to hand over to private interests majority control of this viable, efficient, commercial public enterprise which has been built up over the past 50 years by the sweat and expertise of hundreds of thousands of Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sugar Company was established in 1933.  Notwithstanding the opposition to the proposal at the time Seán Lemass took a very enlightened approach which proved to be a momentous decision on his part.  I wonder what he would now think of current Fianna Fáil policies and whether he would feel he was betrayed in any way?  Since then the Sugar Company has made a very significant contribution to the social and economic life <Col N="1600" /> of rural Ireland particularly in terms of employment and quality of life.  It must be stated, however, that like other State companies the Sugar Company was established against a background of failure by the private sector in this area. If one studies the history of Irish life, particularly the agricultural sector throughout the forties and fifties, one sees that the Sugar Company grew in strength to the benefit of the Irish farmers. The Sugar Company gave employment to people in rural Ireland at a time when there were no other opportunities available to them.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Labour Party are adopting a negative approach in opposing this Bill.  At a time when the Coalition Government are proposing to hand over the majority shareholding in this highly succesful State company to private interests it is appropriate that the contribution made by the workers in this company down through the years is highlighted and recognised by people.  We should not forget that it is their efforts alone which have made this company the highly desirable asset it is today.  Very few people have anything good to say about our State companies and they believe they should be privatised but it should be remembered that it is only because these companies are so successful that private enterprises want to take them over now.  Many people who did not avail of the opportunity to get involved in State companies when they were being set up are now seeking to take them over when history has shown that they can be made viable from an economic point of view.</P>
    <P>Many people in exalted positions have said that all State companies should be privatised.  I want to say clearly that State companies have made a major contribution to the economic development of this State throughout their history.  As I have said before, if we want to privatise State companies we should have a major debate in this House on the merits or otherwise of such a proposal.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that a bias has always existed against the public sector. This has been evident down through the <Col N="1601" /> years in the case of the Sugar Company. For example, not alone were Erin Foods expected to meet their social obligations but they were also expected to balance their books at the end of the day.  Grants which were made available to companies in the private sector were not readily made available to the Sugar Company and Erin Foods.  This prevented the company from making developments which would have given more employment in the food processing sector.  Unfortunately, this meant that the great opportunities which existed in that sector at that time were lost.</P>
    <P>At a time when almost 240,000 people are unemployed in the State and there is a huge level of emigration it behoves Dáil Éireann and the Government to look at the various options available whereby jobs can be provided for our people at home.  I want to point out very clearly that when opportunities were highlighted in the public sector no grant aid was made available to companies unlike the private sector where the IDA provided grants to companies including companies from abroad which set up here.  However, many of those foreign companies left fairly quickly when they did not receive the type of returns they had expected.</P>
    <P>What has brought about this change of policy on the part of Fianna Fáil in regard to our commercial public enterprises?  In their recent election manifestos they have given commitments to preserve and strengthen our commercial State companies. Indeed, while various Ministers stated clearly that they had fudged a little and encouraged a type of privatisation they were adamant that the Fianna Fáil Party would never envisage handing over more than 50 per cent of the shares in a public company to private individuals.  If that was the case then the Progressive Democrats input into this Bill is very obvious.  Since the Progressive Democrats were established they have proposed the sale of most of our semi-State companies, in many cases to the highest bidder.  Given the about turn by Fianna Fáil on the issue of privatisation and their proposal to hand over more than 50 per cent of the shares in the Sugar Company <Col N="1602" /> to private concerns I wonder how the employees in some other State companies feel at present.  I wonder how the employees in Aer Lingus feel about the commitments which have been given in regard to that company, It will be interesting to see the further developments in regard to that company.</P>
    <P>I note from the various annual reports that the Sugar Company have made significant profits, particularly since 1986. In the 1990 annual report the managing director of the Sugar Company, Christopher Comerford, reported that in the period 1989-90 the company had achieved record levels of turnover and profitability.  Profits before tax were almost £22 million, an increase of 4.86 per cent on the previous year.  Profits have been increasing steadily in recent years.  Profitability was recorded in the various sectors within the Sugar Company. For example, in the Sugar sector operating profits were £17.7 million, an increase of 18 per cent on the previous year.  Further profits were reported in the agri-trade division, the animal feeds section and the agri-chemical section, to name but a few.  Profits were made by the company through diversification.  The staff took an interest in and gave a commitment to the company.  Through their efforts the company succeeded in making a profit and can now look forward to the future.  The commitment of the workers has to be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>In the light of this report and indeed reports from previous years the question must be posed, why privatise now.  I have my own ideas on this.  A small group of people feel that is the way to go, that is the way to develop.  They feel they can now move in and make a profit.  It disturbs me somewhat that this Government readily look across the water and adopt the conservative policies of England, policies that have not always proved successful.  I would ask them to reconsider their attitude to this matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the terms of reference and indeed the composition of the Government's <i>ad hoc</i> committee who <Col N="1603" /> examined the future of the Sugar Company. They were asked to consider three main options: the <i>status quo</i>, full privatisation or partial privatisation of the company.  In my opinion this was a totally unacceptable way of evaluating the future direction of the company and setting in place precedents that would be followed in the future in assessing the merits for privatising other State companies. I repeat once again that a wider debate is required on this most important matter.  Privatisation is a fancy word for taking something that belongs to the public and handing it over to a very small number of private individuals who can make a profit from it.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that, given the numbers of Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House, with the support of the Fine Gael Deputies, this Bill will be carried.  The question I would ask is why we must hand over a 55 per cent share in the company to private interests.  I look forward to the comments of the Minister for Agriculture and Food on this matter.  The Labour Party will be proposing amendments recommending that majority shareholding of the company remain in State ownership, in the interests of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us does not adequately meet the concerns of the existing workforce. I note that the Sugar Company have given a commitment to give a written guarantee in regard to continuity of employment, to negotiating wages and conditions of employment, to the recognition of trade unions and so on. However, if this Bill goes through in its present form, the State will retain only a 45 per cent share in the company.  In view of this it is imperative that the guarantees given to the workforce be incorporated in the Bill.  I do not have to suggest to the trade union people the importance of this.  The Bill as it stands does not go far enough to meet the commitments given.</P>
    <P>I believe the minimum requirement of controlling interests will not be met.  The assets of the company which have been built up over the years by the hard work and expertise of thousands of Irish people <Col N="1604" /> will be handed over.  I would ask the Minister when replying to expand on his proposals for a stock market floation.  I would also ask him to say how he proposes to spend the money that will accrue from the sale of the company.  Given the economic position I would urge that the money is not wasted for short term political gain.  Does the Minister propose to put some of the money back into the agricultural and horticultural industry? These are some of the questions that have to be answered.  The Labour Party have no hesitation in saying that the Bill as it stands does not meet the requirements of the workforce.  We hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will take on board some of the amendments we intend to put forward so that the Bill as enacted will be more realistic.  I want to convey once again that I and the Labour Party are opposed to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>One may ask why, as a city Deputy, I am interested in the Sugar Company or in the semi-privatisation of that company.  In my youth I spent a lot of time with my nose against sugar beet, and that has left an indelible impression on me.  Listening to people talking about the privatisation of the Sugar Company reminds me of being on my knees in fields trying to thin out rows of beet, not a very pleasant occupation on a wet summer's day.  I do not want to go back too far but machinery was not available in those days.  I think that aspect might have led to the closure of the Tuam Sugar Factory because the farmers in that area were not prepared to put up with the slavery and sheer hard work of trying to grow beet in boggy grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Ryan's Second Stage speech.  One could agree with much of it.  He posed questions but, to misquote Drummond, &ldquo;opinions have their rights but they also have their duties&rdquo;.  The Deputy, while saying that privatisation of this company is not right, did not say what is right, what will make the Sugar Company a better company, working better for the Irish people and <Col N="1605" /> the workforce.  The Deputy talked eloquently about the workers in the company, and he was quite right, but he forgot to mention the management.  The two go hand in hand.  The workers can work all the hours God sends them but if the management is not up to scratch the company &mdash; any company, not just the Sugar Company &mdash; are in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back to the genesis of the Sugar Company.  It was founded to do three things, to provide a market for a cash crop for farmers, to provide employment and to reduce our dependency on foreign imports.  We could do that relatively easily at the time because the structure could take advantage of the tariff wall which we built around the Twenty-six Counties.  Times have changed and, to all intents and purposes, the tariff wall has gone.  At the end of 1992 or at the beginning of 1993 the Sugar Company will be exposed to the full blast of competition.  Let us look at the type of competition they will face.  In the general sugar market we are now down to two or three major players in the EC.  France has one sugar factory for the whole country, just think of the economies of scale there.  We had four factories but we now have only two.</P>
    <P>The former Eastern Germany has now joined the EC and its agriculture is not backward, regardless of what one reads in the newspapers.  We are again talking about economies of scale, the former East Germany is the main root crop growing area and will remain so in the EC.  When the farms of 2,000 to 3,000 hectares get their act together they will really provide competition; they could literally flood the market.  We must also consider Poland and Czechoslovakia, the latter country is the home of sugar beet production.  Indeed the earliest technicians who came to Ireland to set up the sugar company plants in Mallow were Czechoslovaks.  They brought the technology with them in the early thirties and I am sure that they have not been idle over the last 40 years; I am sure they have developed their systems and technology. Czechoslovakia, Austria and Poland are knocking on the door of Europe and they <Col N="1606" /> will be a force to be reckoned with in the future.  In that context we must gear ourselves to face the full blast of competition. While we are talking about the history of the company it would be remiss of me not to mention the unnamed men and women who manned the factories and kept them going.  They provided the Sugar Company &mdash; this is something I would still be looking for &mdash; with a regional underpinning to the social structure in the thirties and forties which only they could have provided.</P>
    <P>The ITGWU made a submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies and I will quote one paragraph:</P>
    <P>The Irish Sugar Company has made major contributions to regional development in employment creation, in the profitable crop which it has purchased from farmers and the spin-off effects of this income generation to traders and others.  The contribution by the Irish Sugar Company to gross domestic product is substantial each year.  This contribution is made through factor payments which include profit, rent, interest payment and labour costs.  This contribution to GDP by the Irish Sugar Company amounted to nearly £50 million in the year 1986-87.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that labour costs are the largest item in factor payments and that these have decreased in recent years.  Indeed, in 1986-87, they were at the same level as in 1980-81.  The fall in the Sugar Company's contribution to GDP has had an adverse effect on regional development and on the incomes of those in areas in which their factories were &mdash; or are &mdash; located.  For this reason it is vitally important that decisions on the future of the Sugar Company's operations should be guided by criteria other than crude book-keeping.  Cost benefit analysis of the company's contribution to the overall economy, which takes in the loss in taxation from the workers' wages, the payment in social welfare, medical cards, differential rates reductions, psychological effects of unemployment <Col N="1607" /> and the loss of income through the multiplier effort to others indirectly employed must all be considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Finance is retaining a 45 per cent share in the company.  However, it is not clear from a perusal of the Bill whether the company, when set up, can be called to account by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  Will the committee be able to call management to account for their stewardship of what, after all, is a national asset? This vital matter must be addressed.  The Sugar Company reaches through all layers of society, rural and urban.  I am talking about what Damon Runyon referred to as the historical present. Things are rapidly changing; down what road should the Sugar Company go?  I have heard it said in this House that the sale of shares in the Sugar Company will realise approximately £200 million although I am open to correction in this regard.  What will happen to this money? Will it be used to pay off the State debt? Will some of it be ploughed back into &mdash; as it is now &mdash; Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta to develop related industries? The Sugar Company's quota is due for review in two year's time.  Any sugar which we produce over and above the quota must be sold on the open market outside Europe where the prices for sugar are a lot lower.  Will this money go back to the company to develop downstream industries?</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company should be getting into related businesses; they know about sugar and selling it.  They also know about convenience foods but they should not be involved in engineering or areas of this kind which require totally different expertise.</P>
    <P>There is a market for high grade consumer foods and it is this area with which the Sugar Company should become involved.  Sugar &mdash; unless you are a dentist &mdash; has a good name and a clean image. On the Continent of Europe Irish food has this image but we are such a small player that others can literally steal our advertising or its image.  I remember one <Col N="1608" /> morning buying butter &mdash; Kerrygold &mdash; in a supermarket in Spain; beside it I saw a carton of milk which was packaged in the very same Kerrygold colour. Although it did not bear the name &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; I thought it was Irish.  I turned the carton over and I saw that the milk had come from Germany.  Its packaging was Irish, complete with shamrocks, not overdone.  It struck me that the German company realised that Ireland has something to sell, a clean image.  They cerainly jumped on the bandwagon in this regard.</P>
    <P>I contacted An Bord Bainne and was told that they could do nothing about the problem.  At the moment we use the name &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; on milk-related products. Maybe we should look at this name again to see if we could use it on other branded products because that is the way forward.  Branded products will command a premium price and will be instantly recognisable as first class, high quality foods.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill goes through I hope ideas like this will be discussed and debated in the Dáil Chamber so that we can tease them out.  The amount of money we are talking about seems large by our standards, but it is not.  It will be a minnow in the EC pool and unless management are careful the company will be driven to the wall.  I am sorry to harp on this, but all depends on management, the decisions they take and what they do with the money they raise on this future privatisation.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance of the day, whoever they are, must keep an eye on what is going on and ensure that we get value for money and expand the potential in our image and on our foods.  After all, if we continue rationalising businesses we will be left with one factory, or maybe no factory, with the loss of all the underpinning these industries provide.</P>
    <P>This measure provides one more opportunity for an Irish company to compete on an international level.  Recently another businessman in the food industry tried it and due to circumstances beyond many people's control, he failed. <Col N="1609" /> However, that does not make the dream unviable.  In fact, if we do not try to put flesh, bones and clothing on this dream, we will be relegated to the backwater of European life in the food production area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, emphatically oppose this Bill.  This Bill is clearly very similar to the Government's proposals in the case of Irish Life.  However, I would like to compliment the management and staff of the Sugar Company for their excellent financial results disclosed in the 1990 annual report.  It is particularly inappropriate that we should be doing what we are doing here through the programme of closures and centralisation when the success of the company has been made possible by the sacrifices of workers and farmers.  In many areas farmers have been deprived of the option of growing one of the few profitable alternatives to cereal crops, being pushed relentlessly towards monoculture with all its environmental problems.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, due to short-sightedness in years gone by, we do not even have a decent rail network to transport the beet over distances thereby reducing costs all round and, of course, there is the environmental damage due to excessive use of the road network.</P>
      <P>We in the Green Party believe the Thurles sugar factory should never have been closed.  Forty per cent of the processing plants in Europe process less than 5,000 tonnes per day, which was the throughput of Thurles, and they operate profitably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are TDs sitting in the Dáil today because they promised to keep the Thurles factory open.  Why did they break their promises and contribute instead to the deterioration of the surrounding agricultural community?  Was it the lure of selling a company which has a monopoly not only in contracting the crop with farmers but in the supply and price of seed, fertiliser and chemical sprays for that crop?  Farmers, workers and consumers are already suffering, and will continue to suffer, from the restructuring <Col N="1610" /> of the Goodman Group.  Will safeguards be built in to prevent a similar situation in this company or will another factory be closed should it be judged to be uneconomic within the artificial criteria used by private enterprise?  What guarantee will farmers have of fair payment when yet again they are forced to deal with a monopolistic private company?  Hardly a season goes by without some major controversy on basic issues such as sugar content, the monitoring of tare, access to information, etc.  One of the reasons for the substantial profits of the company is the way tare is now processed.  This is an absolute rip off of the sugar growers to the extent of at least £6 million a year.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a golden share.  However, he must surely be aware that the industrial mandarins of the EC intend scrapping all such shares in their quest for control.  It is really being used as a fig leaf by this centralist Thatcherite Government who, oddly enough, seem to have a total lack of concern about possible foreign takeovers.  Can the Minister ensure that the present sugar quota will remain in this country, as it would seem to be under threat of export from several sources such as the Single Market after 1992 as well as foreign takeovers? We suggest that the growers should be given more control over the quota, possibly as an option or even direct ownership.</P>
    <P>If this company are privatised, there is a very real possibility that the new company would import cheap sugar from Third World countries which would have a devastating effect on the industry.  Once profit becomes the sole criterion, there is no saying where this could leave the industry.</P>
    <P>The usual glib remarks by established politicians about expanding the food and vegetable processing activities of the company must sound very hollow indeed to the people of Tuam and Thurles who are still waiting for their promised jobs, but they are treated with scepticism by farmers and growers throughout the country who remember the last time they invested time, money and effort into such undertakings only to suffer when these <Col N="1611" /> options were snatched from them due to lack of long term planning in the whole agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>The Green Party are not in favour of State enterprise; <i>per se,</i> in fact very much the opposite.  However, privatisation is not the answer, especially for a large company like the Sugar Company which will be in a monopoly situation.  All interested parties in the Sugar Company, that is, the employees, the growers, the consumers and the community, should have a say in the running of this company. The growers need a fair price for their produce; the consumer needs a reasonable purchase price for sugar; and the employees need real industrial democracy to recognise their contribution to the industry.  The workers must receive more than just a wage in any newly structured Sugar Company.  They must have full participation in management decisions and a share of the profits.  The company need to be restructured to respect the needs of these separate interests.</P>
    <P>Another matter which must not be overlooked is a thorough examination of the ancillary companies controlled by or associated with the Irish Sugar Company. Many of these companies integrate naturally into the Sugar Company's operations, nevertheless a fresh look needs to be taken in the context of privatisation. In particular the recent acquisition of a 50 per cent interest in Odlums, the flour millers, seems to indicate that the company are seeking to emulate the Goodman Group in becoming a broadly based food industry with all the connotations for a possible future monopoly.</P>
    <P>This is a unique opportunity to set up a completely different structure for a semi-State company like the Sugar Company. Therefore, I ask the Minister to withdraw this Bill to enable these ideas to be considered further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised at some of the things Deputy Garland has just said.  I respect and listen to Deputy Garland's contributions.  They are usually <Col N="1612" /> more thoughtful and weighted than, certainly, his closing comments.  To be critical of a company such as this for their wish to become a broadly based industry is contrary to what is suggested as being commercially wise and prudent.</P>
      <P>State enterprises represent one of the most prolific experiments in public administration in the past 50 years.  There have been two great waves, one into State enteprises where the State has become more and more involved in the market for a variety of reasons, and then an international movement of the State out of the marketplace.  We should not consider privatising a company operating in the State sector or nationalising a company operating in the private sector solely because of some trend which has been observed in international affairs.  It is logical, however, to see that there is a natural cycle in the life of any State enterprise. A State enterprise is nurtured; it grows and develops and if it is prudent in its affairs it can be launched into the private marketplace.  There is nothing wrong with that.  There is nothing about that scenario which is inherently right either.  Each case must be regarded on its merits.</P>
      <P>Oddly enough, with regard to State enterprises, broadly speaking, parties of the left seem to claim State enterprises as an invention of their own.  The reality is that State enterprise, outside the Eastern bloc countries, has been distributed very widely, particularly in Europe, among countries irrespective of the ideology of their Governments.  Sweden, for example, a country which generally has Government of the Left has had very little State enterprise, whereas Austria in contrast, in terms of OECD countries, has probably more State enterprise than any other, yet that is not a reflection of the political flavour of Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons why states become involved in the marketplace and ideology is just one of them.  The failure of private enterprise is another reason why states become involved in the marketplace. Here we have examples of that. The ACC and the ICC were examples of companies set up because the private <Col N="1613" /> sector bankers were not prepared in the early years of the State to take the risk and support Irish agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>History, too, has been the creator of many state enterprises, particularly in mainland Europe where the prerogative of kings has passed on to democratic states.  For example, alcohol, tobacco and salt monopolies are to be found around the world and they are really the inheritance of collapsed monarchies.  Quasi-tax reasons is another basic reason for the state becoming involved in state enterprises, as is the idea that there is a resource which should be exploited for the common good and the best way to exploit that resource to bring the maximum benefit to the people of the country is through a state enterprise.</P>
    <P>In the sixties and seventies there was a blossoming worldwide of state oil enterprises. These were agencies set up by Governments to exploit a wasting resource which it was felt the private sector would not yield to the maximum benefit to the states in question.  Accidents of war are another reason.  In France in particular a great deal of enterprise owned by the State was inherited by the State, or rather was taken over by the State at the end of the last war and the preceding war.  Chemical and automobile industries in France have largely become nationalised on that basis.  There is also what economists refer to as the dying duck rationale.  This is the cynical abuse of state enterprise where governments intervene to save a dying enterprise at least until after the next election.  This, of course, is a very costly way of supporting private enterprise failures.</P>
    <P>Employment creation is the more positive side of the same thing.  We have had many examples of state enterprise being created here to assist employment by developing an industrial base.  As in the case of Aramara Teoranta, companies were kept in place by the State in order to provide employment or to protect employment.  We have this in the case of Irish Life as well.  The nine companies that were going to the wall when Irish Life was first set up had a significant <Col N="1614" /> employment content, and the argument put forward in the Dáil to support this was for employment creation or employment protection.</P>
    <P>Resource development is another reason very commonly associated with the creation of State enterprises in Ireland.  The Sugar Company very much a company that fall into that category. Like Bord na Móna and the ESB, the Sugar Company were regarded in their day as helping to develop a resource. Financial re-adaptation where companies get into difficult financial circumstances is another reason for the State moving in.</P>
    <P>The reason I have listed this chronicle of rationale for State enterprises is to make the point that there is a variety of reasons why the State should intervene in the marketplace and why it makes good sense for the State to take over and develop an enterprise.  In general, in Ireland we have been very fortunate. Since the foundation of the State our State enterprises have contributed to a very considerable degree to the development of the economic life of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company are one of those companies.  They were originally founded to bring industry and employment to parts of the country where there was not an industrial base, to secure employment in other parts of the country and to provide a specific cash crop for small farmers in the west.  When the Irish Sugar Company were created, those were prudent sound reasons socially, politically and economically for the creation of a State enterprise. However, as with many of the other reasons why State enterprises have been created here and elsewhere, circumstances change and history marchaes on.  The Sugar Company have had a very troubled past in recent times possibly because over the years they were encouraged to expand, to become involved in regional policy issues, to dramatically expand employment potential and they were encouraged by the State to move out of sugar and into other food processing. The problem over all the years the Sugar Company operated, like so many other State enterprises, was that <Col N="1615" /> our ambitions for the State enterprise surpassed our capacity to capitalise the venture, to expand and let the venture grow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>Political will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just political will. If it were just a matter of political will resources would have been there.  There is a small problem.  There is no tooth fairy to provided the sort of cash inputs an enterprise like this needs to fulfil its full potential in the economy.  We all recognise that there is a problem.  There has been a cycle in this industry.  At the moment for instance we know that domestic consumption of sugar is declining dramatically.  There is a need to enter into the non-sugar sweeteners market.  It is interesting that a couple of years ago when we could have bolstered the Sugar Company by moving a major producer of non-sugar sweeteners into the sugar company, Wheat Industries Ltd., which at that time was owned by the State and which is the first example of privatisation in the past 15 years, we disastrously sold off Wheat Industries Ltd.  We gave it away for its written-down asset value. That decision was taken by another Government.  I do not introduce it to be controversial but to make the point that when we hear people from Labour and some contributors from Fine Gael speaking on this Bill, they are being a little disingenuous to say the least.  The reality is that the Sugar Company have weathered many storms and Deputy Garland was quite correct when he said that they have turned round.  The industry has been turned around over the past few years at considerable cost to the people of Thurles, Tuam and the workers in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago when the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies met with the Sugar Company and met, over a series of meetings, with the management of the Sugar Company, the argument continually came forward that the company had grown to a point of maturity where it was now ready to be launched into the private <Col N="1616" /> market.  The argument was put forward that the best way forward for this company, the best way they could be developed, the best way they could utilise their levy, the best way they could secure the employment and well-being of their workforce, was by moving out from the protection of the State and into the private sector where some additional injections of capital and cash could be put into it.</P>
    <P>It is in fulfilment of those particular wishes which have been expressed by management and middle management and, in fact, expressed privately by workers within the company, that this Bill; is introduced.  It is not a nefarious piece of legislation aimed at selling off part of the family jewels in order to raise cash; it is a sensible piece of legislation which is introduced to allow the Minister to invite private capital participation in this enterprise.  If we were all being objective and if instead of political agenda we had a logical economic and social agenda for this company, we would accept that this is the way the Sugar Company have to move.</P>
    <P>I have no particular ideological commitment to the concept of State enterprise. I do, however, believe that State enterprise has served this country well. State enterprise over the years has devoured a great deal of capital and all too often in some State enterprises there has been an element of featherbedding, of back sliding, of comfort, which would not exist were those enterprises to operate with private shareholding.  I do not believe that the Sugar Company was one of those enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company played a very brave role in the development of Ireland, particularly in the fifties and sixties when they were on an expansionary trial.  It is a pity we did not have the sense and foresight to channel their energies and enthusiasms in the right direction.  Fundamental mistakes were made by successive Governments of different hues by not properly capitalising the enterprise.</P>
    <P>We cannot change the past, all we can do now is influence the future.  If the Sugar Company is to develop, expand <Col N="1617" /> and become a meaningful player in a European market which is increasingly difficult then they must get capital injections from somewhere.  It is obvious in a State that has eschewed the way of public sector borrowing, that has limited taxation capacity, and has very few reserves, that the only way this company can expand or develop is if the Minister is given the power by the Dáil to invite in private sector funds and private sector capital.</P>
    <P>One argument which has been made from time to time &mdash; and I admit that I have made this point myself &mdash; about the privatisation route is that our markets and Stock Exchange are so small that it would have difficulty digesting some of our State enterprises.  This argument was put forward in the case of Irish Life but it can also be put forward in the case of this company.  When one looks behind that argument at the level of investment, particularly being made by institutional investors here and abroad, it is obvious that within the public of Ireland as represented by various financial institutions and by private investors, the capacity to privatise this company is there.  The only issue that will remain at that stage will be to strike a proper price for the company. That is always a difficult judgment.</P>
    <P>I have felt in other countries &mdash; and in the only case of privatisation that I am familiar with in detail in this country, Wheat Industries &mdash; that there have been mistakes made on pricing.  I would hope that we would be more prudent and that we will learn from the mistakes of others in this regard.  I cannot see how we will serve the sacrifice that is being made by the people who have given so much to turn this company around if we hide our heads in the sand and argue that there is any easy option for assisting this company other than by going the route which is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a modest one.  It is not overly dramatic.  The arguments can be mustered very successfully in favour of letting the Sugar Company go the way that its management has been asking for the last four or five years.  I do not believe that the workers have anything to fear <Col N="1618" /> from this Bill and I certainly do not believe that the producers of beet and the suppliers to the company have anything to fear.  It is more than a little irresponsible that people without a shred or scintilla of evidence put forward arguments and suggestions that the workers will lose out badly.  The only way the workers within the Sugar Company will lose out badly is if their future and their interests are not properly and honestly secured and the only way we can secure their future is by injecting additional money into the company.</P>
    <P>It is important that the company be released now.  The management of this company and other State enterprises have come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies in the past three or four years and argued that they feel they are fettered and constrained in the State sector.  I do not accept that argument on each occasion when it is put forward but I do think that the management within the Sugar Company have proved in the past few years that they have a workforce and a capacity to turn the company around to make it very viable within the food sector and to make it a company we would be proud of.  I have no doubt at all that this company will have a very bright future.</P>
    <P>We should not come in here and cloak our opposition to this Bill in spurious arguments.  Arguments have been put forward by the Minister, and the arguments of logic are in favour of moving in the direction proposed in the Sugar Bill, 1990, and I am pleased to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity that this legislation will give the Irish Sugar Company fairly and squarely to face up to competition which, would drown them had it not come at this stage.  The future of any company, particularly the Irish Sugar Company, if starved of much needed investment funds would be very bleak indeed.  It would be unreasonable to expect the Irish taxpayer to fund such an arrangement.  I do not see in the present financial situation how we could ask the taxpayer for the type of funding that will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> It is very important to point out that it was by the grace of God in years past that international trading in sugar did not point its competitive ways to Ireland. There was a time a few years ago when French sugar was delivered and sold in Irish supermarkets at less than the cost at which we could produce it.  That was a hair raising experience for the producers of sugar and, obviously, it had all to do with keeping costs down.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that in European terms we are talking about a very small company.  By Irish standards they are quite a large company.  As somebody who grew beet for this country over the years I have a great deal of respect for some of the things that the Sugar Company tried to do in rural Ireland. However, great care must be taken about the way the company are privatised in the context of the checks and balances that are being proposed.  I cannot claim to be a professional in company law but from past experience I would question the golden share, the Government proposal to shed control over certain aspects of the operations of the Sugar Company with the Government having a lot less than 50 per cent.  I sincerely hope I am wrong.  In a few moments I will outline a likely scenario.</P>
    <P>Many would say privately that they bemoan the passing of the Sugar Company as they know it.  Like everything else the new order takes a bit of getting used to.  I will have a lot to say about the workers in Tuam in a moment.  They have a real problem.  Can they expect the same procedures to be adopted when there are different people at the helm?  The people who put their money into this company will want their pound of flesh.  When they buy shares in the company they will want their profit, and that is what it is all about. I have met a goodly number of workers who are genuinely upset.  Let us suppose that nothing is done and the Sugar Company are allowed to trundle on as they were.  Then they would have an even bigger problem.</P>
    <P>There is room for concern for farmers <Col N="1620" /> too.  Our beet quota is extremely important to us.  As with the milk quota, and every other quota, who knows exactly what will come out of the common agricultural policy discussions?  Nobody in the country knows one iota of what is happening because the agenda is written elsewhere, but that is a debate for another day.  The farmers were for a long time the poor relation of the Sugar Company and the profit margins in beet production were poor.  There was not always much consideration for the primary producer but a lot of consideration for management and the labour relations side of things.  Not much attention was given to the people who, when things were not as mechanised as they are now, went out and did the work &mdash; and it was a laborious industry at that stage.  Times change and there is now mechanisation.</P>
    <P>Beet is an important rotational crop in farming.  The better beet growing areas consist of the more fertile lands in the country and it is a high cash crop for farmers.  I believe that a multi-national food company will have an interest in it and I sincerely hope there will be a mechanism to ensure that the profits cannot be moved out of the country.  I have heard nothing from the Minister, and have read nothing in the various communiques issued, that would lead me to believe that is guaranteed.  I do not think it can be quaranteed in so far as we do not know what the future will bring.  I would like to see much clearer evidence of our ability to control what will happen in regard to beet quotas and contracts.</P>
    <P>Although his style did not particularly suit my part of the country, I have to give credit where credit is due and say that Chris Comerford gave great leadership. He has put a lot of time and effort into the Sugar Company.  It is ironic that so many people had to lose their jobs in Tuam and Thurles to arrive at some of the new profit margins, and I will come back to that in a few moments.  Given the right mix of investment and company leadership the Sugar Company can be a great force in the development of agriculture in the future.  In the time of the late General Costello there was a buzz <Col N="1621" /> about the Sugar Company.  I was a lot younger then than I am now and it appeared at that time that the Sugar Company had taken on a whole new social dimension.  It will be remembered by people who were in the service at the time that there were many forays into all sorts of sideline activities.  I could talk about Gowna farm near Ballyforan, Erin Foods, the potato factory in Tuam and many others all over Ireland.  Unfortunately, many of them had slow and painful deaths.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy know why the Tuam potato plant closed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  It closed and so did the sugar factory.  While the initial ideas were always good and technology was not there and they had not the ability to change quickly enough with the times. One other thing I will always associate with the Irish Sugar Company is their belief in the contracting system between the growers on the one hand and the processors on the other.</P>
      <P>I do not think we should get too carried away with it because I have often said it was something we should have extended between farmers and processors.  I am afraid, however, that it was a captive market.  Where else could one go with a lorry load of sugar beet except to a sugar factory?  Where else could one go with milk other than to a creamery?  However, when one got the chance of going into sheep or cattle there were one thousand and one other places and one went to the highest bidder.  While the Sugar Company could take great credit for the contracting arrangements it was difficult enough to extend them to other areas of farming operations although they are badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the traditional base the Sugar Company had in rural Ireland, they were trusted.  They were a force for change, a vehicle for progress.  I see the Minister for Agriculture and Food here and, while I am not in the mood to criticise this evening, I have to say that despite all his best efforts it is very difficult to do the things here <i>vis-á-vis</i> the <Col N="1622" /> Sugar Company that should be done.  I always thought the Sugar Company, all things being equal, were more likely than any other company to be a remarkable force.  Somehow or another they ran out of steam.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Roche that we must think about the future now.  The new Sugar Company will have to be very cost effective.  They will have to be competitive on the international scene.  It will not be enough to be competitive here. We are a very small market community and obviously we will have to hitch our star to a much wider sky altogether.  In my view it is likely that a multinational company will be involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to something which is parochial because this is the only chance I will ever get of putting it on the record of the House.  A black mark against the Sugar Company and its major shareholder &mdash; the Government &mdash; concerns what I can only call a breach of promise regarding the company's withdrawal from sugar manufacturing in Tuam.  I want to put on the record today that Tuam did not get one single replacement job since the harvest of 1986-87 when the sugar factory there closed.  I defy contradiction on that from anybody, from any side of this House, from the IDA, the county development team and the Sugar Company themselves.  Five years later all we have got is the promise to build an advance factory.  I notice that the Minister led off with that.  There is one vitally important point about the Sugar Company's withdrawal from Tuam and I am sure the position is the same for Thurles but I do not know the background details.  When any town loses a long-established traditional industry words cannot explain or express the trauma of the fall-out.  In fact, Tuam will never be the same again.</P>
    <P>There were great behind-the-scenes negotiations to ensure that the Sugar Company did not walk away scot free from Tuam in late 1986.  At that time I was junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture and I represented East Galway &mdash; where Tuam is located &mdash; on <Col N="1623" /> that occasion.  I had a meeting with the Chief Executive of the Sugar Company who, I have no doubt whatever, was working on the instructions of his board to guarantee the sum of £2 million to Tuam as the cost of their withdrawal from the town.  I want to say that publicly on the Floor of this House.  This investment was to come in the shape of a high technology meat processing plant where the Sugar Company would canvass for a processor in conjunction with the IDA.  The meeting which was private took place in a Dublin hotel.  On that occasion I was shown a sketch of the proposed building and was told what was to be manufactured there.  I was almost told who would be involved in it.  At any rate I was left in no doubt whatever that the total commitment by the Sugar Company to Tuam, among other things that are long past and gone, of £2 million would be made available.  I have to say that in the intervening years, unfortunately for us, fate and Larry Goodman intervened and we know the Government bent over backwards to facilitate the beef baron. His project was stillborn, he never came to Tuam and, obviously, after the events of the last couple of years he never will come to Tuam.  The problem is that almost five years later the Government and the Sugar Company are taking credit for the provision of a 20,000 square foot advance factory when we have had an advance factory in the town for ten years for which we have not been able to find an occupant.  However, there may be better prospects of attracting industry to a town where there is an advance factory available than to a town where there is no such facility.  I understand that building will commence within a couple of months but that the factory will be no different from the advance factory on the Dunmore Road.</P>
    <P>This new building will cost the Sugar Company between £200,000 and £250,000.  That will be their investment in Tuam.  I should like to put it on the record that I hold the Sugar Company and the Government responsible for the <Col N="1624" /> other £1.8 million.  The reason I am raising this point is that it can only be delivered, as solemnly promised five years ago, before privatisation takes place.  I do not expect the new financiers who will get involved in the Sugar Company to be one bit concerned about what happened in Tuam, County Galway, in 1986-87; that would be the least of their worries. I was one of the participants at that meeting, which was attended by the chief executives, it is not that I heard about it, that I was written to about it or that I got a telephone call about it.  I believe the chief executive meant what he said at that time.  I should like to say to the Minister that it is up to the Government, as the major shareholder, to ensure that the Sugar Company will actually carry out their solemn promise to Tuam.  It is the only chance for the community in Tuam who lost 300 or 400 jobs and several part-time jobs.  At one stage 700 people were working either directly or indirectly in the Sugar Company there.  It is incumbent, irrespective of what way you look at it, that that £1.8 million be delivered to Tuam, specifically for job creation.  I hope that when the Minister stands up to reply he will give us an indication that the Government do intend, as the major shareholder, to hold the company to that promise.</P>
    <P>I want to say also that there is grave concern in Tuam at present regarding Tuam Engineering.  As the Minister is aware this is a subsidiary of the Sugar Company.  There are all sorts of rumours about takeovers but one way or another I should like to say that the workforce in Tuam Engineering are less than enthusiastic about the privatisation proposals because they are not able to get a word from anybody as to what their future is likely to be.  I hope they will not be sold down the Swannee as were the workers in Erin Foods, followed by the workers in the sugar factory.  I hope this matter will be addressed on Committee and Report Stage because the fears and anxieties of those concerned should be taken note of and we should, at least, be given some indication of what proposals <Col N="1625" /> the Sugar Company have for Tuam Engineering.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the privatisation proposals I would like to refer to but time is running out.  From a national point of view it is a gigantic leap for a company, such as the Sugar Company, to be privatised and to swim in much deeper and more dangerous waters.  However, if this were not to take place they would drown in shallow waters.  I am confident that they will be able to capitalise on this development and get the type of investment that is absolutely necessary for a food company. I believe they will be able to expand into many areas in the whole food industry.  I cannot think of a vehicle that is more likely to be successful.</P>
    <P>I know that the company's record shows that over the years some of their endeavours were not well thought out. They were certainly not well researched because they met with a very poor response, but one can also argue that they were imaginative, that the company were prepared to take risks.  I hope that that type of verve which was characteristic of the Sugar Company over the years will be maintained.  I know the workers and the farmers are worried and I would have concern for them but all I can say at this stage from what I know of the company and from what I see of international competition is that this is the only hope the company will have of attracting new financial investment and ensuring they are in a position to compete with the best in Europe or the world for that matter.  What happened to the factories in Tuam and Thurles may happen to the other two factories &mdash; there is nothing to suggest that we will only have one sugar factory.  I hope that will not happen but it could.</P>
    <P>As I said, I hope the golden share will be as important as the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food have led us to believe.  I cannot see how it will be that important in practice, but I hope it will be.  I welcome the Bill in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with what Deputy Connaughton said about <Col N="1626" /> the scandalous manner in which Tuam has been reneged on by the Government, I would say, rather than by the Sugar Company.  Deputy Connaughton referred to the period during which he was junior Minister.  I was in Tuam at that time on behalf of my union, the ITGWU as it was then, when Mark Killilea, representing the Fianna Fáil Party, was being extremely vociferous &mdash; I certainly found it very difficult to keep pace with him &mdash; about what was going to be done for Tuam and the workers at Tuam by the Fianna Fáil Party when they were returned to power.  It is a matter of concern that the promises, such as they were, which were entered into in such a firm fashion have not been honoured and that Tuam &mdash; I do not want to use any emotive terms &mdash; has been treated so shabbily and left in a very bad way in terms of employment arising from that closure and the subsequent broken promises. Even though there are two Government Ministers from the area, it is a cause of great concern to anybody who visits Tuam to see it has been reduced to the status of an outpost of Galway.  People try to find jobs in Galway, socialise there and Tuam, which was such a thriving town, has been reduced to its present quiet status.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Deputy Connaughton that the Sugar Company cannot be allowed to trundle on as they have been doing, having regard to the threat posed by international market conditions and the fact that they would be a very small company in that international perspective. While I recognise the necessity for the Sugar Company to be competitive, efficient and so on, I cannot understand how we make the leap from there to agreeing with the measure before the House to sell off a majority stake in the Sugar Company.  I cannot appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, I am puzzled by the contribution of Deputy Roche who rambled on, as we all have come to recognise and dread, giving us a lecture about the role of State enterprise in Ireland.  We all have our views on the role of State enterprise in Ireland.  Perhaps he is right that not all <Col N="1627" /> the State companies were as efficient and well managed as they ought to be.  They certainly were not as well funded as they ought to be and virtually all of them have a debt equity ratio which is a fundamental problem for them.  Having regard to the debt burden and repayment schedule, it was not possible for them to be a dynamic force to the extent we would like. However, as Deputy Roche admitted, one could not say that about the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's entire contribution was marked by a Tadhg an dá thaobh approach.  He said it was Fianna Fáil and not the Left who were the creators of the State sector.  That is not quite right in the case of this company but, generally speaking, Fianna Fáil were very prominent in establishing the State sector as we know it.  He went on to praise this at great length and then he told us all the reasons the company should be sold off. Deputy Roche will never get the promotion he is aiming for if he continues to play with both hands.  He should make up his mind to come down on the side of one potential new leader or another, he cannot have it both ways.  He suggested that the Sugar Company will be in safe hands from the point of view of the workforce and producers in this new arrangement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the efficacy of the golden share.  I very much agree with him because there is no precedent which leads me to believe that the use of the golden share will keep control of the Sugar Company in Irish hands in the future.  We have nothing to go on but the Minister's commitment in this respect.  What about the experience in regard to Britoil and Jaguar in Britain? There it was very clear that the golden share did not guarantee against a foreign takeover.  I am afraid I cannot accept the Minister's commitment.  I find it very difficult to see the party who proclaim paternity of the State sector now coming in here and putting through a measure which involves selling off that company.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at some of the questions asked by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  He wanted <Col N="1628" /> to know, for example, what the accountability of the new company and its managers will be and whether they would be required to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  I should like to hear the Minister's answer to that but I cannot for the life of me see how they will because they will no longer be a State company.  He asked what the money raised by the flotation of shares will be used for and whether it will be reinvested in the company, as he recommended.  I agree with him that that is not the purpose of the flotation.  The purpose of the flotation, according to the Minister for Finance at Question Time last week, is to pay off part of the national debt.  I know the company have their own segment of shares from which they will seek to raise some money for acquisition purposes, but the majority stake is being sold off to pay off the national debt.  I find that extremely difficult to take seriously, and I do not accept the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who raised the question asked the Minister if this money would be used to pay off the principal or to minimise the debt repayments.  The Minister seemed to say that it would be used to pay off the principal.  I do not accept that but in any event, the point is this: if we were to sell off every State company we would realise about £2 billion the national debt is £25 billion, that is the order of the problem about which we are talking.  I would like to be able to make some reduction in the national debt for all the obvious economic reasons which would flow, but to sell off the Irish Sugar Company for a sum not of the order mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick but suggested to be about £60 million, will make no impact on the national debt.</P>
    <P>I regret to say, as a trade unionist, that in respect of the privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are wrong.  The retention in public ownership of such a critical indigenous company in the food sector warranted the trade union negotiators making this a <i>sine qua non</i> at the negotiating table for a new national agreement or <i>Programme for Economic and Social</i><Col N="1629" /><i>Progress</i>.  They did not make it such a bargaining factor at the table and, by accepting the argument of the Government that there will be no more capital available for expansion purposes for the Sugar Company, they have effectively given the green light to privatisation.</P>
    <P>How can any Government &mdash; we can go over the figures; there is a recently published review on industrial performance and there was another a little over three years ago &mdash; who commit on average about £800 million per annum in grants and in tax foregone to private industry which we seek to attract here through the IDA and so on, claim there is therefore no money available to develop one of our major successful indigenous companies?  There is always money available for good investment.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is interesting to highlight this with remarks of a politician who was referred to a couple of times in this debate, a former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Seán Lemass.  I will quote from a book presented to me by its author, Michael Foy, in the mid-seventies when I represented for a brief time the workers in the Sugar Company. Michael Foy who was an employee of the Sugar Company wrote this book, <i>The Sugar Industry in Ireland,</i> which I am sure some Deputies are familiar with and which is unfortunately only of historic interest now.  For example, a similar argument was put forward to Seán Lemass when he became Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The book stated:</P>
    <P>In the first Fianna Fáil Government, some eight years later, the Carlow industry was in real trouble and calling for further Government assistance.  It has been said that when the files of the Carlow operation were shown him by his staff, clearly indicating &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, Lemass remarked: &ldquo;Yes, it appears a &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  But we'll save it.  We'll buy it.  We'll build three more with it.  Now tell me how that can be done.</P>
    <P>Mr. Foy commented:</P>
    <P>That was the spirit of the '20s and <Col N="1630" /> the '30s.  That was the spirit which was to leave the nation a trend-setter &mdash; as indeed the sugar beet industry was to become &mdash; not merely for agriculture and the national industrial programme which it heralded, but also in extending the helping hand of technical knowhow to the underprivileged overseas, an exercise of the sugar beet industry which was to win much credit and respect for Ireland.</P>
    <P>That was the attitude, &ldquo;sure we have no more money&rdquo; which in the straitened twenties and thirties was demonstarated by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Seán Lemass.  I simply cannot understand, in a circumstance where we are still prepared to lavish, between tax breaks and grants, in the order of £800 million per annum on private industry, that we cannot provide the money to develop a major indigenous company in the food sector, especially in the context of the failure of private industry to produce the jobs in that sector.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Connaughton to the difficulties of the Goodman enterprise.  This was supposed to be the private sector or joint venture answer to the problems of developing a large-scale player in the food industry I accept &mdash; I made this clear at the time of the Goodman debates &mdash; the necessity for the development of a large-scale player.  I do not think we are at the races internationally unless we develop such a large-scale player.  In our present circumstances, why the Sugar Company ought not be used as precisely such a vehicle and why they should not be funded from the sources I have indicated escapes me.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> which asserts that, &ldquo;the Government are committed to the maintenance of a viable and profitable commercial semi-State sector&rdquo;.  That declaration of faith is hedged about with qualifications.  The programme states: &ldquo;Any changes in the ownership structure of particular State companies will only take place if it is in <Col N="1631" /> the public interest and in the best interest of the company and its employees and following consultation with the Social Partners.&rdquo;  That is so hedged around with qualifications as to be virtually meaningless. Who will define &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo; which must also be in the interest of the company?  The answer is the Government or maybe, if it is an especially hot political potato at the time, they will refer it to the NESC for approval.  The clause is nothing more than a fig leaf and the requirement to have consultation with the social partners is little more than window dressing.</P>
    <P>We already know the position of the IFA and the FIE.  They are in favour of privatisation.  Consultation with Congress is a very poor substitute for the veto that Congress effectively held, up until the 1987 Government were formed, on this critical question of privatisation of our major State commercial companies. Just before the 1987 election the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the executive council of Congress that there was no question but that it would be out of kilter with Fianna Fáil approach for Fianna Fáil to touch the state companies and to sell them off to private interests.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, may I ask what time does the Minister come in at?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will feel obligated to speak only for as long as I consider I have something of value to say.  I will not be filling in time just for the sake of doing so, I assure you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> I will give one other example of how anyone as familiar as I am with agreements like the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> can drive a coach and four through the article of faith, &ldquo;the maintenance of a viable and profitable commercial semi-State sector&rdquo;, which, incidentally, is one of the Fianna Fáil core values that is supposed to distinguish Fianna Fáil from Fine Gael and from the private marketeers of the Progressive Democrats.  Paragraph 89.2 (b) (ii) of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> reads:</P>
    <P>Sales of shares in a State company to the private sector where this will enable the company to survive, to make a better contribution to the economy, to protect or increase employment, [and now my emphasis] or is desirable on policy grounds.</P>
    <P>In other words, most of us in this House can subscribe to the greater part of that clause but, as is the case in respect of many key sections of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there is tagged on to the end of it an allencompassing permissive clause, &ldquo;on policy grounds&rdquo;.  In other words, if it is in the interests of the company or the workers or if it is to enable the company to survive we all agree with that, but in case that is not enough tagged on to the end is, &ldquo;or is desirable on policy grounds&rdquo;.  There is no conceivable circumstance where that kind of chapter in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is worth the paper it is written on.  If everything else fails &mdash; I could spend all day here quoting from the other sub-paragraphs &mdash; the Minister can always come into this House and say, &ldquo;but it is desirable on policy grounds&rdquo;. Inevitably policy grounds are in the eye of the beholder, and I am afraid the horse has bolted on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that The Workers' Party opposition to selling off our key State companies to private business is not based on ideological grounds but rather on sound economic sense which acknowledges the vital role which a viable and <Col N="1633" /> efficient State sector can play in generating wealth and jobs in our economy, where the record shows the failure of the private sector alone to provide employment for our people.  If this Government are serious about tackling unemployment &mdash; and the modest targets in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are for a standstill &mdash; then the development and expansion of public enterprise must be part of their job creation strategy.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food is in the House and I am quite sure that he would have agreed until quite recently that that is what Fianna Fáil would say.  It is worth recording &mdash; and this is in the programme &mdash; that our existing commercial State companies account for approximately 10 per cent of our gross national product.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the Goodman experience and the consensus that exists concerning the necessity to develop and expand our food sector, it is clear that the Government's rush to privatise the Sugar Company has more to do with political dogma than with economics.  What is there to suggest that privatising the Sugar Company will assist the industrial development opportunities in the sugar and related industries?  It is a matter for grave concern that the performance of the private sector in the food area has been so weak.  Since 1972 and our entry to the EC the number employed in the food processing sector has actually declined from 43,700 people to 35,000.</P>
    <P>What is the financial purpose of this headlong rush to privatise the Sugar Company?  The timing could scarcely be less propitious.  While much has been written in recent days about a recovery on the equity markets, the facts of the matter remain that the markets in question have fallen back by about one-third in recent months.  The effect for the Government of raising the much bruitedabout figure of £60 million to which I have referred would allow the Minister for Finance to take one penny off the standard rate of income tax.  In fact that is being generous because when you apply <Col N="1634" /> that to our annual repayments of the national debt it means a reduction of less than one penny.  I am quite happy that the workers would be prepared to pay that if they thought that the Sugar Company was being developed as a meaningful vehicle to generate wealth and create additional jobs in this economy.  I believe that in the context of a national debt of £25 billion this only serves to highlight the folly of selling off the family silver.</P>
    <P>At a recent IPC/FÁS seminar which I attended on 28 September 1990 the managing director of the Irish Sugar Company, Mr. Chris Comerford, characterised the trend in the company over the past decade as follows, and I quote him:</P>
    <P>In this Company over the decade, at historical prices, almost £96 million was utilised in the purchase of fixed assets, while numbers employed declined steadily by over 2,000 or 57 per cent and large-scale losses moved downwards to be replaced by adequate profits at the end of that period.  There were many factors in this particular instance; plant closures in sugar, closure or sale of unprofitable processed food businesses, early retirement schemes, voluntary and compulsory redundancy, serious in human terms and financially costly to the Company and significant recapitalisation by the State as shareholder.  The net result, however, has been a business with the potential to survive and grow as against a business which could not survive in increasingly competitive conditions unless drastic rationalisation occurred and capital investment in the core activity kept going on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>There was a table accompanying that which shows the figures up to 1989 presented by the managing director of the Sugar Company which I would like circulated in the Official Report.</P>

    <P>It does not include what has been described in the media this month as &ldquo;the bumper profits of £22 million for the trading year that ended in September 1990&rdquo;. <i>The Irish Times</i> financial reporter, Brendan McGrath, noted, for example, on 7 February 1991 and I quote:</P>
    <P>The group seems in sound financial shape for its imminent flotation on the stock market &mdash; a flotation that is expected to raise £60 million for the Exchequer &mdash; turnover rose from £215.6 million to £271.4 million.  In other words, the restructuring that has taken place, culminating in last year's £22 million profits, has been with an eye to preparing ultimately for the stock market.  Primarily it has been achieved in the usual way of Irish employers through substituting capital for labour on what is euphemistically referred to as rationalisation.</P>
    <P>Another media economist, Mr. Colm Rapple, of the <i>Evening Press</i>, estimates that during the 1984-85 campaign it required one worker per 672 tonnes of beet processed.  In the 1989-90 beet season 1,451,000 tonnnes of beet were processed or 1,700 tonnes per worker. He calculates that: at the 1989-90 wage rates the 1,165 employees got rid of since 1984-85 saved the Sugar Company, this year £22 million or, precisely, this year's profits.  In other words he calculated that precisely the number of redundancies, 1,165 in the years mentioned, has generated this saving of £22 million this year <Col N="1636" /> to the Sugar Company.  He goes on to outline that, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Company's labour savings/ profits were secured by its investment since 1984-85 of £56 million or £48,000 per job destroyed.  At the bottom-line the Company's investments yielded a return last year of £20 million which is the increase of last year's profits over the £2 million of 1984-85.  This is a rate of return of just 6 per cent on investment which must make the Company highly attractive to the stock market.</P>
    <P>Commenting on the fact that the high price of sugar &mdash; which he likens to the <i>gabelle,</i> which I will not illustrate for the Minister as I am quite sure he knows what it refers to &mdash; is a hardship only for those on low incomes.  He notes that: &ldquo;the higher the price the Company can charge for sugar, the brighter its new corporate image will shine&rdquo;.  He further states:</P>
    <P>These prospects, designed to make the stock market salivate, would be less disagreeable for the rest of us who are required to finance the operation by an unnecessarily high sugar price, if the 1,000 plus people made redundant since 1984 and the future 1,000 to go the same way by the year 2000 were engaged in other useful activities. Unfortunately that is not and will not be the case.  All of them are, or will be, idle on the dole or emigrants.</P>
    <P>That is the price which we have paid to put the Sugar Company into shape to make it attractive to the Stock Market. And for what?  A paltry £60 million.  We can find money to put into large foreign projects that are located here which are footloose when the pressure comes on, have never managed to establish linkages in this company and which will get up and pull out when it suits them.  Yet here we have a company of which we all could have been proud where we did have Irish control and where we could direct its diversification and expansion programme, but the problem is, as Mr. <Col N="1637" /> Comerford said at that particular seminar, that he does not have the capital to do it.  He claimed he has no ideological hang-up about the task.  He would do the task, he did not care where the money came from but he needed it in order to diversify, to acquire related industries, to develop and generate more wealth and to create more jobs in this economy.  That money should be provided; I am not making any blanket reference here to the question of privatisation; I am referring to the particular case of the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the submission in 1988, which is somewhat out of date now, from the then Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. I would like to refer to a clause in that submission which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government is spending vast amounts of money in subsidising industry through direct grants, subsidies or tax-breaks, and yet industrial employment is steadily falling each year. Direct foreign investment has slowed up internationally because of the world recession, and other countries have become more competitive in fighting for a share of this declining investment. Furthermore, such investment has low linkages with the domestic economy, as the vast outflows of repayments of profits and royalties and dividends indicate, and successful indigenous Irish companies prefer to buy companies abroad rather than diversify in Ireland. Therefore, the only alternative is to divert some of the vast amounts of State money and tax expenditures into resource-based indigenous industries, such as the Irish Sugar Company. There is a clear need for a major initiative on the whole food processing industry.</P>
    <P>That statement deserves a serious reply from the Minister, and my only regret is that the authors of that document, the then leaders of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the current leaders of SJPTU, did not bring it to the negotiating table when they were up in Dublin Castle locked in rooms with Mr. <Col N="1638" /> Pádraig Ó hUigín devising the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and making believe for the TV cameras that the public ritual about the pay were the real negotiations.  The real negotiations were those that went on, appropriately enough, in Dublin Castle. It is a great pity they did not bring that philosophy to the table and we would not be in the situation where we are proposing to sell off the family silver.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton; I would like to hear the manner of the flotation addressed.  As I said, having regard to the experience in Jaguar and in Britoil, I have little belief in the golden share being successful in retaining control in Ireland.  I have little confidence in that. I would like to hear from the Minister what plans he has.  How precisely is the flotation in present unpropitious market conditions to be handled?  I do not know what commitments the Taoiseach gave to Mr. Cahill when he visited the island during the summer but I presume our old friend Mr. Dermot Desmond will be invited back in to give us a hand again on how we should sell off this one.  Certainly, he is doing very well out of all of this.  I wish I was as happy that the workforce of the Irish Sugar Company will participate in this experiment to the same lucrative effect as the kind of financial institutions who have the inside track with the Government.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult as a trade unionist to stomach the acquiescence of the trade union movement in this decision.  There is no precedent in Britain or elsewhere where varying numbers of workers were casualties of the privatisation process.  Of course, there are examples, and I put them on the record of the House in a different debate, of how well leading managers do in public companies that are privatised overnight virtually, though I am not denying Mr. Chris Comerford and his team fair remuneration for the job they do.  They ought to be remunerated. It is arguable that the Devlin ceiling on key jobs in the public sector such as managing director of the Irish Sugar Company is unfair in terms of what the marketplace can command, but the facts <Col N="1639" /> show in Britain that there have been fantastic gains for the managers but not for the workers.  I find it difficult to reconcile that with the ICTU's acquiescence on this.  In their submission to Government on the question of privatisation, they said that Congress opposes (1) selling off all Government shares in public enterprises, (2) selling off a majority of the State's shares in public enterprise, (3) using money from the sale of a minority of shares to pay off part of the national debt, and (4) secret discussions with consultants and financers as inadequate procedures for specific privatisation proposals.</P>
    <P>That was from the ICTU document. How it can be reconciled with their acquiescence in selling off one of our most successful, dynamic State companies beats me.  Coming from where he comes from, the Minister knows better than anybody the long years of employment that were provided in Thurles by the Irish Sugar Company.  We started off this discussion this afternoon based on the tragedy Deputy Paul Connaughton has brought forward, the ghost town that is left behind in his constituency, Tuam. The Sugar Company, and their founders, had this dimension for industrial development and the underpinning of the infrastructure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  Before I reply to the points raised during the debate, let me first restate what we are aiming to do in the Bill.  We are proposing to remove the exclusive State control of the company so as to allow them to develop in a way which will be most beneficial to themselves, to the State, to their employees and to the suppliers.  We are doing this in a way that will safeguard the Irish sugar industry and, at the same time, will yield a reasonable return to <Col N="1640" /> the State, namely the taxpayer, on its investment.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the semi-State commercial sector has played a major role in the development of this economy. At a time of scarce capital resources and, indeed, over the last 60 years it has contributed greatly to economic developments and employment here.  Many of these companies were created by the late Seán Lemass &mdash; I am glad Deputy Rabbitte referred to him &mdash; to provide capital and expertise in the Irish economy in a period of depression and understandable protection for infant industry.  There was neither native capital nor native capacity. Their success in the intervening years is attributed to the skills and commitment of the workforce, management and suppliers.</P>
      <P>The European and world markets have changed dramatically since then and Government policy reflects that change and is now promoting a dynamic, vigorous market-driven approach as distinct from a State-dependent strategy.  Therefore, the decision to enable Siúicre Éireann as the first semi-State body to seek flotation on the Stock Exchange is an historic one.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased and privileged to be the first Minister of Government to seek the support of the Oireachtas for this dynamic approach. The company have proved their commercial capacity and the dramatic return to profits reflects a very healthy balance sheet indeed.  It will enable Greencore plc to call on equity capital for their expansion programme in all areas of their activities and to seek out new partners and associates to compete effectively in the internal markets of Europe and, indeed, worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers, and the beet growers, have been key partners in the company's success, and the provisions of the Bill I am introducing, with the amendments I will introduce on Committee Stage, after consultations with the trade union interests and with the sugar beet growers, <Col N="1641" /> will ensure that their vital role will be respected and enhanced in the new competitive free market environment.  It will enable Greencore plc to call on equity capital for its expansion programme in all areas of its activities and to seek out new partners and associates to compete effectively in the Internal Market of Europe and worldwide.</P>
    <P>The workers and beet growers have been key partners in the company's success and the provisions of the Bill together with amendments which I will introduce on Committee Stage will ensure that their vital role will be respected and enhanced in the new competitive free market strategy.</P>
    <P>Neither workers nor suppliers have anything to fear from the flotation.  On the contrary, the overall strengthening of the financial base of the company from the flotation can only be to their advantage. Beet growers and employees will, of course, approach certain individual issues from a different perspective to that of the management of the company.  There will always be negotiations on matters such as prices and wages and conditions of service.  However, in a growing and profitable company, such as I expect Greencore to be, these matters should be capable of resolution without particular difficulty in the mutual interest of workers, management and suppliers.</P>
    <P>Irish food companies will never be as big as the giant European and US companies. However, that does not mean that they cannot succeed in the Europe of the future.  There will be plenty of room for effectively small companies, even though they will have to be large in Irish terms as at presently understood. The companies that succeed will be those that recognise that the different elements of the European market will no longer be self-contained but will be interacting with one another.  In particular, it can be expected that customer tastes and preferences will begin to overflow country boundaries while prices will be increasingly affected by European rather than local considerations.</P>
    <P>While the small scale of Irish food companies is a disadvantage, their ability to <Col N="1642" /> source high quality raw materials at a relatively low cost is a major advantage. That is one of the key elements in this proposal.  Siúicre Éireann have, in recent years, displayed abilities which should stand them well in their drive to become a successful food company in the nineties. They have been successful with branded sugar products in Ireland while Odlums is a household name.  Developing international brands is an expensive and difficult process.  The larger Irish food companies are, I am sure, conscious that apart from the brand route which can be so difficult, there are substantial opportunities in Europe for trading directly with other companies.</P>
    <P>Given the change in the business environment in which the company have to operate, they have, in their present status, achieved with the financial resources available to them the maximum that could reasonably be expected.  They have performed excellently in recent years and, indeed, the results for the year ending 30 September 1990 which were published recently by Siúicre Éireann show continued improvement with operating profits rising to £26.7 million compared to £21.1 million the previous year. But, as has been pointed out by the consultants and further highlighted by the analysis of the <i>ad hoc</i> group, the company cannot remain in a static position if its long term commercial viability and growth are to be assured.  The company have as they have shown by their recent performance, significant technical and managerial expertise which can be applied further in expansion into areas outside their existing core business. However, all of these attributes are of little value without the freedom to call upon commercial sources of finance when opportunities for growth and expansion present themselves.  This Bill will afford the company that essential freedom by giving them access to equity from the capital markets by way of flotation on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>To reassure the employees of the company, we are, in addition to the protection of their interests already provided <Col N="1643" /> for in EC legislation, making specific provisions relating to their rights, in an amendment to the Bill, which I will, as already indicated, be moving on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The protection of the sugar quota for all concerned, but in particular for the beet growers, is provided for in the special share which will prevent, in addition to other matters, the disposal of the controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann and their sugar quota.</P>
    <P>By way of an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage and following consultation with the beet growers and trade unions, I will make a provision whereby the special share may not be disposed of. I will say more about that later.  It was never the intention that I, as Minister for Agriculture and Food would dispose of that on the market.  It was simply to enable me to dispose of elements within it to either workers or beet growers, but if it is the wish of both that I hold on to it in total, I am prepared to put that provision into the Bill so that the Minister for Agriculture and Food cannot dispose of the special share.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the growers and employees as shareholders, will be given, an active interest in the company and will benefit from its expected development by way of income from dividends and the capital appreciation of shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the points raised by Deputy Deasy.  There will be a copy of these points made available to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy claimed that at one stage the number of employees in Siúicre Éireann cpt had dropped to a level of 1,200.  This is not correct.  In the last decade, it is true to say that because of rationalisation within the group average employment levels have been falling.  The <Col N="1644" /> lowest average level of employment in that period was in 1989 when the figure was 1,556.  This, in fact, rose in 1990 by 200 to 1,757.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy, Deputy Rabbitte and a number of other Deputies also referred to the timing of the flotation and said that a higher valuation would have been achieved two years ago.  I accept that ascribing the correct value to a company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I took these notes with a view to making the most precise response in the short time available to me.  I was going to reply to another point made by the Deputy.  I accept that ascribing the correct value to a company is a difficult exercise at the best of times; I say that to Deputy Rabbitte as well.  The market will determine that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given current international conditions, the attitude to Ireland is a key element in all of this.  I have no doubt that this will be a successful flotation at this time, despite uncertain international circumstances.  Deputy Deasy said this should have been done two years ago but at that time the company was only emerging from a period of heavy loss-making.  Deputy Deasy would recognise that until such time as they had the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity to move into profitability, one could not expect a positive response from the market after sustained loss making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> In setting the date for flotation, account will be taken of the market sentiments. I wanted to have the opportunity to have a full debate on this in the Dáil with a view to moving to the market as soon as possible on the basis of the best advice available to the Sugar Company and to us.</P>
    <P>A further point worth mentioning in the context of timing is the capacity of the market to absorb the flotation.  The advice available to the Minister for finance and myself is that the Irish market can readily absorb the proposed flotation. Indeed, fund managers have been aware for some time of the intention to float this year and I expect that they will have earmarked some of their funds to take up shares in the holding company.  There is still a reasonable flow of funds to Irish institutions and I expect that some of these funds will be made available for this new equity investment.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured in the short time available to deal with most of the points. I would again underline that this Government are committed to developing a new dynamic partnership.  We are not removing the State role from companies set up <Col N="1646" /> under the late Seán Lemass which were a key element in a different period of our economy.  We are injecting a new role&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where the company, with control exercised by the Minister on behalf of the Legislature, will guarantee the workers' interests and the companies interests.  As we move through the debate and, more importantly, as we go to the markets I hope I can demonstrate that we have the balance right and that the attitude to Ireland in the world markets, which is positive, will be reflected in the partnership which will emerge from this legislation being passed through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>After four years of management of the health services by this Minister, we are once again in 1991 back to a health crisis.  The health boards have been left short of funds necessary to just maintain their level of services of last year.  They are an estimated £20 million short.  The result of this thoroughout the country will be fewer admissions to hospitals for elective-surgery with the inevitable lengthening of waiting lists.  In one health board, for example, there will be up to 7,500 fewer admissions this year, there will be fewer residential places for those who can no longer cope at home, there will be extra strain on nursing care and there will be fewer support services for those in the community.</P>
      <P>Similarly in the voluntary hospitals we are facing a crisis once again as exhibited by the recent situation in the Dublin hospitals where the accident and emergency admissions system has run into complete chaos.  We have as a result &mdash; it has been documented &mdash; inadequate supervision of patients who are being left unattended on trolleys, often overnight in humiliating circumstances, and many are forced to stay for very long periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> We are looking at the position in 1991 where the existing chronic waiting lists for services for mentally handicapped persons will worsen.  Hundreds are already without service and thousands are facing inadequate service levels for their needs.  The reality is that the cuts which the Minister for Health is imposing this year are unplanned and poorly thought out.  They are a stab in the dark and a hope that the consequences will not be too bad, when the reality is that they have scant regard for the families who will have to cope with the consequences of longer waiting times and the early discharge which is an essential consequence of these budgets.</P>
    <P>There are very notable examples in the various health boards of what will happen.  The South-Eastern Health Board report that they will be reducing admissions by 7,500 patients this year compared to the levels which the Minister is forcing them to cut back to.  This will result in their waiting lists growing again after a short period when there was a slight decline.</P>
    <P>In the Southern Health Board two hospitals will see 1,700 fewer admissions.  In the Midland Health Board 70 long-stay geriatric places will be closed and 20 staff will be let go, although the chief executive officer told the board there is a very strong case against this loss of staff. Again in the South-Eastern Health Board we are told of the release of psychiatric patients into the community, although they admit there is not the required development of back-up services to cope with these admissions in the community.  Every board reported that they will not be able to develop any new community care services.  This comes at a time when the Minister has declared his priority for the development of community care.  No improvements will occur in 1991, outside the small number of areas where the Minister has offered special budget provisions.</P>
    <P>There is a supreme political irony that this Minister for Health who, in 1989, shielded the Taoiseach from the reality of the health crisis should again, in 1991, a local election year, choose to squeeze <Col N="1651" /> out of the service the small improvements he has allowed since the last election which were wrung out of him by the political reality of what was facing patients.  Perhaps later this year we will see a drawing realisation about the health crisis.</P>
    <P>Some of us looked to budget day as a day we thought there would be some breakthrough in the health allocation.  I know many social partners who looked to the health budget to see of very substantial sums made available, were treated to what I would regard as a complete sleight of hand on the part of the Minister that fooled no one.  He announced on budget day, and sought applause, for an extra £8 million for dental care, care for the elderly and care for the handicapped.  However, when you read the small print of this year's Budget Statement you discovered he was actually taking £4.5 million out of the health services, he was taking £2.5 million in economies which he refused to specify, he was taking £5 million in unspecified restructuring of borrowing &mdash; which again he refused to specify &mdash; and he was taking £5 million in extra public contributions for health that were being pocketed by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We are really back to the old days of creative accounting, phantom efficiencies, putting off the evil day where debts are paid, and taxation by stealth.  That was the essence of this year's budget announcement in the health area.  Even some of the announcements were fraudulent. We heard that another £3 million for dental services was being allocated but the reality is that that was only restoring an equivalent cut that was built into the Estimates given to the health boards.</P>
    <P>Since budget day the Minister has shrugged off the reports from the health professionals and contemptuously dismissed their appeals for a reassessment of their funding requirements.  Only last week we thought we saw a chink in his armour, that perhaps he was having a change of heart, we heard that maybe he was going to restore £10 million to the health boards.  I am extremely sceptical <Col N="1652" /> about the reality of this because from what we have heard the Minister's plan is that the money is to be found elsewhere in the health budgets.  I cannot look to any year in the health service and see where the Minister will find these savings.</P>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals, the other major area of spending, are in deep trouble.  In the last few weeks we have seen total chaos in the accident and emergency departments of those hospitals. We have seen detailed reports from professionals in the Mater Hospital of the inadequate supervision, of the inability to monitor patients appropriately and of the chronic overcrowding in cubicles &mdash; of more than one to a cubicle &mdash; and where patients have to remain overnight on trolleys.  As that report indicated this is humiliating treatment for patients at a time when they are at their most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister commissioned a special committee under David Kennedy to report on this.  They reported urgently in the middle of the year on what needed to be done.  They indicated the lack of adequate observation wards, the need for a greater allocation of experienced staff, the delays in the turn around of results from diagnostic tests, the cumbersome assessment procedures, etc.  All the problems were listed.  The Minister was to see that the necessary changes were in place by 1 October 1990 at the latest.  Clearly the Minister failed to deliver on this as in so many other areas.</P>
    <P>Catering for the accident and emergency departments is not marginal in the business of a hospital, that is the essence of their job.  Almost half of all admissions to hospital are coming through the accident and emergency departments.  This is the time when people are at their most vulnerable.  It is not acceptable that the Minister permits a situation where a short cold spell can throw the system into complete chaos, as we have seen in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is the way this Minister has presided over our health services where sacrifices have been squeezed from patients, but these sacrifices have been in vain.  We have had four years of persistent <Col N="1653" /> savings, but in that period the Minister has failed to undertake any fundamental reform that could hold out the vision for people of a better health service.  In every area the Minister has refused to act.  He refuses to specify health service targets which the health agencies could aim for and against which we could judge their performance.  He still uses crude cash controls that fall most heavily on the front line services, and have the consequent effect on patients.</P>
    <P>Budgeting for our hospitals and other health agencies remains entirely divorced from their actual achievements in the provision of service.  We have seen the two speed health system become more entrenched in the period of this Minister's care for the service.  The Minister has even failed to get to grips with the efficiencies that can be achieved easily from the system, in areas like energy, management and the use of drugs.</P>
    <P>It is depressing to see that this Minister consistently refuses to put forward plans for the restructuring of our health services. He persists with the cumbersome system of administration from eight health boards which has resulted in a system that is over-administered but under-managed.  This failure could be forgiven if the need for action was unknown, but the reality is that the Minister's own Department signalled the direction of reform quite clearly in a document published in 1986, <i>Health, The Wider Dimensions</i>.  The Minister inherited a charted course on his desk as to the reforms that were needed.  In every area that document indicated the reform in the system needed but the Minister has not moved in any of these areas.  Instead of taking action he has piled up more and more consultancy reports.  The names of Fox, Kennedy and the Review Group on Mental Handicap trip from his lips as if the mere mention of their names meant that there was reform, change and a better service.  These are just more in a long string of reports and the only thing which extinguishes them is that they have not yet had the opportunity to gather dust on shelves.</P>
    <P>The Minister expects a gullible public <Col N="1654" /> to believe a new display of rhetoric, the pledge in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that he will develop community care services.  The reality is that there are very shallow foundations to the Minister's declared priority for the development of such services.  A promise was made in that document that a sum of £100 million would be invested in community care facilities over seven years. However, none emerged in 1991.  On the contrary, several requests by health boards for urgent new community care developments were turned down.</P>
    <P>On day-to-day spending, the Minister imposed cuts on the budgets of community care providers which were much tighter than those imposed on hospitals. The major hospitals got an increase of over 10 per cent in their allocation, whereas most of the community care services have to make do with virtually unchanged budgets in 1991, despite escalating costs.  This makes a nonsense of the Minister's often made claim that he will make extra moneys available to community care rather than to hospitals.</P>
    <P>The cruellest cut of all has been reserved for the parents of mentally handicapped children where the Minister halved the allocation in the budget for their needs.  The parents of mentally handicapped children have had to take to the streets to highlight the crisis they are facing.  As I said earlier, hundreds of mentally handicapped children are without any service and thousands of them are inappropriately placed.  Nationally there is an immediate need for 800 extra residential places and 1,000 extra day places.  The cost of this runs to about £23 million.  It is against this background that we must judge the Minister's allocation of £1 million in 1991, the first year of the much vaunted seven year programme. This sum is an insult.  Waiting lists will get far longer for the mentally handicapped and their carers this year.  The treatment being meted out to the carers of the handicapped is shameful and a major blot on a society that regards itself as caring.</P>
    <P>Many aging parents who have to care for their handicapped children are driving <Col N="1655" /> themselves into the ground trying to cope, with far too little help.  Many have not had a break in years and they face huge uncertainties in the future.  Even the basic support services which one would expect should be provided for people caring in the community are not available to them.  For example, only 155 respite places are available, as documented in the recent report by the NRB.  This means that fewer than half of the parents of mentally handicapped children can get a break from caring.  A similar situation exists for those parents caring for physically handicapped children.</P>
    <P>The carers' allowance is a sick joke.  It is only paid to parents who are on the bread line, that is, if they earn less than £100 per week, below the minimum income level dictated by the Commission on Social Welfare as constituting a subsistence level.  The mentally handicapped do not have automatic eligibility for free doctors' care and they face rationing on essential items such as nappies.  Specialist services like speech therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy are hopelessly overstrained and the Minister does not have any long term plan in this area.  He did not indicate in the PESP any service targets which would be achieved and gave no commitment as to how the service would develop over the years.</P>
    <P>That document also raised a new issue, the change in eligibility for hospital services. The Minister proposed that the top 15 per cent of income earners in our community should now be eligible for so-called free services in the hospitals.  The reality is that the cost of these services has been significantly increased for those who depend on them.  I am very sceptical that this change will bring any improvement to the lot of public patients.</P>
    <P>This action is not in accord with what the Health Commission recommended, despite the misleading impression given by the Minister.  The commission favoured the abolition of restricted hospital entitlements for the top 15 per cent of earners, but their key recommendation was that all necessary services <Col N="1656" /> should be available on the basis of medical need and not ability to pay.  This recommendation was to be implemented by a &ldquo;commmon waiting list for both public and private patients from which cases would be taken on the basis of medically established priority.&rdquo;  This, in turn, was to be backed up by regular publication of criteria for admission to hospital and of maximum waiting periods for access to specific procedures.  None of these fundamental recommendations made by the commission have been implemented by the Minister.  He has ignored the notion of a common waiting list.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, it seems absurd to answer the chronic waiting times for public patients by the extension of the service to a further 15 per cent of patients, especially when not a red cent is being provided by the Minister to meet the extra demands which might emerge. The Minister argues that public beds will be freed by excluding private patients from them.  Many dispute this but what is most extraordinary is that the Minister does not know how many private patients have been using public beds.  He is engaging in what seems to be a major social experiment about which no one knows the outcome, least of all himself.  Yet, the Minister confidently announced to hospital consultants that he sees no reduction in private practice resulting from his changes.  There can be only one reason why this will be so &mdash; the Minister will continue to ensure that the public system is sufficiently starved of resources, that waiting times will continue to be unacceptably long and people will not opt to take up their entitlements.  The Minister has steadfastly refused to offer any guarantees about maximum waiting times for treatment in public care.  This is why people have been willing to join the VHI.</P>
    <P>The abandonment of the idea of a common waiting list held out by the health commission bodes ill for those who have to depend on public provision.  The Minister is institutionalising the two speed health service for the first time instead of tackling its causes which were <Col N="1657" /> the essence of the Gleeson approach to setting consultants' remuneration.  It is sad that we have to come into this House after repeated debates on the issue of the health service and refer again to the failure of the Minister to deal with his responsibilities.  This is the reality and the Minister and his party will sadly discover this later during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the most overreported and under-planned health services in all of Europe.  At this point in time the Minister for Health has been in power for four years, yet during that period he has not made one single decision regarding the fundamental problems facing the health services.  He set up a commission on health funding and during the two years of their deliberations he used their existence as an excuse for doing nothing and not making decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the commission published their report the Minister invited submissions from interested groups, another excuse for not making decisions.  He then set up a series of committees.  We had the Fox report, the Kennedy report and in the Southern Health Board region we are waiting a further report, the Kenny report.  These reports cost an enormous amount of money.  It is an absolute scandal that at a time when children in our schools cannot even get dental treatment the Minister would spend approximately £350,000 on the Fox report &mdash; I garnered that information from a reply to a question I put down to the Minister on 19 February.  Expenses to date in dealing with the Kennedy report are running at £30,000 and the final costs are not yet known.  The Kennedy report and the Fox report have been completed, but the Minister has not released the details of them.  The health boards which are affected by the Fox report are unaware of its contents.  I am calling on the Minister to publish the details of the Fox report and the Kennedy report which he received last Friday and contains five chapters dealing with out-patient services, in-patient waiting lists, services for geriatrics and the question of referrals from outside the Eastern Health Board <Col N="1658" /> region.  The latter report extends to 208 pages.  The tax payer, and the public, who are long suffering are entitled to know the contents of those reports.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is frozen by indecision.  He is not prepared to take the hard decisions that could bring about improvements in our health services.  We have eight health boards, each of them bureaucratic monsters out of step with each other and some of them are havens of political patronage.  I have come to the conclusion that that is one of the reasons the Minister does not consider the existence of eight health boards, in a country whose population is three million people, as superfluous.</P>
    <P>The health boards, despite their unwieldly structures and inadequacies are striving as best they can to deliver a health service to the public.  However, they are failing miserably.  They are failing to give a service to the public, a service to which they are legally entitled. Our hospital services are in turmoil, with long waiting lists and delays in essential surgical procedures because of equipment breakdown.  For example, only this week I received a letter from the leader of the consultant group in the Cork Regional Hospital and which stated:</P>
    <P>Cork Regional Hospital is a multidisciplinary hospital containing local, regional and sub-national specialties. In recent years there has been a serious undermining of its role as a result of deterioration of equipment, fabric and morale.  In spite of this, services have been maintained and, indeed, in many areas increased.  A further decrease in the allocation for the hospital for this year is now envisaged and this could have serious implications for the delivery of services to the public as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of grave concern to us and we wish to alert you of the situation.</P>
    <P>An unprecedented meeting will be held between public representatives and the staff of Cork Regional Hospital next Friday because of the crisis there.  The <Col N="1659" /> Minister has been warned of the position. Submissions have been made to him by the Southern Health Board regarding the need for a capital allocation for equipment, but he has ignored those submissions.</P>
    <P>Despite major problems facing the health services perhaps one of the greatest and cruellest con jobs in recent years has been the Minister's pathetic attempt to pretend that a full, comprehensive and free hospital service will be available to all our people in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>In other words the Minister is trying to pretend that despite the long waiting lists of sometimes up to two years for ear, nose and throat operations and orthopaedic and cardiac surgery and despite the profiteering involved in private practice in our public hospitals, evidence of which the Minister received months ago and did nothing about, despite the fact that patients who are seriously ill are being denied entry to hospitals, despite the widespread chaos and suffering because of inadequate facilities, the Minister is trying to use the big bluff, the political stroke, and he tells us he is going to provide free hospital services for all within a number of months.</P>
    <P>To all this chaos the Minister is going to add a further 200,000 potential patients to the health services, and he is trying to tell us he will be in a position to treat all who require treatment.  Shame on the Minister.  He is either out of touch with reality or, worse still, is attempting one of the cruellest political strokes ever here just because of the impending local elections.  It is shameful that political stroking can come before the wellbeing of the patient in such a sensitive service.</P>
    <P>The local elections are coming in June and already we are hearing the political promises.  These promises will be as numerous as the patients on the waiting lists before June.  We have already heard a number of these promises.  The Minister last week indicated that there may be more money for health boards, without saying where the money will come from except that it will come from internal sources.  I would like to know where the <Col N="1660" /> money is coming from and how much will be provided.  We are to have free hospital services for all our population, and everything in the garden will be rosy, again because of the June elections.</P>
    <P>I repeat, this surely must be one of the most pathetic and cruellest political strokes of all time, and we have had a lot of them in recent years.  If the local elections can produce suddenly from nowhere extra finance and promised improvements in our health services surely the greatest tragedy of all must be the needless deaths and suffering in recent times.  Now we are being told they could have been avoided.  I hope the public will not be fooled by the Minister's and the Government's trickery.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to say where the money will come from for all the improvements suggested in recent times, either promised by the Minister or leaked by Government sources.  I would like to quote from an editorial in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> headed &ldquo;Where Will The Money Come From?&rdquo;  It states.</P>
    <P>The news that agreement has been reached between Dr. Rory O'Hanlon and the hospital consultants concerning remuneration for lost earnings consequent on the extension of the free hospitalisation scheme is of course welcome.</P>
    <P>But any settlement along the lines proposed is going to be costly.  Whatever the final expense, and substantial compensation is being quoted, more money yet again is going to be needed for health.  Yet we have been told by way of the budget and the budgetary estimates that while there is more for the health service than last year the increase is likely to be swallowed up by existing expenses.</P>
    <P>The article states in conclusion:</P>
    <P>What is worrying about this whole business is that it lends substance to the widespread view that more than at any time previously it is the Department of Finance rather than Health which is effectively deciding policy for health.  If we are wrong then all the <Col N="1661" /> Minister has to do is make plain that the extension of free hospitalisation is one of the lynch-pins of his policy.</P>
    <P>The problem that remains is that money is going to have to be found to compensate disgruntled consultants and the likelihood is that it will be found at the expense of the very people the extension of free hospitalisation was meant to benefit &mdash; those paying tax on incomes over £16,400 a year.</P>
    <P>Health, social welfare, education and housing should be the cornerstones of any nation's social policy.  Here there is no housing programme despite the glossy presentation made by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, in recent weeks.  Health is in a shambles.  We have a Minister for Health who is out of touch and not in control of the system, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, and his Department are calling the shots purely for cosmetic reasons because of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The Minister for Health is obviously all at sea at present on health issues and there is an urgent need for direct intervention.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for direct intervention by this House because the lives of our people have been sacrificed in some cases and in other cases they are increasingly being put at risk.  I am tonight calling on the Minister to set up an all-party Dáil committee on the health services because horrendous things have been happening up and down the country.  We must, as elected representatives, face up to our responsibilities and deal with the problems directly because the Minister has run away from his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I reject the allegations made by the Minister some weeks ago in this House that TDs are scaremongering in the Dáil. The Minister has been provided with plenty of evidence in recent weeks to prove my allegation.  Last Thursday the Minister of State received evidence of medical cardholders being harassed by a health board and this has not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Lip service has been paid to community care in recent years while, at the same time, the service deteriorates.  There has <Col N="1662" /> been widespread withdrawal of medical cards, harassment of medical cardholders &mdash; as I said last Thursday in the House &mdash; and medical cardholders who cannot get ophthalmic or dental treatment.  The comprehensive community care programme about which the Minister spoke is a figment of his imagination.  It is pathetic that health boards cannot provide a cardiac ambulance service in some health board areas.  Doctors will tell you that people are dying on the streets because ambulances do not have defibrillators or monitors to deal with cardiac arrests on the streets of our cities outside Dublin.  This scandalous situation must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman for health dealt with the pathetic way our mentally handicapped children and their parents are being treated at present.  This House must not leave the running and the workings of the services to the Minister, his Department, the Foxes and the Kennedys, who are just producing reports and making a fair bit of money from the services which should be going directly to the patients who are suffering.  There have been enough reports, we now need action.  If the Minister will not act this House should refer the health services to an all-party committee.  This House should monitor the performance of the Minister from now on.  We represent the people, an all-party committee should monitor the situation because the Minister is out of touch.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognises the substantially increased financial allocation provided for our health services in 1991 and commends the Minister for Health for the initiatives he has taken and is taking to radically reform our health service in the light of the recommendations of various studies now available to him and in particular for the action he has taken to enable the increased level of <Col N="1663" /> service to be maintained by our health agencies.</P>
    <P>The speeches of Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Allen could have been made by members of The Workers' Party.  They advocated moving more to the left and spending more and more money.  I will deal with some of the points raised and the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, will deal with the remainder tomorrow night, including the contradictions.  One of the Deputies said there was no more money in the service but later he said more money could be provided by reducing the cost of drugs.  Indeed, Deputy Allen made the same speech four years ago when he was spokesman for health for his party.</P>

      <P>It was scaremongering as was the case again tonight.  There is nothing new in the motion, nothing that we have not heard every time that the health services are mentioned by Fine Gael spokesmen in this House.  There are, however, clear signs of regression, a return to hankering after something which is not available to the health services &mdash; soft money.</P>
      <P>I will deal with that particular phenomenon in more detail later, but it is a matter of surprise and disappointment to me that the party's new spokesman on Health, Deputy Bruton, should be prepared to advocate further expensive borrowing.  It would seem that little has been learned by the main Opposition party in the last four years.  The suggestion that it is necessary to become involved in further borrowing at this stage of the year is, to say the least, precipitate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to be implementing a practical programme of reform, to provide those services that are needed at costs we can afford.  I intend to remind Deputy Bruton, his leader and his colleagues, not only of the detailed plan which already exists for the maintenance and development of the health services, <Col N="1664" /> but, more particularly, the steps which are being taken and will continue to be taken to implement that plan effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that, in truth, it is a source of political disappointment to Fine Gael that steady progress has been and is being made.  Conditions in the health service are not deteriorating: reform and renewal are taking place and there will not be any end to this process under this Government.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House today completely ignores the real progress made by this Government in strengthening and developing our health services. We have attracted much criticism from Opposition parties for not implementing or responding to the various expert reports published on individual aspects of the health services in recent years. This, as I will show, is totally without foundation.  Indeed, on occasions we have also been criticised even for establishing these groups in the first place, amid claims that they are a substitute for Government action.  This is patently untrue.</P>
    <P>The motion is based on the assumption that existing services will not be maintained during 1991 because there has not been sufficient financial provision made. In dealing with this aspect of the motion let me first outline the provision which has been made and level of expenditure which health agencies are authorised to incur during 1991.</P>
    <P>The post-budget figures for health services show a total gross provision of £1,543 million, the largest amount ever provided.  Capital grants account for £32 million of the above.  A further £9 million will be made available from non-Exchequer sources, giving a total capital availability of some £41 million.  The gross non-capital provision is, therefore, £1,511 million.</P>
    <P>The level of provision which has been agreed for 1991 is considerabe, particularly when viewed in the light of overall Government expenditure.  An examination of the post-budget net non-capital figures shows that almost 22 per cent of total spending has been allocated to the <Col N="1665" /> health services in 1991.  Never, over the last decade, has the health share of total resources been this high.  Since I came into office, this share has increased in each successive year which is in stark contrast with the decline which occurred when the Opposition were in Government.</P>
    <P>The motion speaks of the alleged inadequate financial provision this year for the health services.  I will give more figures: between 1982 and 1986, the amount of money provided in real terms went down by .5 per cent and, in the last four years, it increased by 6 per cent in real terms under this Government.  The reality is that the 1991 allocations which issued to the health boards and voluntary hospitals are, on average, almost 7 per cent greater than the comparable allocations last year.  It should be understood that the additional expenditure approved for health boards and voluntary hospitals in 1991 represents a considerable investment by the State in the public health system.  Indeed, since 1989 I have provided about £116 million extra for the health boards and, by any standards, these are significant levels of investment by the State in the health system.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to the effects of the allocation on the handicapped. However, the fact is that the voluntary organisations providing care for the mentally handicapped have received from my Department a level of financial resources for 1991 which is 9.7 per cent in excess of the 1990 figure.  Such an increase again underlines this Government's commitment to protect the handicapped and ensure that services provided for them by their organisation will continue and, indeed, will be developed.</P>
    <P>Most of the discussion concerning the adequacy of the financial provision has tended, as usual, to centre on the extent to which acute hospital services will be affected.  The Government set the approved number of acute hospital beds at 12,000 in 1990.  Apart from the normal seasonal closure, this level of bed availability will be maintained during 1991.</P>

      <P>The Government will assist health boards and agencies to maintain this level by supporting an enhanced value for money programme.</P>
      <P>My policy is, and has been, that we must not just maintain the level of service but enhance it.  One way of addressing this issue is the pursuit of greater value for money at all levels throughout the service and the Government have laid great emphasis on this strategy for 1991. The way forward in the hospitals sector has been set out in the Fox report.  Similar strategies are now being applied to all other major agencies, including health boards.</P>
      <P>Achieving greater value for money will not happen overnight.  Indeed, I believe that many agencies have operated very efficiently for a number of years.  By value for money I mean greater efficiency, economy and effectiveness, doing the right things; doing things right; and eliminating waste.</P>
      <P>One example is in the area of the management of consumables.  For too long little attention has been paid to the management of usage, product selection, warehousing and stock management and, indeed, to purchasing itself.  Good examples of progress in this area are the development of computerised up to date price information by my Department and the reorganisation of the procurement function in the Eastern Health Board with the establishment of their professionally developed purchasing unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, value for money will not be maximised unless there is greater co-operation between the various health agencies, working together and with the VFM unit of my Department.  I am very pleased to report that the senior management of the agencies have responded to my requests in this regard. We now have in place in each health board a senior official with specific responsibility for VFM.  The health boards collectively have established a value for money committee under the chairmanship of the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board.  Furthermore, an action programme to follow <Col N="1667" /> up the main findings of the Fox report is being developed by a steering group including two assistant secretaries of my Department and Mr. Noel Fox.  This group are working closely with the six main Dublin hospitals and work has already commenced on such functional areas as energy, pay, supplies, pathology &mdash; all major cost areas.</P>
    <P>Let me say for Deputy Allen's benefit, that while we will be publishing the Kennedy report the reason we are not publishing the Fox report is that when Noel Fox and his group went into hospitals they were given freely information it would not be appropriate to publish in fairness to the hospitals concerned.  I assured that, as far as the Southern Health Board and Cork Regional Hospital, are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One final example of progress in this area of VFM is the initiative I took last week in the launch of the National Drugs Formulary which will make a substantial contribution to the control of drug costs on a national basis and at the same time expand the list of drugs available under the GMS scheme to include analgesics and antacids.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may be aware that the review group who looked at the GMS suggested a figure of £8 million for savings in changing over to generics for patients. Of course, I always underline that the important thing is that the patient receives the drug appropriate to his need, but there is an obligation on the prescriber to use a cheaper drug as long as it is equally efficient and effective.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that as the year progresses VFM programmes will generate additional resources which will not be clawed back from the service.  Much work has been done in changing attitudes but unless we build in adequate incentives, such as allowing retention of savings and providing the proper motivation to improve value for money, the optimum level of savings will not be achieved.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to initiate VFM programmes on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but to build it into the structure of the service.  I see my Department's role not just in encouraging VFM but in assisting agencies in the development, implementation and measurement of VFM strategy.  It is in this spirit of co-operative action that I have decided to establish the performance audit unit within my Department so that we can not only facilitate the transfer of good practice throughout the service but actually measure and be seen to achieve best value for money while ensuring that resources are allocated in the most equitable way possible between the various components of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely no one can argue against prudent management on the basis I have <Col N="1669" /> outlined.  It is only when all such possibilities have been fully implemented that one could properly consider the need, if any, for additional funding.  Certainly now is not the time to come to conclusions on this issue.</P>

      <P>The costs of certain schemes, such as the drugs subsidy schemes, are very difficult to control. They have, in recent years, put a great deal of pressure on health boards.  I have, on a number of occasions, indicated to this House my concern about this growing problem, most recently during my statement on the budget on 6 February.  It has now been decided that these costs will be identified in a separate subhead.  The full cost of meeting these schemes will be funded from the Exchequer, relieving the boards of the necessity to make savings elsewhere, if the costs prove to be higher than initially estimated.  This should be of major assistance to the health boards in maintaining services during this year.</P>
      <P>Containing activity and unit costs at agreed levels throughout the year will require careful management controls in health boards and hospitals throughout 1991.  The Government will honour fully all commitments: the message I want to give to the House and to the public is that services will be maintained at not less than the levels approved for 1990.  There simply will not be the deterioration in services this motion talks about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I am surprised and disappointed that Deputy Bruton should advocate an increase in health boards' overdrafts as a means of solving a problem which, as of now, does not exist.  As I remarked during my budget statement to the House on 6 February, it is difficult to know where Fine Gael stand.  On the one hand, they say we are spending too much money and, on the other, they come in here regularly and say we are not spending enough.  In this instance, they seem to be hedging their bets.  We should, they say, allow health boards to extend their credit with <Col N="1670" /> the banks despite the fact that we may not require this credit later in the year.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable proposal but one which bears all the hallmarks of the party's approach to the financing of the health services when they were in Government.  Because of that approach we find ourselves still grappling with an uneconomic level of bank debt.  It is certainly not my intention to add further to our problems by accepting the terms of this motion.</P>

      <P>Let me now return to the accusations that have been made on many occasions that recommendations of reports on the health services are not being implemented.  I established a number of working groups in recent years to advise me on priorities for the development of individual services; my predecessors have done the same.  In a service as complex and costly as health, such examinations will always be necessary. In this respect, we are no different to all other developed countries.  It would be inexcusable if, when allocating £1.5 billion of public money, we failed to engage in fundamental reviews of individual service areas.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased with the important work done by such groups as the Commission on Health Funding which I established. They reviewed the entire structure and funding system of the health services.  The reports of the Working Group on Health and Welfare Services for the Elderly, the Green Paper on Services for the Disabled and the Study Group on Psychiatric Services, <i>Planning for the Future</i> have been enormously helpful in plotting the development of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to claims that these reports have been ignored, the Government are engaged and have been for some time in a careful and structured implementation of the key recommendations in each case. The implementation process began with the action plan which I announced to this House in February 1990.  It received a <Col N="1671" /> further major impetus with the conclusion of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> between the Government, trade unions and employer groups. The progress which has been made in implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Health Funding is a good example.  I will briefly highlight some of the main recommendations.</P>
    <P>As regards eligibility, the commission's key recommendation has been accepted and will be implemented with effect from 1 June 1991.  As regards administration and management, a major detailed preparatory work has been completed and, as indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government will announce their proposals during this year.  So far as information and evaluation are concerned, the action plan which I announced in February 1990 is being implemented.  In relation to drug costs, the FICI agreement is in place, the National Drugs Formulary has been launched and a special unit has been established within my Department to concentrate on all aspects of drug procurement, usage and costs.  Further developments will arise from the recently completed review of the GMS.  In relation to the provision of appropriate services, the options open to carers in planning the right mix of service for each patient will be considerably broadened by the enhancement of community based services in line with the service and financial commitments contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
    <P>I will return to some of these matters later.  It is, however, clear from this brief summary that, contrary to what is implied in the Fine Gael motion, there is a plan and reform is being implemented.</P>
    <P>Policy implementation is proceeding in a coherent way and is based on a substantial body of research and analysis of priorities.  Only in this structured manner can we ensure that we achieve value for money and the best possible services, given the resources available.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned, since becoming <Col N="1672" /> Minister for Health, about the importance of ensuring an adequate availability of key services in the community, including those for the elderly, the physically and mentally handicapped and children at risk.  The Commission on Health Funding stressed that it was not sufficient to expand these services in an undirected way.  A proper evaluation of the needs of specific target groups, and an assessment of the best means of meeting these needs, was required.  Accordingly, the action plan which I presented to this House in February 1990 allocated extra funds to carefully selected areas.  We spent an extra £5 million on services for the elderly, an additional £3 million on dental services and a further £2 million in the area of mental handicap.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that, following on the success of these extra allocations, we have been able to take a similar approach under the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>. The funding involved, however, will be substantially greater.  Over a seven year period we have committed ourselves to allocating £100 million of capital expenditure to community based services for the elderly, mentally and physically handicapped, psychiatric services, child care, dental services and health centres.</P>
    <P>The extra capital funding will be an important contribution to developing our community based services.  Up to now I have been particularly constrained in the capital funding available; the bulk of it has had to go, in the past, towards our in-patient services.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would remind Deputies that we will also be allocating significantly increased levels of current funding to these community based services.  By the end of the seven year plan, we will be spending £90 million above the present annual level of current expenditure in real terms.  The Government are committed to providing additional funding in each year's budget and a start has been made in this process in 1991.</P>
    <P>In my budget speech last week I dealt with many of the aspects of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>. I will not go over them now, but <Col N="1673" /> I will move on to other aspects of the programme, for instance, eligibility which was mentioned here tonight.  To ensure the greatest possible equity in the availability of health services, new arrangements for eligibility for public hospital services were announced in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  These measures were recommended by the Commission on Health Funding and by the National Economic and Social Council and were sought by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the context of the programme.</P>
    <P>In brief, the principal changes are the abolition of the income limit for Category 2 eligibility so that all patients will now be entitled to public consultant services, free of charge and the modification of the present arrangements for admission to public ward accommodation in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>The removal of the income limit will rectify a number of anomalies identified by the commission which arise in determining eligibility for a hospital services card, while the new admission arrangements will contribute towards equity of access to public beds.  Under the new admission arrangements the availability of public beds for public patients will be increased by requiring private patients needing other than emergency treatment to avail of private or semi-private accommodation. Emergency cases will continue to be admitted to whatever bed is available.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the income limit will take effect on 1 June next and the new arrangements for access to public beds will be phased in gradually over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>In improving the position of public patients, the Government will also ensure that the public hospital system continues to cater adequately for the needs of private patients.  The Government also recognise the crucial role played by voluntary health insurance.  In introducing the new system the Government will be sensitive to the need to ensure that the public hospital system caters adequately for the requirements of private patients and that the important <Col N="1674" /> role and contribution of voluntary health insurance is not diminished in any way.</P>
    <P>The decision to continue full tax relief on health insurance premium illustrates the Government's commitment to this principle.  The introduction of the new eligibility arrangements follows upon the very detailed analysis of the Commission on Health Funding and the National Economic and Social Council.  Once again, it is an illustration that the Government are ensuring that the changes necessary for a more equitable and efficient health service are carefully researched and identified and then implemented in a planned manner.</P>
    <P>The current negotiations with medical consultants cover a number of vital issues, including the implications of the change in eligibility.  Agreement on matters such as pay, accountability and the management role of consultants is central to the future orderly management and delivery of a high quality service that must have regard to available resources.</P>
    <P>We have been fortunate in this country to have such a committed and highly qualified medical staff who can be justly proud of the quality of service which has been achieved.  I would like to put on record the Government's commitment to achieving an agreement which will do justice to the interests of the patients, the consultants and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>A major review of the organisational structures of the health services is in progress. The purpose of this important review is to establish how our health services can be better organised to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness from the very substantial resources being provided by Government.  That review began with the analysis of administrative structures prepared by the Commission on Health Funding in chapter 9 of their report.  The report analysed, in broad outline, the weakness and strengths of the existing structure.  It identified the lack of integration of related services and inadequate accountability within the existing structures as major shortcomings which any solution must address.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the commission's report I announced an action <Col N="1675" /> plan in February last year to provide a pragmatic strategy for the implementation of major improvements in identified areas of the health services which I regarded as priority areas.  A central pillar of that action plan was the establishment of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group and the Hospital Efficiency Review Group to advise on the detailed strategy to improve efficiency within the health services.  I now have the recommendations of both groups in relation to organisational structures particularly in the Dublin area.  Both groups have concluded that services could be delivered more effectively if mechanisms were developed to co-ordinate services better and improve resource management and have made a range of very detailed proposals.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government have set out their decisions on the principles upon which the organisation of the health services should be based.  The principles are based on the findings of the expert groups which I have already mentioned.  As promised in the programme, the details of the Government's proposals will be announced during this year.</P>
    <P>This issue is of fundamental importance. It calls for time and care and it will get the time and care this issue requires. I am satisfied that the time and care given to preparing our proposal is more than justified.  I also see it as appropriate that those proposals should be announced in the context of a programme which provides for major investment in the development of our health services and especially community services.  I am also working on a patient's charter about which I will be saying more in the future.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists are a feature of all health systems.  Better health care with ever increasing demands on services, the needs of our growing elderly population and even the development of new forms of treatment, such as hip replacement surgery, have all had effects on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In 1989, certain areas were identified as requiring special attention and additional <Col N="1676" /> resources were targeted for these areas. I have placed strong emphasis on tackling waiting lists in general and waiting lists for hip replacement operations, ear, nose and throat surgery and cataract surgery in particular.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to report on the progress made with regard to these procedures. The waiting list for hip replacement operations has decreased by over 12 per cent since April 1990.</P>
    <P>With regard to ENT, in the Deputy's area of Cork, last year there was a reduction of 45 per cent in the waiting list and a reduction of 55 per cent in Temple Street.</P>

      <P>I will be saying more about the medical card appeal system which we will be establishing in the very near future.  I have referred before to the information technology recommended by the commission on funding: we have a special provision of £4 million for that this year and very substantial progress has been made in a number of hospitals around the country.</P>
      <P>Health agencies the world over always seek additional funding partly because of the complexity of the services and partly due to the demand-led nature of so many of the services they provide.  I as Minister for Health must distinguish between demands and need and fund the latter. To do otherwise would mean that a disproportionate and unjustified amount of public money would be committed to the health services.  Indeed, it would be true to say that the entire gross national product of any developed country could in time be consumed by the health services if every pressure group were to get its way.  I could not stand over such an approach, nor could any responsible Minister for Health.  A far better strategy is to work at getting the maximum return from every pound invested and seek efficiencies where they can be found. Then, and only then, should the question of additional funding be considered to finance needs and not demands.</P>

They got a very substantial increase: they got £2 million in last year's budget which has been repeated in the current year, plus another £1 million.

      <P>I wish that all speakers so far in this debate would realise that there is an element of disbelief out there about what is really happening in the health services.  I do not think the Minister has for one moment addressed what is a major problem.  This sense of complacency was indicated by the Taoiseach even last week when he said across the floor of the House in the budget debate that he did not know what was the matter <Col N="1679" /> with the health services, because in real terms there is real money available.  The Minister has now confirmed and continued that attitude.  Does the Minister not realise that there are also increased costs in real terms in the health service? Because of that, there are areas in which the boards have no control whatsoever over expenditure, like the GMS and, indeed, the hospital activity that has been increased over the years.  These are increases and hidden charges in reduced estimates or estimates with which they are unable to maintain their services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  There are problems in health areas because of these deficiencies that are outside their control. I am surprised at the original motion from the Fine Gael Party which we are now discussing.  It does not go nearly far enough to analyse the short term crisis in our health service and in proposing the solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly &mdash; and the Minister has touched on this &mdash; I find it extraordinary that the Fine Gael Party in particular, the party of so-called fiscal rectitude, should be proposing here that a rational solution to the crisis in our health services would be to allow health boards to increase their already substantial overdrafts.  Fine Gael have never been able really to face up to the truth of the crisis in the health service. It was the budget of 1987, it should be remembered, that led to the start of this crisis.  It was the present Leader of Fine Gael who introduced that budget.  Since then, that party have begun the process of starving the health boards of resources and they have been unable to admit that the problem is simply and almost exclusively a shortage of financial resources. <Col N="1680" /> That is why every time a solution is proposed they have always stopped short of saying that what the health services need should be paid for by the Exchequer. That is the kernel of the problem.  People are entitled to the service and if this Government and this Dáil do not provide the resources, we are doing a disservice to the people we represent.  The closest that Fine Gael have ever come since the 1989 election was their proposed to allocate funds out of the national lottery, as if that was a reasonable basis on which to plan the health services &mdash; based on gambling.  We should not be gambling with people's health care.</P>
    <P>It is a statutory responsibility on us all to ensure that this Dáil provides sufficient funds to provide health care for our people.  It is neither sensible nor practical in the light of experience &mdash; and I have many years' experience on a health board &mdash; to attempt to address the problems by encouraging health boards to increase their existing overdrafts.  Experience has shown us that that simply defers the problem for another year.  The Minister accused health boards previously of doing this, at a time when the Minister's members were on health boards advocating the increasing of overdrafts.  The Fine Gael Party, as well as everyone else in this House, know it well.  We should be honest and responsible in demanding an increase from the Exchequer and we should do so immediately.  They know that that would leave their leader with egg on his face, having regard to his record in the area of fiscal rectitude, and that it would make a nonsense of what has passed for a philosophy for some time in the recent past.</P>
    <P>The immediate crisis in the health service arises in two areas.  First &mdash; and this is the real crisis &mdash; is the shortfall in health board allocations.  This has been confirmed by all the health boards.  Some of them have rejected it, some of them have had to go back, under threat of abolition under section 31, to cut back services in spite of the Minister's request not to do so.  These shortfalls to health boards will inevitably lead to cutbacks in elective treatments and to longer waiting <Col N="1681" /> lists.  Second, there is the acute shortage in provision, both current and capital, in the area of services for people with mental and physical handicap.  There have been increases in those two areas but nothing like what is required to give the services that people with mental and physical handicap need.</P>

      <P>I spoke about the enormous national debt the previous Administration got this country into and the problems that put on the shoulders of the incoming Government in 1987.  Frederick I said that the surest way to destroy a State is to have it governed by professors. It is clear to us who have been following the state of our economy that a professor leading a Government from 1982 to 1987 did his best to destroy this State.  The restrictions, the actions, malpractices and the inability of the Government of 1982-87 placed on the incoming Government from 1987 are still with us today.  The manoeuvrability of any Minister has been severely restricted.  We have heard calls in the last hour or so for more money to be put into the health services; more money has been put into the health services. This Government would like to give more money to the health services but we can refer back to the Government by that professor from 1982-87, which is restricting the manoeuvrability of our Minister for Health today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this enormous handicap Fianna Fáil have, since 1987, faced the reality of the bankruptcy facing this <Col N="1682" /> country.  They took the problem by the scruff of the neck and administered the corrective action needed to bring the country back from the brink.  Fianna Fáil took this action in 1987 when we were a minority Government because we saw it was necessary to ensure that in years to come we would be in control of our own destiny, that we would have money to put into education, environmental projects and health care.  We needed no push from parties of the Right or Left.  We did what was necessary and will continue to do what is necessary.</P>
    <P>During that period there were three main areas to be targeted &mdash; social welfare, taxation and budgetary discipline. In the tradition of Fianna Fáil since 1926, we looked after the less well off in our society.  The increases in social welfare since 1987 have been consistently above the rate of inflation.  We gave increases higher than the inflation rate to people in the lower wage bracket and those in receipt of unemployment assistance.  We gave lump sum increases which did not relate to inflation, because if people depended on getting <i>pro rata</i> increases they would never be any better off.  We have seen the necessity for giving lump sum increases in order to give a decent level of benefit to those on the lowest rung of the ladder.</P>
    <P>We also recognised the children of the country by giving increases in the monthly rate of child benefit.  We widened the qualification this year for the carer's allowance.  This allowance has been misunderstood and misrepresented. It is clear that there were many people in our society who were not receiving any benefit.  They were not getting unemployment assistance because they were not available for work and they were not getting unemployment benefit.  Deputy Woods as Minister for Health decided to introduce a carer's allowance.  Some people, for political reasons, tried to misrepresent this allowance as being something it was not and consequently it was misunderstood.  It is now clear that it benefits people who had not been receiving any benefit.  The Minister and the Government extended to 21 years of age <Col N="1683" /> the qualification for children of long term social welfare recipients in full-time education.  This is a welcome decision because many people were not able to afford education.  I welcome this decision to increase the age limit again.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Government for improving the family income supplement scheme. This is an excellent scheme which ensures that people will go out and work rather than stay at home and draw the dole.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the area of taxation.  I have listened to the Leader of the Opposition on numerous occasions in the last week or two saying that there has been no change in the income tax area and that there has been no movement in income tax rates, income tax bands or income tax allowances.  This is not true, as the facts show.  In 1987 the income tax rates are 29 35 per cent, 48 per cent and 58 per cent. In 1991-92, the income tax rates are 29 per cent, 48 per cent and 52 per cent which represents a change downwards. Income tax bands in 1987-88 were £4,700 at 35 per cent, £2,800 at 48 per cent and the balance at 58 per cent for a single person.  The income tax bands in 1991-92 were £6,700 at 29 per cent, £3,100 at 48 per cent and the balance at 52 per cent. The rate for married couples are doubled with £9,400 at 35 per cent, £5,600 at 48 per cent and the balance of 58 per cent in 1987-88 and in 1991-92, £13,400 at 29 per cent, £6,200 at 48 per cent and the balance at 52 per cent.  There have been significant increases in the rates and in the tax bands over the years Fianna Fáil were in power.</P>
    <P>There have been minimum increases in allowances.  There have been increases from £2,000 for a single person's allowance to £2,100 in 1991-92 and in 1987-88, from £4,000 for a married couple to £4,200 in 1991-92.  There have been improvements in tax rates, bands and allowances over the years Fianna Fáil have been in power.  To put it into context, we have to remember we are fighting a debt of £25 million and we are still improving income tax as well as reducing the debt placed on us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> One area that has concerned me is that of widowed persons.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, on introducing a special allowance this year for widowed persons.  It shows that the Minister and the Government realise the great pressure which widowed persons experience. I hope this allowance will improve as the years go on and as the Government have more finance available.</P>
    <P>However, I would request the Minister to look again at the BES scheme.  There have been abuses of this scheme over the years but there are genuine people who in the last six or nine months made plans, in good faith, and now find themselves in great trouble.  I would ask the Minister to look again at this scheme and at the hardship cases and allow some relief between now and the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The third element of the budget relates to budgetary discipline.  Since 1987 Fianna Fáil have worked wonders with the budgetary position.  Foreign debt has fallen, and, more importantly, the debt-GNP ratio has fallen from 131 per cent in 1987 to 111 per cent in 1990.  However, when one considers that the debt-GNP ratio in developed countries is in the area of 35 to 40 per cent, it puts into perspective the task that is ahead for this Government and for future Governments.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government on the excellent budget they have prepared.  It was prepared in a time of great strife and great difficulty, with negotiations in Europe, war in the Middle East, GATT negotiations and CAP negotiations.  It was a time for battening down the hatches and keeping the ship on a steady course and I congratulate the Government for steering along the right course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I came here tonight to speak on the budget debate.  Having listened in particular to the rural Deputies and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to the advantages of this budget to rural areas, I ask myself a simple question: do we live in the same country as we try to praise or broaden <Col N="1685" /> out the benefits of this budget for agriculture? It is my intention in the time available to me to stay with the area of agriculture, because the greatest single problem for the economy of this country will take place in agriculture over the next couple of years.  There is a lot of uncertainty and there is nothing more uncertain than the situation in agriculture created by the present Coalition Government led by Fianna Fáil.  For the past 12 months we have had the Minister for Agriculture and Food insisting that the decrease in farm incomes is somewhere in the region of 6 to 7 per cent.  However, he persisted in that line right up to 30 January 1991 when he called a press conference. Unfortunately he did not attend the press conference himself but sent his officials to talk to the press.  I quote from an article by Mr. William Dillon, Agriculture Correspondent, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 30 January 1991:</P>
      <P>The drop in real farm incomes last year was much higher than the seven per cent official figure vigorously promoted by Minister Michael O'Kennedy, the Department of Agriculture admitted yesterday.</P>
      <P>Real earnings for farmers declined by more than 13 per cent when account is taken of a number of factors for which no calculation was made in the figures used by the Minister, senior officials disclosed.</P>
      <P>Are we to take it at this stage that the officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food misled the Minister or did the Minister on purpose mislead the people?  Those are the questions I pose at present.  I have not the slightest doubt but that the latter is the truth, that the Minister set out to mislead the people.  I claimed as far back as August and September 1990 that the real decrease in net income to farmers would be in the region of 15 per cent.  The Minister is now prepared to admit that the decrease is 13 per cent or more.  That is what his officials said.  The Minister is treating agriculture with contempt when he was not prepared to attend that meeting and meet the press and answer the relevant questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> In analysing that figure I reckon that approximately £200 million, was taken out of agriculture last year.  That is a disastrous situation but that is not the whole picture.  At present we see the failure of the Minister to come before this House to have a proper debate on agriculture and discuss how the problems could be ironed out.  We have the MacSharry proposals and the GATT agreement. I do not worry so much about the GATT agreement because it is spread over ten years and the overall impact will not be that great but I certainly worry, as does every farmer in the country, about the MacSharry proposals for the EC Commission.  It is my belief that the farmers face a further reduction in net incomes of between 8 per cent and 12 per cent.  I would ask the Government if there is any other section of the community who, over a period of two years, would be asked to take a reduction in the region of 25 per cent in their net income and what effect that would have on them. Still, they have brazened it out on the far side and I am glad that the local elections are forthcoming.  They will not have long to wait until the farmers, particularly in Munster and Leinster, tell them plainly where they stand.  During the last election the Taoiseach said he did not believe things were so bad in the health area but the people soon told him where he stood. There is a fair cushion in Connacht and Ulster where people in the severely handicapped areas can draw very substantial grants but not in Munster and Leinster where we have a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the disadvantaged areas.  We have heard from the Minister of the great allocation he has made to agriculture.  I will read out the headings as they are in the budget speech. A total of £19 million is being allocated for the disadvantaged areas scheme, £2 million for farm improvements, £600,000 for installation grants, £1.2 million to Teagasc, and £1 million for low income farmers.  The latter allocation makes a real joke out of farmers.  He did not spell out on the day of the budget or afterwards what this £1 million meant.  I reckon there <Col N="1687" /> are 30,000 low income farmers so that they will have about £20 each per annum out of this £1 million.  That is what makes a joke of the whole thing.  If all these figures are added up the total allocation to agriculture is £25.3 million.  Of the £25.3 million I reckon that the EC will pay approximately £10 million, so that the total amount from the budget, so far as farmers are concerned, is about £13 million.</P>
    <P>I was not a Member of this House when the Minister made his submission to Brussels on the reclassification of the disadvantaged areas in 1987.  He withdrew that submission and has not as yet, almost three and a half years later, submitted new proposals.  Yet he constantly states in this House that they will be approved next week or the week after. They were supposed to be approved last October but they still have not been approved.</P>
    <P>Almost all the land in the West is a disadvantaged area.  I understand there is a proposal to delare all of County Galway as a severely handicapped area. I understand from information which has been leaked that it is proposed to include only 34 per cent of County Wexford in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I want to warn the Minister that if he attempts to designate only 34 per cent of County Wicklow as a disadvantaged area we will challenge that decision in court.  Like other TDs from County Wexford I have travelled throughout the county to examine the different agricultural areas.  I have been in politics for 25 years and I have never seen poverty in agriculture such as that which exists at present.  The Government should come clean on which areas of the country they are going to reclassify so that people will know what are the proposals.</P>
    <P>We told the Minister we would not accept his decision in regard to the Mulder scheme and we challenged it in court.  The milk quota taken from Irish farmers by the EC under the Mulder scheme was fully restored to them at that time.  If the Minister excludes any areas <Col N="1688" /> from the reclassification of the disadvantaged areas schemes which qualify for inclusion under the criteria laid down by the EC we will challenge that decision in the courts.  We are not going to allow the Minister to steamroll over the people of County Wexford.  We would even go so far as to form associations throughout Leinster and Munster to ensure that certain areas are included in the scheme.  We are not prepared to accept that type of decision making.  The Minister is responsible for the decisions taken in regard to this scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the inheritance tax. During the early seventies people had to pay death duties and it took the Coalition Government led by Fine Gael to remove those duties.  The inheritance tax is much worse than death duties.  I want to refer to the amounts which have to be paid in death duties.  The legal costs plus stamp duty and inheritance tax on a 100 acre farm would be somewhere in the region of £25,000-£30,000.  I cannot put an exact figure on the amount as it depends on the valuation of the farm.  Unless a farmer with 100 acres has a substantial milk quota he will not be viable at present.  An unfortunate young farmer who is taking over a farm from his parents will be asked to hand out about £30,000 in inheritance tax and legal costs.  This makes it prohibitive on farmers to transfer their land to their sons.  A son who wants to take over his father's 150 acre farm will have to pay almost £30,000-£40,000 in inheritance tax.  It is not possible for such farmers to transfer their land to their sons.  Fianna Fáil have neglected this issue down through the years.  It took the Coalition Government led by Fine Gael to remove the death duties so that farmers could transfer their farms to their sons.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has stated in this House that he wants young farmers to take over the land because it is a young man's game.  However, the present level of inheritance tax is prohibitive and will not enable farms to be transferred.  This will be disastrous for agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> I want to refer to the proposals in relation to green diesel, agricultural contractors, all vehicle parts in garages, land reclamation and agricultural services, including veterinary services.  The cost to farmers of the 12.5 per cent taxation charge on veterinary services will be roughly £4 million.  The extra charges imposed on agriculture in this budget amount to approximately £5 million- £7 million.  If the Minister had made his submission on the disadvantaged areas to Brussels in time he could have ensured that farmers would be cushioned against a reduction in their incomes over the next two to three years.  I accuse the Government of being neglectful in this area.</P>
    <P>No recognition has been given in the budget to the benefits which can accrue to our economy from the agricultural sector.  Last year agricultural exports amounted to about £3.2 billion while manufacturing industry amounted to about £9 billion-£10 billion.  While the import content in the manufacturing sector is around 50-55 per cent, the import content in the agricultural sector is somewhere in the region of 20 per cent. This means that agriculture still represents between 35 and 40 per cent of the total economy of this country.  While the exports may deny this, they will not say anything about the import content in the manufacturing sector.  Approximately 200,000 are employed in the manufacturing sector while 205,000 are employed in agri-business.  This gives an indication of the contribution agriculture can make to our economy.</P>
    <P>If Commissioner MacSharry's proposals are accepted, the Government will be seen to be negligent so far as agriculture is concerned.  I have accused Commissioner MacSharry of taking a western outlook to Irish farming, these proposals will be seen as an attack on the productive farmers, the people who have won our quota down through the years.  Any attempt to take some of the quota from our top milk producers and distribute it among the smaller milk producers will prove disastrous in the long term.  I am prepared to accept that I am being somewhat negative <Col N="1690" /> but in the time available to me I cannot put forward alternative proposals. During the council elections we will remind people of the Government's total neglect in regard to agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Lest it skips my mind later, I should like to defend the Minister for Agriculture and Food against the onslaught by the Deputy opposite.  I believe the Minister for Agriculture and Food has shown down through the years that he has sought to protect the interests of Irish farmers at all times and it is nothing short of scandalous for a Member of the House to come in here and attack the Minister in such a manner.  I believe proof positive of the Minister's desire to protect Irish farmers will be found when Commissioner MacSharry puts his proposals on the table and the Minister has had an opportunity to look at them.  I have the utmost confidence that the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government will not be found wanting when the interests of Irish agriculture and farmers are threatened.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that four factors influenced the framing of this budget in late December and January.  The Gulf War and the uncertainty which surrounded the outcome of that war were uppermost in the minds of the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet at that stage. The great uncertainty which surrounded the international economic outlook for 1991 also had to be considered.  The Programme for Government agreed in July 1989, and in particular the provisions which related to public expenditure control, taxation reform, employment creation, health services and social welfare, were also foremost in the mind of the Minister for Finance when he was framing this budget.  He also had to bear in mind the provisions in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and accomplishing them within the budgetary process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> It is only right that I should congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government for the successful way they have managed our economy since returning to power in July 1989.  Indeed, this is just a continuation of the successful policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil Administration which took office in 1987.  The Government's aim in this year's budget was to maintain the economic progress which started in 1987.  The success of recent Government policy is a result of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which expired in December.  The commitment made by the Government to the social partners in relation to the overall economic policy and to the various other aspects of social equity and employment creation has been honoured.</P>
    <P>I am glad the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been agreed and, only last week, approved by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This new programme takes up where the old programme left off.  The 1991 budget was designed to underpin the economic progress which has been made so far and to ensure that the climate is right for the success of the new programme for national progress.  Consensus between the Government and the social partners has brought new levels of prosperity through industrial peace in Ireland.  The potential for even greater prosperity in our small country is still greater.  Nineteen ninety was another milestone on the road to national recovery.  The returns show a strong economic growth, sustained investment, a healthy trade balance and more people in employment.  It is regrettable that our level of unemployment has increased, but this can be put at the door of more of our emigrants returning to seek employment at home. It is also an indication of the problems being experienced in the international economy.  Prudent management of the public finances has resulted in an improvement in our economy.  Budgetary discipline has ensured investment and consumer confidence has been restored &mdash; far from the dark days of the previous <Col N="1692" /> Coalition Government which left office in 1987.</P>
    <P>Government borrowing is now at its lowest level in about 40 years.  The Government are on course to balance the current budget by 1993.  Having achieved that goal, no future Government should ever undertake the despicable practice of deficit budgeting which was started in 1973.  That practice has been continued by successive Governments and has brought nothing but hardship and disaster to this country.  Indeed, we are still paying for those decisions, and will be for a long time to come.  It is the intention of this Government, and should be the intention of all future Governments, to balance the annual budget.  Our foreign debt is now well below its 1986 level. Our national debt still stands at over £25 billion, and everybody should be fully aware that it is costing the taxpayer well over £2 billion per year to service that debt.  Let us put this in perspective: all the PAYE tax collected every year goes towards paying the interest on our national debt.  It is essential that we reduce this £25 billion debt as soon as possible in order to free funds for much needed projects in other areas of government. I commend the Government on the setting up of the new body to manage our national debt.  This initiative has borne fruit already in so far as in the last year and a half major savings have been made in the management of our national debt.</P>
    <P>The key to all recent improvements in the public finances and in the health of the economy has been the reduction in public expenditure over a four year period by almost 11 per cent of gross national product.  The major change of policy in 1987 came not a minute too soon.  If, as some are now beginning to suggest, we reverse this trend and again enter into the area of uncontrolled, unbridled public expenditure, the people we are supposed to represent would not forgive us.  It is essential that we continue to exercise disciplined control over public expenditure, which has obtained for the past four years, in order to achieve substantial reductions in our national debt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was recently signed provides a structure and a framework for the development of the economy and for the development of social policies over the next three years.  It will be a source of stability over that period.  It is comprehensive in its economic and social policies.  The overriding principle remains the firm control of public finances.  At this stage we should commend the Government and the social partners who were involved in drawing up and negotiating the new programme.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, FIE, CII, CIF, the IFA, ICMSA, the Irish Co-Operative Societies and Macra na Feirme in agreeing this programme, have done a good day's work.  Some commentators have been critical of the level of wage increases agreed in this programme, and when the Government look back on the programme perhaps they might be a little concerned about the excessive levels of wage increases that were agreed, but in putting a programme in place and providing a comprehensive framework which will last for three years, I think they have done well.</P>
    <P>Strict control of State expenditure is necessary to safeguard the future economic well-being of our people.  This well-being was in serious jeopardy up to recently and needed to be carefully watched over.  The choice we faced was simple: a continuation of the chronic economic and financial problems and being left behind as Europe and the rest of the world moved forward or to take the difficult course of correcting public finances, improving our economic performance and providing real prospects and opportunities for a worthwhile future for our children.  It was a difficult choice and Fianna Fáil in Government from 1987 faced up to that choice manfully.</P>
    <P>The correct decision was taken by the Taoiseach and the Government in 1987. We now have on offer a real prospect of finally overcoming our problems, no matter how difficult and intractable some of these still might seem.  The reduction of our national debt must remain one of our main priorities.  Our debt of £25 <Col N="1694" /> billion is still dangerously high.  Our debtgross national product ratio at 123 per cent still does not compare favourably with some of our European partners, but when one compares it to 131 per cent in 1987 and 111 per cent in 1990, one can certainly see the progress that has been made in that area.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government in the immediate future is to reduce that ratio to 100 per cent.  When one considers that developed countries have an average debt-GNP ratio of 40 per cent, one can see the problems we face.  The achievement of the overall reduction in personal taxation is required over an agreed time span.  This Government, more than any Government, have gone down the road of reducing personal taxation.  When one makes the comparison of 1985 &mdash; which was mid-term in the previous Coalition Government &mdash; and sees their record when tax rates were 35 per cent, 48 per cent and 60 per cent and when we, in Government, are well on our way to having two rates by 1993 of 25 per cent and an upper rate of 48 per cent, one can see the huge leaps we have made in the reduction of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>When one considers that the Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1985 was in the order of 12.9 per cent and that in 1990 we had reduced that to 1.9 per cent, I am sure even the most bitter Opposition Deputies must agree that formidable progress has indeed been made.  This level of growth has been made possible by the improved financial position while growth itself has, in turn, contributed to further improving the financial situation.  There was a slight rise in the rate of inflation in 1990.  However, it remained below the EC and OECD average and several points below our immediate partners, the UK, whose inflation rate is currently at something over 9 per cent.  Our inflation rate was indeed just over 1.5 per cent above the German inflation rate.</P>
    <P>Forecasters are predicting a rise in the number of those employed in the year to mid-April 1991.  This is very positive news for young unemployed Irish people.  One <Col N="1695" /> of the major characteristics of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was that almost all its objectives have been successfully achieved.  I wish the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> success.  I know, building on the previous experience of the last programme, that we can look forward to a good future for our young people.</P>
    <P>One must also pay particular tribute to the social partners to this new programme. It is a team effort and, without them, the substantial progress which was made over the past three years could not continue.  I commend the Government on the work they have done so far and I wish them continued success.  I know that, with the goodwill of the public and all the community, we can continue to prosper and go forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two main criteria which we in the Green Party look for in a budget.  First what does it do for the environment and, second, what does it do to remedy the dual scourges of unemployment and emigration?  I regret that this budget, like the 1990 budget of this Government, fails dismally on both counts.  If we look first at the environment we find that the only specific provision in the budget is a very minor, if welcome, taxation change in the farming area which gives fiscal incentives to farmers to install pollution control equipment.  The cost to the Exchequer is estimated by the Minister to be £3 million, and that is the only public expenditure specifically targeted towards improvement in our environment out of a total Government expenditure of £11 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing for renewable energy to supplement the meagre spending by the ESB in this area.  There is nothing to redress the reduction in the Vote for energy conservation of 26 per cent announced in the 1991 Estimates.  There is no increase in the amount of £1 million provided in the Estimates for the Environmental Protection Agency. There is, quite obviously, no sense of urgency in setting up this absolutely vital instrument in the fight against pollution. <Col N="1696" /> The need for both energy conservation and reducing our dependence on oil must be apparent to everyone in this House. The Gulf problems will not go away and even when the war is brought to a conclusion there will be many problems in this area.</P>
    <P>I will turn to the second failure in this budget, that is, to address the problems of unemployment and emigration.  The Minister in his speech talked about the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  In drafting this programme he stated that growth in employment should be top of the list of priorities.  The response by the Minister to this very laudable objective can only be described as pathetic.  In his budget speech, he nevertheless admitted that unemployment will increase from 224, 700 to 228,000.  There is nothing in this budget which does anything for employment or work creation. How can the Minister have the gall to state, in the same speech, that he wants to prioritise employment growth and at the same time admit that employment far from reducing is targeted to increase?  Let us be quite clear that everyone &mdash; and I repeat everyone &mdash; other than those who are so mentally or physically handicapped to be unable to work, is entitled, as of right, to paid work.  People want work not dole.  No one should be obliged to leave Ireland permanently because of the absence of paid work.  It is quite obvious where the Minister's priorities lie.  His first priority is to cater for the needs of big business, particularly foreign transnationals.</P>
    <P>Ireland has one of the lowest tax takes in Europe from corporation tax.  Total revenue estimated for 1991 amounts to a mere 8.8 per cent of total current revenue. The owners and controllers of these businesses have no interest in or incentive to create employment.  The Minister well knows that the only objective of a business enterprise is to maximise profits. Employing more staff quite obviously does not tend towards maximisation of profits.  Our whole tax system is very antiemployment through the operation of the PAYE/PRSI system.  While I welcome the income tax reductions, particularly <Col N="1697" /> for the lower paid, the whole tax system needs to be restructured and reformed in a radical way.  To describe the minimal changes in our tax system over the last few years as tax reform, as claimed by politicians in the major parties, is a gross abuse of the English language.</P>
    <P>There is only one short term answer to solving the unemployment and emigration problems and that is to share the work which is already there by job-sharing, reduced working hours, early retirement and career breaks.  This will probably require most employees to take reductions in their gross pay.  However, as there would be huge income tax reductions possible from the virtual elimination of social welfare payments, the reduction in net pay would be quite small. Profit sharing for medium sized and large firms should be introduced as an extra incentive.  Such a radical change in this area would require to be phased in over a period.  It would, of course, require the co-operation of employers and trade unions.  I appeal to the trade union movement, which has in the past played such a noble role in safeguarding the interests of the poor and underprivileged, to accept that their current policies do not adequately address the evils of unemployment. There is a failure to accept the reality that the high-tech industry which they espouse cannot create sufficient jobs to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Of course, the brunt of such a major change in work practices should not be borne by the lower paid and unskilled but should be extended to managers and professional people.  It is nonsense for politicians and economists to hold out the wonderful hope of growth-creating employment.  There has been growth as measured in conventional terms over the past two years but unemployment, far from reducing, has increased.  I ask the other political parties who cling to this illusion once and for all to admit collectively that growth is not going to solve our problem.  Apart from anything else, growth based largely on the use of fossil fuels and on industry and agriculture without adequate pollution controls is clearly not sustainable in the long term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> In addition to the radical changes in the area of paid work we would like to have a tax system which will create incentives for work creation and, at the same time, bring our modern world into harmony with the needs of the planet which in the long run is essential to the well-being of all of us.  The main thrust of the alternative taxation would be to bring in a tax based on energy and land.  That the world is using up precious resources of fossil fuels must be apparent to us all, yet the world's energy pricing does not provide for this in its costings, thus resulting in energy from non-renewable resources being grossly underpriced.  It is interesting that in an elite newspaper report it seems the EC is seriously considering a $10 a barrel tax on oil to reduce emissions and to reduce global warming. In addition, our own energy, particularly that emanating from Moneypoint power station is not carrying the real cost of the pollution control, due to the continued failure of the ESB to fit scrubbers to this station.  A realistic tax on energy would solve a number of problems simultaneously. An increase in electricity prices would force industry into using more intermediate technology with a corresponding increase in the workforce.  It would allow renewable energy in its various guises, hydro-power, wind power, tidal power, solar heating, biomass and so forth, to compete on a fair basis with non-renewable energy.</P>
    <P>The other question which is not addressed is that of our real energy requirements.  The Government should be targeting a substantial reduction in overall energy consumption over a 15-year period.  I have little doubt that a combination of more conservation and less wasteful usage could reduce our energy consumption to perhaps half its existing level.  With regard to petrol and diesel, further increases in taxation would reduce the use of private cars and encourage public transport.  It would also encourage people to live nearer their places of work.  With the increasing information technology the option of working from home is now very real.</P>
    <P>The other main tax which should be <Col N="1699" /> introduced is a tax on land, on all land irrespective of its use.  I want to make it quite clear that this is not just a tax on farmers but would extend to land users for houses, industry, shops, etc.  As it would be based on the rent and value of the land the tax per acre would vary very considerably.  The projected tax yield from these taxes would enable the abolition of VAT, income tax and PRSI. Excise duty would continue to be levied on drink, tobacco and other luxuries.  In any event, income tax is fatally flawed as it is totally unsuited to a country such as ours with its very large informal economy. The introduction of a system of guaranteed basic income to replace social welfare would facilitate greatly these radical changes in our tax system.</P>
    <P>To turn again to the budget, I welcome the social welfare increases even though in the absence of a basic income scheme such increases would increases the poverty trap.  I would like to state once again that the real answer to unemployment is not increases in the dole but provision of paid work.  The cost to the community and to these unfortunate people who find themselves unemployed is incalculable.  Huge increases in crime over the last few years, particularly in urban areas, have been quite noticeable.  The continued failure of successive Administrations even to cost a basic income scheme is quite incredible. The lack of incentive for the long term unemployed to seek work is notorious. The long term unemployed are not even entitled to educate themselves without incurring the risk of losing their dole.  It is absolutely ludicrous to have 224,000 people paid by the Government to do nothing when there is so much useful work to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech estimates the number in the public service at 199,000 people, a reduction of 18,000 since 1987.  The Minister is claiming great credit for this.  I beg to disagree.  What these statistics mean is another 18,000 people on the dole queues or who have taken the emigrant ships or are paid to do nothing.  Any policy which results in this type of solution is absolutely crazy. <Col N="1700" /> However, the Minister is still not satisfied. He states the reduction in staff numbers must go on.  Meanwhile there is a huge backlog of work in the income tax offices.  The Registry of Deeds, the Companies Registration Office and the Patent Office are all grossly understaffed.  These areas should be self-financing and run on commercial lines.  They should charge an appropriate fee for their services and should have freedom to recruit the necessary staff.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the numbers employed in the public service have resulted in the Government being unable to provide the required range of services in an effective manner.  That is not to say the Green Party are in favour of a large public sector which, of necessity, requires high rates of taxation.  Quite to the contrary, the Green Party believe in decentralisation of administration in all possible areas.  This should result in a much more efficient and cost effective community service replacing a bureaucratic, centralised structure.  This Government and their predecessors have attempted to run the same level of public service with a large reduction in numbers. This is clearly dishonest.  It is now apparent that the present numbers employed in the public service are either insufficient to provide the level of public service the Government purport to provide or productivity in the public sector has not improved.  In the long run, the only answer is the type of decentralisation administration I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>One of the major budgetary problems we have had over the years is the funding of the interest on our national debt.  The huge increase in both the amount of the debt and consequent cost of funding is probably the greatest scandal of all.  This huge accretion in the national debt is a result of the most blatant vote buying, and virtually all parties in this House have to accept responsibility for this.  The Minister himself has mentioned that more than £2 billion or nearly 75 per cent of income tax revenue goes on servicing this debt.  This always means that room for manoeuvre in the budget is very limited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> What is not in the budget speech is perhaps more significant than what is in it.  In a very lengthy statement, running to 58 pages, the Minister has devoted little more than a page to agriculture and food.  It is quite amazing that what was once Ireland's major industry is now dismissed in such a cavalier fashion.  What little there is about agriculture targets the wrong priorities.  There is nothing about encouragement towards organic farming, nothing about the replacement of the now totally discredited CAP by a system of income support as recommended by the United Farmers' Association, a body who represent the interests of small and medium farmers.  A radical reform of agriculture will be necessary in the interests of the environment and of the vast majority of people who do not earn their living from farming.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with the more detailed aspects of the budget in the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a time when budget day was the highlight of the parliamentary year.  It is still a very important occasion but in recent years I feel budget day tends to be less unique an occasion when the great blueprint of the Government's economic strategy is revealed.  Budgets for a number of years have had to take into account many various policy areas.  For example, in the 1991 budget which we are debating at the moment the various aspects of the budget had to take into account the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and, on a more general level, the fact that we are moving closer to completing the Internal Market and to European integration.  There is nothing wrong with using the budget in this way and seeing it as part of a bigger instrument or a wider articulation of Government policy.  In the past some Governments tended to work in isolation from the various sectors of Irish society as if they were mutually antagonistic.  In the sixties Seán Lemass attempted to change this with his approach to budgets.  The Taoiseach has followed that policy today in involving each of the social partners on the path <Col N="1702" /> towards national recovery and progress. Accordingly, not only can each sector participate and benefit from such discussions but they and the Government can ensure that nobody will be forgotten or precluded from taking full advantage of the opportunities in a ten year strategy for progress in the linked areas of social and economic progress.  In any context, such progress is possible only if the Government maintain a disciplined approach to the public finances.  In general terms the Minister for Finance has achieved this.  As a result the Minister can give encouragement to continued investment, keep the underlying borrowing trends within targets and continue economic achievements and policies which since 1987 have seen the country re-established on a sound economic footing.</P>
      <P>The country was in an economic mess in the mid-eighties and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was aptly named at that time in 1987.  The programme lived up to its brief.  There have been four budgets since 1987 and all of them, including the one before us this year, reflect the Government's commitment to economic stability and progress whether in areas of taxation or expenditure particularly in the big spending Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Education. There is a clear long term strategy not only to restore stability but to ensure that all sectors of society are carried towards recovery in a way which is detrimental to none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 budget reveals a sense of balance in so far as the business community is concerned.  It will encourage the investor confidence necessary to increase employment.  This is not being done at the expense of the weaker sections. I was pleased about the increase of 4 per cent in social welfare, which is above the rate of inflation of 2.7 per cent. This, taken with the cumulative effect of reducing the standard tax rate by 6 per cent since 1989 and the changes in the FIS makes it clear that recent budgets have tended towards substantial improvements for those on lower <Col N="1703" /> incomes, whether they are on social welfare or are employed on low income. In addition, the Minister's concession to increase the rate for the long term unemployed to £55 represents an increase of nearly 6 per cent.  There is also an 11 per cent increase for the short term unemployed in that this benefit has been increased from £45 to £50.  The budget reflects a tangible commitment to assist those on the lower end of the scale.</P>
    <P>I will concentrate now on an area which might not have been addressed in much detail by other speakers, that is the £500,000 in the budget for women's groups.  This provision was first made last year by the Government to be divided between the Rape Crisis Centres and women's organisations.  My difficulty with the provision last year was that the women's aid and refuge centres, a group which I particularly represent, could not be covered.  I am glad that both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare referred to this, this year, and ensured that money would be provided to finance the much needed work done by this group.  I have a particular interest in this not only as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights but because of the Meath women's refuge which is located in my county in Navan which covers counties of the north-east, Louth, Longford, Monaghan, Westmeath, Cavan, Meath and parts of County Dublin.  Refuge centres such as this provide a much needed service by people who are giving their time voluntarily on a 24 hour day, seven day a week basis.  It is difficult for these people to go out and fund-raise as well. I am delighted that the £500,000 in this year's budget will assist these groups in their work.</P>
    <P>The money allocated last year for womens' groups was divided between 200 groups in rural and urban areas.  The representatives from these groups attended a seminar in Dublin Castle in January.  I was glad to be able to attend this seminar where representatives of the groups explained what a magnificent opportunity it has been for them to get <Col N="1704" /> funding in the budget.  It is important for voluntary groups, particularly women's groups to get Government funding, no matter how small it is because it gives them recognition.  The Government should be complimented on recognising the need last year, and for this year including the provision in the budget again and for specifically targeting the area with which I was particularly concerned as was the Committee on Women's Rights, the area relating to women's shelters.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare should also be complimented on it.</P>
    <P>Many Irish women are caught up in an ill-defined world of part-time work.  Part-time working has increased dramatically here and in the EC in recent years and there has been too little effort to regularise it in the past, perhaps because part-time work was not in operation in so many employments.  Because the vast majority of part-time workers are women I have a particular interest.  The inequality already existing between male and female workers is reinforced by the fact that part-time workers are not properly regulated.  I am glad that in the budget part-time workers are being recognised in the Social Welfare provision for them and I am glad that later on this week in the House we will discuss legislation from the Minister for Labour regarding part-time workers.  About 70 per cent of part-time workers in Ireland are women.  Women are finding part-time work in the service and sales area and this has tended to create a two-speed labour system, with full-time workers enjoying the usual rights and part-time workers enjoying no rights.  Little was done to regulate this up to now.</P>
    <P>In the EC 85 per cent of part-time workers are women, the vast majority of whom are in insecure employment without social welfare protection.  I know this area is complicated and difficult to regulate but I am glad that at last something solid is being done in this area.  The budget suggests that the Government are making a good beginning in this area. I welcome the proposals to link social welfare payments to wages, particularly <Col N="1705" /> in cases where part-time workers cannot work because of illness or because of unemployment.  I would also urge the Minister to consider relating pensions to wages, although I understand that this will have to wait for the National Pensions Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>My second last point is in relation to another area which has been covered in the budget and specifically relates to women in the community, the carers and home helps.  Women are mainly the people who provide this service in our community.  Many of us have had difficulty with the carer's allowance, the fact that some people did not qualify, and others were not getting enough as it was means-tested with social welfare payments.  I am glad the budget has recognised disabled person's maintenance. The majority of refusals I was involved with were within the area of DPMA.  I am pleased these are now recognised as being eligible for carer's allowance.  There were complaints about people who were not getting the full allowance of £45 because of means-testing. In some cases they were only getting £13 or £14, but that is £13 or £14 per week more than the family would have been getting.  If the husband was in receipt of unemployment assistance he would have been getting the allowance for himself and his wife.  Most of the difficulty stems from the fact that he is getting £34 less while his wife is getting that £34, plus an additional £14 approximately. Their combined income is approximately £14 more and his wife is getting £45 into her hand.  I see no problem there.  I am glad to see in the budget that the carer's allowance has been increased from £45 to £50 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important concern of our economic planners must be to ensure a proper balance between the various socio-economic levels of Irish society. This year's budget reflects this sense of balance and, within the broader context <Col N="1706" /> of the integrated and more long term <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we can get back to the days not only of economic health but of the optimism and self-confidence which comes with it.  I am pleased the budget recognised and offered support to a number of women's groups which must be nurtured if women are to achieve anything near their potential in Irish society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage most of the provisions in the budget have been debated in depth by several Members on all sides.  However, listening to many speakers, and I am not referring to Deputy Wallace, it is rather cynical of a number of Fianna Fáil speakers, and indeed some Progressive Democrats speakers, to try to impress upon this House that the economic ills of this country originated during the period of the Coalition Government from 1983 to 1987.  I admit that economically that Government were not too successful. However, any effort they made to correct public finances during that period was met with a barrage of abuse from the then main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, and also well orchestrated resistance from organisations and individuals representing several diverse views throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 Fine Gael presented a framework for the future shape of our economy to the electorate.  This was rejected by the people.  No doubt they were influenced by the very cynical and skilful campaign carried out by Fianna Fáil on that occasion.  I will always remember those billboards: &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the weak and the handicapped&rdquo;.  Another beautiful billboard depicted a passport being handed to some young individual, implying that the only solution was to hand him a passport and get him out of the country.  Another billboard had a long queue to a social welfare office.  Those posters were displayed around the country for a year before that election and they had a major effect on the people.  As a result that Government were destroyed in the 1987 election. However, when the Fianna Fáil minority <Col N="1707" /> Government went into power in 1987 they took on that very same proposal almost verbatim and with the help of Fine Gael, through the Tallaght strategy, and the social partners, put that programme in place.  I am sure the Minister would agree that it was that type of co-operation and goodwill that ensured the success of that <i>Programme for Economic Recovery</i>. It is rather cynical that Fianna Fáil speakers one after another should claim all the credit and claim it as their own agenda, when really, going into the 1987 election, they presented no agenda to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 Fianna Fáil, and now their Coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats, have benefited substantially from certain measures like the bonanza from the tax amnesty which brought in over £500 million.  The sale of local authority houses which resulted in a major cash injection into local authorities substituted for Exchequer spending.  There was the windfall from the national lottery put in place by the previous Government.  This ensured that when the worst cuts were taking place, Government Ministers were able to go around and keep the people happy with little hand-outs or promises of hand-outs.  Now we are experiencing the doubling of the EC Structural Funds.  This is another cash injection into our economy which was not there previously.</P>
    <P>The improved tax collection system, or revenue buoyancy as it is called, which we are experiencing at the moment, was put in place by the previous Government when they appointed sheriffs in each county.  Definitely our whole tax collection system has improved substantially since we appointed sheriffs in each county to pursue defaulters.</P>
    <P>Last year in this House I listened to Deputy Dick Roche endeavouring to rewrite the economic history of Ireland.  Of course, he made no reference to his own part in the economic recklessness displayed in 1977 when he was personal adviser to Dr. Martin O'Donoghue.  I was disappointed to hear so many Fianna Fáil <Col N="1708" /> Deputies, and some Progressive Democrats Deputies, follow the very same line in this debate.  I am sure they have a lot more to offer and they could address our present problems rather than reflecting back and blaming all the ills on the period from 1987 to 1987.  They all failed to mention, except Deputy Charlie McCreevy, that from 1977 to 1981 the country was subjected to reckless economic strategies.  I refer to measures like the removal of car tax and the removal of rates from private houses, which plunged local authorities into a situation that they have never recovered from.  They have never funded themselves adequately after that removal of rates.  They will never refer to that period but they will always refer to the 1983-87 period and I hope we will not have a continuation of this in the next budget.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the incoming Government inherited an economy with inflation running at 22 per cent and interest rates at 18 per cent to 19 per cent.  By 1987 inflation was at 3 per cent and interest rates reduced substantially.  It is time for Deputies on the Government side of the House and Ministers to address the economic problems that we are experiencing today and not to refer continually to 1983-87. That is a deliberate ploy to divert attention away from their own failures in certain areas of the economy.  The greatest failure of this budget is its failure to address the major problem in our economy which is unemployment.  RTÉ are running a programme at the moment where they go to several different provincial towns around the country.  Each town has a worse story to tell.  Small towns are being denuded of their young population especially because of the lack of employment opportunities.  We have heard no reference to that except by the Minister himself.  Other Deputies prefer to ignore that instead of addressing the problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the problem of youth unemployment.  This has been brushed under the carpet despite the fact that unemployment for people under 25 years of age is now running at 23 per cent. This is 7 percentage points higher than <Col N="1709" /> ordinary unemployment rates.  Provision in the budget for young people is severely lacking.  There is no increase in the numbers being recruited by FÁS on Teamwork and SES schemes despite major oversubscriptions in Teamwork.  There is no provision for increasing the numbers of young people in apprenticeships despite shortages in industry.  It is now easier to get into third level education than to get an apprenticeship, which is ridiculous.  There is no increase in FÁS trainee allowances.  This is disgraceful considering that allowances were cut by £10 in 1988 and have remained static with no increases for national understandings and inflation.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> states that all training allowances will be reviewed.  When will this happen and will allowances be increased?  The problem of emigration is still very serious.  Approximately 31,000 people emigrated in 1989-90.  Those emigrating are, in the main, young people taking with them their enthusiasm, education and expertise.  This very serious situation is compounded by the underfunding of emigrant services abroad.  There have been no increases in funding for these services despite repeated calls from many concerned groups.  The £880,000 combined allocation for England and America is a mere drop in the ocean and is not sufficient to meet the needs of these services.  When one hears of the reports of the level of psychiatric illness among young Irish emigrants in England, it is then we should realise how important it is that we adequately fund our services for these young emigrants.</P>
    <P>The fundamental flaw in this year's budget is that it has failed to bridge the gap between unemployment and employment. While those on social welfare and on low incomes in employment get more money, there is no provision in the budget to help bridge the yawning gap for young people.  The most startling aspect of the budget is the admission by the Minister that unemployment will increase to an average of 228,000 for <Col N="1710" /> 1991.  After the publication of the January figures the Minister will have to revise his estimates upwards.  This must be a first for a Minister for Finance, having to frame a budget and admit to an increase in unemployment.  This is all the more bizarre as Ministers recently claimed that Ireland is experiencing an economic miracle.  If this is an economic miracle I dread the effects of a recession.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to engage in political point scoring on the dreadful prospect of continuing high unemployment and emigration.  I would rather compliment the Minister on his frankness.  It is a pity that many of his Deputies were not as frank.  This debate gives us an opportunity to deal with the problems with maturity.  Over the past few years our unemployment figures have been artifically depressed by the extraordinarily high levels of emigration particularly to Britain.  However, recent economic forecasts from across the water are alarming and have a strong bearing on our own economic prospects, particularly on rates of unemployment.  A survey a few weeks ago by the Confederation of British Industry showed that prospects for manufacturing output and employment are the worst since the recession of 1981.  Manufacturing investment is expected to fall by 16 per cent this year.  It is forecast that 90,000 manufacturing jobs will be lost over the next three months.  The outlook for the service sector is no better.  The London Chamber of Commerce is predicting rising unemployment in this sector.  Britain will let unemployment increase as a means of dampening demand to reduce their inflation figures. This gloomy outlook will have serious repercussions on our future.  Our high levels of emigration to Britain will ease with a corresponding increase in our levels of unemployment and the range of social evils that accompany it.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to have a fatalistic attitude to the problem and seem to think that creating the right economic climate will solve the problem.  This process will only have an incremental effect and will make no major impact on the figures.  The recent data on the 1989 <Col N="1711" /> school leavers is alarming.  It shows that nearly 17 per cent of school leavers had either emigrated or were unemployed a year after leaving school: this represents 25 per cent of that year group.  In the light of this information I would ask the Minister or the Taoiseach to immediately assemble an all party forum on unemployment and bring in the social partners, representatives of the unemployed as well as the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  We now need fresh and radical approaches to this problem before irreversible damage to the social fabric of our society is caused.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the special allocation for the Olympics in 1992.  This is the third year of the Olympic cycle.  It is now traditional that the Government make a special allocation in the budget to the Olympic Council of Ireland to fund the various training and preparation programmes for their athletes. However, this year the Government failed to do so.  It should be brought to the attention of the Taoiseach who has a very positive attitude to sport to ensure that many of our better athletes will not be denied the opportunity of winning medals in Barcelona.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West</i><b>):</b> Let me start by complimenting the Minister for Finance on the excellent job he has done on this year's budget.  In what has the makings of a very difficult year, he has managed to balance the many differing priorities and produce a budget which builds upon the successes achieved since 1987.  This budget, taken together with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreed last month represents the first stage of the next phase of economic and social development and provides a basis for growth well into the nineties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties facing the Minister in framing the budget should not be underestimated. Even before the Gulf conflict started, the outlook in the US and UK economies was giving cause for concern in terms of our growth prospects for 1991. <Col N="1712" /> The situation in the Gulf only adds to the uncertainties associated with these difficulties.</P>
    <P>This budget, however, steers a sure path between the need for continued vigilance on the public finances and the need to make further progress on tax reform, social welfare and jobs.  I firmly believe that this budget succeeds in these key areas.</P>
    <P>The successes of the last few years cannot be squandered now, they must be preserved and built on.  The maintenance of the downward pressure on the Exchequer borrowing requirement in a potentially difficult year is proof, if proof were needed, of this Governments's total commitment to reaching the targets they have set themselves.</P>
    <P>The budget impacts directly on most sectors of the economy through its expenditure provisions.  I will, therefore, devote some of my time to specific aspects of the Department of the Marine's responsibilities which cover most areas of the marine economy.  Due to the shortage of time I want to restrict myself to a few activities in which I have a personal interest.</P>
    <P>Our inland fisheries are a valuable natural resource, a fact recognised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Irish angling is worth in the region of about £65 million to the economy each year and generates the equivalent of about 1,900 full-time jobs.  My objective, therefore, for the inland fisheries are to facilitate and encourage the development of inland fisheries to their full potential; to ensure the conservation and protection of fish stocks and their environment; and to optimise the amenity, recreational and environment value of the resource.  Their objectives have been set with a view to maximising the return to the economy both in terms of output and in terms of employment.</P>
    <P>The importance of our inland fisheries is shown by the fact that the total area covered by freshwater lakes is approximately one-fifth of the total area covered by the State.  In addition there are some 8,600 miles of main channel rivers.  These surface waters comprise a much higher <Col N="1713" /> percentage of total area than in many European countries, including England, Scotland and Wales.</P>
    <P>We must develop and protect this valuable resource.  I am particularly conscious of the physical damage which pollution can do to inland fisheries and to its image at home and abroad.  Regular contact between my Department and other Government Departments, State agencies and fisheries boards is ongoing to prevent and control water pollution.  I am pleased that our community has been much more keenly aware of the importance of clean water, an area in which the fisheries boards are continuing to play an active role.</P>
    <P>The boatbuilding industry is another important area within my Department's remit.  I believe that close liaison with the industry is essential if we are to identify and understand its needs.  A committee has been set up comprising representatives of the Irish Federation of Marine Industries, BIM and the Department to examine all aspects of the industry.  I can assure Irish boatbuilders that their concerns will be carefully examined and that so far as it is possible, whatever can be done to improve the commercial viability of this great resource will be done.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention also to the related sectors of shipbuilding and ship repair.  The sale of Verolme Dockyard in Cork to Damen Shipyards of the Netherlands has now been completed. Following some essential refurbishment the yard will reopen for ship repair activities.  The owners eventually intend to move into shipbuilding, specialising in smaller vessels with the prospect of employing 400-450 people within five years.</P>
    <P>The Government's aim in designating Ringaskiddy as a free port is to encourage real industrial activity in the area through the use of fiscal and financial incentives. Manufacturing industry locating in Ringaskiddy already qualify for a wide range of incentives such as deferred liability from customs duties and VAT as well as simplified customs documentation and procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> Around 85 per cent of Irish exports are handled by our commercial ports.  The Government are committed to the development of these ports in order to offset the disadvantages of our location in the Internal Market after 1992.  In this regard the ports of Limerick and Foynes in the Shannon Estuary, among others, have been put forward for aid under the EC-assisted operational programme.</P>
    <P>The Limerick Harbour Commissioners project, now completed, involved the installation of radar surveillance equipment. This equipment will assist vessels using the Shannon Estuary, particularly those of over 100,000 deadweight tonnes.</P>
    <P>The Foynes Harbour Trustees have completed the first half of their project and have installed dolphins to facilitate the handling of bulk liquid cargoes.  The trustees will also be acquiring a crane which will be installed later this year.</P>
    <P>In November last, the first tranche of EC aid under the operational programme, totalling in excess of £2,713 million, was made to ten commercial ports, including £45,000 for Limerick and £93,000 for Foynes.  Total investment of about £69 million is envisaged under the programme.  Major developments have been undertaken by the Department in the area of maritime safety in recent years.</P>
    <P>Moneys have been provided in the 1991 Estimates for the implementation of the main recommendations of the Doherty Report on Air-Sea Rescue Services, which were approved by the Government, in particular the cost of a search and rescue helicopter service contract. This helicopter, to be based at Shannon Airport, will provide a countrywide medium range search and rescue service to complement the short range recovery and air ambulance service provided at present by the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended the establishment of a single marine emergency service under the control of my Department which would be responsible for the co-ordination of the response to all types of marine emergency, including search and rescue, shipwreck and sea and <Col N="1715" /> coastal pollution.  I expect the recruitment by open competition of a director for this service to take place shortly.</P>
    <P>A further commitment to safety at sea is the opening of coast and cliff rescue service stations at Achill and Killala in County Mayo, Killybegs in Donegal and Castletownbere in Cork.  The Achill and Killala units will be specialist cliff rescue units bringing to eight the number of these elite teams in the service.  The service now has four inflatable boats for coastal search and supporting cliff rescue. Extensive training has been provided to the crews using these boats and they without doubt are a major addition to the effectiveness of the service.</P>
    <P>Legislation has recently been passed in this House for the establishment of the Marine Institute and this legislation should be enacted shortly.  The aim of Government in establishing the Marine Institute is to bring together, under one authority, all the resources of the State which are currently allocated to marine research, and to co-ordinate the activities of marine research agencies.  The objective of the institute will be to undertake, promote, co-ordinate and assist marine research and to provide related services.  As many as possible of its activities will be carried out on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that there is a case for applying increased resources to marine research in Ireland.  We account for about 15 per cent of Community waters but national expenditure on marine research represents only 0.7 per cent of the total expenditure by all member states on such research.</P>
    <P>To begin to address this situation, and in the context of the imminent establishment of the Marine Institute, the Department of the Marine are embarking on a programme of expanded research and development in which priority is being given to developing new or underexploited resources and determining the most effective means of harvesting the sea's resources.  It is the Government's intention to ensure that funding from EC <Col N="1716" /> sources for Ireland's marine science programme is maximised to the greatest extent possible in the future.</P>
    <P>Managing the economy is not a book-keeping exercise for the Government. We see the correction of budgetary imbalances not as an end in itself but as a necessary prelude to the generation of lasting growth and employment.  Our success in these twin objectives over the past few years is there for all to see.  The progress made is perhaps nowhere more visible than in the mid-west, particularly in my city of Limerick.  This city which was neglected and in decline not five years ago has undergone a dramatic rebirth recently with almost £40 million having been committed to urban renewal developments.  Almost 2,500 jobs were created in the mid-west in 1990.  Tourism in the region has grown significantly in the past few years with a large increase in the number of visitors and investment of almost £50 million.  By 1993 it is expected that tourism revenue in the region will reach £75 million and result in the creation of an additional 3,660 jobs.  These are real tangible improvements. They demonstrate very clearly what can be done when the climate for investment is right.</P>
    <P>The budget will ensure that the progress made over the last few years will continue and that the benefits of economic growth will benefit all sectors of the economy.  This is an excellent budget. Notwithstanding anything said by Members on the opposite side of the House, it will ensure that further progress will be made in our economy during 1991. I have no doubt that the Government will reach the targets they have set out in the budget, as they have done since 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take note of your very specific instructions, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the last few comments made by the Minister, in particular his statement that the progress <Col N="1717" /> made by the Government over the past few years would continue.  While I would be the first to admit that certain progress has been made in the management of our economic affairs, unfortunately the central problem of unemployment and the related problems of emigration and poverty continue to haunt the Government and all politicians.  Unfortunately, there was nothing new in the budget which addressed these major problems. If the main function of the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement is to outline the new approach being taken to tackle old problems then I am afraid the budget was only a PR job designed specifically for the advent of the television cameras.</P>
    <P>It is almost a month since the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, announced his plans and proposals for 1991.  While the gloss, much of the publicity and even the press have gone, unfortunately the problems still remain. When the time comes to discuss the 1992 budget &mdash; hopefully we will all still be here &mdash; I believe we will still be talking about the 250,000 people who are unemployed, the tens of thousands of our people, particularly young people, who are leaving our shores in droves because they cannot find employment at home and the one third of our people who are living in poverty.</P>
    <P>This budget has failed to put forward one new idea or one shred of evidence to suggest that real employment creation will begin in the way needed if we are to address our major problems.  These problems have affected people in every town, village and townland throughout Ireland.  Politicians have to take note of these problems and address them.  No parish, townland or community has escaped the ravages of unemployment and emigration.  While it is great to hear that progress is being made in the management of the books of State, that the level of our national debt is being reduced and that the Government have kept to their financial targets over the past three years, unfortunately it has to be noted that there has been no improvement in <Col N="1718" /> our unemployment problem and the level of emigration has increased.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave a very interesting answer last week to a parliamentary question on the number of Irish people who have emigrated over the past seven or eight years.  If my memory serves me correctly, he stated that approximately 250,000 Irish people had emigrated over the past eight years or so.  That is a frightening figure.  Leaving politics aside, it is almost the population of Cork city.  All politicians have to take some of the blame for this problem.  Not only should we continue to speak about this problem but we should also try to devise solutions to it.  I would be the first to admit that there are no automatic solutions around the corner or automatic ways of creating the 250,000 jobs needed over the next few years.  We have to keep putting forward new proposals in this area and move away from the very constrained economic approach we have endured over the past three years.</P>
    <P>There was a certain degree of hope among people after the 1989 general election that the Progressive Democrats input into Government would bring radical taxation reforms which would prove to be a stimulus to job creation. However, the tax proposals which have been put forward by the Government since June 1989 have not unfortunately been radical or brave enough to bring about the economic miracle we need in our economy.  The slight changes in our tax system introduced over the past few years and the slight reduction in personal rates of taxation have not been sufficient to provide the economic stimulus which our economy urgently needs if growth in employment is to increase to the levels needed.  I am disappointed the Progressive Democrats, the party of radical tax proposals, as they would have called themselves a number of years ago, have failed miserably to ensure the introduction of any serious tax reforms.</P>
    <P>There are many problems apart from unemployment and emigration which continue to haunt us and have not been addressed in the budget.  We have been told that the main problem facing rural <Col N="1719" /> Ireland today, the crisis in agriculture, is something over which the Government have no direct control.  The GATT proposals, and the EC price proposals, will be decided by people not totally removed from the Cabinet table, but certain decisions will be made over which we have no control.  Notwithstanding that it is very important that the Government, and particularly the Minister for Agriculture and Food, lay down very strong markers as to what is and is not acceptable to rural Ireland, to the Government and to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>The present proposals for agriculture are so draconian that they affect not just the farming and rural communities but every citizen of the State.  If the proposals from the GATT negotiators, and the MacSharry proposals, are agreed the economy will be decimated overnight, unemployment figures will rise sharply and emigration will continue on the up and up.  It is very important that the Government are seen to be more active in opposing the price cuts which are being proposed.  I am gravely disappointed that we have seen so little opposition by the Minister and the Government to these cuts to date.</P>
    <P>I was here last Thursday for questions on agriculture when the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, outlined his views and offered certain assurances that he would be very strident in defending the Irish position in Brussels and at the GATT talks, but we need more than words from the Minister; we need action.  When the proposals go before the Council of Ministers and the Commission the Minister should make it abundantly clear to all concerned that as Ireland's national interest is threatened he will use the veto to ensure that these proposals are not accepted.</P>
    <P>What is proposed &mdash; this must be often repeated &mdash; is a reduction in tillage prices to the extent of 50 per cent, a reduction in the price of beef of up to 20 per cent, a reduction in milk prices of 10 per cent and a reduction in the Irish national milk quota of at least 5 per cent.  When one considers those drastic proposals and <Col N="1720" /> reflects on the negative impact they will have on rural Ireland and, as I mentioned earlier, on the Irish economy it is amazing that public representatives and Irish MEPs are telling us that these proposals are good for us.  They tell us that reducing the income of some farmers by 50 per cent and reducing the Irish national milk quota by 5 per cent is good for the economy. I do not know what sort of gurus are behind that type of approach.  It is about time we spelled out loudly and clearly that if those proposals are accepted rural Ireland and, indeed, the Irish economy will face decimation.</P>
    <P>It is ironic and disappointing that a former leader of a farmers' organisation, a man who spent many months leading opposition to far less drastic cuts, is now appearing on television and radio telling the farming community on an almost daily basis that the MacSharry proposals and the GATT proposals must be accepted, and not only that but that they are good for us.  I am glad that as late as tonight the IFA leader made clear the position of his organisation.  I am glad the farming organisations are at long last beginning to speak up on these issues.  I remember not so many years ago during the reign of another Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, these farming organisations marching the streets in opposition to cuts far less severe than those we now face.  I am glad these organisations are finally coming to their senses and are beginning to lead the campaign of opposition to the MacSharry and GATT proposals.  It is important that all rural communities join in that opposition.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the Minister's comments on social welfare. Changes have been made this year in the carer's allowance.  The Minister informed the House that there will be an extension to that scheme.  I took that remark with a grain of salt because I recalled 12 months ago the same Minister informing the House that approximatey 20,000 people or so would benefit from this scheme, but when I put down a question some weeks ago to the Minister, Deputy Woods, on the carer's allowance I was informed that of 3,600 applicants for the allowance in <Col N="1721" /> 1990, 1,200 applicants were successful. When one contrasts that with the figure of 20,000 applicants whom we were told would benefit in 1990 it makes one sceptical about the Minister's promise to extend the scheme in 1991.</P>
    <P>The idea of the carer's allowance scheme is very good but, unfortunately, unless the rules and regulations are changed radically the whole purpose of the allowance &mdash; permitting elderly people to remain in the care of their families in their homes &mdash; will be lost and people will not benefit from the scheme to the extent that they should.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to bring about the necessary changes in the scheme to make sure the people who deserve it benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one brief point in relation to housing.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, informed us a month or so ago that a marvellous housing package will be laid before us by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn.  The package announced was far from marvellous.  It is ironic that it is called a programme for social housing because it does absolutely nothing for the social welfare applicants on our housing lists.  I suggest that up to 80 per cent of housing applicants to local authorities today are social welfare recipients.  If one is dependent on social welfare for one's income one has no possibility of purchasing a house under a joint ownership scheme or of obtaining a £3,000 mortgage subsidy because one cannot obtain a mortgage.  What is needed is a housing policy which will ensure that public housing programmes will start again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by appealing to the Minister for the Environment to ensure that the public housing programme which, unfortunately, has ceased since he came to office in 1987, will begin again so that those people who genuinely need housing and cannot afford to buy their own homes are looked <Col N="1722" /> after.  That is not the position and it is something which has to be urgently addressed.  It certainly was not addressed in the so-called programme for social housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important issue.  There is at present substantial EC funding available for Border regions development, more than was anticipated in the early or mid-eighties.  There are a number of programmes: the rural development programme, the LEADER programme, INTERREG and the International Fund for Ireland.  It is important to gain the maximum benefit from those funds.  There is adequate funding and if properly utilised it could improve the economy out of all recognition and create many jobs.  I am not satisfied that up to now we have secured the maximum benefit from many of those programmes. I will deal with the two which are related mostly to the Border regions, INTERREG and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise this matter is that I understand the terms of the INTERREG initiative are being drawn up.  I quote from the Explanatory Memorandum from the EC introducing INTERREG which stated:</P>
      <P>The creation can be envisaged of some form of shared institutional and administrative structures to reinforce and develop cross-Border co-operation on a long term self sustaining basis. This may also involve the setting up of management structures for certain specific functions with appropriate technical support and financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In support of that Mr. Poulson, the director general for regional policies, stated at a conference in Enniskillen on 9 November that there is a requirement for a suitable administrative structure which <Col N="1723" /> will strengthen existing cross-Border links and be suitable for cross-Border co-operation.  Through inquiries which I have made it appears that the Department of Finance may not avail of this suggested administrative system but will continue as heretofore with funds disbursed through Government Departments and various development agencies.</P>
    <P>Anyone involved in cross-Border economic development, as I have been for a long number of years, welcomes this proposal because very few were satisfied with the administration of the previous funds.  The funding to date has not been evenly distributed.  No consideration was given to the most disadvantaged areas; the more populous regions, which were better off and which had the ability to secure matching funding, benefited. They should avail of this opportunity to set up an administrative structure instead of piecemeal application of funding for a very narrow scale of projects.  An umbrella body should be set up to co-ordinate the various funds.</P>
    <P>There should be three considerations in selecting projects for funding by either the IFA or INTERREG: (1) the projects should be those promoted locally; (2) the projects should be, as far as possible, through cross-Border projects; (3) the projects should have the prime aim of job creation.  When the International Fund for Ireland was being approved in this House &mdash; I spoke on it and welcomed it &mdash; we were told that its terms were to support the private sector and job creation projects.  I am sorry that that has not been the case, because projects put forward by many individuals and groups have been turned down.  In the 1990 report of the IFI a wide range of activities in the Six Counties is listed which received 75 per cent funding.  In the South the money has been on a very narrow scale and given to hotels and urban councils.  There was also a fairly substantial funding of £2 million for the six southern counties adjoining the Border for urban development programmes and public space improvements.  Most urban <Col N="1724" /> councils are very short of funding and are unable to secure matching funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial proportion of developmental funding in the Border areas, as elsewhere in the country, is being co-financed by the European Community through the Structural Funds.  This is being done under the various operational programmes under the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  The activities under these programmes are given effect by the relevant Government Departments, State agencies and other public bodies, such as the local authorities, the IDA, Bord Fáilte, FÁS, Teagasc, etc. Each programme is monitored and co-ordinated by a monitoring committee made up of representatives of the responsible Departments and other implementing agencies, the EC Commission and the social partners.  The monitoring committee for the Community Support Framework oversee the work of the programme committees.  Furthermore, there is ongoing consultation and co-ordination, as necessary, at local and subregional level between the implementing bodies.</P>
      <P>The county development teams also play a valuable role in promoting economic development by ensuring maximum use of existing public services and by fostering worthwhile new ideas for development. The teams are comprised of local elected representatives and representatives of State agencies.</P>
      <P>The arrangements put in place for the Structural Funds also provide for a large element of local consultation.  Seven subregional review committees have been established throughout the country to monitor the implementation of the operational programmes in their sub-regions. The committees review periodic reports on the implementation for each programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-West Review Committee &mdash; extended to include Louth &mdash; has also been consulted at a series of meetings about the preparation of the joint Ireland and Northern Ireland programme under <Col N="1725" /> the Structural Funds Community initiative INTERREG for Border regions.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the arrangements in place are those best suited to co-ordinate and deliver the whole range of development activities in the most effective and efficient way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of combating drunk driving is as old as driving itself.  The advent of speedier vehicles and faster roads has made the problem more acute.  The yearly carnage on our roads related to drink and drunk driving is unacceptable and must be tackled.  One of the most effective methods of combating drunk driving is criminal prosecution. Unfortunately, this device has not been used to best effect.  The recent intensification of Garda action against drunk driving is a welcome indication that there is a change in public attitude to this crime and, especially, that there is a change of attitude among those who often demand strong law and order but are prepared to turn a blind eye to someone driving home from the local pub or club well over the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately the same change of attitude has not yet become evident in the Oireachtas, as illustrated by the recent and shameful case where an important protection in our Constitution was invoked as a device to avoid prosecution. Also, we as legislators have failed to act to make prosecutions more simple and relevant.  The absence of a modern criminal evidence Act led to the disgraceful decision in the recent case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Haughey where a prosecution failed because a doctor was too ill to attend and to attest to his signature on an unchallenged document and to confirm his status as a registered medical practitioner.  This weakness in the law was evident long before the particular case exposed it.  The soft attitude of this House reaches further.  It has the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in its grip.  The decisions of our courts again often lack any understanding or comprehension of the extent of the damage <Col N="1726" /> and injury caused by these drunk drivers. Two recent cases illustrate this point.  On 16 July 1989 Tony Kelly was crossing the main road at Annesley Bridge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his case, nonetheless, the circumstances amounted to a citizen of this city being killed by a speeding driver who left the scene of the accident, was pursued on foot, apprehended by an off duty garda, brought back to the scene, found to be driving with excess alcohol and then brought before the court and prosecuted.  In the District Court the driver received a three month sentence, reduced to a fine of £200 by the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.  I wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions in April of last year inquiring why a charge of dangerous driving causing death had not been preferred in the case.  The Director of Public Prosecutions replied at the conclusion of the criminal prosecution in February of this year indicating that he was,&ldquo;precluded from giving reasons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The second case I wish to refer to was well documented by the columnist Kevin Myers in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 February last.  In that case, again a fatal one, a man appeared before Wicklow Circuit Court charged with careless driving and drunk driving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By way of comparison, that fine today was increased from £500 to £600.  These issues have been raised with the Government by Mothers Against Drunken Driving and their manifesto was presented to the Minister for Justice in September 1989.  Since then no amending legislation has been introduced or other action taken by the Government. Their demands should be responded to.  They suggest a charge of dangerous driving causing death should be preferred and be allowed to be decided upon by a court of trial whenever death occurs through danger or drunk driving or both.  If the law needs to be amended or improved in this area the Minister should act upon it.  The present position is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group suggest that a reduction of blood alcohol limit, as recommended by the EC, to a level of 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres should be introduced.  This requires amending legislation.  The third suggestion concerns the right of the family or representative of the deceased person to be consulted or advised of the prosecution of these offences and to be <Col N="1728" /> heard on their behalf in a court of trial imposing sentence.  Again, I believe amending legislation from the Minister is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the specific demands of the Mothers Against Drunken Driving group, I want to make a few general comments.</P>
      <P>The prosecution of offenders, and the conduct and outcome of court cases, as Deputy McCartan well knows, is not a matter for the Minister for Justice.  The prosecution authorities &mdash; the Garda authorities and/or the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; are responsible for deciding the charges which are preferred in drunk driving cases.  I have no function in relation to the matter and it would be wholly improper for me, or the Minister for Justice, to comment or to interfere in any way with this process.  As regard the sentences imposed by the courts in specific cases, it is not normal practice for the Minister for Justice to comment on these.  I do not propose to depart from this long-standing practice.  I can, however, reassure this House that the Garda authorities intend to maintain with unremitting vigour their campaign to stamp out drunk driving and to bring offenders before the courts in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the prosecution of drink driving cases where a death has resulted special revised procedures have recently been put in place by the Garda authorities and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Those procedures were established following consultations between officials of my Department, the Director of Public <Col N="1729" /> Prosecutions, the Garda authorities at a very senior level and the receipt of legal advice by my Department.  For obvious reasons I cannot go into all the details of these new procedures, but I can confirm a number of them, for instance, all decisions on traffic accident cases involving a fatality are now taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Garda instructions on responding to indications of excessive alcohol consumption by drivers have also been revised.  For instance a special procedure has been decided on to deal with attempted dodges, such as feigning an injury by motorists who seek to avoid being brought to the station to give a blood or urine sample.  Where necessary, the gardaí now accompany the motorists involved in an accident to the hospital where there is a doubt as to the seriousness of their alleged injuries.  In this way, if the hospital discharges the motorist within a reasonable period, he or she may then he arrested and brought to the station to give a sample.  Even where it is not possible to make an arrest or obtain a blood or urine sample from a motorist involved in a fatal accident case the gardaí go to great lengths to establish the facts.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me to be specific in this regard, but I can assure Deputy McCartan and the House that in a number of recent cases the gardaí through exhaustive research and detective work, established to the satisfaction of the court the inebriated condition of the driver in a fatal accident case and secured appropriate convictions in this respect.  I can assure this House that the Garda devote considerable attention to investigating fatal accident cases where drink is involved.  The utmost diligence is applied by them in the presentation in court of the facts in such cases.</P>
    <P>Turning to the demands made by the Mothers Against Drunken Driving, I propose to deal with these <i>seriatim</i>.  The first demand is that a charge of dangerous driving causing death to be preferred where the facts warrant a dangerous driving simpliciter charge and the driving caused a death.  It is the Director of Public <Col N="1730" /> Prosecutions who decides what charges are preferred in any such case and we in this House cannot gainsay his independence.</P>
    <P>The second demand is that a mandatory custodial sentence be imposed where a conviction is secured.  This is a legislative matter for the Minister for the Environment to consider, but the Deputy will be aware that the Judiciary are deeply opposed to legislation which ties their hands in determining sentences. The third demand is that there should be compulsory blood tests on suspected drunk drivers who end up in hospital.  I can confirm that this proposal is under consideration by the Minister for the Environment.  The other more administrative-type recommendations by MADD are also being studied by the Minister for the Environment.  Proposals to have the legal representative of a deceased victim involved in the prosecution would represent a major departure in our criminal law and practice and I have to be candid with the Deputy in saying that such a change is not being contemplated.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCartan that a number of technical loopholes on the evidential side require to be addressed and this will be done at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Drunk driving is a serious crime. Unfortunately, we as a nation have not in the past been strong enough in our condemnation of this crime, or in our efforts to stamp it out.  I am entirely supportive of the efforts of organisations such as the Mothers Against Drunken Driving which, together with the various agencies involved, have put the public spotlight on drink driving and given a clear message that drink driving is no longer socially acceptable.  To conclude, may I give the Deputy, and the House, one statistic?  Since last December, prosecutions have commenced against 1,000 drivers for drink driving offences.  This is proof of the determination of the Garda authorities to tackle this evil head on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Member of this House got a letter from a woman correspondent in County Limerick in November 1990 seeking clarification about grants made by local authorities for amenity and recreational purposes. She claimed that support for male groups for 1990 was in the region of £330,000 and for women's groups, £6,000.  She is a member of the Irish Girl Guides and was involved in preparing a lottery application for the provision of a regional training headquarters in the mid-west for guides.  It was twice turned down.  She then looked at the allocation to mens' and boys' groups over the same period and found that scouting organisations were granted over £330,000 for various dens for individual units.  She asked me and every TD who make the decisions as to which applications receive funding, on what grounds the decisions are made and why womens' and girls' organisations are given so little.  I am now asking these questions of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first I was disbelieving, but I sourced the funding to girl guides and scouts at national level.  The figures I got for funding at national level showed no direct imbalance.  Proportionately speaking, the annual grant for girl guides in 1990 was £28,000 and for scouts it was <Col N="1732" /> £443,000.  In the context of their numbers, with 32,000 guides and 56,000 scouts this appeared to be all right at national level.  I referred back to the local grants for 1990.</P>
    <P>When I examined the figures in the amenities and recreational facilities grant scheme report, from lottery surplus funds I was horrified at the naked advantage given to male organisations.  In effect, these funds are used almost solely for the betterment and enjoyment of sporting young males most of whom are well catered for anyway.  Huge sums went to GAA clubs for dressing rooms, extensions of halls, development of pitches and for scout dens.  In the middle of all these large grants I found a princely allocation to the Cooraclare Ladies Football Club of £500.  I am sure the Cooraclare ladies felt under a great compliment to get this princely amount.  Not one other club got such a small amount, except a handicapped riding centre which got £300. Women and handicapped are treated as second class under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Government treatment of women in sport is a disgrace.  It is having a harmful effect.  In the study &ldquo;Girls and Boys Come Out to Play&rdquo;, recently published by Thomond College on gender attitude to sport, the author said that the self image scores of boys and girls reflect the trends found in other studies, that girls were found to have less positive and more passive views of themselves than boys, and that this is almost certainly linked to broader societal stereotyping.  The study showed that boys perceived themselves to be more involved, talented, intelligent, good looking and co-ordinated, free from stress and more achievement orientated than girls.</P>
    <P>Lottery funding should be aimed at correcting these kinds of images rather than reinforcing them.  I call for a special independent ombudsman to arbitrate on local authority applications and allocations. There is a need to stimulate and encourage applications from girls' organisations. It is not enough to refuse girls' and women's organisations when they make applications, and then say they do not apply.  They should be encouraged to <Col N="1733" /> apply.  They should not be turned down except for the best reasons.  I suggest that women should consider boycotting lottery funding until they see equitable and fair treatment for both sexes from the proceeds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another example of the unjust system of distribution of national lottery funds.  It is obvious that the girl guides in the mid-west region did not receive grant aid because of the lack of political pressure and support.  The distribution of national lottery funds under the amenities grants scheme is dictated by pressure from TDs and Ministers. Why was the application for grant aid to provide a regional training headquarters for 3,000 girl guides twice refused?  In the same period why were scouting organisations granted over £330,000?  Why did girl guide groups throughout the country only receive a total of £5,500?  This was allocated in Cavan and perhaps someone had influence there to get that.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that when this application comes up again it will be considered sympathetically on its merits.</P>

      <P>The amenities and recreational grants scheme is funded from the national lottery.  It has provided financing in 1988 and in 1990 for a wide variety of schemes designed to give opportunities of enjoyment to all sections of the community.  I am glad to tell the <Col N="1734" /> House that the scheme will operate again in 1991.</P>
      <P>In some respects, the amenities and recreational grants scheme has been a victim of its success.  What I mean is that the scheme has been in constant overdemand.  It has only been possible to grant assist a portion of the many worthy voluntary projects which are in planning around the country.</P>
      <P>In allocating grants from among the many applications recommended to the Department by local authorities, we have operated on the basis of clearly stated criteria.  Allocations take account of the desirability of the proposed work, the cost effectiveness of a project and the employment which may be expected to result, as well as the need to distribute available funds on an equitable basis to all areas of the country.</P>
      <P>Grant applications are not generally identified by reference to their degree of use by men or women.  Typically, the grants are made on the foot of applications by particular bodies.  If bodies of a particular grouping make a large number of applications they are, in the nature of things, likely to receive more grants than those of another grouping which make comparatively few applications.  Similarly, large projects, if grant assisted, are likely to receive a larger allocation than smaller and less expensive projects. Consequently, references to total allocations do not compare like with like and are not helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fennell's complaint is related to projects initiated by boy scouts and girl guides.  In modern times, and apart altogether from the consideration regarding the numbers of applications made, any attempt to equate scouting organisations solely with boys only is misleading. The two main scouting organisations accept female members and I understand that, in fact, their membership includes large numbers of girls. Further, scout dens are also widely used by girl guides; in such cases, new or improved facilities benefit both groups.  I wish to emphasise that allocations are made in as fair and equitable a manner <Col N="1735" /> as possible, starting from the assumption that all projects are, <i>prima facie</i>, eligible and worthy ones since they have been examined and recommended by the local authorities.  All grant allocations are conditional on certification by the local authority concerned that the project when completed will be of public utility and will be available for public or community use as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming public perception of the amenities/recreational facilities grant scheme is of something very well worthwhile.  I am certain that the 1991 scheme will again benefit many excellent projects.  I ask Deputies to encourage <Col N="1736" /> these organisations to apply and due consideration will be given to all these applications on the basis of the criteria which I have explained.  It would be my aim and also the Minister's to give all sections of our community fair play.  I appreciate the matter being raised here this evening.  However, the total amount in 1990 was £6.5 million and Deputies can understand the enormous number of applications we received in our Department. The House can be assured of our intention to look after everybody in our society as best we can.</P>

      <P>During 1990, motor insurers notified my Department of increases in their premiums which resulted in an overall increase in rates of 30 per cent on average.  Since January 1991 the average increase notified to the Department is 9 per cent.  However, I consider it only right to point out once again that the fundamental cause of high motor insurance prices for all motorists in Ireland is the high claims rate which, regrettably, is on the increase, allied to the high cost of individual claims which is also rising.  One cannot reasonably expect the price of motor insurance to reduce, or even stabilise when the claims rate and cost of claims is increasing.</P>
      <P>In 1988, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £48 million on their motor portfolios, the corresponding figure for 1989 was more than double that at £116 million and is expected to be even higher for 1990.  Confronted with losses of this magnitude and in order to maintain their viability insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premiums in line with their claims experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of improving the environment for insurance the Government recently set up an inter ministerial group to examine ways and means of improving the environment for motor insurance in particular.  This group are focusing on <Col N="1471" /> strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation, amendments to the Road Traffic Acts designed to reduce the motor accident rate, suggestions it improve the cost and availability of motor insurance and improvements/ alternatives to the courts system for the resolution of personal injury cliams.  I am hopeful that this will result in a number of positive proposals which can be implemented in the very near future.  I would add, however, that Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs.  Consumers must play their part by increased awareness of the need for safety.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Deputy of what I have said in this House on numberous occasions, in that, as the insurance supervisory authority I have a responsibility to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  I do not, however, have responsibility for the day to day operations of insurance companies. Therefore, I must respect the right of insurance companies to make their own underwriting decisions in the light of their particular circumstances and assessment of the market.</P>

    <P>These debts, normally referred to as &ldquo;political risk&rdquo; debts, are not necessarily owed, in all cases, by State buyers who simply defaulted on commercial transactions. They also include cases where, despite the best endeavours of foreign buyers to pay, Government authorities abroad have not remitted the foreign exchange due in satisfaction of the contracts involved, most usually because of severe foreign exchange shortages.</P>
    <P>Various methods are available for recovering sovereign debts including debt rescheduling through the auspices of the Paris Club; international debt recovery agencies; use of intermediaries in the debtor country and finally, direct Government to Government contact with the debtor country, including the use of diplomatic channels via our embassies overseas.  In all the cases I have mentioned, various such methods have been used by successive Irish Governments with varying degrees of success and I can assure the House that our efforts in this respect are continuing unabated.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, in circumstances where debts still remain to be paid, it is our policy not to offer export credit insurance for new business with any of the countries involved.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Question Nos. 221, by Deputy R. Bruton on 30 January 1991, and No.77, by Deputy T. Gregory on 13 February 1991.  I would wish to reiterate that I do not have official information <Col N="1476" /> available to me on prices for products not subject to statutory price control. However, in the course of a price monitoring exercise exceptionally undertaken by my Department in the context of the Gulf crisis, the information made available by the Irish suppliers indicates that the recommended retail prices of a standard cylinder of LPG increased from £9.46 to £10.23 in September 1990 and to £10.90 in October 1990.  I have also been advised that one of these companies have recently been advertising a special price promotion for a limited period amounting to a price reduction of about 9 per cent.  I am not in a position to state the prices actually being charged in individual retail outlets throughout the State.</P>
      <P>The information given to me by the suppliers does not support the contention by Deputy Noonan that the price of bottled gas moves in parallel with petrol and diesel prices.  I am advised by the industry that, because the LPG product market is subject to far greater seasonal variation of price than petrol or diesel, it has been the long-standing practice that recommended retail prices are set by the respective LPG-supplying companies, in the expectation that they will over-recover their product costs in the summer and under-recover those costs in the winter. In this way, a relatively stable price level is maintained throughout the year and this is seen to be desirable by the distributors and users alike.</P>

      <P>I do not believe it is possible to identify or isolate the effects of the Gulf War on employment in Ireland.  Any adverse effects on employment in the short term are more likely to arise primarily from wider economic factors such as recession in the UK and the US and slowdown in growth in other markets; some of these factors are, of course, influenced by the war, through uncertainty and through exchange rates, interest rates and oil prices.</P>
      <P>The combination of these circumstances, and some practical effects of the conflict such as restrictions on travel by many overseas company executives, may cause a delay&mdash; hopefully short term &mdash; in the implementation of some job creating investments.  Because of the present uncertainty, it is not possible to make a firm assessment of the effect on the job creation targets in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> However, when the uncertainty caused by the war is removed, I would not foresee any long term consequences for employment in Ireland.</P>

      <P>All of the 282 proposals contained in the Commission's White Paper, Programme for the Completion of the Internal Market have been tabled. Of these, 186 have been finally adopted, five partially adopted and common positions agreed on four.</P>
      <P>Internal market measures are classified as physical, technical or fiscal.</P>
      <P>Greatest progress has been achieved in dealing with the removal of technical barriers.  Of the 160 proposals in this area, only 41 remain to be adopted.  Most notably, virtually all of the measures dealing with capital movements, the free movement of labour and the professions and the new approach in technical harmonisation and standards policy have been adopted.  Progress has also been good in public procurement and certain services areas.</P>
      <P>Progress has been less satisfactory with regard to physical and fiscal barriers.  In the former, 30 out of a total of 82 proposals in the veterinary and phytosanitary areas await final adoption while under the control of individuals heading, four out of eight proposals have yet to be adopted.  In the latter, 18 measures out of a total of 22 dealing with VAT and excise duties remain to be adopted.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Rome last December stressed that every effort must be made to complete the programme before the deadline.  It placed particular emphasis on completing the proceedings in the area of indirect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's programme for 1991 also mentions indirect taxation as a key area in which progress must be secured &mdash; along with transport, financial <Col N="1480" /> services and the veterinary fields.  It stresses the importance of completing the programme during 1991 so as to allow one year for member states to implement the adopted measures.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a clear-cut commitment all round that the Internal Market programme must be as much in place as possible by the end of 1992.  The Government, for their part, will continue to do their utmost to ensure that their contribution to this process will remain wholehearted and energetic.</P>

      <P>Consideration of this matter concerns my Department in so far as land reclamation requires a lease under the Foreshore Act, 1933.  To date there is no application under consideration for such a lease at Dún Laoghaire.  The matter of rezoning refers, I understand, to the proposal by Dún Laoghaire Corporation included in the draft borough development plan and as such is a matter for that authority.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views of the Salthill and Seapoint Association following receipt of a submission from the association on the matter.  A meeting at this stage would be somewhat premature and serve no useful purpose until an application for a lease is lodged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> Ireland has never recognised the incorporation, which occurred in 1940, of the Baltic countries into the Soviet Union, and has, on a number of occasions, called for dialogue between the Soviet authorities and the elected representatives of the Baltic peoples, with a view to satisfying the legitimate aspirations of these peoples.  On 4 February, the Foreign Ministers of the European Community welcomed the decision to hold referenda in each of the Baltic countries and expressed the hope that this would favour the resumption of a meaningful and constructive dialogue between the central authorities of the USSR and the Baltic countries.  The Ministers considered that this decision was in conformity with the spirit of the Paris Charter for a new Europe.</P>
    <P>The formal position concerning Georgia is different: this republic has been part of the Soviet Union since the establishment of the Union in 1922.  The Soviet Constitution makes provision for Union Republics to leave the Soviet Union and legislation adopted in April last year sets out the modalities by which this can be brought about.  The question of whether Georgia should remain part of the Soviet Union is a matter to be decided by the Soviet and Republican authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Soviet Constitution and legislation.  Full details are not as yet available concerning the holding of the referendum in Georgia.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986, individuals residing abroad may, if so entitled, become Irish citizens by having their births registered under the foreign births registration provisions of the Acts or by lodging, in the prescribed manner, a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as their post-nuptial citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the foreign births registration provisions, individuals may claim an entitlement to have their births registered if they produce documentary evidence that one of their grandparents was born in Ireland.  Individuals living abroad may lodge applications with the appropriate Irish diplomatic mission or consular office.  Individuals who are living in countries with which Ireland does not have diplomatic or consular relations <Col N="1487" /> may apply directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Similarly, individuals living abroad who wish to lodge a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship may do so with the appropriate Irish diplomatic mission or consular office.  As in the case of applicants for foreign births registration, individual declarants living in countries with which Ireland does not have diplomatic nor consular relations may apply directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Such declarations must be lodged in the prescribed manner not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage or from the date when the Irish spouse became an Irish citizen, whichever is the later.  The declaration must be accompanied by evidence that the marriage was subsisting at the date of the lodgment of the declaration and by an affidavit from the Irish spouse that the couple are living together as husband and wife.</P>
    <P>Applications for registration lodged since January 1987 have been and are being dealt with on receipt except in case of the Consulate General at New York where, because of the level of applications, applications are currently taking several months to process.  In addition certain applications lodged before January 1987 were received too late to process under the terms of the 1986 Act.  The Department of Justice are considering a number of changes to the relevant legislation in this context.</P>
    <P>Current applications for post-nupital citizenship are subject to some delay at present caused by the volume of applications and the introduction of more stringent regulations regarding the documentary evidence required with each application.  Extra resources have recently been allocated to this area of work.</P>

      <P>Yugoslavia applied for membership of the Council of Europe on 5 February 1990.  In accordance with the provisions of the Statute of the Council of Europe, the Committee of Ministers has sought the opinion of the Parliamentary Assembly on Yugoslavia's application.</P>
      <P>While not wishing to anticipate the opinion of the Parliamentary Assembly on Yugoslavia's application, our general position, and that of our fellow member states, as regards membership of the Council is that all applicant countries must fulfill the statutory requirements of pluralist democracy and respect for the rule of law and for human rights before they can be admitted to membership. Membership of the Council of Europe is a legitimate aspiration for countries which meet these requirements and we would support membership applications by them.  Recent developments in Yugoslavia have given cause for concern in relation to the establishment of pluralist democracy, notably at the federal level, and full respect for human rights in that country.  We believe that continuing co-operation between Yugoslavia and the Council of Europe can help Yugoslavia meet the criteria for membership.</P>

A certificate of tax-free allowances on a non-cumulative basis will be issued to the taxpayer on 8 March 1991, but, in the interim, the inspector of taxes has informed his employers of his allowances.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a Dáil question on 24 October 1989 the Government accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations made by the committee in relation to the method of allocating national lottery funds to particular sectors.  I would refer the Deputy to my answer to that question for the details of the present administrative arrangements in relation to the allocation of lottery funds.</P>
      <P>The main areas where these arrangements diverge from the committee's recommendations relate to the Department of the Environment's amenity grants scheme and the Department of Education's recreational facilities grants scheme.  Whereas the committee had recommended the allocation of block grants to local authorities and VECs respectively, the Government decided instead to merge the two grant schemes with the Minister for the Environment allocating funds on foot of recommendations by local authorities who are responsible for processing applications. The Government also decided that the allocation of lottery moneys to voluntary bodies in the welfare area was proper to the Minister for Social Welfare rather than the health boards.</P>
      <P>The Government did not accept a general recommendation that lottery funds should not be used to substitute for Exchequer funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 to 71 together.</P>
      <P>It is hoped to launch the scheme of grant aid for investment in agri-tourism very shortly.  Consultations have already taken place with the agencies responsible for operating this scheme with a view to making the necessary arrangements for implementation.  The estimated expenditure under the scheme up to the end of 1993 is £5.3 million of which £3.2 million will be provided from the EC Structural Funds.  Details relating to the types of investment which will qualify for grant aid will be set out in the scheme.  The grants will be paid when approved projects have been satisfactorily completed.</P>
      <P>As the principal objective of the scheme is mainly to promote tourist facilities on farms the title is considered appropriate.</P>

Such a structure, will operate in all rural areas, including Arigna.</P>
      <P>The operational programme for rural development which I announced in December includes a range of measures to assist the diversification of the rural economy.  These are schemes of grant aid for animal production, horse breeding, deer, goats, rabbits and greyhounds, horticulture, including organic production, agri-tourism, forestry and job creation involving services in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The programme also provides for a scheme of aid for small and community enterprises to assist worthwhile projects which would not otherwise qualify for grant aid.</P>
      <P>These measures will be of considerable benefit to all rural areas and will respond in a meaningful way to the needs of the Arigna area as identified by the task force.</P>

      <P>The person concerned made a claim for unemployment benefit on 13 December, 1990.  His claim was authorised for payment from that date at the weekly rate of £59.40 which is the maximum rate payable to a person whose spouse is not dependent on him and who has two qualified child dependants.</P>
      <P>His wife is employed as a traffic warden with Dublin Corporation for approximately 40 weeks in the year and receives an average weekly wage of £61.05.  In accordance with regulations made under the equal treatment provisions, a spouse whose average gross weekly earnings exceed £55 is not regarded as the adult dependent for social welfare purposes.  It has been decided the person concerned is not entitled to an increase in respect of his wife in any week in which she is employed.  He may, however, claim an increase for her during school vacations when she is not working in which event the increases for his child dependants would be paid at the full rate.</P>

      <Quest>whether in relation to the proposed modifications regarding the family income supplement announced in the budget, he will be extending eligibility for the income supplement to those persons on social employment schemes who are on relative low pay, particularly people with large families such as a person (details supplied) in County Offaly.</Quest>

      <P>The Social Employment Scheme (SES) is aimed at providing part-time employment to assist unemployed people, particularly the long term unemployed, to re-enter the labour market. The purpose of the Family Income Supplement Scheme (FIS), on the other hand, is to create an incentive for full-time workers with families, who are in low paid employment, to remain at work. Its purpose is essentially different from the SES and to extend entitlement to FIS to persons on the SES would involve fundamental changes in the FIS scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowances under the SES scheme are <Col N="1511" /> payable at a standard weekly rate of £69 for a single person and £98.50 for a person with an adult dependant.  Child dependant allowances of £11 per child are payable in addition since 1989.  SES participants receive a payment which is in excess of their entitlements under the unemployment assistance scheme.  For example, a SES participant with an adult dependant and three child dependants receives an allowance of £131.50 per week, as against an entitlement under long term unemployment assistance of £116 per week.</P>
    <P>SES participants are also free to supplement their payments through earnings from work outside of their working hours on the scheme.  There is no ceiling on the additional earnings allowed and SES payments are not affected.</P>

An applicant who is already in employment may be granted a PSV licence provided the Garda Commissioner is satisfied that the applicant is not engaged in any occupation which, in the opinion of the commissioner, is likely to impair his efficiency or to conflict with his responsibilities or to be incompatible with his employment as a driver of a small public service vehicle.  In addition, an applicant must, in accordance with the regulations, give an undertaking that he will be available for at least 40 hours per week to drive a small public service vehicle.</P>
      <P>In the event of a refusal by the Garda Commissioner to grant a PSV licence, the applicant is told why his application is being refused and is informed that he has a right of appeal to the District Court.</P>

      <P>The overall scheme will be 10.25 km long, of which 7 km has been designated a motorway.  This designation restricts direct access from adjoining land and limits the classes of vehicles which may use the road.  The balance of the scheme, some 3.25 km, will be all-purpose road linking the motorway section to the existing N1 route at both ends of the scheme. Of the 7 km which is designated as motorriageway standard.  The balance will initially be built to single carriageway standard with provision to construct a second carriageway when warranted by traffic volumes.  The decision to implement the scheme on this phased basis was the subject of discussions and agreement between the engineering staffs of my Department and Louth County Council.</P>

    <P>In the case of county councils, a similar system of block grants applied during the period 1981 to 1988 with the grants supplementing local authority resources for the maintenance and improvement of regional roads and for the improvement of county roads.  As with the block grants to urban authorities, the proportion of the grants to be applied to maintenance, and the selection of works to be undertaken, were matters for the local authorities subject to guidelines issued by the Department.  The block grants to Louth County Council during that period were as follows: 1981, £139,000; 1982, £139,000; 1983, £151,000; 1984, £151,000; 1985, £170,000; 1986, £187,000; 1987, £187,000; 1988, £187,000.</P>
    <P>Since 1989, a revised system of discretionary road grants to county councils, for works on non-national roads, has been in operation, with separate block grants for the maintenace of these roads and for their improvement.  The discretionary grants to Louth County Council in 1989 and 1990 were £548,000 and £1.083 million respectively of which £98,000 and £102,000 respectively were in the form of block grants for maintenance works.</P>

      <P>The Arigna Task Force report has been considered in my Department and the position on the recommendations pertaining to my area of responsibility is as follows:</P>
      <P>The priorities for a works programme on regional and county roads in the Arigna area have been agreed in discussions at engineering level between my Department and the county councils concerned. The cost of such works, estimated at £800,000, normally falls to be financed from local resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department.  However, I have taken account of the needs of the Arigna area in determining the 1991 road grant allocations which will be notified to local authorities this week.  In a broader context, the national primary road improvements throughout the country outlined in the operational programme on peripherality will improve access to the Arigna area.</P>
      <P>Proposals are being prepared by Roscommon County Council in relation to the Arigna water supply scheme.  This scheme will replace the existing inadequate schemes serving the Arigna, Ballyfarnan, Keadew and Rover areas and thus provide a guaranteed supply of water to meet the existing and future development needs of this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158, 166 and 167 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of research on youth and alcohol the Advisory Council on Health Promotion have commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to conduct a major research project which will, <i>inter alia,</i> deal with the issue of alcohol and youth, as part of its formulation of a comprehensive national policy on alcohol.  The particular direction of the research concerns the prevalence and prevention of alcohol abuse among young people.  While the various studies which have taken place in Ireland in recent years have used different methods, classification samples and ages, they do show that there is a need for systematic and on-going educational programmes for young people and that <Col N="1529" /> parents and the adult population in general have an important role to play in influencing young people in the area of alcohol and its proper use.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I consider it a priority that young people should be in a position to make informed decisions about alcohol.  It is also important that if they decide to drink they will have the required skills to do so in a moderate and responsible fashion conducive to their good health and well-being and that of others.</P>
    <P>On the question of resources my Department's allocation to the health boards encompasses resources for health promotion-health education.  A focus on youth and alcohol would be an integral part of individual health boards' health promotion-education programmes, but given the multi-disciplinary approach of these programmes it would not be practicable to calculate the specific resources allocated to the issue of youth and alcohol.</P>
    <P>Parallel to these individual health board initiatives are national programmes. The Drink Awareness for Youth (DAY) programme aims to inform and educate young people about alcohol and the dangers associated with its abuse.  It is a prevention programme, targeted at the 14-19 year age group, that seeks to equip young people with the personal and social skills necessary to make responsible decisions regarding their use of alcohol.  This is a joint initiative between the Department's health promotion unit and the National Youth Council.  The DAY programme is primarily for use in youth settings and for those who work with young people.  It has been completed following its very successful piloting in various youth settings throughout the country.  The programme can also be used in schools.  A nation-wide training programme for youth leaders and other persons involved with youth is now underway.  One hundred and fifteen such persons have been trained to date.  A number of national and regional organisations are considering including the DAY programme as part of their training activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> I also recently launched an alcohol education video entitled &ldquo;Handle with Care&rdquo; which was produced by the health promotion unit, in conjunction with the Catholic Communications Institute and Veritas Video Productions.  The video is aimed at 10-15 year olds and includes a comprehensive teacher's guide for use in schools.  This will be a very useful way of getting the message across to young people before they actually drink alcohol. Both the DAY pack and the video have been made available to all health boards.</P>
    <P>A more broadly based community programme entitled &ldquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers?&rdquo;  has also been developed by the health promotion unit to promote a community response to drug problems.  It brings together health and educational professionals and interested voluntary workers, in their communities, and places particular emphasis on problems posed by alcohol abuse.  To date approximately 450 persons have participated in the course throughout the country and the response to its content has been very positive.</P>
    <P>Other materials on alcohol education are also available from the health promotion unit of my Department and from health boards.  A series of booklets focus on the problem of underage drinking &mdash; one for young people, one for parents, and one for youth leaders.  Additional materials cover specific issues such as guidelines towards the assessment of an individual's drinking habits, and women and alcohol.  The costs of these initiatives in 1990 amounted to approximately £100,000.</P>
    <P>The particular focus of my Department's strategy on underage drinking is in the educational setting, both formal and informal.  However, a much broader focus is required to tackle the problem of alcohol use and abuse among young people and within the community generally. Measures necessary to address the problem are multi-factorial and are encompassed within the remit of a number of Government Departments and statutory and voluntary agencies.  In pursuance of a broadly based policy on <Col N="1531" /> alcohol, its use and abuse, the Government decided that the Advisory Council on Health Promotion should develop such a policy which will address broader economic, social, educational, cultural and health factors which impinge on alcohol use, including the problem of under-age drinking.  As part of this remit, the council recently commenced a major consultative exercise requesting submissions from national and regional organisations including youth organisations and from the general public on these issues.</P>
    <P>In relation to the expenditure on advertising by the drinks industry and the percentage of expenditure which is spent on combating underage drinking, this information would not be available to my Department.  I am fully aware of the great responsibility the drinks industry have in promoting the sensible and moderate use of alcohol.  The industry are generally aware of this responsibility as evidenced by various educational initiatives which they have sponsored, but it is an area which will be examined by the Advisory Council in the context of the formulation of the national policy on alcohol.  I am of the view that a combined and cohesive strategy involving the industry and statutory and non-statutory agencies would represent an innovative and important approach to combating problems of alcohol abuse by young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on waiting lists in the form requested by the Deputy is not routinely kept in my Department.  I have explained on many previous occasions that waiting lists have always been a feature of all health care systems throughout the world and this will continue given the infinite <Col N="1534" /> demands which will be made on finite resources.  The success of new techniques and forms of treatment which have improved the quality of life for many patients has, however, led to increasing demands being placed on the health services with a consquent effect on waiting lists and waiting times.  I have placed great emphasis on tackling waiting lists over the past few years.  Waiting lists in Irish hospitals in most specialties are not excessive.</P>
      <P>Certain areas were, however, identified as requiring special attention.  The Deputy will be aware of my concern about the problems which had arisen in the provision of cardiac surgery, ear, nose and throat procedures, cataract and hip replacement operations and will also be aware that additional funds were made available in 1989 and 1990 to reduce waiting times in these areas.  The effects of the additional funding were clearly seen towards the end of 1989 and throughout 1990.</P>
      <P>The present waiting times for the specialities mentioned depends on the medical condition of the patient.  Waiting lists are kept under regular review by consultants.  Each patient is assessed having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and priority is given according to medical need.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to the mix of private and public patients is not currently available.  The introduction of modified arrangements for admission to public beds, as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> will enable this information to be available in the future.</P>
      <P>I will write further to the Deputy regarding the changes in acute consultant-staffed hospital beds since October 1988 per health board area.</P>

      <P>Arrangements regarding an individual patient's position on a waiting list and when his/her operation will be performed are entirely a matter for the clinician concerned and the Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter in which I have any involvement.</P>

      <P>Representations have been received requesting that the scheduled date for completion of the home economics facilities in the new building for Jobstown community college be brought forward.

The construction of the new school is on schedule and is due for completion in September 1991.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination of the feasibility of accommodating an amalgamated school in the Coláiste Chaoimhín building established that the cost of the adaptation and renovation required would be excessive. The amalgamation can be facilitated in the Marist girls secondary school by providing additional accommodation at a much <Col N="1542" /> more economical cost.

      <P>It is estimated that for the 1989-90 academic year, 71.6 per cent of pupils from the relevant cohort, ie, post-primary pupils enrolled in 1st year junior cycle in 1985-86, were retained up to the final year of the leaving certificate course. I must point out, of course, that it should not be assumed that the remainder of the cohort left school either during or at the conclusion of junior cycle.  It is estimated in fact that a further 11.5 per cent of the cohort specified transferred to vocational training type courses after junior cycle. One of the main objectives of my Department in sanctioning vocational training courses is to cater for those pupils whose particular talents and aptitudes mean that they will derive greater benefit from the skills-based nature of such courses as opposed to the more academic thrust of the leaving certificate course.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined in the House the educational proposals contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>; several of which are aimed at increasing retention rates of students in full-time education.</P>

    </P>
    <P>In addition to the above, there has also been a number of charter operations involving private hire or sole-use type charters which generally involve small light aircraft and which are not significant in terms of overall passenger numbers to and from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under current policy, charters are permitted on all routes to/from Ireland whether or not scheduled services exist on these routes.  Limits may, however, be imposed on the availability of &ldquo;seat only&rdquo; sales on a charter flight.  The mingling of Irish originating traffic with foreign originating traffic is permitted as is the mingling of inclusive tour and other charter categories.</P>
    <P>Tour operators normally have pricing freedom to determine the fares they will charge on charter services.  There is, however, a 14 day advance purchase requirement on advance booking charters to/from the US.  No such requirement exists for charters to/from Canada for so long as no scheduled services are in place between the two countries.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the Government's and CIE's pricing policy in relation to fare levels on the following: (a) the railways, (b) Dublin Bus and (c) Bus Éireann in the context of (1) the Government's subvention, (2) competition and (3) inflation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government took office, I had consistently refused applications from CIE for increases in fares and rates, emphasising instead the need for further cost economies within the CIE Group's operations, to keep the costs of public transport as low as possible to the travelling public and to the Exchequer. However, in view particularly of the increase in fuel costs arising from the Gulf crisis, I decided reluctantly late last year that an increase in fares and rates was unavoidable since fuel cost increases, <Col N="1567" /> being outside CIE's control, must be recovered.  I, therefore, conveyed approval to CIE for an increase in rates and fares which came into effect on 17 December 1990.</P>
      <P>With regard to CIE's pricing policy, decisions on individual fare levels within approved maxima, e.g. concession fares, fall entirely within the responsibility of the board.  I understand from CIE that fares are set at levels designed to maximise revenue subject to the need to maintain existing carryings to the greatest possible extent.</P>

      <P>From <Col N="1568" /> 1984 onwards, target reductions in railway expenditures were introduced for CIE.  These targets were generally not met, however, and were replaced in 1988 by a formula which limits the overall Exchequer subvention for CIE.  Under this formula, the annual Exchequer subvention for CIE is fixed by reference to an annual 3.5 per cent cut in real terms on the 1988 subvention for the company.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, specifically exempts the carriage of mails by or under contract with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from the licensing requirements of that Act.  The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, transferred that exemption to An Post.</P>
      <P>As An Post do not engage in the carriage of goods other than mail, the company do not require a carrier's licence for their activities.  It should be noted that in the carriage of parcels-express mail An Post do not have a monopoly and that the company provide that service in an open competitive market.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the cost to date, in terms of State Exchequer support, towards the Cork-Swansea ferry in recent years; and his views on whether the service can be made viable, on a stand alone basis, without Exchequer support.</Quest>

      <P>The cost of grant assistance by the Exchequer towards the provision of the Cork-Swansea ferry amounts to £1.3 million from 1987 to date as follows: 1987, £500,000; 1988, £300,000 and 1990, £500,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, repayable Exchequer loans have been made available to date as follows: 1990, £500,000 and 1991, £500,000.</P>
      <P>Swansea Cork Ferries Limited have informed me that they are budgeting for a break even result in 1991 but that they will be endeavouring to do a lot better than this.  The company accept that they must now operate on a commercial basis and must make a viable return on their furture operations.  With this commitment, and with the support of local tourism and business interests, I believe that the service can be made viable.  I have already made it clear that there can be no question of further Exchequer grants for the service in the future.</P>
