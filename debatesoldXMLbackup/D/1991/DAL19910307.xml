      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of promised legislation, namely, the Finance Bill, 1991, and the Social Welfare Bill, 1991, I should be greateful if the Taoiseach would arrange for a debate in this House, before those Bills are finalised, on the poverty traps which have been disclosed indicating that anybody who seeks promotion or works overtime at a certain income level can actually be worse off as a result of the extra effort.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be useful to have a debate on this subject before the finalisation of the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill, which are likely to make the position worse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a rather absurd sort of suggestion.  The debate on both Bills will give ample opportunity to discuss any of the matters to which Deputy Bruton refers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton should not give rise to argument now. The situation is quite clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the problem is the interaction of social welfare and taxation and that we need to discuss them together in one debate?  The proposal to have a debate prior to the finalisation of these Bills makes sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach if a report has been brought to his attention to the effect that in court yesterday during the <i>Eksund</i> case a French State official indicated that the French understanding of the Provisional terror campaign in the North is that it is part of an ancient struggle.  Will the Taoiseach take steps to convey to one of our partners in the European Community that this is not the case?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Deputy.  Clearly the matter he is raising is not appropriate to the Order of Business.  He must find another way of raising the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked this question previously the Taoiseach said it would be before the summer.  Since purported extracts from the Bill are being published in the newspapers, it would keep some modicum of relevance in this House if Members were allowed to read the intentions of the Government in relation to local government reform before they are discussed in the national press.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach about a matter which is probably of interest to people outside this House, Item No. 10, the establishment of a Select Committee on Crime.  As the Taoiseach is aware, this is a matter that has been going on for some time and there have been disputes between the parties about it.  I wrote to the Taoiseach some time ago and he replied in a non-commital way indicating that discussions were proceeding through the Whips.  I understand, in fact, that the Government have made no specific proposals in response to ours through the Whips and I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would give this matter his personal attention with a view to coming to an agreement on this before the Easter recess.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the fourth ACP-EEC Convention, signed on 15th December, 1989, together with the related internal agreement on the financing and administration of community aid, signed on 16th July, 1990, copies of which have been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The ACP-EEC convention or Lome Convention, to give it its short and better known title, is a wide ranging and detailed agreement on economic, social and cultural matters between the EC and the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lome Convention is the Community's most important instrument of development policy and for this reason I am particularly pleased to be seeking the approval of the Dáil for this motion in support of the Convention.  The detailed provisions of this, the fourth such agreement, are intended, as stated in the first article of the agreement, &ldquo;to promote <Col N="308" /> and expedite the economic, cultural and social development of the ACP States and to consolidate and diversify the relations between the Community and the ACP States in a spirit of solidarity and mutual interest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Lome Convention represents both a consolidation of the achievements of its predecessors and a significant development of the depth and scope of the Community's relations with the ACP States. The agreements have grown out of the earlier Yaoundé Conventions of the sixties between the original six member states of the EC, and a number of their former colonies, for the most part in French-speaking West Africa.  Work on a more ambitious association agreement followed between an enlarged EC and an enlarged group of countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.  The first ACP-EEC Convention was signed in Lome, the capital of Togo on 28 February 1975.</P>
    <P>The Lomé Conventions, in contrast to the previous Yaoundé Convention, have granted free non-reciprocal access to the Community market for almost all ACP products.  In addition, considerable financial and technical assistance has been made available for a wide range of ACP projects, primarily in the agricultural and industrial sectors.  One additional and significant innovation in 1975 was the introduction of a system to guarantee compensation for losses in basic commodity export earnings of ACP countries.  The scheme, known as STABEX, covered a range of agricultural commodities and was designed to alleviate the worst effects which fluctuations in world market prices have on the export earnings of those developing countries.  In view of the often dominant element in export earnings which these basic commodities represent, the value of the STABEX system is very clear.</P>
    <P>The Second Lomé Convention was signed in 1979.  A new feature of Lomé II was the introduction of the SYSMIN system, to assist ACP countries, whose economies were heavily dependent on the export of minerals to the Community, <Col N="309" /> and who had not benefited greatly from the STABEX system.</P>
    <P>The negotiations regarding Lomé III followed a similar pattern with the fundamental lines of the previous agreement confirmed and improved, where possible, and progress made on emphasising new areas of important joint co-operation. Thus agricultural development, and in particular food security and food self-sufficiency, were accorded particular importance.  Lomé III also made resources available for the first time to take steps to deal with drought and desertification. Social and cultural matters and respect for human rights were also provided for in the new convention.</P>
    <P>Lomé III also introduced a more comprehensive system of financial and technical co-operation with the intention of providing more effective aid, not just for projects but to whole sectors of the recipient countries' economies.  The Community was also able to provide a small real increase in the overall level of financial aid contained in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The negotiations for the new agreement, Lomé IV, took place against the background of serious economic difficulties for most ACP States which resulted from a continuing decline in commodity prices and increasing indebtedness. It was not surprising that these negotiations were long and complicated, and only finalised immediately prior to the signing ceremony.  Following five ministerial negotiating conferences, the last of which took place at the end of November 1989, the Convention was signed in Lomé on 15 December 1989 by the EEC and ACP States involved.</P>
    <P>The final agreement was welcomed by all involved in the process but praise is especially due to the efforts of the French Presidency, and in particular to the Foreign Minister, M. Dumas, for bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Since that time the Irish Presidency successfully presided over the Community negotiations both for the extensive transitional arrangements which implement many of the most important provisions of Lomé IV in advance, and <Col N="310" /> also for the internal agreement on financing Community aid.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the new Lomé Convention, while drawing on the achievements of its predecessors and improving and expanding the areas of co-operation, is a very comprehensive agreement.  It encompasses the entire scope of our trade, co-operation and assistance to the ACP countries.  Accordingly, I do not intend to go through the various provisions in detail.  What I would wish to do, however, would be to highlight some of the new or significantly improved provisions of this Fourth Convention which represent the Community's continued and increased commitment to the development of the ACP group of nations.</P>
    <P>One of the innovations of Lomé IV is, in fact, its duration.  Previous conventions have been of five years duration but for the first time, we now have a Convention that will endure for ten.  This will provide for greater stability in ACP-EEC relations and facilitate more long-term planning for the enhancement of co-operation between both sides.  To ensure that the accord can adapt to changing circumstances within these ten years a built-in flexibility has been added. Towards the end of the first five year period, a new financial protocol will be negotiated for the second five year period of the Convention and, at the same time, either party can request a review of the other clauses of the agreement if this proves necessary.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the level of aid proposed in the Convention, it is very commendable that, in an international economic environment which was not favourable to increasing aid, the Community's financial contribution has more than kept pace with inflation.  In actual figures the amount for the first five years of Lomé IV will involve 12 billion ECU compared with 8.5 billion ECU under Lomé III, an increase of over 40 per cent in nominal terms and over 20 per cent in real terms.  While the ACP States would, no doubt, wish that the overall amount could be larger, nevertheless they recognize the highly concessional nature of the <Col N="311" /> finance available.  Indeed, this has been increased with the removal of the necessity for the ACP States to repay STABEX transfers and with the provision of grants rather than loans for structural adjustment.  So far as Ireland is concerned, our financial contribution to the Convention over the first five year period will be 60.17 million ECU &mdash; approximately IR £46.8 million.</P>
    <P>Agricultural co-operation and rural development remain at the heart of the new Convention but within the framework of a new recognition of the regional dimension of food security.  Thus food production and supply will be stimulated at national, regional and inter-regional levels.  Food self-sufficiency will be promoted by improving productivity and aiming to guarantee adequate incomes in the rural sector.</P>
    <P>In the area of trade, significant progress was made after particularly difficult negotiations.  The new convention recognises both the needs of the ACP countries and the position of many Community states which are producers of products being exported by the ACP.  All ACP industrial products and almost all agricultural products enter the Community free of duties.  Despite difficult negotiations, the list of agricultural products was expanded, while rules of origin for industrial goods were liberalised.  In addition the general principles of commercial co-operation were significantly improved.  A new departure has also seen agreement to establish a trade development service with the task of developing and promoting ACP trade in the Community market.  This particular development is of considerable importance to the ACP group.  They consider that this unit will play a significant role in ensuring that they improve their position in the EC market, particularly in view of the advent of the Single European Market and the likely conclusions of the latest round of GATT negotiations.  In addition to the limited extension of the list of products, the Community and the ACP states have committed themselves <Col N="312" /> to increasing participation by the ACP states in the processing, marketing and distribution of their exports.</P>
    <P>In relation to two other important areas of the convention, the STABEX and SYSMIN systems to which I referred earlier, and which try to alleviate fluctuations in commodity and mineral export earnings, I am glad to say that these are improvements of real value. While the ACP States would have wished for an increase in both the number of projects eligible as well as securing the maximum possible amount devoted to the STABEX fund, nonetheless they recognise and acknowledge the progress made.  In particular regarding STABEX they welcomed the removal of the obligation to replenish the fund and the very significant increase in the resources devoted to the system which will be underwritten by 1,500 MECU &mdash; £1,154 million &mdash; compared to 925 MECU &mdash; £711 million &mdash; under Lomé III.  Modifications to the SYSMIN system, and the inclusion of uranium and gold, are also significant.</P>
    <P>The Convention has recognised the debt problems which exist for many ACP countries, and also the steps being taken, through structural economic reform, to tackle fundamental economic problems, of which the debt problem is only a part. Lome IV can only have a limited direct effect on the debt problem as the ACP debt to the Community &mdash; as opposed to its individual member states &mdash; is very limited.  Outside the context of the convention the Community is considering the possibility of further concessions on the relatively small amount of ACP debt to the Community.  In the meantime the Convention will provide specific financial supports to assist structural reform where ACP states wish to place their economies on a more viable footing.  This is in addition to the existing long-term development financing.  This support follows on from the Community's experience in providing a special programme to assist adjustment in the heavily indebted countries of Sub-Saharan Africa; 1,150 MECU &mdash; £884 million &mdash; will be available to support those countries engaging <Col N="313" /> in significant economic reform and to cushion the effects of this reform on vulnerable groups.  However, I emphasise that the bulk of the Community's aid will not be conditional on such reform.</P>
    <P>The Community's assistance for structural adjustment will be closely co-ordinated with other donors such as the World Bank.  It will enable the Community to have a real influence in the design of structural adjustment programmes and to ensure that, in co-operation with these other institutions, the social consequences of adjustment are fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>Protection of the environment is one of the most important challenges the world faces today.  The new Convention recognises this concern with significantly enhanced emphasis being given to the preservation of the natural heritage of ACP states.  Co-operation in matters of the environment has become the subject of a specific title in the Convention designed to ensure that economic and social development is based on a sustainable balance between economic objectives, management of natural resources and enhancement of human resources.  In addition to providing support to projects which preserve the environment, all projects will be assessed for their environmental impact.  Already one tangible achievement is the prohibition of the export of toxic and radioactive waste from the Community to the ACP countries.</P>
    <P>Respect for human rights, which was treated in an annex of Lomé III, has been strongly reinforced in the new Convention. It now forms part of the main body of the agreement.  It is recognised as a basic factor of real development. Co-operation is explicitly recognised as entailing respect for all human rights. Furthermore the contracting parties reaffirm their existing obligations and their commitments in international law to strive to eliminate all forms of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Provisions on the role of women in development have also been strengthened. Recognition of the role of women, both as agents as well as beneficiaries of <Col N="314" /> the entire development process, is a crosscutting issue which is accommodated throughout the Convention as well as being the subject of a specific article.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the provisions to deal with emergencies and refugees in the previous conventions have been retained &mdash; and indeed improved, as they now embrace persons displaced within their own countries as well as cross-border refugees.</P>
    <P>Concern has sometimes been expressed that the need to assist countries in Eastern Europe will distract the Community's attention from the developing world.  I should like to take this opportunity to assure the House that those developments will not undermine in any way the Community's commitment.  Our contractual relationship with the ACP states is absolutely firm and the convention is their guarantee.  At the signing ceremony for the new convention, both the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr. Marin, and the then President of the Council, the French Prime Minister Mr. Recard emphasised that the improvement of our relations with Eastern European countries is perfectly compatible with increased support for development of ACP countries.  During our own Presidency, I reassured the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly as well as the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers that our relations with the countries of Eastern Europe and with the ACP group are complementary, not competitive.  The volume of resources which the Community has devoted to the convention is ample evidence of this.</P>
    <P>As President of the Council in the first half of 1990 I also reassured the ACP States that the completion of the Internal Market is not designed to cut the Community off from the rest of the world. Nor will it damage the economic interest of the ACP states, or affect the commitments we have entered into with them.  A Single European Market can be an important source of economic growth and consequently it can provide new trade opportunities in which the ACP and other developing countries can share.</P>
    <P>This is not to deny that difficulties will undoubtedly arise from the structural <Col N="315" /> weakness of many ACP economies faced with tough international competition. This is why the Irish Presidency assured the ACP countries of the Community's wish to help them in using to the full the instruments of the Convention for the improvement of their competitive position.</P>
    <P>Where our ACP partners have genuine concerns, the Community is prepared to assist them to overcome concrete difficulties which may arise for them.  The new convention provides an unrivalled framework in which this co-operation can take place.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like the House, by approving the terms of the Convention, to welcome Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Namibia as the newest members of the Convention.  The ACP states now number 69.  I hope that Namibia's accession may consolidate its happy and peaceful transition to independence and democracy.  Although the negotiations within the Community on the terms of its accession were sometimes difficult, we have played an honourable role, consistent with our support for Namibia over many years.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by referring to the special position which Ireland, and my predecessors in the Department of Foreign Affairs, had in relation to the previous Lomé conventions.  In the case of each of these, Lomé I, II and III, Ireland held the Presidency of the European Communities during the period when each Convention was being finalised and signed, and these efforts were concluded each time with complete success. In the case of the current Convention Ireland has, for the first time not actually presided over the completion of the negotiations.  Nevertheless, as I indicated earlier the period of our Presidency was marked by conclusion of internal agreements necessary for ratification of this Convention.  Ireland has therefore once again played a significant and positive role in the continued success of this very important instrument of development policy.</P>
    <P>I recommend that this House approve <Col N="316" /> the terms of the Fourth ACP-EEC Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to ratify the Lomé IV Convention which was signed on 15 December 1989.  The Convention marks the 15th year of ACP-EEC co-operation.  I too welcome the fact that the life of this Convention is for ten years although the financial protocol will be negotiated after the first five, which gives a certain amount of flexibility. I urge the Minister and anyone who may succeed him in the Department to ensure that the renegotiation which will take place in five years time will not in any way take away from the Convention that has now been signed.</P>
      <P>The number of African, Caribbean and Pacific states participating has grown in the 15 year period from 45 to 69, the most recent countries to sign being Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Namibia.  I particularly welcome the inclusion of Namibia in this Convention.  The independence of Namibia was warmly welcome throughout the world.  It is hoped that it can achieve the necessary assistance it requires to ensure that it can sustain its independence and make it work. It is in the interests of all the states in Southern Africa that Namibia survives and manages to sustain its independence without fear of domination by South Africa.  The nations which supported Namibia's struggle for independence, including Ireland, have an obligation to put their money where their mouths were during all those years and ensure that Namibia gets a fair hearing in this Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that this Convention has been signed at a time when there has not been growth in nearly all the ACP countries.  A figure of £90 billion has been placed on the indebtedness of the 69 countries.  In ACP countries there are more slums, more poor people, more illness, more deaths, more drug abuse and diseases such as AIDS.  By and large it is fair to say that over the past 15 years the number of health centres and schools in some countries has decresed due to such factors as internal strife and war and <Col N="317" /> also because they have not been able to sustain the development they have achieved.</P>
    <P>Although many of the ACP countries have benefited, particularly in the educational field, and there is an output of more skilled people, unfortunately these people are leaving the ACP countries and gaining employment in the developed world.  This is a sad reflection on the structural positions in those countries. Many ACP countries are still counting their skilled personnel in tens rather than in thousands.  This is perhaps an indictment of the transfer of administrative and technological skills to these countries. The Convention, in examining the projects which will be funded, must put a great deal of emphasis on administration skills and on using as effectively as possible the large sums of money going into these countries.  The amount of money involved in the Marshall Plan after the Second World War would not amount to the sum which has gone into the four Lomé Conventions.  However, the difference is that the people who administered the Marshall Plan were absolutely determined that the money would be used effectively to restructure the economies and build up the social infrastructures of the countries concerned. Why is it that, in spite of the amount of money which has been given to the ACP countries, so many of them have gone backwards instead of forwards?  One could not compare any ACP country to Germany now.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we are being asked to ratify this Convention at a time when this Government have presided over the worst cuts in Irish ODA programmes. Since 1987 there has been a steady decline in the amount of aid given to these countries as a percentage of GNP to the point that in 1990 we only contributed 0.158 per cent of GNP compared with the high figure &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; of 0.256 per cent in 1985. Unfortunately the main cuts have been in our bilateral aid programme and the co-financing for non-governmental agencies which bring such credit to this country in the work they do.  Our bilateral <Col N="318" /> aid programme is the only programme over which we have real control.  Our other multilateral payments are paid as part of our membership of various bodies such as the UN and the EC.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of hearing the Government mouthing their support for the Third World countries.  It is time for the Government to cease this mouthing and put their words into practice.  It is not good enough at a time when 20 million people are now facing starvation in Africa, giving rise to fears that this famine will be much worse than the famine of 1984-85 when approximately one million people starved to death, that we are cutting back on our aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the aid given to Eastern Europe.  It is interesting to note that an additional £6 million was made available in this year's budget to help the emerging east European independent countries.  I welcome the fact that a number of those who signed the Lomé Convention made it clear to the ACP countries that there would not be any diminution in the assistance given to them because of the assistance given to east European countries.  I do not begrudge in any way the assistance given to these emerging nations but it should not be done at the expense of the bilateral and least developed countries in the world.  Ireland's contribution is now the lowest of the OECD countries.</P>
    <P>Many people say that Europe has its own poor.  I want to put into perspective the differences between these countries and the ACP countries.  It is estimated that the average income at present in countries in Eastern Europe such as Poland and Hungary is ten times greater than the income of people in the poorest African and Asian countries.  People in Hungary and Poland had a per capita income of $2,240 and $1,930, respectively, in 1987.  I want to compare that with the per capita incomes of people in Ethiopia and Tanzania, of $130 per annum and $180 per annum, respectively, in the same year.  No matter how bad the problems are in Eastern Europe we cannot continue to say that their needs are greater.  It is imperative that no <Col N="319" /> Government should play one country off against another.  While it is only right and proper that we give assistance to the east European countries, this should not be done at the expense of the ACP countries.  We have fought since 1987 for an increase in the amount of aid given to developing countries but we did not succeed in convincing the Government to do this.  Yet they could find a sum of £6 million for the eastern European countries in this year's budget.  This makes me wonder if there is more in it from a PR point of view for the Government to make that sort of money available to countries where there are perhaps more business opportunities.  I am sorry to sound cynical about this but that is the way it appears to the people who are looking at the figures.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the stark reality of life in some of the ACP countries where one in five children dies before their fifth birthday and over 40,000 children die every day.  Before we pack up and go home to our constituencies this evening over 40,000 children will have died in Third World countries.  Our aid programme for 1990 amounted to approximately 2½p per day per person.  About two weeks ago I read in one of the Sunday papers that this country alone spends £1,600 million approximately a year on alcohol.  We have to question where our priorities and commitments lie.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Government that we have had enough of their pious statements. We should achieve the UN target of 0.7 per cent so that we will be able to hold our head up with dignity at the international fora in which we participate, instead of hiding behind the door and saying that our problems are so bad we cannot even give a small percentage increase each year to our Third World partners.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister's speech of welcome here today and his commitment to the least well off in the world will sound a trifle hollow to the many thousands of people who have recognised our responsibility and commitment and who have been so generous in the many fund-raising <Col N="320" /> efforts run by non-governmental organisations. The total commitment of this ACP Convention is £7.7 billion.  That is a great deal of money and should make major changes in the ACP countries.  In preparing for this debate I thought I would have a look at what that amount of money means and how much of a commitment it is.  I want to give figures of some of the costs, for example, of the most recent war.  This is not a reflection on the war itself but a solitary reminder to us of exactly where our priorities lie when it comes to spending programmes in all the countries in the developed world.</P>
    <P>The five Tornado jets lost in the war by 23 January 1991 cost £105 million, equivalent to the cost of enough grain to feed for one month the 20 million people who are now threatened with starvation. The cost of training one Tornado pilot is £3 million, enough money to provide 25,000 Ethiopian families with enough seeds and tools to recover from the drought and become self-sufficient in the production of their own food.  The 33 Scud missiles which were fired in the war between 16 January and 23 January cost £3.3 million, the equivalent of the cost of 50 trucks plus spares, plus shipping costs to Africa.  The 216 Tomahawk Cruise missiles fired by 19 January, three days after the war started, cost $280 million which is the total food aid requirement of Ethiopia for six months.  The 23 Patriot missiles fired by 23 January at a cost of £500,000 per missile, a total of £11.5 million, would provide clothes, seeds and storage facilities for two million people in Mozambique for 12 months.</P>
    <P>One has to look at those costs carefully and realise that a horrendous war is not the way to solve the world's problems. We must reassess our commitment in the western world to the less developed world and the 69 countries with whom we are drawing up another convention.  It must be extremely difficult for a starving man or woman in Africa to understand that the red tape, bureaucracy and problems in our countries are so vast that we cannot reach out, help them and prevent them from dying of starvation.  It must be <Col N="321" /> difficult to understand when they read in the papers or hear on their radios that all the aid they would need is fired off in one bomb or in the loss of one aeroplane.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell on some of the new elements that I particularly welcome in this ACP Convention: first, the use of the environmental check list for all aid projects, and the fact that the first paragraph of the Convention is entitled &ldquo;The Environment&rdquo;, with the growth of recognition of the need for environmental protection it is important that that chapter is included in the Convention.  However, I find the language, particularly in Article 37, very loose.  It states that environmental impact assessments will be carried out as appropriate in the case of large-scale projects and those posing a significant threat to the environment.  It is a bit like the chicken and egg situation.  How do you know if a large project will cause environmental damage without first carrying out an environmental impact assessment?  I regret that the language is so loose there.  I would prefer to have seen the term &ldquo;all large-scale projects&rdquo; or even a specified size for the projects, as is the case in the environmental impact assessment directive from the EC.  In that way we could be sure that large-scale projects could not be undertaken which would be found later to have caused major environmental damage to the country in question and indeed to the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>The inclusion in this chapter of a recognition that environmental protection requires an approach embracing both the social and cultural dimensions is very insignificant.  I am reminded again of the project in the Philippines a number of years ago where, on the one hand, the proposal to dam a valley, known as the Chico dam project, had a lot of merit for the people living in the towns and cities of the area because it was going to bring them water, but on the other hand it was going to destroy the culture, lives and livelihood of a remaining, almost obsolete, tribe of Indians.  Thankfully in that instance the environmentalists, who at that stage were considered crack-pots and cranks, won out and that project did <Col N="322" /> not go ahead.  That highlighted the need to link environmental protection with social and cultural dimensions and the livelihoods of people.  The inclusion of environmental check lists will help to estimate the viability of proposed projects. As I have said, I hope we will see fewer mistakes of the kind we have seen in some of the projects undertaken in ACP countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome too the fact that all new aid will be in the form of grants, apart from the European Investment Bank which will continue to give all-risk capital to the ACP countries.  The inclusion in this Convention of the recognition of co-operation in the structural readjustment programmes is very important.  Many of us in this House have spoken previously of the &ldquo;hole in the bucket&rdquo; syndrome that exists where, on the one hand, vast resources are being poured into countries while, on the other hand, they are pouring out through the hole in the bucket due to indebtedness.  One welcomes the fact that there will now be a joint assessment on structural reform between the EC and the ACP countries and the IMF and the World Bank.  However, I urge the Minister to use whatever power he has and whatever forum is available to him to ensure there is expertise at EC level to match the IMF and the World Bank on their own ground when discussing these structural programmes.</P>
    <P>I want to comment briefly on two other areas of the Convention, as the Minister has already highlighted, the chapter for women and women in development. Article 153, particularly paragraph (c), is to be welcomed.  It states that there should be easier access by women to training and education which shall be regarded as a crucial element to be incorporated from the outset in development programming.  I hope that is taken on board and that women will have an input in the initial stages of development programmes. I welcome Article 154 on health and nutrition in which there is reference to the integrated approach needed to provide basic health care.  Too <Col N="323" /> often we see health centres being provided but with no preventative side. This chapter is to be warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is the fault of the Lomé Convention that some of the ACP countries are less well placed than they were ten years ago.  Matters would probably have been a great deal worse if the Lomé Convention had not been in place, particularly given the severity of the slump in the price of raw materials, the burden of debt of £90 billion and the effects of the structural adjustment programmes.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to pay tribute to a man whom I met a number of times over the years, Mr. Edwin Carrington, who is now retired as General Secretary of the ACP Group.  I quote what he said during the signing of the Convention:</P>
    <P>I think Lomé, without boasting, is now clearly the premier co-operation agreement between North and South on our planet today, and the ACP Group is a respected institution which takes part in, and makes a welcome contribution to, all the major regional and international conferences.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Edwin Carrington for the work he has done.  I sincerely hope this Government and all Governments in the future will monitor this Convention with care and diligence and ensure that it improves the lot of the people in the ACP countries.</P>

      <P>When these issues are discussed in this House I note a certain tendency &mdash; it is with no disrespect to the Minister of State that I say this &mdash; for development issues to reach the Dáil Order Paper usually towards the end of the week; they are not crowded occasions in terms of speakers or of a large audience. I have also noted, over the many years in which I have been speaking on this area, a certain kind of assumption that development issues and aid issues of countries and continents, such as Africa, are regarded as matters for the heart whereas real economics are regarded as a matter for the head.  I simply do not <Col N="324" /> want, yet again, to give a list of all the children who are dying &mdash; even though it is true &mdash; of all the villages without clean water, all the families without medicine and of the destruction of the native environments. One could do that year after year but the events of the last few weeks were very revelatory.</P>
      <P>It was when the glorification of military expertise was being extolled on our television screens that the people who believed in development should have spoken out.  You cannot have it both ways, you cannot be for the use of advanced technological armaments, weapons of destruction produced at profit by countries we refuse to criticise and then, a fortnight afterwards, say it is a pity that these resources were not used on medicine.</P>
      <P>I find it very difficult to accept people in this House, whose sincerity I do not challenge on the development issues, being reluctant to speak about the disgrace of what has taken place in the last few weeks.  At the same time as weapons costing more than $1 million a time were being aimed at villages with no water &mdash; and fired from villages with no water &mdash; maybe somewhere between 20 million and 30 million people in Africa were dying of starvation.  It is necessary for us to try to get our act together.  In all the coalition arrangements in which the Labour Party were involved, I had very little influence on the writing of a common programme.  However, I did have an influence in relation to one element, the inclusion of the commitment to achieve our United Nations target on overseas development aid.  It is very significant that in the negotiations between the Progressive Democrats and the Fianna Fáil Party, it was not a condition of the Progressive Democrats participation in Government that overseas development aid targets at United Nations level would be achieved in a phased way or within a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can also say &mdash; before the definitive biography appears &mdash; that at the time of the Coalition Government in which the Labour Party participated and which was led by the leader of another party, we <Col N="325" /> did not have it easy and there was an argument about what was meant by the achievement of the target and whether one talked about progress from one year to another.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Owen that the abandonment of any attempt towards a coherent development policy at present is an absolute scandal.  Let us be clear about what is happening here today; we are debating Lomé IV which was signed in Brussels on 16 July 1990, which had been signed in Lomé on 15 December 1989.  We do not have a foreign affairs committee in this House; there was once a joint committee on development co-operation on which a number of Members of this House served but it no longer exists.  There is no White Paper on the principles of development policy.</P>
    <P>I want straight answers to a few straight questions.  Where is the European Community's development policy?  That is a specific question because I want a specific answer.  Where does it differ from the World Bank strategy for the countries affected by the agreement?  Where does it differ from the International Monetary Fund?  I visited countries which are recipient countries in terms of the treaty.  I visited one when, at that very moment, it was being suggested that the country's economy should &mdash; and could &mdash; be restructured in terms of the market economy principles of the World Bank and the IMF.  Within the level of staff for a project delivery under the terms of the treaty, how do the numbers available to the Community compare with the IMF and the World Bank?  It is true that the ideological horror of the World Bank and the IMF, which has told the poorest of the world that they must pull themselves up by the principles of the market economy, is being slavishly followed by the European Community.</P>
    <P>I listened with care to the speech and I welcome the developments in Lomé IV and the other agreements since the signing of the first Lomé agreement.  On each occasion in this House when we have discussed the gap in trade between the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the Community the gap has <Col N="326" /> widened; the gap in income between <i>per capita</i> income has widened.  Indeed, the Community has quite an ambivalent view in relation to Lomé.  Maybe the Minister of State, for example, will tell me whether the Irish view on Lomé veers towards the British view, which was that you should have more trade, or towards the Italian view which said that you should have more aid.  These were not lofty principles of alternative development policy.  Very simply, Italy saw a threat for its agricultural producers in regard to agricultural concessions and, therefore, it wanted straight aid.  Britain, on the other hand, with its particular development focus at present, wanted to implement market principles.  What is the Irish view?  I repeat, our failure to put ourselves on course to at least go back to the level at which we were towards achieving the United Nations target in overseas development aid is a scandal.  I repeat &mdash; because I am always getting lectures about being in a minority in this House &mdash; no party in this House has a mandate from the public to cut overseas development aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>All the surveys say that, whatever the cost, people want Ireland to be on course towards achieving the target.  Why then is this unique mandate from the people being broken again and again?  There is a new tendency, from the people who write speeches in this country, to substitute proportionate figures with absolute figures.  Mrs. Thatcher had the same idea; when the old harridan of modern historical Britain was wandering around Britain, when people were in TB wards mixed with general patients and so on, she would smile through her teeth and say: &ldquo;last year we spent so many millions on health&rdquo;.  This is what we are getting now every week here. We never get a real statement such as, &ldquo;Proportionately what happened one year was such, the change in real terms was such&rdquo;.  The absolute figure is good enough for the plebs and their representatives. Throw it at them, because after <Col N="327" /> all they are unique in Ireland; they are the only country in the EC who do not deserve a foreign affairs committee, a development aid committee or a development aid policy.</P>
      <P>There are many things of a superficial and technical nature that are to be welcomed in Lomé IV.  For example, the word &ldquo;survival&rdquo; occurs in the speech. What survival are we talking about? There is a very interesting coded word in the Minister's speech in a reference to &ldquo;sectoral assistance&rdquo;.  Sectoral assistance means that the elite in the receiving country that controls the export economy will be assisted by the agreement and there is not one whit of progress towards people-to-people aid.  I am sympathetic to any Minister for Foreign Affairs in the EC, including the Irish Minister, regarding a dilemma that is genuinely there since the day Lomé I was signed.  The dilemma is about sovereignty.  In the first and early days a number of projects were built that were gradiose and not necessarily to the benefit of their receiving peoples.  They were prestige projects which served the image of government. The dilemma was: how could you respect the sovereignty of the recipient country and at the same time appear to give indications as to how funds should be spent to better effect?  The evolution of that problem through Lomé I on through Lomé IV has not really got any better but the EC has virtually run off the field altogether.  It has simply tailored and adjusted its economic programmes towards the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund orthodoxy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lomé IV was signed &mdash; indeed the discussions took place &mdash; in an incredible atmosphere.  Those of us who are elected must take the resources that are promised under Lomé IV and place them in comparison with the scale of the need of the countries involved.  The debt burden was about £90 billion sterling.  How will this agreement impact?  I am not saying the Treaty is wrong in that regard.  I am not saying it could solve all these problems, but I repeat that those who were for the war a fortnight ago and for development <Col N="328" /> this week are being inconsistent, that those who are for Lomé today and who are at the same time in favour of international market economics creating the debt burden that hangs like an albatross around the least developing countries and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries are equally being inconsistent. It is an unpopular view in this Parliament and in many parliaments that the people who are struggling against famine and disease should be allowed to pick their own path to development and to pick different models of development.  What is being visited on them is an orthodoxy. That orthodoxy means that the internal structure of many of the countries is not affected by the aid that is involved.</P>
    <P>I have another question for the Minister when he comes to reply.  How do the developments suggested in Lomé IV square with the developments that are going to arise from the GATT?  For example, what is our attitude towards Lomé IV specifically?  I have asked the question about the Italian and British position, but how do we square our bleeding hearts in relation to Lomé discussions with the position we are taking up on the GATT?  Is it not a kind of dishonour of language to say that I am for this this week but I am going to weep with the rest of the world the following week and I am going to be concerned about something else the next week?  You cannot have it every way.</P>
    <P>There are many things we could do. We could have our foreign affairs committee, a development co-operation committee and a development policy.  We have had enough of advisory councils. They are very valuable but they come and go and keep on saying the same thing. We have had a plethora of agencies, marvellous people all drawing our attention to the issue, but the truth is that our Department of Finance would not let us take anything like a progressive view.</P>
    <P>To use a word that is becoming very unfashionable, how does the specific post-colonial history of Ireland feature in this development policy?  I notice a profile of thinking emerging in the British case that arrived in St. Stephen's Green about <Col N="329" /> a month later.  What is Irish about I veagh House's development policy apart from the fact that it is the least staffed, the Cinderella Department within the Department of Foreign Affairs, regarded as something like a punishment station. This is no reflection on particular individuals, but I repeat my statement.  It exercises no muscle down there.  I am sure it does people's vanity good to be able to say, &ldquo;we presided over the signing; we dragged everything together&rdquo;.  I will be more concrete than that.  Take the statements of a distinguished French Foreign Minister at one stage, and later a Commissioner, Claude Cheysson, and compare them with anything said by anybody in Ireland on development and you will get an idea about how far we are from any consistency.  Where does our response to Lomé IV fit in with or depart from the Scandinavian views?  Are the Scandinavians mad?  Is some madness induced by their commitment to social democracy and to the solidarities that led them to continue with the UN targets? Are the little Irelanders who wanted to follow the little Britain of the market economy so intellectually superior that we follow along the line of telling poor countries they must pull themselves up?</P>
    <P>Of course, what Deputy Owen said is true, and she and I have seen this on the ground.  Yes, 40,000 children die each day.  And &mdash; a very interesting thing &mdash; the equivalent 48 hours of the recent war could have provided clean water for practically most of the countries involved in sub-Saharan Africa.  Yes, we could achieve the UNICEF targets in relation to children's welfare.  Where we are making a mistake and living a lie is by saying the development aid issues are soft issues but that real men talk about economies within a market economic model.  That is how that comes across again and again.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all those who have raised Irish consciousness again and again, year after year, but no progress will be made on development aid until it enjoys a sufficient status and until, in a budget planning process, some Minister says he wants to implement the mandate <Col N="330" /> the Irish people have given to put us on course to achieve the UN target in relation to ODA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is about ratification of Lomé IV.  Lomé IV was signed by the ACP negotiators in December 1989, ratified by the European Parliament in July of last year and yet here we are, in March 1991, six or seven days after the Lomé III Convention expired, seeking to ratify Lomé IV. When one considers that because of the delay by various European and ACP countries in ratifying Lomé IV it has been necessary for the European Council to take steps to extend arrangements for the continuation of assistance to ACP countries at least until June, we can see how slow European countries in particular have been in taking seriously their commitments under ACP.</P>
      <P>It must be said that for quite a long time there have been doubts cast on the commitment of the European Community and the member states to the question of development in the underdeveloped world, or the Third World, particularly since the concentration in the last year to 18 months on eastern Europe. Questions have been asked by the developing countries.  They want to know if this means they will be left in the lurch. It must be said that the delay in ratifying this agreement would seem to indicate that there is very little urgency with regard to development in the region.  We seem to be able to deal far more quickly with issues arising in relation to Eastern Europe than in relation to what is known nowadays as the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that there have already been three ACP-European Community Conventions implemented, and given the continuing appalling poverty among the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries which are signatories to the Convention, one might expect a somewhat critical analysis of where the Lomé process is leading, and what the programme which the Dáil is being asked to approve is likely to achieve in reality.  Instead, the Government in chorus with other European Community Governments are <Col N="331" /> attempting to sell Lomé IV as a major breakthrough for assistance policies to developing countries.  There is an old Italian proverb that says, when too many roosters start crowing, the sun never gets a chance to come up.  There is a danger that in such a chorus of support for Lomé IV we may fail to examine the full value of the agreement or to assess whether it is of any real benefit to the developing world.</P>
    <P>We have the strange situation where, despite the Lomé framework the flow of funds from south to north has exceeded the flow from north to south over the past ten years.  Aid, either deliberately or as a result of defective policies, ends up being used to increase dependence on the economies, trading priorities and technology of the developed world.  It is not simply a case of some of the major economic powers exploiting the poorer states. Ireland would appear to be a clear net beneficiary from its contracts with these countries.  Figures available in Irish semi-State companies for 1987, for instance, are recorded as having earned consultancy and technical assistance contracts worth a total of £86 million from the Third World.  Ireland's bilateral aid allocation was a mere £9 million in the same year &mdash; a tidy profit of £75 million. While it is not possible to quantify the gains and losses for the developing world from Lomé, so specifically there is increasing evidence that the balance of loss is on the side of the developing countries.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, <i>The Irish Times</i> ran the chilling headline which read &ldquo;Twenty million may starve as food aid falls short&rdquo;.  In countries as far apart as Mozambique, Sudan, Rwanda, Chad, Uganda and Liberia, development policies are failing to the extent that millions of people are starving.  Most damning of all perhaps is the fact that during the eighties, Ethiopia was the scene of one of the most horrific and much publicised famines in history and it is now reported that up to six million people face famine and starvation.  These are but the extreme examples.  Throughout the developing <Col N="332" /> world Governments and people are fighting an increasingly uphill battle for survival.  In Africa the problem of famine; in Latin America and the Caribbean the problem is a crippling debt which prevents those countries ever shaking off the burden of chronic underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>If this is the overall picture, it is hardly unfair to wonder how effective north-south co-operation is in achieving its stated aims.  It is surely time to subject the aims and instruments of this co-operation, particularly Lomé and its resources to critical analyses.  Bigger, better and faster was one of the slogans of the Community on economic contacts with ACP States at the start of Lomé III.  The facts would seem to indicate that this strategy has served to overwhelm rather than assist the developing world.  There is every danger that Lomé IV will result in not just a continuation, but an escalation of the difficulties facing the African, Caribbean and Pacific States.</P>
    <P>The 1992 process of the Single Market, which is geared to create a more efficient and competitive economic and political unit within the European Community, would present an even stronger bloc confronting the chronically disorganised economies of the south.  While the Ministers say that it is not designed to do this, and while it may not be intentionally designed to do this, it will certainly have a deleterious effect on the efforts of the developing world to gain access to that market.</P>
    <P>The developments in Eastern Europe and the inevitable flow of investment into these countries from the European Community and other sources, jeopardise and will undoubtedly reduce the funds available to the poorer states.  Unless there is a fundamental review of funding, structures and policies the Lomé process will continue to fail in its stated aim of assisting real development in recipient states and, in the new world order emerging on the political and economic front, Lomé will achieve less and less.</P>
    <P>This new world order deserves closer attention.  The past few months have displayed the ability of the developed <Col N="333" /> countries to deploy unimaginable levels of resources and funding in response to the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait.  Well over 500,000 troops &mdash; about the number of voters it takes to elect the Members on the Government benches &mdash; were deployed in the Middle East with associated transport and life support systems in a most hostile environment at very short notice and without any serious reference to the costs involved.  Yet, it proves impossible to provide adequate funding to assist developing countries to allow them develop their infrastructure to the extent necessary for economic development to take off.  As yet, uncounted amounts of financial resources, estimated at £2,000 million to £3,000 million in the case of Britain alone, were devoted to military expenditure in the war against Iraq and on arming other Middle East States in the allied coalition.  Yet millions of people in dozens of ACP countries continue to draw water from unclean wells because there is a lack of money to develop such basic infrastructural services as clean water supply.</P>
    <P>On the financial package offered by Lomé IV, I am not satisfied that it represents a sufficient financial commitment. The figures show an overall allocation of 10,800 million ECU in EDF funding and this represents an increase of about a quarter on the Lomé III allocation of 1985.  Given the effects of inflation and the fact that particularly improverished countries such as Haiti and countries with special development needs, such as Namibia, have now joined the Lomé framework, the allocation does not really represent any advance at all.</P>
    <P>Considering the failure of Lomé III to achieve any tangible progress in tackling under development the cash allocation of Lomé IV will be inadequate to reverse the slide into greater poverty and under development in the ACP states.  Interestingly, the European Investment Bank loan provision of 1,200 million ECUs represents a less than 10 per cent increase on Lomé III.  In real terms therefore less cash will be available for such loans.  It <Col N="334" /> may well be that we are finally seeing a recognition that loans are an unsatisfactory means of dealing with Third World development.  It may instead be a fear that more and more ACP states are a bad bet when it comes to issuing loans. The facts are that in Africa statistics show that between 1980 and 1987 GDP fell by an average of 2.6 per cent each year, investment fell and the rate of return on investment fell even more from a rate of 30.7 per cent in the period 1961-73 to a mere 2.5 per cent in 1980-87.</P>
    <P>Western institutions offered vast sums in loans to sub-Saharan countries in Africa in the late seventies and by the mid-eighties, pressure for repayment had reached alarming levels and these countries have suffered the crippling effects of debt and interest repayments ever since. The new Lomé Convention does not take adequate account of this unparalleled crisis of debt.  A declaration annexed to the convention reiterates the Community's readiness to hold exchanges of views with ACP states on the debt issue in the context of overall international discussions on debt but this sounds little more than talks about talks.  If this is to be the attitude of the developed world to the virtual bankruptcy of dozens of states in the Third World then we are heading for an unparalleled economic crisis which will affect much more than just the poorest states.  The entire world trading and financial system will be affected and the crisis will not be confined to the Third World.</P>
    <P>The pressure on ACP states with the advent of 1992 will become even greater. While the enlarged Internal Market will in theory open new doors to Third World countries, it is also clear that a high level of technological and infrastructural development will be required of any country which hopes to benefit from the 1992 process.  The ACP states are clearly the most disadvantaged in this regard.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Lomé IV provide an inadequate strategy for dealing with the economic crisis in the ACP states.  A fundamental review of the entire Lomé framework should have been carried out in view of the failure evident in Lomé <Col N="335" /> III.  Indeed, it is reprehensible that the European Community in its negotiations did not allow for such a review.  For the ACP countries therefore it became a case of quarter of a loaf or no bread at all. Their lack of enthusiasm for the new agreement was evident in the fact that six months after the initial signing of the agreement just one ACP state had ratified it.  As I understand it, something like ten are still required to sign and ratify it in order to reach the two-thirds required before it can become effective.</P>
    <P>In relation to Ireland, it goes without saying that there is urgent need to reestablish the joint committee on co-operation and aid.  It is quite extraordinary that not only do we not have a foreign affairs committee, although one has now been promised, we do not have any forum, other than the odd debate in this House, on development policy for aid to the Third World and on the way it should be developed.  What contribution is being made by Ireland in the various fora in which we are represented on the question of aid?  What attitudes are being promoted and from where do they come? Certainly, Members on the Opposition benches have very few opportunities to convey their views and help develop a coherent response to the needs of the Third World.  I urge the Government to take on board the idea of reconstituting the committee which we had here some years ago.</P>
    <P>It is also unfortunate, although I have tried on at least two occasions to get all-party agreement, certainly among the Opposition parties, on an approach to the Government in relation to an agreed programme on increasing ODA, that I received little response from the parties in this House to this idea.  By and large, there is agreement that ODA needs to be increased and that we need to get back on track to reach the United Nations' target.  It seems that it would make sense for all the parties in this House to get together to discuss how this can be done in a rational way over a period of years. I, again, urge all parties &mdash; I am not <Col N="336" /> singling out any party, either in Opposition or in Government &mdash; to sit down, privately if necessary, to thrash out how this country can regain some credibility, in relation to our contributions on ODA.</P>
    <P>There is no question of either I, or any other Deputy, opposing the ratification of this Convention as that would not make sense.  It has been negotiated over a long period of time between a large number of countries.  It is what it is but I do not think we should leave it at that.  As I said, we should have a committee to monitor its implementation and the way it is developing.  It will apply for a ten year period and it may well need to be changed and adjusted during that period.  This House should address the issues that arise.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins who said that Deputies who supported the Gulf War are not being consistent in now crying about the waste of resources in the bombing of people and armies in the Gulf.  This does not make sense.  The questions of ODA and what kind of security order will exist in the future were entwined in the attitude to the Gulf and the war which was precipitated there. There are differing views as to whether the war started in January or August &mdash; indeed one could go back through the history of the Middle East to decide when it started and who started it.</P>

It was a crime that a country such as Egypt, which has so few resources of its own, was engaged in the war and was effectively bought off to support the war on the basis of having its debts wiped out by the United States.  That is a country which has one of the most appalling levels of poverty on the face of this earth.</P>

      <P>Nowhere is the hypocrisy of the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles <Col N="337" /> Haughey, more obvious than in this attitude to overseas aid and development co-operation. I speak from personal experience. In 1981, I was appointed as the first Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid and development co-operation. I recall that following the change of Government in 1982 that appointment was not continued and no Minister of State with that responsibility was appointed by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey.  I raised the issue with him in the House and he dismissed the suggestion that the precedent established in 1981 should be continued. He suggested that such an appointment was superfluous and supernumerary. Those were his words in 1982.</P>
      <P>Following a further change of Government I was again given special responsibility for overseas aid and development co-operation.  I recall being in Ethiopia at the height of the famine in 1985.  I was there on behalf of the Irish Government, but principally on behalf to the European Community, because at that time we held the Presidency.  I had been pressing for substantial aid from the Community for the starving in Africa.  Arising from the strong proposal I made, I was asked to go there and report personally on the position.</P>
      <P>When I was visiting one of the awful death camps in Ethiopia, where I saw the full horror of the famine and people literally dying before my eyes, I received a news report from Ireland as to what the then leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, felt should be done.  His view was that Ireland should appoint a Cabinet Minister with responsibility for overseas aid and development co-operation.  I will not tell the House what my physical reaction was when I heard this proposal but it highlighted the feelings I had about our current Taoiseach.  Of all the hypocritical proposals I had heard, that beat them all. A man who, when he was Taoiseach, would not even appoint a Minister of State was responding to publicity about famine in Africa with this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not at all surprised in 1987 that the ODA budget, built up year by year during the term of our Government from <Col N="338" /> 1981, was savagely attacked.  Between 1981 and 1986 we had been able to increase our contribution from 0.18 per cent to over 0.25 per cent of GDP.  That was not done without a lot of commitment and effort and I was delighted to have been involved and associated with it.  I was not surprised in 1987 that the poorest of the poor in the world were the first to be targeted by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, when it came to retrenchment and cutback.  Over a couple of years all the progress that had been made in the early part of the decade had been taken apart.  The programme had been cut and slashed and by 1990 the percentage of GDP allocated to aid was even lower than in 1981 at 0.16 per cent. That is an appalling indictment of this Government.</P>
    <P>I exempt entirely from my remarks the Minister of State present who has been dealing with development co-operation, a decent man who has been trying to do the very best he can in the circumstances. I focus my comments entirely on the hypocrisy of the Taoiseach in view of that kind of record over the decade.  He has shown that he has not the slightest interest in or commitment to the poor.  If they have not a vote, they are of no concern to him.  When the tear is in the eye he will respond by making the grand statement, but when it comes to the bottom line of producing the wherewithal to develop the Irish aid programme, he is not at the races.  It is a frightful indictment of his record and it deserves to be highlighted.</P>
    <P>I note that in 1991 there is an improvement in the figures, but I fear we must look behind those figures.  The improvement, while on the face of it substantial, does not do much to indicate a renewed commitment on the part of the Government. The 1991 Estimate show an increase of £9 million, which sounds good.  There is £5 million on the multi-lateral side but virtually all of it is due to a mandatory requirement to provide extra funds for Ireland's contribution to the European Community.  The other £4 million is on the bilateral side and it is mainly to supply food aid for countries <Col N="339" /> affected by the Gulf crisis.  This will largely consist of the supply of skimmed milk powder to Egypt, I am glad to see our support for Egypt, one of the poorest of the frontline states in terms of <i>per capita</i> income involved in the Gulf War. Let us not pretend that it is a reinforcement of our commitment to the poorest of the poor in Africa and Asia.</P>
    <P>While talking about Egypt and the Gulf I feel it necessary to respond to comments made by my colleagues, Deputies Higgins and De Rossa.  I find their comments to be absolutely ludicrous. The approach I adopt to the UN is entirely consistent.  I supported fully the resolutions of the UN Security Council relating to the Gulf.  I stood four square behind the UN in that regard and I would criticise anybody who was prepared to damage the credibility of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I hold similar views in relation to development co-operation.  This country should move towards the UN-recommended figure of 0.7 per cent of GDP and I make no secret of the fact that I was the person who pushed that commitment as the first Minister of State with responsibility in this area.  I was delighted to be involved with the Government who in the early part of the last decade increased our contribution substantially from 0.18 per cent to 0.25 per cent.  Both approaches were absolutely consistent and indicated my support for the UN. Any inconsistency is on the part of other parties.  Let them explain their inconsistencies. I support the UN on both fronts and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins regarding public support for overseas development and co-operation.  There is no mandate for any Government to cut development co-operation moneys.  The most recent survey in this area was carried out in 1989 by the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation and it covered all aspects of Ireland's development co-operation policy.  The survey found that 89 per cent of Irish people have a positive overall attitude towards helping the Third World &mdash; 58 per cent are very much in favour <Col N="340" /> and 31 per cent are in favour of it on the whole.  There is no mandate for cutting support for the poorest of the poor.  It is clear that there is very strong support for Ireland, as the 25th richest nation in the world, playing its part in the development co-operation effort.</P>
    <P>This leads on to what we should do in the future.  It was I who proposed in 1981 that there should be an Oireachtas joint committee on development co-operation. At this stage I am not entirely certain if that is the best way forward. From the point of view of giving Members of this House an opportunity of expressing their views it is probably best that we go ahead with the foreign affairs committee and that we form a sub-committee to deal specifically with development co-operation.  I do not think it is practically really to have two such committees.  One committee, with a sub-committee dealing with development co-operation is the obvious way forward and will give Members of the House who have an interest in it the possibility of expressing their views.  The second way forward, was touched on by Deputy De Rossa and I think there should be an effort to try to take overseas aid and development co-operation out of the area of party politics.  Over the years I have seen vague commitments from different parties in Government to do what they can as resources permit.  Our own party in Opposition between 1977 and 1981 made a commitment which we adhered to.  But I would like to see a commitment by all parties to a gradual, sustained increase in development co-operation and overseas aid and that the whole issue would be taken out of party politics.</P>
    <P>I would suggest an annual increase in overseas development aid of 0.05 per cent of GDP.  This is not unreasonable and in fact we achieved it between 1981 and 1987 and I think it is possible to do so again.  Our only assurance of making progress towards achieving the UN target is on an all-party basis.  When the foreign affairs committee has been established &mdash; and I hope with a sub-committee dealing with developing co-operation &mdash; I hope discussions will open between the parties <Col N="341" /> on a proposal of that kind.  That holds out the best chance of making sustained progress on the UN target over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I believe Lomé IV is an improvement on Lomé III.  I was involved in the negotiations on Lomé III and I attended the signing in Togo.  In passing I might say my recollection is of a dingy, nasty country whose human rights provisions which we discussed during our negotiations could be highlighted.  My comments are not in the context of its poverty.  I have been in the death camps in Ethiopia and in refugee camps in Kampuchea, bangladesh and Calcutta, and I would not refer to poverty in that fashion, but I am concerned about the type of Government in some of these countries.  It appears to me that there are major restrictions on the freedom of their people and we cannot overlook this in the negotiation of international agreements of this kind.  I know it is a sensitive issue but the European Community will have to continue to raise it in the ACP-EC context.</P>
    <P>The framework established by Lomé IV seems to be an improvement on Lomé III.  The fact that it spans a longer period of time makes sense.  The money available has been improved and there are a number of technical provisions which will give rise to improvements.  Therefore, I have no difficulty in giving approval to the Convention.  Realistically it would be quite ludicrous if Dáil Éireann did not approve the Convention &mdash; a Convention freely negotiated between the representatives of the European Community and representatives of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.  I wish Lomé IV every success in the years ahead.  I hope the remarks I have had to make on our national performance will be borne in mind and we will see a change of heart on the part of the present Government. I hope the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will bear fruit for whatever term is left to this Government.  I encourage him to continue his efforts within the Government side and we will support that from the Opposition benches by continuing to highlight the <Col N="342" /> deficiences and the need for a change of heart on the part of the present Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of my major political interests and I am always delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to debates on the Third World.</P>
      <P>This is a quite day in the Dáil.  It is noteworthy, but not in a desirable way, that there are so few Deputies in the House.  It is particularly regrettable that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is the sole bearer of the banner for his own party and there is not another single Fianna Fáil front bencher or back bencher to contribute to this debate.  It is particularly noteworthy also that, on the benches slightly to my right, there is not one single personage from the Progressive Democrats, whose publications, particularly when the party had just been formed, were full of laudable sentiments.  One would hope that those sentiments are still part of the policy of that party, but it is a great pity that none of these people is here today.</P>
      <P>I, like all my colleagues who have spoken, support Lomé III.  While it might not be an adequate response in terms of what we need to do for the poor of the Third World, nevertheless the principle of Lomé established in 1975 is an excellent one.  In each of the four conventions we have now gone through, there has been an improvement in terms of trade and aid and in terms of including relevant or important matters that were not included in previous conventions.  This time around one is particularly satisfied that there is a linkage to human rights abuses and respect for human rights among the participants in this convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said today in relation to faults to be found on the EC side, the inadequacies of what we are doing and what we are offering to do.  We should not lose sight of the fact, however &mdash; and this is going back to the need to include human rights in the Convention &mdash; there is so much the recipient countries themselves could improve about the way they conduct their own affairs.  We should not be ashamed, indeed we should at all times <Col N="343" /> say to certain countries who are recipients &mdash; and naturally we give anything they get in the full spirit of generosity and knowing their need &mdash; that there is something wrong if they devote 35 per cent or 40 per cent of GDP to their military and maybe 1 per cent of their GDP towards primary education.  It is most important that those points be made in our negotiations and that when we are critical of ourselves, we might be mindful of these points as well.</P>
    <P>A proposal on development aid placed by the EC Commissioner to convert all outstanding repayments of loan aid to ACP countries to grants was passed after a special meeting last December through the full council but, as far as I know, we have not had a definitive decision to date. Deputy Owen mentioned that the total debt of the APC countries is of the order of £100 million.  The proposal to convert would only represent 1 per cent of the total debt burden of those countries.  This proposal is fully consistent with the philosophy in Lomé IV which sets out that in future aid should come under the heading of grants rather than loans.</P>
    <P>In his breakdown of Irish overseas assistance this year Deputy O'Keeffe said that while the overall figure may look good it is interesting to look at the various components of it.  I have to criticise the fact that £7 million of it has been specifically targeted towards countries that are particular victims of the Gulf crisis, i.e. Egypt.  That is all very well and we welcome that.  However, in its underlying principle, this does not show that we have a cohrent overseas development policy. That sort of sum, because it is given on a once-off basis this year, should be shown as a separate item.  It is misleading to show it as a percentage increase of our ODA which it absolutley is not.</P>
    <P>The allocation of funds to front line states in the Gulf conflict raises the fear that Irish aid will not be disbursed in accordance with the recipient needs, which has always been the principle that has governed it in the past.  If this is what we are to have in future it would represent a major policy change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> Much has been said in the House about the cutback in the levels of our aid since 1987 which never should have taken place.  This is such a small amount of our total annual expenditure targeted on the poorest in the world, and we have our own historical experience of living at the kind of levels of privation which this aid reaches out to.  Since 1987 there has been a increase in total current expenditure of 3.9 per cent, despite all the cutbacks.  We find ourselves at the end of the four years with a total current expenditure by the Exchequer which has increased by 3.9 per cent.  On health care, which is very controversial, there has been an increase in expenditure of 5.3 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not enough.  In social welfare there has been an increase of 4.3 per cent.  On education there has been an increase of 13.7 per cent &mdash; that is laudable.  However, on ODA there has been a decrease of 23.4 per cent, and that is absolutely shameful.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes argued that the national generosity of the Irish people in the way they contribute to overseas aid, to the non-governmental organisations such as Trócaire, GOAL and so on, in many ways almost cancels out the lack of Government generosity.  Non-governmental organisations from this country alone last year contributed £23 million to projects in Third World countries.  That was collected, in coins very often, small amounts, from the people all around the country, and we find the amount of official assistance at around £36 million. As a previous speaker said, there is this clear tangible expression of support in terms of people willing to put their hands in their pockets and to give their own money.  Yet we find this penuriousness on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome Ireland's contribution towards the European Bank for Construction and Development.  We all recognise that Eastern Europe has to reorientate its economies.  Recently we <Col N="345" /> debated a Bill governing our participation in this facility; that will commit the Irish Government to spending something like £23 million towards Eastern European construction.  That is laudable. However, in terms of level of need, the need in the Third World is so much greater.  Yet we were very generous, we were very quick to respond because this was a particular EC initiative.  We were very quick to play our part, but the gap in our alacrity in playing our part in that direction and our lack of action in terms of outreach to the Third World is amazing. There are people who do not like to go into some of the horrific details of what is taking place in poor countries at present.  I would like to put on record some of the projects that will be helped by the money we spend.  I will give details of the problems that will be exacerbated if we do not spend money.</P>
    <P>At present there are 40,000 child deaths each day in the 67 countries about which we are talking.  There are 115 million children in these countries living in constant illness and in a state of retarded growth.  In 1990 alone over 20 million children in the world died from whooping cough and measles.  There are 100 million children in these countries between the ages of six and 11 years who never go to school and 60 per cent of them are girls.  They all form part of 1 billion people &mdash; a quarter of all mankind &mdash; who are illiterate.  By our meanness we are contributing to these figures becoming worse because as the economic status of some of the poorer countries get worse the areas that suffer first are primary education and primary sanitation.</P>
    <P>About 11 per cent of all ODA from the wealthy countries goes towards the provision of education.  If one looks at a profile of how that money is spent one will find that it reaches a relatively low percentage of children in the countries that most need aid towards education.  A very high percentage of the 11 per cent goes towards educating children at second-level or, perhaps, third-level, while countless millions of children have no access to even primary education <Col N="346" /> which underlines the point about illiteracy. We should talk to our recipient countries and ask that there be a reorientation of the way the money is spent.  We should insist that there be a reorientation of how the money is targeted and ask who are the recipients. Ours is a penurious response to the overall problem but it is absolutely despairing to find that so much of the money is badly orientated or is not properly targeted to the people most in need.</P>
    <P>One finds that 5 per cent of all ODA which goes to the poorest countries is spent on health.  There are hundreds of thousands of children, perhaps millions of children, suffering from whooping cough and measles &mdash; easily curable diseases by simple immunisation &mdash; whom this expenditure at least affects.  Frequently, expenditure on health helps people in the middle and the better-off classes of these countries because it is spent on prestigious hospitals, clinics and so on.  That problem is not talked about and it should be part of the negotiations on the importance of targeting.</P>
    <P>Only 1.5 per cent of all ODA nowadays goes towards water and sanitation.  From figures I have seen recently I note that 60 per cent of urban dwellers in the poorest countries have access to safe water and barely 40 per cent of rural dwellers have access to safe water.  Safe water is the very basis of primary health and sanitation. Reasonable health care and sanitation will protect people from so many easily curable diseases but because of the environment in which they live, particularly children, they die as a result of those diseases.</P>
    <P>Every year about 500,000 in the Third World die of diseases related to pregnancy, most of which are easily curable diseases.  A sad corollary is that these 500,000 mothers leave approximately one million orphans each year.  Another sad aspect is that many of these deaths arise from improperly supervised abortions. A very high proportion of these mothers are 18 years of age and under.</P>
    <P>Health expenditure in 95 of the underdeveloped countries is only about 1.1 per cent of GNP.  In many of these countries <Col N="347" /> military expenditure would be of the order of 320 per cent of GNP.  Expenditure on education in these countries amounts to about 2.5 per cent of GNP and 4.5 per cent of the gross national product of these countries goes to servicing debts owed to countries in the developed world.  I use that figure to reinforce my earlier point that the Government should support Mr. Martin's proposal that previous debts owed by ACP countries to EC under Lomé be converted from debt owing to us to grants.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of life in Africa is the horror of AIDS.  It is now estimated that three million women are HIV positive in Africa and in Asia but even more horrific is the concentration of 2.5 million of these women in sub-Saharan Africa.  It is estimated that 30 per cent of the children born of these women will be infected with AIDS and that they will die within six years of their birth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely make that point to illustate again the scale of the problem we are dealing with and to remind us of the inadequacy of the response of this country to the problem.  The point cannot be made often enough that in terms of ODA as a proportion of our GDP &mdash; and that is the only way one can measure it &mdash; Ireland's contribution this year, if we take out the £7 million which goes to the front line states affected by the Gulf crisis, will be 0.15 per cent.  Last year it was 0.16 per cent of GDP.  There were years during the mid-eighties &mdash; I am glad this was at the time of the previous Coalition Government of which I was a supporting Member in the other House &mdash; when we went as high as 0.25 per cent of GDP, and this was at a time of very severe economic crisis.  Since then we have almost halved that figure.  One has to go back as far as 1978 when it was 0.13 per cent of GDP or 1979 when it was 0.18 per cent of GDP to find a comparable <Col N="348" /> figure in terms of what we contributed in ODA to the Third World.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will take on board some of the views expressed by Members on this side of the House.  Very often we judge our civilisation by our economic and technological achievements but we should remember that ultimately we will be judged by what we have done for the other people with whom we share this planet.  I would have to say that Ireland's contribution to the other half of the world will not add in any noble way to our history.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I support this motion which will provide a wide range of assistance to the developing world. However, it has to be said that there is a great deal of hypocrisy in our attitude to the Third World both at EC level and in this country.</P>
      <P>Since the decolonisation of Africa, the former colonial powers have continued to plunder and exploit these unfortunate people.  Our record in so far as aid is concerned is very mixed to say the least. On one hand, ordinary people have been extremely generous in their contributions to Third World organisations.  Many Irish people have given of themselves selflessly to try to alleviate some of the worst poverty in Africa.  However, this has been in stark contrast to the efforts of successive Governments who have contributed smaller and smaller percentages of our GNP to Third World aid each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to trace the history of the efforts made by countries in the West to help the Third World.  In the immediate post-war years it was very straightforward, because people were hungry and dying and we simply sent them food and money.  We did not question why they were poor and dying.  A few years ago we decided that the answer to the problems of the Third World was the development of trade.  Hence the slogan &ldquo;Trade not Aid&rdquo; was coined.  However, instead of making things better this in many ways made things worse. Increasing trade between nations is not <Col N="349" /> necessarily a good thing despite the conventionally held view to the contrary.  It should be realised that the real cause of the two major world wars was the issue of international trade.  There is nothing wrong with the concept of national self-sufficiency either here or abroad but the domination of world markets by transnational corporations leads to an ever-increasing impoverishment of the countries in the Third World and will inevitably end in the collapse of our economic system.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the ecological basis of life for humans, animals and plants is of primary importance, since this determines the wellbeing of a people.  It is only when industrial nations put a stop to their constant industrial expansion that they will be able to establish a new relationship with the countries of the Third World. The Green Party are strongly opposed to the type of development which favours economic growth at the cost of natural and cultural resources.  This type of development, together with the so-called aid to Third World countries, simply enables industrialised nations to further exploit and rob them of their lifestyles and natural resources.  Instead, we want to work together with the countries of the Third World in developing a new economic policy and relationship which will not fall victim to the world crisis.</P>
    <P>The Green Party have always been strongly opposed to the plundering of raw materials in Third World countries through military intervention.  Such intervention has plunged us into another inhuman and horrifying war which fortunately has now been brought to an end but not without a tremendous human and ecological disaster, the full extent of which has not yet been seen.  We support greater assistance for Third World countries with the aim of promoting their independent development.  We consider these people equal partners of a humanity doomed to destruction unless we can create a meaningful and endurable form of communal life for everyone on this planet.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the various ways in which we exploit the Third World.  Toxic <Col N="350" /> waste disposal is probably one of the most cynical activities which we have imposed on these unfortunate people.  I am glad this practice has now been brought to a conclusion but it is disgraceful that it was allowed to continue for so long.  As the House is aware, environmental standards are rising in the developed world as countries seek to avoid the worst dangers of dirty industry and address the problems of years of environmental mismanagement. This has resulted in growing pressure by Governments and communities to find a safe way of disposing of much of our waste.</P>
    <P>Stricter environmental standards have persuaded many industries to seek to expand in the Third World.  They also take advantage of the cheap labour in these countries.  We saw the results of this policy in the horrifying disaster in Bhopal in India.  Thousands of deaths took place in the immediate aftermath of that explosion, hundreds more die each year from the direct effects of it and many more will suffer for the rest of their unnaturally short lives.</P>
    <P>Another crime the West has committed against the Third World is the sale of outdated technology.  We lend them money to buy materials and technology but, lo and behold, a few years later we tell them such technology is out of date and downright dangerous.  This applies especially to nuclear power plants which are a source of debate in India at present. It will take India many years to pay for these outdated plants and they cannot afford to shut them down and develop safer ways of generating much needed power.</P>
    <P>We have been using the Third World as a source of luxury goods for many years either by killing off their animals for ivory and skin or looting their silver and gold, with no benefit to the inhabitants of these countries at all.  We have either corrupted them into obtaining the ivory and skins for us or herded them into townships where they live in unbelievable squalor and earn extremely low wages which just about cover shelter and food.</P>
    <P>Another area of exploitation is the export of harmful consumer goods.  It <Col N="351" /> grieves me very much that our country, through the export of mercury soap and powdered milk for consumption by infants, has contributed to so much suffering in African countries.  We in the First World also export out of date and inadequately tested drugs, the use of which is banned here.  If one looks at the other side of the coin one can see that these imports have to be paid for by exports.  Exports from the Third World are primarily raw materials, food and cheap textiles.  The terms of trade, that is, the relative prices of exports by Third World countries as against imports, have worsened very considerably over the past few years.  The growing of cash crops for export has resulted in major ecological disasters and famines throughout the Third World, in the destruction of the rain forests, the loss of irreplaceable top soil, the over-use of chemical fertilisers and the gross exploitation of people who work in appalling conditions for miniscule wages paid by transnational corporations who own much of the land in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Many giant corporations have invested in vast tracts of land which were sold to them by dollar-hungry rulers, often military, and privileged elite, involving the eviction of small farmers who had been living there and growing food for their own people.  The power of the US dollar means that in order to buy technology and manufactured goods poor countries are trapped into producing more and more food for export.  Out of the world's 40 poorest countries, 36 export food to the USA.  The Third World countries are forced to sell their goods at low prices and buy overly expensive products from industrial nations. This is the primary reason the Third World countries have such immense foreign debt.</P>
    <P>The most serious form of exploitation is moneylending.  We have become moneylenders to the Third World, with all its connotations.  A recent UN development programme report shows that 98 developing countries transferred a net <Col N="352" /> amount of $115 billion to developed countries between 1983 and 1988.  This is probably the worst exploitation of all. There is little prospect of debts incurred by these countries ever being repaid.  Certainly these countries have no moral obligation to repay the debts, as they repay them many times over in interest payments.  In reality we are in their debt because of the treatment of these countries over the centuries by the so-called civilised and developed world.  Third World organisations are calling for the writing off of these debts without any further ado, and the Green Party support this wholeheartedly.  These countries will never be able to stand on their own feet if the western banks keep them on their knees by these crippling repayments.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at possible solutions to the problems of the Third World.  The key undoubtedly is land reform.  By this we mean ownership and control of land by small holders and/or co-operatives who would be encouraged to grow subsistence crops.  These people could be helped with the kind of intermediate technology advocated by Schumacher, that is simple farm equipment such as a well-designed plough, access to water and low interest or interest free loans to facilitate the development of these farming enterprises.  The economic policies should be centred on settling as many people as possible on the land to avoid the horrendous urban slums now endemic in these countries.</P>
    <P>Finally, there can be no realistic hope for a stable world as long as the world's poor remain without hope and as long as the industrial countries east and west continue their fight for raw materials and markets.  What industrial nations choose to call growth is in reality a worldwide struggle of the strong against the weak, which in the end will result in the downfall of us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity of contributing to the debate on the Fourth Lomé Convention for a number of reasons, one of which is that Fine Gael have been to the forefront in encouraging overseas development aid <Col N="353" /> for some years.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, signed the First Lomé Convention when he was President of the Council of Ministers in 1975.  Since then we have always encouraged increased overseas development aid, not purely for political reasons but simply because of the necessity to address a very serious problem.</P>
      <P>The failure to address such a problem obviously has side effects and undesirable results, which I will not go into now because it does not come within the ambit of this discussion.  Suffice to say that developed countries have a moral responsibility to assist those who are less well off and less advantaged.  We should do so not by way of direct charity but by providing them with the means to help themselves.  That is the concept of the Lomé Convention and it is a very good one.  It is the old story, instead of giving the man or woman the fish they should be taught how to fish and to develop.</P>
      <P>It is easy to be critical of the Government's commitment in this area.  I know we have to work within financial constraints on an annual basis, but, notwithstanding all the competing demands, it is fair to say we could contribute a little more than we are doing at present.  When we compare the performance of the Government with that of the Government who were in power from 1982 to 1987 we will see a dramatic difference. From 1982 to 1987 the Government, even though there were serious pressing and competing problems at home, pushed out the boat, took their courage in their hands, decided there were people less well off than ourselves and contributed accodingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to comment very briefly on a number of matters that have already been mentioned.  For example, the Gulf War has been referred to on a number of occasions, and, you will be delighted to know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am going to make a passing reference to it. As a person who has been critical of US foreign and economic policy for many years, both inside and outside this House. I cannot understand the attitude of some <Col N="354" /> Members to the Gulf War.  It was a horrific war and there is no question but it will have an impact on poor regions.</P>

      <P>Democracy, as we all know, is a great thing, but one of its weaknesses is that peace cannot be declared.  Nobody declared peace on Saddam Hussein.

      <P>With due respect, I do not interrupt the Deputy.  If the Deputy listens he will find I am able to qualify what I have to say.  For example, last August I did not hear a furore about the hardship caused to the Kuwaiti people, and they suffered great hardship, which we will hear about shortly.  Some Members have spoken out previously in that regard.  It must surely be time to come back to reality and recognise that if a serious problem exists, as was the case for the past six monmths, there are two ways one can deal with it.  We can propose peace but we cannot enforce it. War is a terrible tragedy, as has been <Col N="355" /> shown many times in the past.  As I said in this House when we discussed the Gulf War, the loss of 100,000, 1,000 or 100 lives is a huge loss.  I am quite sure if anybody had suggested in 1937 or 1938 that a war would have resulted in the loss of 100,000 or 200,000 lives, there would have been shock but not many people advert to the fact that 40 million lives were lost in the war that followed.</P>
      <P>We must put the matter into perspective and ask whether you make the sacrifices in the beginning or later on.  I say that as someone who has been critical of American foreign and economic policy but, on this occasion, the Americans were right and we should not adopt an anti-American position on everything. Sometime, somewhere, everybody is right about something.</P>
      <P>All Europe has contributed to the spirit of the Lomé Convention and I hope it will continue to do so.  The United States has a similar agreement in relation to similar countries, and they have attempted to offload the negative aspects of their agreements on Europe, oddly enough, with the resultant hassle in relation to GATT and other matters.  If you decide to enter into an agreement, out of the goodness of your heart, with Third World or poorer countries and, following the imports which you decide to take on board, instead of consuming them in your own economy you decide to hive them off to other economies &mdash; in this case the European economy &mdash; while Europe is contributing, under Lomé, in a far better and forthright fashion, that should be highlighted.  If the US continues to formulate similar agreements it should accept full responsibility for those arrangements and should not expect the rest of us to carry the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Garland seems to decry economic expansion.  He was going into reverse gear because, obviously, we have more to offer by expanding economically. If we remained as we were 150 years ago we would be very poor relations in today's economic world.  Perhaps we might be able to get up in parliamentary <Col N="356" /> sessions and talk about it, but that would be the sum total of our input.  As a result of our connections, cultural or economic, with Third World countries we have advantages because they will benefit from such inter-changes.  Quite a number of Irish people have become involved in working in those countries in a very meaningful way and have made a huge contribution to the development of their economies.  Such exchanges are obviously beneficial to us in terms of bringing the seriousness of the problems which they face to our notice.  It also brings home to them the necessity to expand and develop and to provide for the future.  If we all remained in the same economic mould forever, as some people seem to suggest, we would have a very serious problem on our hands and very little to offer to Third World countries and little to gain from our relationship with them.</P>
    <P>A number of hand crafted goods have found their way to this country from Third World countries in the last number of years and they have, rightly, become very fashionable.  After all, the European Community has the money to pay for such items.  This is useful for two important reasons; (1) it obviously has a financial impact and (2) it makes us aware of the culture and heritage of the people in those countries and it give us a better understanding and appreciation of their abilities which has become more noticeable as a result of the Lomé Conventions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will take into account that, while we all appreciate their contribution to overseas development aid, it is not sufficient and leaves a great deal of room for improvement.  If they put themselves in the position of the people in the countries which were referred to during this debate, any caring Government must surely realise that the needs of those people are considerably greater than is evident from the manner in which the Government are responding at present.  I fully understand and accept that they have many competing demands but they must accept that this is also an important competing demand.  They must remember that there is an onus and responsibility on all developed countries <Col N="357" /> to accept a fair share of responsibility, acknowledging the problems which exist and drawing up a programme which will deal with them.</P>
    <P>In many of those countries democracy does not exist and, unfortunately, many of them will not, in the immediate future, be as democratic as they would like.  We can only assist and encourage; again &mdash; like peace &mdash; you cannot force democracy on anyone because then it is no longer democratic.  We should encourage, through our membership of the European Community, countries where there is a greater tendency towards democracy instead of countries where assistance &mdash; direct or indirect &mdash; would get to the armed force instead of going to the people in real need.</P>

      <P>I sincerely thank all the Deputies who contributed to this morning's debate.  In particular, I should like to thank Deputy Owen because she, in the course of her contribution, stuck mainly to the issue raised, the ratification of Lomé IV.  Many of the other contributions, while containing many valuable points of which, of course, I will take note, ranged over the whole question of Third World aid as distinct from the commitments the Community has through Lomé IV.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  A point raised by many Deputies, made strongly by Deputy Owen, is that Lomé has contributed enormously to the development of the ACP countries and Community relations.  She spoke of the former general secretary, Mr. Carrington, and I should like to be associated with her remarks.  I have know Mr. Carrington for many years, I worked with him and he was a very practical person who could have contributed much more to the agreement but for the fact that he decided to go elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully realise that I have only ten <Col N="358" /> minutes in which to reply so if I do not respond to some of the points I ask the House to forgive me.  In relation to the Gulf War many people have talked about the US.  The Gulf War was conducted as a result of UN resolutions.  The issue seems to have been raised because of the tremendous expenditure.  The Gulf War occurred because one member of the UN decided to try to take over a second. Today is not the time to elaborate on that but the fact that the action was taken by the UN as a result of Security Council resolutions and not by the US or Great Britain should be put on the record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins talked about person to person aid.  We all have a certain influence in our own communities and if each of us could encourage our cities, counties or the areas we belong to to twin with a community in the Third World, particularly in some of the countries in which we take a special interest, we could achieve a geat deal.  A number of communities in the country have done this already.  Doing this on a person to person basis, as Deputy Higgins said, we would be able to see the results of the aid and assistance we give to those countries.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about a foreign affairs committee which is to be considered by the House.  Deputy Connor is looking across at me now.  As a Senator he voted against the resolution put down by Senator Higgins, now Deputy Higgins, in relation to that Deputy Higgins's voice has been the one consistent voice in this House in relation to a foreign affairs committee.  Times have changed and they should change.  Deputy Higgins and I do not agree about everything let me say lest he thinks we do, and I will be saying something else to him very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen spoke about Namibia. As I said in my speech, we welcome the fact that Namibia, having achieved independence, sought and was granted accession to the Lomé Convention.  We reviewed the request in the context of the role played by Ireland and other member states in the lengthy process which led to a full, sovereign, independent and democratic Namibia state.  The Community <Col N="359" /> reaffirmed its intention to provide assistance for the future economic and social development of the country and I am glad Ireland was able to play a role in that because of our long association with that country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen, Deputy Garland and others, spoke about the environment and I am glad that has taken very special place because of the emphasis we put on the environment during our Presidency of the EC.  I was surprised at Deputy Garland's contribution.  Like Deputy Durkan I found it strange that Deputy Garland seemed to be advocating a policy that would take some countries back into the Middle Ages.  He talked about a specially designed plough.  How are we going to draw it?  I do not understand his reference to Ireland causing suffering in the Third World by sending powdered milk.  Maybe he has some connotations for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen was anxious that the Community try to monitor various environmental projects.  Environment impact assessment will be actively implemented in all eight programmes and I will take her suggestions on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I think there has been a big change in attitude even in the Third World and ACP countries themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come back now to the thorny question that ran throughout the debate, that is our own contribution.  We are paying the full figure we were requested in relation to Lomé and we are taking about Lomé specifically here today.  Our contribution will be considerable over the next number of years.  Let me refer to criticism of sending money to the Gulf region.  Deputy De Rossa and Deputy O'Keeffe described Egypt as one of the poorest regions in the world.  Approximately £3 million has gone to the people of Egypt for food aid.  In the light of Deputy De Rossa's and Deputy O'Keeffe's comments I fail to see why that action has been criticised.  On the other hand <Col N="360" /> about £300,000 has gone for food aid to the Sudan from the same fund and another £200,000 has been sent to other developing countries, including our priority countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins asked how we review the GATT.  I suppose I could talk on that for half an hour but, unfortunately, I have not the time to do so.  One of the lesser known objectives of the Uruguay Round is greater integration of the less developed countries to the GATT and the multi-lateral trading system.  As Deputy Higgins knows, trade is a major avenue to economic growth and development. The Community is and has been especially sensitive to the needs and demands of developing countries and is making real efforts in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked how Lomé aid might differ from that given by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  The third and fourth Lomé conventions laid special emphasis on agricultural co-operation and rural development, with an emphasis on food security.  The Community has been concerned to ensure that the ACP countries develop their own agriculture effectively and should not depend solely on the workings of the market.  Secondly, the STABEX and SYSMIN policies are unique to the Lomé Convention and have no parallel in either the World Bank or the IMF programmes.  They recognise the crucial importance of Community exports to all countries in the ACP and the need to protect them against excessive price fluctuations.  Thirdly, the Community gives nearly all its aid in the form of grants as distinct from the loans normally given by the IMF and the World Bank.  Fourthly, the Community is giving a small proportion of its investment for structural adjustment and is concerned to ensure that severe social consequences are taken into account in the design of any programmes from the beginning of the design.  This has been built into the process of policy dialogue which the Community has with all its partners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> In relation to Deputy Higgins's question about the Italian view of the emphasis being placed on quantity and the British view that trade is more important, the position is not as clear cut as that.  We took the view that both trade issues and the volume of aid are important.  In this regard we favoured additional concessions in agricultural trade which, as every Deputy knows, cause us some problems, and an increase in the resources which, as I indicated in my speech, are a 20 per cent increase in real terms.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Connor and Deputy Garland raised the question of debt.  The ACP debt to the Community is between approximately 1 and 2 per cent of the total debt, so we are talking about an amount which is exceptionally small.  The Council are examining the proposal from the Commission to cancel all ACP debt to the Community.</P>

      <P>I cannot predict what will actually happen there but ours will be a positive approach.  There are certain concerns in relation to some countries but our attitude is one of support.  I cannot predict the outcome of the examination but there is a lot of goodwill towards the proposal in many countries.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa spoke about the delayed ratification and said that quite a number of the ACP countries had not ratified the agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill which deals with a problem that needed to be addressed.  I welcome the Bill in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Bill is wide ranging in its application and it offers quite a lot of support and protection to the part-time worker. It will extend to part-time workers the benefits of the Redundancy Payments Acts, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, the Holiday Act, the Worker Participation Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act and so on. That is very necessary and I congratulate the Minister on bringing this before us.</P>
      <P>The Bill will certainly have repercussions in the marketplace.  I wonder if we will see the black economy being given a boost.  How will this be policed?  I suppose the Department will try to police it, but it will be an enormous task.  This will, I am sure, be a penalty on employers and I have no doubt that hard pressed employers will make an attempt to evade the cost penalties which might be involved for them under this Bill.  There are thousands of people looking for part-time employment which is in very short supply, in the provinces at any rate. Wives whose children are attending school want work for short periods every day.  Because of the poverty traps we hear about every day, these people are not alone anxious for part-time work but they need it to pay the bills, to clothe and feed their families and to keep them in shape to be able to get value for their schooling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth in this part of the economy has been dramatic in the past decade. The reasons are fairly obvious.  Many <Col N="363" /> part-time workers are unofficial and the Department have definitely closed an eye to the existence of this practice in some sectors of the economy to date, because they know there are sections of the economy that could not afford to pay official rates and have used a sort of black economy approach to survive.  Because our economy does not reward a number of sectors at the moment, we have difficulties of this nature.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the numbers involved in part-time work are likely to grow because it suits employers and, now that it is made official, some employers will get more involved in this area than heretofore.  It often suits employers to organise their workforce in a different way.  Part-time workers were frowned upon in the past; trade unions were not in favour of factories taking on part-time workers when they were trying to get full-time jobs for their members.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being debated against the background of the recently published <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There are very fine objectives and strategies in the programme but at this stage, I am afraid some of them have already missed the target.  The key objectives purport to bring about a substantial increase in employment.  The figures we heard a few weeks ago from the Minister for Finance are already out of date.  Last week it was confirmed that there are 243,000 people out of work, and that does not include people on social employment schemes and other courses who were taken off the live register.  The real figure is quite frightening.</P>
    <P>Last year every Minister told us they had beaten the unemployment problem, that the figures were coming down and would continue to come down, and that the future was rosy.  Now, nobody believes there was a modicum of truth in that.  The international economy was a little healthy and some inroads were made, but we can predict now that the next 12 months will be quite awful for us and any gains made in the past couple of years are likely to be lost.  We can predict <Col N="364" /> that the figure of 243,000 people unemployed will be surpassed and that we will have a mini-budget some time after the local elections to try to heal the wounds which have been created in the meantime. Generally speaking, the news reported in the press is beginning to get to people.  We have a problem with morale right across the country.</P>
    <P>Another objective in the programme relates to fair conduct in business dealings.  However, the Government are not doing a lot about that because people do not believe that justice is even handed. Not alone do they feel hard done by with the Government sitting on their back from the point of view of income tax and PRSI but they notice from time to time that people in high places who get involved in fraud seem to be above the law, and our laws are not able to cope with them.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on Tuesday and Wednesday last, as it has been suggested from time to time that the Criminal Justice Act is inadequate, but he failed to respond on either occasion.  He does not seem to understand this business and appears to be a very innocent individual who does not seem to know that we have a financial services centre across the road, that the banking business in the city has grown and that what we call white collar fraud, perpetrated through the use of modern technology&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Doyle) Acting Chairman (Mr. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the Deputy not to stray from the Bill which deals with part-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is central to the whole business of fairness and equity.  The Taoiseach does not seem to recognise that we will have more and more white collar fraud and this will do nothing but put more pressure on the morale of those who are struggling to pay their bills.  I hope the Government will take it upon themselves to ensure that there is equity and justice and gradually get off the backs of ordinary people.  I am not very familiar with the position in Dublin but the morale of workers in provincial areas is very low. <Col N="365" /> Nobody is satisfied with the amount of money they take home on a Friday evening and they put the blame on the Government who are taking far too much money out of their pockets.</P>
      <P>It is also quite clear that low technology work, which very often is the only work available in the provinces, gives a lower reward relative to other jobs.  As we have read during the past few days, a family with an income of £12,000 per year from employment is worse off than a family of corresponding size on unemployment assistance.  This is a desperate and unbelievable statistic.  On a quick calculation, £12,000 a year works out at about £230-£235 per week.  The people in my home town and in my constituency who are earning that kind of money are few and far between.  The normal wage is much less than that.  Therefore a huge number of people realised all of a sudden on reading the newspaper yesterday that they were selling their skills for peanuts. I have no doubt that they already suspected this but it was clarified for them in the press.</P>
      <P>What effect is this going to have on them?  Many of them will no doubt ask why should they bother or make an effort.  They will further ask why should they not join the dole queue, reap all the benefits and perhaps do part-time work on the side to supplement their income. I have no doubt that when people realise the position they are in they will find that option more attractive; in other words, the system we operate encourages dishonesty. I know of many young people who are working in low technology factories for a salary a lot less than £230 per week.  They start at a figure of £100 per week and gradually over a period of a few years their wages climb to £120 per week.  Not alone does the tax man take his slice but if, for example, they need a car to go to work their insurance bill will be horrific &mdash; a figure of £40 per week is normal.  Therefore the system bears down very heavily on the shoulders of our best young people, who have a great sense of justice, have loads of energy and who want to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we hear young people leaving <Col N="366" /> school talk about?  We hear them talk about the career they are going to follow. Not one of them wants to go on the dole. However, after six months or a year in employment we find that the system has destroyed their morale and seen to it that they will seek out ways to improve their lot; in other words, we are forcing people to become dishonest.  There is no incentive or reward for going out to work.  I wonder what the future holds for us in provincial Ireland where there are many low technology factories.  Over time wage levels will deteriorate with the result that we are going to face enormous problems.</P>
    <P>While this is not very relevant it does outline the background to the Bill.  Last week I met a young lad who told me that he had bought a car for £600 as he needed one to go to work.  He did not tell me what his wages were but I am aware that he is on a salary of £120 to £125 per week.  His third party insurance, even though he had never had an accident or a conviction was £1,545 per year.  On getting a full licence he went to reinsure the car but was quoted a figure of £2,250 for third party insurance.  That is a fact and I can prove it.  This kind of case proves totally destructive and it is not an isolated one.  The insurance companies have to take the blame for this because they are not managing that end of the business properly.  People in Ireland &mdash; I tend to say Dublin &mdash; have pseudo-accidents from time to time &mdash; two old bangers come together, an accident is reported and a claim is made to the insurance companies.  Even though no accident occurred the insurance company pay out thousands of pounds for a whiplash injury as they did not bother to investigate the case properly.  This is an absolute disgrace.  It goes on in Dublin as one can hide something in Dublin better than they can in the country but the investigation procedure in the insurance business has to be overhauled.  The insurance companies will have to take the responsibility for managing that end of the business and will have to work in co-operation with the Garda in straightening it out.  We find injustice everywhere.  The reason people have pseudo-accidents is <Col N="367" /> that they are not reaping any rewards in the economy with the result that they create their own rewards by whatever means.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government are aware of this, as the difficulty, once there are no rewards, is that one has come down with the heavy hand and force people to comply in a system which they do not want and which does not offer them the things that they want.  We have some ferocious problems to deal with.  Indeed, the Minister is doing one hell of a job and is working very hard in an effort to improve things for people who are being exploited, and there is no doubt that part-time workers are being exploited.  As I said earlier, quite often they are involved in the black economy where there is little reward gained.  A housewife, when offered a position, will run at it and accept 99p per hour for work for which other people are getting £4 to £6 per hour.  I doubt very much if this Bill will address that issue.  The economy will have to improve before we see any change in that area.</P>
    <P>While we have a huge number of people available for work, there will be mistreatment of both full-time and part-time workers.  Ruthless employers can exploit heavily.  Lower income earners on the PAYE system are probably too busy trying to make ends meet, to pay the mortgage and feed and educate their children to create much hassle for the Government.  They seem to be very docile.  They are organised mainly through the trade union movement but they are not making their voice heard where it matters most by using the ballot box.</P>
    <P>In these extremely tough times ordinary individuals vote the same old way year after year.  I saw this during the Presidential election in my own constituency when there was not a whimper of dissatisfaction, despite the fact that the farming community are feeling aggrieved because we did not get an equitable share of the extension of the severely handicapped areas.  We are a most amazing race.  Our noses can be rubbed in the <Col N="368" /> potholes and the mud and we actually say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;leave us alone&rdquo;.  It is an amazing trait.</P>
    <P>There is much exploitation throughout the economy, particularly in the area of part-time work.  This Bill will definitely help to tidy it up, provided its enforcement is policed to ensure that its provisions are adhered to.  I hope the Government will find some way of unlocking the energy of the nation and ensuring that the ordinary Joe Soap, who is very dissatisfied with his lot and is paying the bills of the nation as well as his own, is looked after and begins to feel that there is some justice.</P>

      <P>The acid test of any society is whether it looks after the vulnerable within its community.  This Bill dealing with the rights of regular part-time workers exhibits the fact that the Minister and the Government have a social conscience.  For many years the exploitation of part-time workers has been an absolute scandal.  I will not say that all employers have been engaged in it but a significant minority of employers have been engaged in what I could only describe as discriminatory practices against part-time workers.  Present legislation in statute law is inadequate to deal with this extremely serious social problem.</P>
      <P>I sincerely congratulate the Minister for Labour on this progressive and enlightened Bill.  It would not be an overstatement to say that this is the most enlightened legislation in labour law since the seventies.  Many people have asked why we require this Bill.  The question is, why not.  For many years the rights of full-time workers have not been applied to part-time workers and they have suffered as a consequence.  Many ask whether the State has the right to interfere in matters between part-time employees and employers.  The State has a paternalistic duty to interfere in every aspect of society when it becomes abundantly clear to Government that discriminatory practices exist and are being pursued with vigour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy of part-time workers over <Col N="369" /> the years has been that very often they were the most vulnerable people in society.  Often they were engaged in the services sector with low levels of skill and very low levels of pay.  A person employed for many years on a part-time basis could be dismissed by an employer without reason and without any consideration for that individual's rights.  It is only just that this should no longer be the case.</P>
    <P>When the threshold for part-time workers was reduced from 21 hours to 18 hours there were some unscrupulous employers who simply reduced to less than 18 hours the number of hours an employee could work.  These practices must be watched very carefully.  Most employers would not do such a thing, but a significant minority have exploited the position of part-time workers.  There is no good reason regular part-time workers should not have the same protection under the law as whole-time workers.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable increase in the number of part-time workers since 1977.  I understand the figure is now nearly 77,000 and this Bill seeks to address the plight of 20,000 of this number, 16,000 of whom are women.  It is tremendous to see legislation brought in to assist women who very often cannot work full-time because of family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>If I have a criticism of this Bill it is in relation to the 13-week period during which a person must be employed on a continuous basis working at lest eight hours a week before qualifying for the benefits in the Bill.  This provision is open to abuse.  In the tourism trade, for example, the high season is July and August, a total of eight weeks.  It is open to employers to take on part-time employees for 12 weeks and then let them go.  This would mean that the provisions of this Bill would be circumvented without adversely affecting the employer. The 13-week qualifying period should go and there should not be any qualifying period in respect of continuity of service. No matter how many weeks are specified, it is always open to abuse.  The best way <Col N="370" /> to eliminate the abuse is to eliminate the requirement.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties the Minister has faced.  He has had to balance the rights of the employers against the rights of the employees.  It was an extremely difficult thing to do and he has succeeded admirably in general terms.  It is of crucial importance that there should be flexibility within the terms of the Bill.  Without flexibility the possibility exists that the intentions of the Bill would not be achieved and more damage than good would come of it.</P>
    <P>There are four very good reasons that this legislation should go on the Statute Book.  First, there should be no discrimination against regular part-time employees; second, part-time workers are the most vulnerable sector of the workforce; third, every European country apart from Britain and Ireland, has such legislation, and forth, a small but significant number of employers abused the privileges which hitherto existed and did not treat part-time workers with the respect and dignity they unquestionably deserve.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable shift towards the services sector which, of course, lends itself to an increase in the number of part-time workers.  There is still a very serious problem in regard to the levels of pay in this country.  Deputy Cotter has referred to this.  I would like to express my concern on two areas; the exploitation of part-time workers should not be allowed to translate itself into the exploitation of part-time work.  By this I mean that part-time work should not be allowed to replace full-time work, where such opportunities exist, and on no account must this Bill be used by any employer to create more part-time jobs at the expense of full-time employment. This is always a very real danger in the workplace and we must be absolutely vigilant to ensure that this does not occur.</P>
    <P>There are employers in industry and other places of work who do not give a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  The Minister for Labour now or in the future will have to address the question of introducing a minimum wage across the broad <Col N="371" /> spectrum of the Irish workforce.  It is true, whether we like it or not, that a significant minority of employers, while making great profits for themselves, do so on the backs of people who are vulnerable and whom they do not remunerate adequately.  No society in this modern age can tolerate that.  A message should go out from this House that exploitation, discrimination and abuse of the workforce is something that will not be tolerated in the future and this Government and this Minister will look at the question of part-time or full-time workers being underpaid for the services they provide.</P>
    <P>This Bill exhibits yet again that this Government and the Fianna Fáil Party require no nudge from the extreme left or no push from the extreme right to do what is best for the Irish people.  I congratulate the Minister on this excellent legislation and sincerely hope that the progressive steps he has taken since becoming Minister for Labour will continue for the betterment of the Irish workforce, and in particular for the betterment of those who are most vulnerable and have been subject to discriminatory practices in the past.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are a considerable number of part-time workers and I sincerely hope that the aspirations which the Bill seeks to achieve will continue in future labour law in this country. I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party spokesman on Labour, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, stated that we will not be opposing the Bill on Second Stage.  We welcome the Bill, but we will be seeking to make some amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill addresses a very large problem but it highlights other problems that require attention by way of legislation or regulation.  I can give instances of some part-time workers who start work at 11 p.m. and finish at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.  For social welfare purposes this constitutes two days, and where their part-time work allows them to sign on for social welfare <Col N="372" /> benefit for the days they are not working, they are excluded in a very artificial way.</P>
    <P>We have a problem also with the eight hour threshold and we will be seeking to have that removed from the Bill.  A problem that arises in this context for the person who works for one hour per day and, again for social welfare purposes, because he has worked any time in a given day, he cannot apply for the three day week type of social welfare cover. We believe this is inequitable and should be addressed.  Obviously it cannot be addressed in this Bill because it is a matter for social welfare legislation.  However, I would ask the Minister to consider these points and to refer this problem for solution to his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Since the provisions of this Bill were made known, some unscrupulous employers have taken certain actions against their employees in anticipation of the legislation passing through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A case was referred to me this morning where a women had been doing domestic work for the same employer for 14 years but she was let go when there was publicity about this Bill.  I think that is a terrible injustice and the Minister will have to address the unfair and unscrupulous behaviour of some employers.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I got information about a major supermarket chain in Dublin who employ young boys for 17 hours per week, but they have now been informed that their hours of employment will be reduced to between six and eight hours per week.  This gross malpractice is being introduced in anticipation of the legislation. I would ask the Minister to look at this problem to see what means he can devise so that, in these instances, workers get justice.  It is very wrong, and I believe it is totally against the spirit of what the Minister is trying to achieve that such practice should continue.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with part-time employment in a more general way.  Part-time employment is a phenomenon of developed industrial societies.  All major industrial societies have a part-time workforce of between 15 per cent and <Col N="373" /> 25 per cent.  In all countries a greater percentage of women are in part-time employment, as much as 55 per cent in the Netherlands, compared with just 10 per cent for males.  In the UK the ratio of women to men in part-time employment is even greater, 45 per cent of women and just 4.6 per cent of men. This, along with the Netherlands, is the highest incidence of female employment being of a part-time nature.</P>
    <P>Across the Community part-time employment constitutes about 12 per cent of the working population.  For Ireland the 1987 labour force survey reveals 65,000 regular part-time workers of whom 47,200 were female, or 72 per cent of all regular part-time workers.  The majority of these women, 72 per cent are married.</P>
    <P>We know that part-time employment is concentrated in a number of occupations. Service industry workers make up 25 per cent, and this includes catering and cleaning workers.  Part-time workers in agriculture make up 19 per cent.  Commerce, insurance, finance workers, including shop assistants and bar staff, make up 16 per cent.  Professional and technical workers make up 16 per cent.  What is obvious is that we are dealing with a social reality of married women who have to work to keep their families.  The growth of unemployment and, in particular, long term unemployment amongst men, will force more married women to try to supplement the social welfare income received by their husbands.</P>
    <P>The magnificent struggle of contract cleaning women in securing a joint labour committee, after a lot of obstruction from employers, was a milestone in the recognition of the rights of part-time workers. These women were fortunate inasmuch as they had a trade union to fight for them.  This does not apply to a great number of part-time workers in rural Ireland and this problem will remain, particularly in terms of the eight hour threshold.  There is a huge area where unscrupulous and uncaring employers will be able to operate in such a way that the employees involved will not get the <Col N="374" /> rights the Minister wants to give them under the Bill.</P>
    <P>What we need to address head on in this Bill is the reality of a labour market with mass unemployment which we have. Any loophole in this legislation will be used by the unscrupulous minority to deny vulnerable non-unionised married women, who desperately depend on the income from part-time jobs, their rights and to put competitive pressure on the good employers who will be paying their full whack of taxes to carry the people who are avoiding paying.</P>
    <P>We need two instruments to prevent gross exploitation.  An hourly minimum wage on a scaled basis relating to age and application of benefits which full-time employees enjoy should be paid to all regular part-time workers and contract employees irrespective of hours worked. We come back again to the eight hour threshold.</P>
    <P>The question of a minimum wage needs to be addressed.  The Minister should have a separate Bill before the House later this year establishing a minimum wage as a statutory right if this Bill is to give effect to the intentions which the Minister has outlined.</P>
    <P>We believe that a minimum wage would have to be fixed in law on an hourly basis &mdash; not any weekly amount &mdash; so as to cover all forms of employment.  Our economic affairs spokesperson, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, has called for an hourly adult wage of £3.50 per hour and two-thirds of this amount to apply to those on a junior rate.  The latter is essential to reflect the established practice of those under 18 years of age being paid a proportion of a full wage.</P>
    <P>In all honesty, the need for a minimum wage for thousands of women involved in part-time work, who have no trade union representation and may be terrified of losing their jobs if they seek a pay rise, is a responsibility which we as legislators cannot avoid.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the speed with which the Government are prepared to change the law in relation to condoms, I would urge the Minister to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable in employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> They deserve the same urgency in their plight.</P>
    <P>There is a weakness in confining the application of this Bill to employees and I suggest that the definition of those who are covered be extended to include contract and casual employees who may be defined as self-employed for reasons which suit those employing them or the nature of the business they are working in.</P>
    <P>The other major change we will be seeking is the abolition of the hours threshold. I will instance two cases which have come to my notice where unscrupulous employers are already in there abusing this system and taking what they see as corrective action to protect themselves before this legislation passes into law. What is to stop the entire catering and cleaning services from doing the same as the major supermarket chain I instanced?</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that on the basis of simple supply and demand, high unemployment already permits employers to secure the maximum flexibility in the manner in which they offer employment.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to reconsider the hours threshold for two reasons.  First it can be used to create a new form of part-time labour which essentially will rely on exploiting the social welfare part-time work scheme, and will be used to displace some currently employed part-time workers who otherwise would remain in work.  Second, it can be used to effectively penalise the employer who does the right thing but cannot compete with those who deliberately circumvent the law and use cheap labour to undermine his business.</P>
    <P>Professor Charles Handy's predictions on future patterns of work in the UK, with one quarter of the labour force in part-time employment, one quarter in casual/contract employment and only one half in full-time employment, is one view of the future.</P>
    <P>Another view which appears a lot more attractive is that we are prepared to look at the issue of labour market flexibility, as it is called, from a different perspective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> We do not have to work on purely theoretical alternatives.  For example, Aer Lingus have a job-sharing scheme which in their current difficulties would seem to offer a much more acceptable form of controlling costs than resorting to redundancy.</P>
    <P>What probably will be dead in ten years is the 40-hour, five day week and the 40-year working life.</P>
    <P>In the context of the European Community, which is the wealthiest trading bloc in the world, I do not accept that full employment is a pipedream.  It will undoubtedly involve new patterns of work &mdash; a re-organisation of work so that those who want to work are allowed to participate.</P>
    <P>Part-time employment should be seen as simply one form of varying the definition of a job.  Similarly, work-sharing as practised to date, whereby two people share one job, will have to be expanded to include other options, with, for example, five people sharing four jobs, thereby creating a vacancy which could be filled by an unemployed person.</P>
    <P>The key here is incentives and a sense of fair play.  We are allowing the issue of new working arrangements to be simply driven by market requirements of particular businesses, when we could be developing through cash and tax incentives, socially beneficial forms of alternative work and work patterns to allow more people back into employment.</P>
    <P>I believe Ireland's unemployment problems cannot be solved simply by domestic policies but we can begin to face the issue of distributing work through a variety of measures which will begin to deal with the reality of fewer people having work if we insist on clinging to rigid, outdated working patterns.  If we can align ourselves with other peripheral regions in Europe to ensure that we get our fair share of increased investment and employment, then we surely have an obligation to redistribute work in society to overcome the unemployment crisis we are enduring.  By providing in law for <i>pro rata</i> conditions of employment irrespective of hours worked, we are at least given the possibility of the redistribution <Col N="377" /> of work to include the unemployed and give them a chance of getting off the ground.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to sound a warning note which ties into what I have been saying.  In the &ldquo;Cheap Labour &mdash; Britain False Economy&rdquo; document written by Peter Brosnan and Frank Wilkinson it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe, in assessing compliance with the terms of the European Social Charter, has singled out the UK, together with Ireland, for the extent of its failure to maintain a &ldquo;decent&rdquo; minimum level of wages.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill but in itself it will not solve the problem unless, as Deputy O'Donoghue said, legislation is introduced to provide a minimum hourly wage rather than a wage related to a week's work.  As sought by the Labour Party spokesperson on economic affairs we agree talking about £3.50 per hour for adults and two thirds of that sum for people under the age of 18 years.  We welcome the Bill but we will be seeking to amend it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of necessity, be brief.  I welcome the Bill but the Minister introducing it is no stranger to the indignities under which many part-time workers in our constituency labour and to the hiring and firing process which can in many ways be a very inhumane system.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures indicate that in the EC 12 per cent of total employment is part-time and that figure is growing. Ireland is at the lower end of the scale with between 5 per cent and 6 per cent, but it is rising.  There are multiple reasons for the growth in part-time employment. The change in work patterns and the change in the composition of the labour force means that many more women with family responsibilities are either remaining on in the labour force or are re-entering it in order to bring in more income to raise their families.  There is an economic pressure on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor that will possibly increase the number of part-time workers in the labour force is the part-time job <Col N="378" /> allowance introduced by the Department of Social Welfare.  This will materially affect the composition of the workforce over the coming years.  The main necessity for this Bill is to protect the rights of part-time workers, and as legislators in Dáil Éireann that is the least we should do.  Everybody, whether part-time or full-time workers, should be treated equally or at least on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  As we know from our own experience, part-time workers do not, in many cases, unless they are very highly skilled, receive just and equal treatment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Minister when reviewing the Bill on Committee Stage to look at the 13 week threshold.  Deputy O'Donoghue pointed out that many of the part-time workers work in the tourist industry and in most years the tourist season does not last 13 weeks.  When this Bill is out of the way I would ask the Minister to take a hard look at introducing a minimum wage.  It is badly needed to protect the rights of part-time workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a short contribution to the Bill.  This Bill, together with the measures taken by the Minister for Social Welfare, represents a balanced approach by the Government to protect the position of part-time workers.  It extends the application of seven sets of Acts dealing with protective labour law to a large number of part-time workers, mainly women.  I would like to refer to those seven areas.</P>
      <P>Under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, most workers are entitled to be given a written contract of employment.  This right to written terms of employment applies only to those who work for 18 hours or more per week.  If you work less than 18 hours per week you may, of course, ask your employer for a written contract but he is not obliged to give it.  One must look for at least 18 hours per week in order to benefit under the provisions of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, one must work 120 hours per month or 1,400 hours in a leave year in order to <Col N="379" /> be entitled to paid holidays.  For those under the age of 18 years the minimum hours worked is 110 per month or 1,300 hours in a leave year.  The hours requirement for holidays may make it rather difficult for part-time workers to have a statutory entitlement to paid leave.  In relation to public holidays a part-time or temporary worker who has worked at least 120 hours, or 110 hours for those under 18 years of age, during the five weeks ending on a public holiday, has the same public holiday entitlement as a full-time worker.  Anyone who works less than those hours has no public holiday entitlement.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, applies only to employees who have worked at least 18 hours per week.  There is very little protection against unfair dismissal for those who work less than 18 hours.  The Redundancy Payments Acts apply to employees who work 18 hours or more per week.  If one is under the age of 18 years the same protection is not extended.  In the area of maternity leave, expectant mothers have a right to 14 weeks maternity leave if they work 18 hours per week; if they work for less than 18 hours per week; if they work for less than 18 hours they have no statutory leave entitlement.</P>
    <P>The importance of this legislation is clear, and I compliment the Minister for bringing it forward.  Most Members in the House have personal experience of part-time workers being exploited by unscrupulous employers.  I acknowledge that the vast majority of employers carry out their business and treat their workers in a responsible and humane way but unfortunately there are employers who do not treat their employees in a proper manner.  I am delighted that we have the opportunity today not alone to pay tribute to the Minister and to the Government but to ensure that this legislation is in place as quickly as possible to protect the people who are most vulnerable. Despite the employment equality legislation of the seventies, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the <Col N="380" /> available statistics indicate that while women make up almost 50 per cent of the population they only account for less than one third of the full-time labour force but almost three quarters of the part-time labour force.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to reverse his decision to abolish the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission; his views on whether the continued widespread dereliction of Dublin city needs special measures to resolve it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to reinstate the commission.  Dublin Corporation have a wide range of measures open to them to control and to eliminate dereliction in Dublin city and to improve the amenities of the city through, for example, pedestrianisation and landscaping programmes. The new Derelict Sites Act passed last year, requires the corporation to take all reasonable steps to ensure that land in their functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site. The more effective powers under this Act will facilitate the corporation in taking action to prevent and remedy dereliction in the city.</P>
      <P>The Act provides for an annual levy, based on market value, on certain derelict sites and I intend that this levy will come into operation from 1 January 1992.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that under the urban renewal scheme a wide range of financial incentives is available to promote development and redevelopment works in the designated areas of the city which comprise some 400 acres.  To date, private sector projects valued at £212 million, including developments completed, in progress and in planning, have been generated by the scheme in Dublin in addition to the Custom House Docks project.  All of these developments will significantly contribute to the restoration of the physical fabric of the city.</P>
      <P>Under the urban improvement grants scheme introduced by the Government in 1989, grants totalling £993,200, matched by a similar amount from the local authority's own resources, have been paid to the corporation to finance a programme of works involving pedestrianisation, upgrading of footpaths, landscaping, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that it was a mistake to take on board only half the package left by the Government of which I was a member <Col N="386" /> and abandoning the Metropolitan Streets Commission which was the second part of the plan for refurbishment?  Will he accept that many of the derelict sites in Dublin city are in the ownership of the very authority which are supposed to be policing them, namely Dublin Corporation? Will the Minister accept that, even with the Derelict Sites Act and the Urban Renewal Act, Dublin will remain a city in tatters for many years to come unless powers are urgently implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, there have been considerable improvements in the aesthetics of Dublin City and Dublin Corporation have the power and capacity to implement the necessary improvements in the city centre.  The Deputy is on record as recognising the great contribution which the designated areas have made to the revitalisation and general improvement of the city; the process is ongoing.  It is worth bearing in mind that, in a few short years, Dublin Corporation spent about £2.75 million on pedestrianisation schemes.  That, together with the possibilities under the Derelict Sites Act which will become operable from 1 January next, will make a great difference. Substantial progress has been made and continues to be supported by the Government and the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that while the Urban Renewal Act and the designated areas under it is a success &mdash; and I am glad to have played a part in bringing that about as a member of a previous Government &mdash; we need more than just individual planning applications, for example, to develop the Dublin quays, Mountjoy Square and others?  Will he accept that there is a need for an overall plan and approach to some of our main throughfares if the city is to look even half right for the next century?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Deputy accepts that considerable progress has been made under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and I am thankful for his support in that regard.  It is interesting to note that, between 1975 and 1986, Dublin <Col N="387" /> Corporation did not receive one single planning application for development along the quays in the designated areas but, since then, there has been a considerable upsurge in activity.  As I stated, the amount of money committed, the number of developments in planning and the jobs created in that area have gone a long way towards relieving the dereliction which was very much a feature of inner city Dublin.  Thankfully, that is on the wane and we look forward to a revitalised and refurbished city centre.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to revise the arrangements for compulsory purchase orders by local authorities; if he will outline the steps he is considering to prevent or minimise planning blight arising from prolonged delays, and sometimes subsequent abandonment of CPOs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that compulsory purchase proceedings can be time consuming and delays can occur in some cases for a variety of reasons.  Although I would not accept that these delays contribute substantially to planning blight, I am having procedures exmained in my Department with a view to identifying any improvements which could speed up the process.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have adequate powers under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, to secure the clearance or improvement of derelict sites in their administrative areas and to ensure that they are rendered non-derelict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed the point.  The local authorities are the agents of the State in enforcing the provisions of the Derelict Sites Act but they are frequently the main culprits in offending against the aims of that Act. Will the Minister accept that in the Dublin city area much of the urban blight derives from the delayed road proposals <Col N="388" /> of the corporation throughout the city and that this has turned Dublin into a city of which many of its natives are ashamed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that natives of Dublin are ashamed of their city; in fact one has only to be a casual listener to any of the programmes on the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to recognise that Dublin people are very proud of their capital city, a pride which is shared by all citizens in the country.  I certainly share it.  As the Deputy knows, the CPO process has been there for a long time; it is a very complex arrangement which goes back to 1845.  Perhaps improvements in it could be contemplated and I would certainly be happy to look at that matter. However, I am not aware of any information on confirmed CPOs which subsequently were abandoned or not proceeded with by local authorities.  They are the people who are genuinely interested in developing public services and using the CPO process to do it.  There have been no undue delays although, as I said, the process is slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the words &ldquo;confirmed CPOs&rdquo; but he must know that, before a CPO is confirmed, it can take many years to get to that point. That is where the delays arise and, very frequently, before it gets to the confirmation stage, the corporation let the CPO lapse with the consequent ruining of streetscapes in our city.  I invite the Minister to visit James's Street with me to see the ruinous results of this sort of official lethargy.  Will he agree to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I will visit it in the company of the Deputy, but I might take the opportunity to visit it myself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the compulsory purchase process is very <Col N="389" /> clear; it falls into three main stages, action by the local authority which have to prepare many detailed maps, publish notices and contact interested parties to ascertain ownership.  Action is also needed by the Minister and the Department and, very often, a local public inquiry is necessary.  There is then action by the local authorities subsequent to the confirmation of the order.  This all takes time but it gives people an opportunity of challenging the order, within a certain period of time, in the High Court if they wish.  There is also the notice to treat and all this is done in the interests of the individual.  When you acquire property by compulsion adequate safeguards must be enshrined in legislation to give people an opportunity to challenge it so that it will be in the proper interests of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when the local authority decide to designate an area for a compulsory purchase order, all planning applications are refused?  It is a sure recipe for dereliction. Will he accept that the people who, unfortunately, live in the vicinity with CPOs hanging over it frequently must live with dereliction for many years, sometimes for 20 years or longer?  Will the Minister accept that there is a danger he will be Taoiseach before some of these things are sorted out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy tempts me. Essentially the CPO process is an enabling method for local authorities to carry out major works in the public interest such as roads, housing and open space.  In so far as the creation of dereliction is concerned, very often private developers take a very long time to assemble suitable sites for the development which causes the blight to which the Deputy referred.  I wish that those people would speed up the process and I would be helpful in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I checked my facts before I tabled the question and the Minister confirmed that I am right.  Will he agree that the whole area of house maintenance is a scandal, especially in the Dublin area, and that there is a case for abolishing the present form of maintenance which would have &mdash; or even quarter &mdash; the rents of the tenants who are so badly served by the present maintenance arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something in what the Deputy says.  I should like to confirm that the latest figures in regard to management and maintenance expenditure for 1989 is £65 million.  The total rental income for all authorities is £47.4 million. As far as Dublin is concerned, we estimate the total maintenance and management of the estates in the same year at about £30 million and the rental income £17.9 million.  The Deputy is right in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there is nothing in existing legislation to prevent authorities from doing the work by contract if they so wish, which is the subject matter of the Deputy's question.  In fact, a considerable proportion of work is now undertaken by <Col N="391" /> that method by the corporation and by other local authorities and housing authorities throughout the country.  I have no objection to them going that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that this problem is not caused because rents are too low?  Most certainly they are not.  I know of people in St. Michael's Estate in two-bedroom flats paying £35 rent, yet they can get no maintenance done.  They wait months and sometimes years for essential repairs. Will the Minister not agree that this is a classic case for privatisation and that something alarming is wrong with the maintenance services in our local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to two things there.  It is an interesting figure when one considers that, between remedial work schemes and the bathrooms subprogramme under the remedial works schemes together with the management and maintenance programme the Deputy referred to, £80 million will be spent this year.  Under a report going back to 1989 major changes in the organisation and operation of maintenance programmes were considered and promoted. It is a matter for the local authorities and they are not too happy, I understand, to go down that road, although it has to be said that in the 1990 Estimates a sum of £1 million was provided for the carying out by contract of routine maintenance by the corporation. Perhaps there is a change in attitude there and certainly the regulations allow for it.  I have no problem with it.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 78 of 26 April 1990, the preparation of a statement giving details of each of the 3,968 projects for which grant applications were made under the amenities-recreational facilities grant scheme would absorb a disproportionate amount of staff time.  In any event, this information might more appropriately be obtained directly from the local authorities whose responsibility it was to process the applications.</P>

      <P>The details of the 1,006 project which were allocated grants under the 1990 scheme were made known, but this is a separate question relating to the details of all 3,968 applications which were received from the local authorities, having been processed by them, and they were recommended for grant assistance.  It was not possible to give a grant to all of them.  When one considers that the total amount of money required to service the 4,000 or so would have been in excess of £160 million, not a bad job was done by the Minister in providing grant assistance to the 1,006 lucky ones.  Of course, we have a scheme again this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings including the provision of bathrooms.  While responsibility for the provision of bathrooms remains with authorities, I am making a special allocation of £2 million this year to assist them to tackle the backlog of work.  This provision is intended to supplement the expenditure of the housing authorities and to focus attention and effort on progressively eliminating this serious deficiency in their housing stock.  It will be in addition to the allocation of £16 million under the remedial works scheme under which bathrooms will also be provided as part of larger refurbishment works to substandard dwellings.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing bathroom or shower facilities, as appropriate, will vary from dwelling to dwelling depending on circumstances.  While it is, therefore, difficult to establish average costs, I understand that the cost can range upwards from some £1,000 per dwelling depending on the nature and extent of the work required.  As local authorities will continue to provide bathrooms from their own resources and as applications for the special funding are only now being received in my Department, it is not possible to state, at this stage, the number of bathrooms which will be provided this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of amenities, including bathrooms, in the housing stock were last comprehensively ascertained in the 1981 Census of Population which disclosed that some 159,000 permanent housing units did not have the use of a fixed bath or shower.  In the intervening years, this number would have been substantially reduced through the provision of bathroom facilities, whether grant aided or not, and the elimination of older substandard dwellings from the housing stock.  The 1991 census will provide up to <Col N="399" /> date definitive information on the position.</P>
    <P>Grants are not now generally available for the provision of bathroom facilities in private dwellings.  However, grants to assist in the provision of bathrooms may be available to eligible persons under the schemes of disabled persons' grants and special housing aid for the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the local authorities accept the figure of £5,500 to £6,000 as the average cost for a bathroom extension?  This figure is also accepted by the health authorities. Would the Minister accept that at the rate of £2 million expenditure per year, it would take 20 years to provide bathrooms in all local authority dwellings? Will the Minister agree that the situation is worse in the private sector and that we will enter the 21st century with tens of thousands of our citizens living in houses without the basic amenity of a bathroom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that one could provide a public sector inner city flat with that facility for about £1,000 but in a house it might cost up to £3,000 and the provision of a whole bathroom extension could cost between £6,000 and £6,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Averaging it out, obviously it will take some time to deal with the whole list but it must be remembered that this has been going on under the maintenance of local authority housing. A lot of that has been done over the years.  The £2 million in the sub-programme of the remedial scheme which I know is supported by all sides of the House is just a help to speed up that process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  This has been ongoing within local authorities in their refurbishment programmes and £2 million is an addition.  Out of the £16 <Col N="400" /> million for remedial works, about 75 estates are being catered for.  Unfortunately we have to spend that money on low cost buildings of 20 to 30 years ago. If we had that money to go in another direction it would make a difference to many other initiatives one could contemplate. I like to think that the House supports the remedial works scheme a £16 million, which includes bathrooms if deemed necessary, plus the £2 million sub-programme.</P>
      <P>In the private sector the figures in the 1981 census were substantial but since that time we had the improvements grants and about 10 per cent of all housing stock qualified under those schemes which cost nearly £200 million.  It can be assumed that quite a number of units of accommodation that did not have the basic facility would have qualified and have it under the house improvement scheme.  We will have to await the 1991 census to know the result of that.</P>

Is it intended to use the £2 million to provide bathrooms or showers as an interim measure in dwellings which are already listed for the remedial works schemes, but where the work under remedial works schemes may not take place for a number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the houses of a large number of elderly people lack these facilities and it was this which prompted us to continue providing special help to the health boards.  Very good work is being done in all health board areas in providing these essential facilities.  This work complements the refurbishing work currently being done in 75 estates under the remedial works scheme at a cost of £16 million.  We should never forget that the local authorities have programmes to provide these facilities in their own estates.  I isolated this £2 million as an added incentive to help these along and speed up the process so that, as Deputy Mitchell said, we can rid ourselves of that difficulty in as short a time as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that over half the cars on Irish roads are over five years old and that we have the third highest incidence of road deaths in Europe?  A strong case has been made by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry for the introduction of compulsory vehicle testing.  In 1988, 8,900 people were killed or injured on our roads. There were 490 deaths.  Does the Minister not consider that it is time to make a positive commitment to vehicle testing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard this case made before and I decided to check out some of the remarks made by the Deputy on a previous occasion.  Some interesting statistics have come to hand.  The biggest single factor in 90 per cent of road accidents is human behaviour, principally of drivers and involving speeding, drink driving and so on.  Vehicle defects cause or contribute to perhaps less than 10 per cent of road accidents, according to an EC study.  The statistics furnished to me by the Irish Insurance Federation suggest that third party insurance claims decline as the age of the insured vehicle increases.  The Deputy's argument does not hold water.</P>

Would he agree that this proposal could lead to substantial job creation?  Would he also agree that it is more urgent that ever, given the huge level of Japanese second hand car imports which are increasing the problem of the older car stocks?</P>

We have a programme involving a step by step approach.  Vehicle testing will be extended to light goods vehicles in 1994-5. When that is in place and we see how it progresses we can consider the extension of testing to private cars.  Statistics do not back up the view that vehicle defects are the primary cause of accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not every other country. A few countries have been resisting. Inevitably we will have to approach this matter over a number of years.  Heavy goods vehicles are now subject to a test and testing is planned for light goods vehicles in 1994.  After that we will progress towards reaching the target we would like to see.</P>

      <P>On the basis of statistical analysis the Minister says that less than 10 per cent of road accidents are caused by defects in motor vehicles.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a test carried out by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry revealed that steering defects constituted 30 per cent of the problems in cars and brake defects <Col N="410" /> constituted 37 per cent?  That clearly indicates that there are dangerous cars on our roads and the only way to get them off the road is by regular testing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be heading in that direction.  Deputy Bryne and I will not fight about this because we are at one in trying to reduce the level of road accidents. The various measures I announced last August which culminated in the ongoing drink driving campaign, together with a range of other measures which I intend to introduce, are geared to achieve a reduction in the number of road accidents. I am very supportive of the Deputy's attitude in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to wait for EC directives in this matter.  There is a pattern in these matters and it is wise to act in conformity with decisions which will apply uniformly across the EC.  That is the direction we are going in respect of a lot of other matters and it is a wise thing to do.  If an estimation of the care for our roads is to be found in the amount of money provided by a Minister or a Government towards road improvement and maintenance and if this can be used as a yardstick of commitment to the road <Col N="411" /> network, then Deputy Kavanagh should look into his heart.</P>

It has taken a great length of time to get sanction from Drogheda Corporation for a halting site.  There are 40 or 50 travelling families living around that town.  Is it not about time that the Minister gave a direction to the managers, because it is the manager's reserved function and not the elected representatives function?  The decision is vested in the county manager and they must and should get a direction from the Minister to provide halting sites.</P>

Having visited one of the traveller sites there, I have to say that very good work has been done and it could be repeated in some counties where there has been very little action.  I was taking an opportunity in the last month or two to visit some of the existing sites to talk things over with the groups not just locally but with the national organisations representatives of the travellers to find out precisely what direction they wish to go, and we are getting a consensus now. <Col N="419" /> There is no shortage of money available to the Minister to satisfy any requirements in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 35 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1 February 1990 the use of land for forestry, including afforestation, was exempted development for the purposes of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act.  That position was changed, however, by the regulations which I made to implement Directive 85/337/EEC on environment impact assessment, viz., the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 34 of 1989) and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990 (S.I. No. 25 of 1990).  Planning permission is now required for initial afforestation involving an area greater than 200 hectares, and for replacement of broadleaf trees by conifer species where the area involved is greater than ten hectares.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals for further changes in the application of planning control to afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="420" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down the question because I felt that the 200 hectare regulation was too extensive by far.  I would like the Minister to address the question of tree felling which blights the landscape and which developers do not subsequently redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the threshold of 200 hectares was chosen was that major forestry proposals that might have serious environmental impact would be brought under the control of the planning authority. Afforestation is much more closely controlled by the Department of Energy under its afforestation grants system. Perhaps the Deputy might pursue that matter with my colleague because that is the area he is getting as far as grant aid is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Creed.  In the West the 200 hectares is a very large area.  People who wish to plant trees can get around that by buying smaller portions and what eventually happens is that houses are surrounded by trees and the property becomes worthless.  There should be a far more stringent planning application for afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy supporting afforestation or is he against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have anything against the planting of trees.  I certainly have something against people planting trees up to where people are living so that whole family farms are surrounded by trees.  This is happening because there are no strict planning laws to stop indiscriminate planting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter might be better taken up with the Minister for Energy because the basic control for the type of afforestation the Deputy is talking about is undertaken by the grant assistance regime that exists.  If the afforestation department are not prepared to give <Col N="421" /> grant assistance, then planting will not go ahead.  We specifically wrote it in at the level it is so that if a large scale afforestation programme was being undertaken a planning application would have to be made at county council level, in the normal process, if it could impact on the environment to a significiant degree.  This works quite well.  There are difficulties in so far as the grant assistance for the smaller acreage s are concerned.</P>

      <P>In relation to access roads to forests, are there any charges imposed or are there any allocations made from the Minister's Department for access roads to forests in light of the fact that a lot of heavy traffic uses those roads and they are not really suitable for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We made some small allocations to a limited number of counties over a couple of years to deal with the break-up of access roads because of the forestry traffic.  I have to agree that those roads were never intended to cater for 30 tonners.  They were built to carry very light vehicle traffic, up to ten tonnes perhaps. It is a very serious problem and, unfortunately, I am not getting a lot of assistance from the Department of Energy by way of money to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>No, because roads are my responsibility and forestry is the responsibility of the Minister for Energy.

    <Title>Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The proportion of the female labour force, both full-time and part-time, which consists of married women has increased from 14 per cent in 1971 to 40 per cent in 1987; I think the most recent figures in 1988 show that figure increasing to around 46 per cent.</P>
      <P>An increasingly important source of income for married women has been part-time employment.  In 1986 for every married women working full-time aged between 25 and 29 years, five married women in the same age group worked part-time.  This Bill seeks to provide protection for this important segment of the labour force.  The measures contained in the Bill are long overdue and I hope that they will provide real protection for part-time workers in the future.</P>
      <P>The existing 18 hour limit has been clearly abused by a number of unscrupulous employers.  It was not unusual for employers to require part-time workers to work for 17½ hours a week, that is, just below the 18 hour limit.  As a result the employers did not have to pay the full PRSI contribution for the employee.  In addition the employee did not have the protection of labour legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill will ensure that part-time workers who are normally expected to work for at least eight hours a week and have completed 13 weeks continuous service with the employer, will enjoy the same protection of labour legislation as full-time workers.  I am sure this is welcomed by all Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of part-time workers has been broken down as between regular <Col N="454" /> and occasional part-time workers.  There has been a major and substantial increase in the numbers of regular part-time workers from 42,000 in 1975 to 70,000 in 1989.</P>
    <P>Part-time working is becoming a more permanent feature of the labour market. It appears that most women work part-time because of family responsibilities or because they do not want a full time job.</P>
    <P>While most male part-timers reported that they could not find a full-time job, 25 per cent of part-time women workers cited inability to find a full-time job as the main reason they were working part-time. It is clear that more people are employed part-time on a long term basis. These people are denied an entitlement to most basic protections which are afforded under labour law.  This Bill removes those basic inequalities and provides protection in relation to unfair dismissals, maternity leave, holidays and minimum notice of termination of employment.</P>
    <P>Part-time working suits employers and obviously in today's society it suits many employees.  It provides a wide flexibility to employers in changing market conditions and allows them to respond to changing demands.  It provides cost advantages to employers.  This is acceptable in the market society provided the employees are not exploited and as I indicated earlier, there is clear evidence that is happening in many areas because of unscrupulous employers.  The Bill will mark a major development in rooting out discrimination and exploitation by unscrupulous employers.</P>
    <P>The main reason women either opt out of the labour force entirely or opt out for part-time working is that they have to attend to child care and other family responsibilities.  These women must have regard to the extremely limited range of child care facilities which are available, the cost of arranging child care and the practical difficulties of combining homework and work outside the home.  If we are to have equality of opportunity the root problem must be tackled by the employers and the State.  Creche facilities which are urgently needed, would enable <Col N="455" /> women who wish to work in the place of employment to do so while their children are being taken care of.</P>
    <P>Employers expressed certain concern at the reduction from 18 hours to eight hours in relation to the cover which part-time workers will enjoy.  It is reasonable that, with an element of additional cost, employers would be concerned.  The FIE clearly recognise that we had to move in this direction to protect the people who were being exploited by a minority of employers.  They expressed the reservation that, in arriving at the eight hour threshold in place of an 18 hour threshold, they would have preferred if it had been done on a phased basis.  Nevertheless, they realised this step had to be taken and it is important that we say that.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been welcomed also in other areas.  For example, Patricia Donovan, Assistant General Secretary of the ICTU, said it was the most significant legislation since the seventies.  Equally, Sylvia Meehan of the Employment Equality Agency said that the Minister's achievement in introducing the legislation was a significant step in the direction of equality for women workers.  She noted that there were 20,000 part-time workers who would be directly affected by the legislation, 16,000 of whom were women.  It is important to note that there is a cost element for the State because there are many part-time workers, whether in the area of education or in health care, who will benefit from this new legislation.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation also takes account of the eight hour threshold currently being considered by the European Community in a series of directives designed to protect part-time workers.  I should like to say that the Minister is ahead of the pack here in relation to part-time work and I compliment him.  I appeal to the House to ensure that on Committee Stage there is no undue delay and that this legislation is passed as quickly as possible so as to give the necessary protection to the many people in the community who urgently need it.</P>

      <P>Did I have any alternative? However, your remarks are as charming as ever.  There are many cynical people out in the real world who may think the Bill on protection for part-time workers refers to TDs.  However, you, I and everyone else in this Assembly know that that is not quite the case and that on some occasions we work eight day weeks. I intend to make only a brief contribution <Col N="458" /> to this debate.  I congratulate the Minister on the practical and common sense approach he has adopted to the plight of the many thousands of workers who are caught in this trap.  Most of these workers are in the twilight or nixer zone.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Wallace said, no doubt there are many unscrupulous employers who are prepared to take advantage of these people who work only a few hours per week, but many thousands of workers have also benefited from this system.  I am glad that such workers are being given recognition, and will be welcomed into the social welfare system where they will be entitled to avail of the substantial benefits in that area.  This is a practical, long overdue measure.  I applaud the Minister on his proposal to include part-time workers in the system. Many part-time workers are hard pressed mothers who need the extra work.  I accept that many men work part-time also but generally speaking most part-time workers are women.  I welcome the practical move being taken to include them in the social welfare system so that they will have access to the benefits in that system.  I congratulate the Minister on his common sense approach to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have felt for some time that there is a need to put in place legislation which will protect part-time workers.  There has been much discussion on the issue of part-time work. Indeed I had the opportunity to speak in this House in May of last year on this issue.  My thinking on this issue has not changed since, that is, that we, as legislators, should put in place the necessary legislation which will protect workers right across the board, particularly in areas where there is a recognised need for appropriate legislation.  Prior to the introduction of this Bill there was no legislation dealing with the conditions of part-time workers.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was clear from the Minister's opening speech that much research and study has been undertaken into the plight of part-time workers.  The Minister referred <Col N="459" /> to all the figures and statistics available and I do not intend to go over them again other than to say that women in the age group of 25-40 years account for approximately three-quarters of all part-time workers.  I will refer later to this interesting statistic.  I have listened to almost all the speakers who have contributed to this debate.  Most speakers suggested that the absence of legislation in this area can lead to abuse and exploitation.  That may be correct.  Some speakers gave the impression that there are many big, bad employers who just want to abuse and exploit employees and that all part-time workers are abused and exploited, have poor working conditions, no holidays, low pay and so on.  That is not so.  I appreciate that certain employers will abuse any system &mdash; there will always be an element of this &mdash; but many employers are very fair, and treat their part-time workers very well and give them an opportunity to participate in the work place.</P>
    <P>This Bill will put in place a balanced framework for employees and employers as it recognises economic trends, market demands and the need for part-time workers.  I believe most Deputies are familiar with the Blackwell report which deals with the changing role of part-time work in Ireland and its implications.  That report highlights the need for legislation and refers to the developing trends in the area of part-time work.</P>
    <P>An IPA Personnel Management Conference held in Jurys Hotel yesterday dealt with the impact of changing employment patterns on manpower policies.  Dr. Catherine Hakim presented a paper at that conference in which she stated:</P>
    <P>Ireland is thus one of the EC countries with scope for a dramatic increase in part-time employment in the 1990s, reinforced by rapidly changing attitudes to working women, and by Ireland's reducing the eligibility threshold from 18 hours to eight hours (the threshold recommended by the EC for the Community Social <Col N="460" /> Charter).  While it may be hazardous to identify a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; rate of part-time work, the evidence of Table 2 suggests that a 20 per cent rate for part-time work nationally, rising to double this level among women, constitutes a natural plateau beyond which there are only minor further increases.</P>
    <P>This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that part-time work is predominantly a preferred option, particularly among women, in Ireland. Involuntary part-time work has, if anything, been declining.</P>
    <P>That is a very significant statement.  The Bill now before us deals with the development during the nineties to which Dr. Hakim referred and also defines regular part-time work.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the threshold of eight hours.  Dr. Hakim adequately covered the eight-hour threshold, the threshold recommended by the EC for the Community Social Charter.  I believe employers would find it very difficult to abuse the eight-hour threshold.  I support the threshold of eight hours and the 13-week requirement, which is in line with Community thinking.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised to hear the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, saying that the Minister, in recognising part-time work, had thus abandoned the notion of full-time employment.  I believe most people will appreciate that that is rubbish.  He also referred to the Minister's comments in relation to the FIE's belief that part-time work would lead to more efficiency and greater competition in the market place. Deputy O'Sullivan said that this would not be the case.  He said that the only people who would benefit from the growth in part-time work would be the employers and it was regrettable that in the years from 1975 to 1989 there was a growth of 10,500 part-time workers in the work place.  I am surprised that Deputy O'Sullivan as Labour Party spokesman on Labour regrets the creation of 10,500 jobs.</P>

      <P>I am speaking through the Chair, as you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I regret if I am upsetting Deputy O'Sullivan.  I have one or two other things to say.  This Bill is a very progressive step.  It addresses a need in the workplace.  What surprised me were the comments of the Labour Party on the Bill.  They questioned many aspects of it and quoted figures for the period 1975-89. That is on the record.</P>

      <P>In 1981 and 1982 Deputy Liam Kavanagh was Minister for Labour. He was kicking up a rumpus at Question Time today about the developments being made by the Minister for the Environment. The figures mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the period 1975-89, but Deputy Ruairí Quinn was Minister for Labour during the period 1983-87, and one has to ask what did these people do for part-time workers when they were in that position.</P>
      <P>One of my colleagues referred to Patricia Donovan, the Assistant General Secretary of the ICTU.  He said she recognises the Bill before the House as being one of the most significant pieces of legislation since the seventies.</P>

      <P>I am simply indicating that we have before the House a framework that will assist both the employee and the employer in relation to part-time work.  I am also indicating that in the past there were opportunities for people to introduce such legislation but they did not avail of it.  Yet today they are happy to come into this House and quote figures and facts as far back as the time they had an opportunity to do something about the matter.</P>
      <P>I would refer to another previous speaker, Deputy Fennell, who mentioned women in the workforce.  I support what she said in relation to women's role in the labour market and the need for a lower workload when their children are young; but I do not agree with her comments on cheap labour, exploitation, vulnerable people and particularly the State colluding with such exploitation.  Other speakers made similar comments.  One would think that part-time workers are victims.  To that I say, what rubbish. Deputy Fennell guessed that most women part-time workers are widows, separated or deserted wives, but I disagree. What about the unmarried working mother?  I also know many married part-time working mothers.  Indeed, my own wife works part-time and it is suitable for us that she can continue to have an input in the workplace while also giving time to our two young children.  I know this position is ideal for many of my other young married colleagues where the male has his role to play in the house and in the workplace and the female partner would like to have an equal opportunity and to keep her place in the workforce.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with anything the Deputy has said, but it is starting to sound like special pleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy does not disagree with what I have said so far. Statistics show that about three-quarters of the women who participate in the part-time workforce are in the age bracket 25-44 years.  Would one agree that this tallies with the child-bearing years? Maybe during these years part-time work suits most mothers.  As I have indicated, they can continue to have a role in the workplace and also look after their young children.</P>
      <P>This legislation covers maternity entitlements of part-time workers.  I would like to refer to the suggestion of Deputy Shatter that maternity benefit be extended to adoptive parents.  I would go a step further and suggest that it also be extended to foster parents.  I wholeheartedly concur with the Deputy's suggestion in that regard.  I know a number of people who have adopted children and there is very little difference in the role of a mother of an adopted child and that of a mother looking after her own child.  Adjustments need to be made and it would be of great benefit if the Minister would favourably consider the proposal to extend the maternity benefit to both adoptive and foster parents.</P>
      <P>I recall one speaker asking for a three to four week benefit for the father, but I do not agree with that.  I see Deputy Shatter smiling.  Perhaps fathers could be given benefit for one or two days, but in the present economic climate I think most people would agree it is a non-runner. If that is the Minister's thinking on paternity benefit I concur with that. I would like to deal with the measures introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, to extend social welfare benefits to part-time workers.  Most people have covered that aspect, and of course it is particularly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome this progressive legislation.  It is in keeping with <Col N="465" /> our progressive Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  He has been to the fore in introducing labour legislation, notably the Industrial Relations Act, 1989, and the Safety.  Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and of course he has had an input into the very much recognised <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as well as the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> His attention to legislation and all policy matters with a social conscience and his concentration on addressing those most in need is very laudable.  I wish the Minister and the Bill every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to briefly respond to Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan's contribution to the debate.  I am sorry he raised the hoary old chestnut of the possibility of having full-time paid work for everyone on the basis of, say, a 39 hour week.  This is a total non-starter which I would have thought everyone in the House realised by now.  I accept his point that part-time workers have been exploited by employers because they are more difficult to organise through trade unions and perhaps because they are less interested in fair employment because it is not a full-time job.  However, we want to progress beyond this concept.</P>
      <P>The Green Party concept of work, particularly in the context of married people, is towards a situation in which husband and wife would job share and contribute to bringing up children and running a home.  This is the kind of road down which we should be going, not trying to create full-time jobs for 240,000 people; it just cannot be done.  Proper protection for part-time workers is very much part of the Green Party policy because those workers are a vulnerable &mdash; and increasingly important &mdash; section. As we know, more and more people are now employed on a part-time basis and this should not necessarily be seen as a bad thing, as Deputy O'Sullivan seems to think; it should be seen as a good thing, provided there is adequate protection for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment legislation of this kind <Col N="466" /> would be needed in a more rational economy where a citizen did not have to rely on waged labour for his income; this is another aspect of Green Party policy. The situation where income is derived only as a reward for work is an anachronism and has led to the creation of a two-tier society with comfortably employed, if heavily taxed, people on one side and economically marginalised people on the other.  It has also led to the bureaucratisation of society as we desperately try to come to terms with an irrational arrangement regarding the distribution of wealth.</P>
    <P>Although we support this kind of legislation as a short term measure, we recognise that this Bill will lead to an increase in bureaucracy and, therefore, a further lessening of freedom in society.  It may also have the side effect of increasing the vulnerability of part-time workers as employers will tend to get rid of them in an attempt to sidestep their legal obligations; otherwise they will still further reduce their hours.  For example, what is to prevent an employer, instead of employing one person for 15 hours, from employing two people for seven hours? This is the trouble.  Where will it all end? We do not know.  One would have to have strong faith in the capitalist system to rely on the good faith of employers in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the long term, the Green Party look forward to the freeing of the whole labour market as a result of the payment of a guaranteed basic income to each citizen as of right instead of the grudging and inadequate social welfare system which exists at present.  If we had such a system there would be no need for this kind of legislation since people would have basic sustenance, independent of their employment, and would be much freer to move between different types of work, such as work in the home, full and part-time work, further education and so on.  In this connection I call on Deputy John Bruton to make his stand on basic income known to the House as well as to the national media.</P>
    <P>There is an unfortunate and glaring <Col N="467" /> omission in this Bill &mdash; to make an exemption for small family firms.  This Bill, if passed in its present form, will place another crushing burden on small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy, and which have much greater potential for employment creation than the larger firms, particularly the multinationals which come and go when the humour &mdash; or the tax climate &mdash; takes them.  It is notable that equivalent British legislation, the Discrimination Act, 1975, which was implemented by a Labour Government &mdash; please note &mdash; specifically excluded firms employing fewer than five people from the provisions of the Act.  It is absolutely essential, for the survival of these small businesses, that a similar provision is built into this legislation.  I call on the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider an amendment in this regard; if he will not accede to my request, I will certainly table an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is one of the most progressive pieces of legislation to have been introduced in the House for some time.  I congratulate the Minister for introducing it and on the matter in which he got broad agreement right across the board from employers, trade unions and various groups.  It is in keeping with this excellent record with trade unions and employers that he has been successful in reaching a consensus on this issue.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the definition in the Bill of a part-time worker and the change in emphasis from the hours worked to wages.  It closes a loophole which was used by employers to pay very low wages to stay below the statutory limits.  Because of this change there will be less exploitation of young people, female workers in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the legislation has been quite clear for some time and there has been a number of debates on the matter. Indeed, the Minister pointed out, in introducing the legislation, that there had been an increase in the number of regular <Col N="468" /> part-time workers.  More particularly, he placed emphasis on the sectoral composition of the part-time workforce.  The significant figures, adverted to by a number of speakers, were those he quoted in relation to the number of women part-time workers.  He said that the figure was 70 per cent, 70 per cent of those workers were married and almost 80 per cent were in the 25 to 64 age group. These figures are very significant and have serious social implications.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of people referred to the fact that the surveys suggest that quite a high proportion of women who work do not do so from choice but from economic necessity.  That should be seriously considered, not just by the Minister for Labour in this legislation but by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare.  The fact that so many women are forced to work in a part-time capacity from economic necessity, must be seriously addressed.  We must again look at our attitude to women in the home and in the work place in the context of our social welfare and tax laws.  We have a very good social welfare system, indeed recently some people have said it is too good.  Yet there are people who are forced by economic necessity to go out to work.  Our system should be geared to assist the role of the homemaker.  Lest anybody accuse me of being sexist, I stress the homemaker can be male or female.</P>
    <P>In our Constitution we put the family in a very special position, but after that we pay just lip service to the role of the family.  The need for a good home environment has been well established and we as legislators should try to help in that regard as much as possible.  We should examine again the whole area of payment for stay-at-home spouses and the recent suggestion that the person who stays at home should have a right to half the wage packet of the principal earner in the family.  Why does our social welfare system not allow for a lump sum payment to a family rather than providing that the principal person gets so much and the dependant, usually the wife, gets a lesser amount?  The system should be adapted <Col N="469" /> so that there is a single payment for a married couple plus the child allowances in respect of the child dependants thus not discriminating against those who want to stay at home.</P>
    <P>Those who really want to go out to work part-time are well covered by this Bill.  It is a major advance and will protect part-time workers very well.  They will now have the full protection of the social welfare system in addition to that of this new labour law which will enhance their status and assist them greatly.  The legislation will also benefit employers, giving them greater flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.  Various sectors have different needs at different times of the year with seasonal work and some at different times of the week.  The legislation will give the employer greater freedom which in the changing market circumstances is absolutely necessary, but it is equally necessary to protect employees from exploitation.</P>
    <P>Reservations expressed from the Opposition centre on the possible cost to employers.  The main point made in the debate was a danger that as a result employers would be put out of business and profits would be affected.  I do not regard that as an argument against the Bill.  Are the people who put it forward suggesting that exploiting people is an acceptable way of maintaining employment or making a profit? I for one cannot accept that argument.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes a long way to reducing the black economy, is very desirable socially and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for contributing to this Second Stage debate.  The Workers' Party Private Members' Bill and this Bill have given rise to considerable debate and we have had considerable airing of the legislation.  That is no less than it deserves because of its importance to the workers concerned and because of the signal it provides that economic and social measures will proceed in an integrated fashion under this Administration. While some matters have been put down <Col N="470" /> for Committee Stage, there has been a fair degree of consensus on the content of the Bill.  Leaving aside the question of a statutory minimum wage and other equally important issues relating to continuity of service, to which I will return later, there is a very considerable degree of support for my proposals.  There are, of course some Government amendments, largely consequent on the recent changes in social welfare regulations, which I will also put forward.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Rabbitte indicated a preference for the inclusion of a provision for a statutory national minimum wage in this Bill.  Low pay is usually associated with certain sectors of industry and services where part-time workers also predominate.  I can understand how in that context the point has been raised here, but it is as well to recognise where the debate on a statutory minimum wage currently stands.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions proposed in the course of the discussions on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that there should be a statutory national minimum wage.  The employer organisations stated their total opposition to this proposal.  It has been agreed that during the period of the programme the Employer-Labour Conference will consider all the issues involved, including the operation of a joint labour committee system, in regard to a statutory minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my part, I have made my policy clear.  Much low paid work tends to be unskilled, requiring few qualifications, with little or no prospects of promotion and subject to high rates of labour turnover. As a consequence, measures to comprehensively tackle the problem must therefore cover a range of areas such as education, training, social benefits and taxation as well as the question of pay.  Research carried out for my Department on the economic effects of minimum wage legislation concludes that such legislation could reduce employment levels.  According to this research the effects of this reduction would be concentrated most severely on particular vulnerable groups such as young workers, <Col N="471" /> women and the least well educated and, I would venture to say, part-time workers. The research also indicates little connection between low pay and poverty as many of the low paid do not come from low income households.  A statutory minimum wage is therefore regarded as being an ineffective anti-poverty measure.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of the Employer Labour Conference examination, it is my conviction that in attempting to address the low pay problem we must look at all the factors associated with low pay and the categories of workers involved.  As far as pay determination is concerned, I still incline to the view that the best approach is through collective bargaining operating in conjunction with the joint labour committee system.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have reflected a concern which has been mentioned by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, that is, the growth of non-standard forms of employment, including contract work and agency work.  Deputy Shatter recalled the Congress request that the Bill be amended to incorporate its own definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, but his principal concern would seem to be with categories who are employees for all practical purposes but described otherwise &mdash; for example, as self-employed. Deputy O'Sullivan gave specific examples and so too did Deputy Ahern; Deputy Martin expressed concern also about such developments.  There is a number of issues involved in this area and it is useful to tease them out.  First, I believe that the situation about agency workers needs to be examined.  While we cannot read too much into the statistics, the fact that there has been a progressive increase in the number of agencies registered by my Department in recent times has signalled the need for a review.  I have accordingly undertaken in the PESP to examine the position of agency workers and the legislation relating to the control of employment agencies.  That review will take up some time and I do not consider that we should hold up this Bill on that account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> Second, there is the question of the nature and extent of change in relation to contracting.  Some people believe that there has been a dramatic increase in subcontracting of production and services from enterprises to subcontractors; the evidence for this is often anecdotal and often relates to the same small number of high profile examples.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the point that within the framework of subcontracting practices vary.  For example, the workers of Bord na Móna's autonomous enterprise units, although they act as contractors, remain the employees of the board and as such are within the scope of labour law.  My impression is that for reasons of production and markets strategy companies are in the process of decentralising or rationalising and jobs are being devolved. Catering, cleaning, transport and security are well known examples.  The point is, however, that many of the workers in these jobs remain employees &mdash; employees of the new subcontractors perhaps, but employees nevertheless, and fully protected under labour law.  I cannot deny that there are also those who become, or are made to become, self-employed as a result of those strategies. There is nothing new about this, nor is there anything intrinsically wrong with it.  It is a practice which has been happening for some long time.  My concern would be with what I might term &ldquo;bogus self-employed&rdquo;; workers close to the black economy, freelancers without the responsibilities and the rights either of workers or of the self-employed.  We are continuing to gather information about the extent and location of this category, not just because of concerns about labour law but also because of responsibilities <i>vis-à-vis</i> tax and social security.  It is not a matter, I believe, of focusing on their situation under labour law, less so under a Bill which deals with part-time work.</P>
    <P>However, the issues raised are relevant to my labour legislation programme for the nineties and, as indicated, I propose to start with the situation of agency workers.  Taking up a point made by Deputy Hillery on the relationship between policy formulation and the <Col N="473" /> research conducted within our academic community.  I would hope to get more hard information on the extent, causes and consequences of non standard forms of employment.  We can do that over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, in his contribution to the debate, asked me to respond to the suggestion by Congress that the Redundancy payments Acts would provide a more appropriate mechanism than the First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act for calculating continuous service.  Deputy Rabbitte indicated concern that unscrupulous employers would use fixed term contracts to avoid obligations imposed by this Bill. He suggested that we should take on board the Congress idea or, alternatively, import from social welfare legislation the notion of cumulative service &mdash; for example, 13 weeks service over half a year.</P>
    <P>I had indeed looked at both these suggestions.  It is true that the Redundancy Payments Acts provide that where an employee who has less than 104 weeks' service is dismissed by reason of redundancy, and is re-employed within 26 weeks, both periods of service are reckonable and continuity is preserved. However, this does not apply where the dismissal consists of the expiry of a fixed-term contract.</P>
    <P>The problem I see with Deputy Rabbitte's idea of accumulating service is that this would result in obligations being imposed on employers in situations where there has been a genuine dismissal and subsequent re-employment and not just in cases where unscrupulous employers are trying to avoid legal requirements.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is necessary to amend the Bill in this respect, principally because the First Schedule is already widely used and has proved in practice to be an effective mechanism for calculating continuous service and any disputes which might arise can be dealt with by the Employment Appeals Tribunal. However, I will continue to look at this issue and may return to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> There has been some criticism of the retention of thresholds.  In a perfect world one would dispose of thresholds.  But the reality is that labour laws, the mechanisms set up to ensure that these are observed and that people can exercise their rights under those laws impose costs on employers, on the Exchequer, and on society generally.  In deciding on how far I should extend this social policy measure I had regard to several factors.  First, as I have already explained, is the position of the Social Affairs Commissioner, who has maintained an eight-hour threshold in a number of her recent proposals.  That is the suggestion.  It may not be as low as eight.  Second, I have had regard to the numbers of hours which part-time workers work, according to the Labour Force Survey, and I have pitched the level at that point which brings in a very high proportion of those currently excluded and accounts for 91 per cent of the man-hours worked by those working less than 18 hours per week.</P>
    <P>In the wide consultations which preceded publication of the Bill it was emphasised time and again that the notion of entirely removing thresholds would give rise to problems out of proportion to the benefits achieved.  I do not agree with those who argue that, because employment protection legislation represents a cost to employers and a possible disincentive to hire, we should in present circumstances look to deregulation or even retrenchment.  But in further developing our labour laws there is a very definite onus on me to have regard to their likely impact on labour costs and particularly to stop short of measures that give rise to administrative costs which are out of proportion to the likely benefits.  It is certainly the case, as Deputy Rabbitte points out, that studies such as those of Dr. Eileen Drew indicate that customer service rather than labour cost is the motivation for recourse to part-time workers in some instances, but there is also evidence that labour costs play a role.  I do not accept that in our present circumstances one is justified in moving below eight hours.</P>
    <P>My consultations revealed that there <Col N="475" /> has been a practice of setting working hours just below the current 18 hours in order to evade certain responsibilities under labour and social security legislation. This is not so widespread that it shows up as a major feature of official statistics but is nevertheless a very definite practice in some quarters, as Deputy Browne points out.  In striking a new threshold of eight hours I was motivated by a desire to minimise the possibilities of this being repeated.  My assessment is that for operational and administrative reasons it would not be in the interests of the employers concerned to adjust hours and workforce to evade labour law obligations in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte is quite correct where he says that the power given to a Minister in section 1 (3) (b) of the Bill could result in theory in the threshold being moved up as well as down.  It is more likely to move down.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Shatter, Deputy Ahern and Deputy Fennell, spoke about parental leave and adoptive leave.  In the context of this Bill I interpret their remarks as primarily a matter of getting on the record a desire that statutory measures should be introduced generally in place of the present arrangements.  I do not interpret their remarks as a proposal that leave should be introduced exclusively for part-time workers.</P>
    <P>The question of making a statutory provision has been considered on a number of occasions in recent years. However, in the context of other social priorities it has been considered inopportune to introduce statutory provisions, but I intend to keep the matter under review.  I would also like to reassure Deputy Wallace that our work about the development of child care services as an integral part of the work-place is continuing and that I hope to announce fairly soon some concrete measures in that regard.</P>
    <P>Some concerns have been expressed by Deputies Shatter and Ahern that the provisions of this Bill could force people into the black economy or that it can have <Col N="476" /> the other effect.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Shatter that the fact that people are more likely to have entitlements will mean that they will opt out of the black economy.  I disagree with the view put forward by a number of Deputies that this will enlarge the black economy.  There are many good arguments to be made, which I will perhaps go into next week.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a view that advanced statutory protection increases the gross costs of labour or the employer's long range commitment and future costs and that for this reason there will be greater recourse to the informal sector, sometimes with, sometimes without, the workers' concurrence.  Nobody can deny that this is one possible reaction to Government initiatives, whether in the tax field, the extension of social security or labour law generally, and that a certain number of workers and employers are prepared to live with the long term consequences of that kind of insecurity.</P>
    <P>But there is an equally compelling argument on the other side.  Deputy Martin is correct in identifying this Bill as an incentive to keep people in the formal labour market.  My proposals are designed to encourage workers to stay out of, or to come out of, the black economy. Just as they have a legitimate interest in ensuring their insurability under social welfare, there are also concrete advantages in the short and the medium term under labour law.</P>
    <P>Some issues arose concerning the complexity of labour law, the need for consolidation and particularly the need for comprehensive explanatory literature for part-time workers on their rights under labour law.  Deputy Shatter spoke about that at some length.  I have already, through the development of a published departmental guide to labour law, responded to the need to reduce the burden on small employers in that regard. I can reassure the House that I will be arranging for the issue of appropriate explanatory literature so that the terms of this Bill will be made clear to users.  I will turn to the other aspects later <Col N="477" /> because I do not disagree with the reference idea.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, as I understand him, sought clarification of how the new Bill with its service qualification of 13 weeks will interact with the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  I believe that what he had in mind was the situation of a worker who replaces a worker who is on the statutory 14 weeks maternity leave.  This kind of situation is provided for in section 24 of the 1981 Act, which amends the Unfair Dismissals Act by excluding from the scope of that Act a dismissal where the employer informs the replacement employee, in writing, at the beginning of the employment that it will terminate on the return to work of the person who is going on maternity leave.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act does not apply to a fixed term contract of less than 26 weeks or a temporary contract which has less than 26 weeks to run.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and O'Sullivan share some unease about my proposal that part-time workers, like other workers, should have access to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, because in the tribunal they would be faced with an impressive array of lawyers representing employers and could not afford themselves the necessary legal armoury.  Both have suggested mechanisms whereby in certain circumstances employees' legal costs should be covered.  I answered a question last week on that, but unfortunately we did not reach the verbal questions on it.</P>
    <P>Membership of trade unions, who regularly represent workers before the tribunal, is one answer from the employees' perspective.  It is instructive to note that almost 2,600 employees, or over 50 per cent of the total, who appeared before the tribunal in 1989 were represented &mdash; over 1,500 by trade unions, the others by legal representatives. Only one in five employers were represented.  There is also an argument that if in certain circumstances employees' costs could be awarded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who spoke last week and Deputies Cotter, O'Donoghue, O'Shea, Fitzpatrick, Dan Wallace, McGahon, Callely, Garland and Dempsey who spoke today. I thank the Front Bench spokesmen, Deputies Shatter, T. O'Sullivan, and Rabbitte, for their major contributions to the Bill.  The Deputies have been co-operative in some discussions and it is vital that we get this Bill through both Houses before 6 April so that it can line up with other legislation.  I have the support of the Deputies in that regard and we will just have to get the support of the Whips.  If we can get the Bill through this House next week and the following week get it through the Seanad it would be in line with the labour legislation.</P>
      <P>One other important point mentioned by Deputies today, particularly Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, was that in the event of not getting this through we can do nothing about any employers who try to change the regulations.  I thank the spokesmen for their co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this extremely urgent and important matter on the <Col N="479" /> Adjournment and I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid is present in the House.</P>
      <P>Needless to say many people will be aware of the impending disaster facing many countries in Africa.  Figures indicate that up to 20 million people in Africa face famine conditions this year.  Unfortunately, the early warning systems were not good in identifying problems and bringing them to world attention.  I only hope, as I bring attention to it in Dáil Éireann, that we are not too late.</P>
      <P>The horrendous scale of the problem facing the poverty stricken nations on the African continent was brought home yet again to many people during the past few days.  I would like to think that we will not look for excuses for failing to take action on this problem.  Action needs to be taken quickly and efficiently if we are to help the millions of people threatened by a human disaster on a scale mankind has never had to deal with or face up to before.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will outline what the intentions of the Government are, how they intend to respond, what they are prepared to do and what they are going to ask the Irish people to do. Are they going to ask them to make a contribution, however small, to deal with this unfortunate disaster?  We are aware when the Irish people were asked to contribute money in the past they responded both spontaneously and generously.  We should call on the generosity of the State yet again.  Needless to say people will look for leadership and this will have to come from the Government.  The Government do not have any excuse to run away from the problem as during the past number of days and weeks the scale and magnitude of the crisis has been highlighted by the relief agencies who are crying out for assistance before it is too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Government presided over savage cuts in real terms in Third World aid in recent years.  The allocations for development aid and international co-operation were frozen in real terms in the budget while bilateral <Col N="480" /> aid and overseas agency expenditure were cut by 3 per cent.  The allocation for disaster and relief aid has been increased by 33 per cent but this means that in real terms the Government have provided £250,000 this year under this heading. This minuscule figure represents one third of what the Department of Industry and Commerce will spend on consultancy services this year, one tenth of what the Department of Agriculture and Food will spend on new office premises and one third of what the Department of Labour will spend on travel expenses alone.  I have to ask the Minister of State if these represent the priorities of the Government.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the Lomé Convention but what we would like to know is what the Government are going to do now.  It would appear that the Third World is once more being marginalised and neglected.  We have spent the past few months observing events in one part of the world at the expense of another region.  I would like to think that the Government will seek a response to the crisis of a scale we have never had to face up to before at both national and European Community level.  The world is focusing attention on the reconstruction of the Middle East, and the developments taking place in Eastern Europe, but in all humanity we cannot allow these developments to take place at the expense of the starving millions in Africa.  I appeal to the Government to lead the field in responding to the crisis. A response has to come from both Europe and the western world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for giving me this opportunity to outline the Government's position.  The Government are very much aware of the tragic conditions prevailing in sub-Saharan Africa where, as Deputy Spring said, an estimated 12 million to 20 million people are threatened by famine. The vast majority of those are situated in the Horn of Africa, in particular in Sudan and Ethiopia.  While we are sadly becoming more familiar with the situation in <Col N="481" /> these countries the list of those countries affected is steadily growing and now extends to Somalia, Mozambique, Angola and Liberia.  In almost all cases the natural disasters are compounded by civil war and the military hostilities which exist.</P>
      <P>Ireland has responded both bilaterally, by providing funds for relief efforts, and through international fora, by formally inviting discussion and participating in general international and particularly European Community efforts to secure the necessary access and co-operation for food aid operations and of course by participating in Community funding for food and relief supplies.</P>
      <P>Ireland contributes to efforts to ease the hunger through its regular contributions to United Nations agencies but in particular it has contributed to European Community programmes and activities, both long term and of an emergency nature.  The European Community in 1990 contributed emergency food aid to Africa to a total value of over 230 million ECUs or about £178 million. Ireland, as a European Community member, participated in this through its contributions to the European Community budget.</P>
      <P>Bilateral contributions in respect of famine relief for Sudan and Ethiopia since January 1990 total nearly £900,000 of which the latest provision of £160,000 was made just last month.  Grants have been made to a number of national and international organisations seeking to deal with the famine conditions in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The generous response by the Community and its member states reflects the concern they feel towards the suffering in Africa.  This response is made possible, it might be said, by the information made available by a wide variety of sources, including early warning systems by such specialised agencies as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Global Information and Early Warning System in the field of food and agriculture established since 1975.  This system has been working effectively and <Col N="482" /> has reached a high degree of sophistication. Within its framework the FAO sent a team of experts to Sudan who in December 1990 published a special report assessing the overall crop and food situation there with extreme accuracy and estimating that following two successive poor harvests total cereal production would be well below average and that in 1991 1.2 million tonnes of cereals would have to be imported.  It stated that the Government of Sudan would not be in a position to meet more than a small portion of this commercially and, therefore, a substantial international response would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The present situation in the Sudan cannot therefore be regarded as being due to lack of adequate information.  It arises because of a variety of other factors connected with the civil war and, in particular, with the Sudanese reluctance to admit the scale of the disaster and to issue an appeal.  This naturally did not facilitate donor response.  However, I am still hopeful that an agreement can now be reached.</P>
    <P>In many of the other countries affected, such as Angola, Liberia and Mozambique, relief efforts have also been hampered by the unstable political situation.  Ireland will continue to carry out all efforts at ensuring that political considerations do not impede relief reaching those in need.  We will certainly do all we can in conjunction with our European Community partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Dairygold is a new co-operative body formed by the amalgamation of Ballyclough Co-op in Mallow and Mitchelstown Co-op.  Mitchelstown will be devastated as a result of the proposed redundancies because it depends so much on the co-op and the subsidiaries for employment.  The plans of the country's biggest co-op, Dairygold, to seek 250 redundancies immediately with a possible loss of a further 100 jobs later this year leads one to be highly <Col N="483" /> critical of that body.  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to meet with the co-op to see how the job losses might be averted.  The redundancies would be a body blow to an area which has already suffered major job losses in recent years.</P>
      <P>I accuse Dairygold of showing little regard for the interests of the workers who have made such a contribution to building the co-op into a major force.  As soon as a co-op gets into difficulty they throw their workers on the scrap heap. We are all aware that agriculture is facing difficult problems but this cannot justify the callous treatment of workers.</P>
      <P>When the co-op merger was announced last July I said the priority must be the preservation and maintenance of employment.  The comforting words then uttered by the management and farm organisations about preserving the jobs of Mitchelstown and Ballyclough workers have proved to be of little value. If the job losses go ahead the loss of income will have a major knock-on impact on the economy of the entire area. Ballyclough shed 20 jobs last year.  There are already 1,200 people on the live register in Fermoy and almost 1,500 in Mallow.  Fermoy is the employment exchange that takes in the Mitchelstown catchment area.  The loss of 350 jobs would lead to an increase of around 13 per cent in the level of unemployment in the area, a frightening prospect.  Unless there is a rapid change in Government job creation policies the only option facing those who lose their jobs will be emigration or the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are reneging on their responsibilities to the people if they stand aside and accept job losses at this level without making some effort to save them. There are 243,000 people unemployed, representing 18.7 per cent of the workforce. This is the worst figure for more than two years and it will continue to worsen unless the Government take action.  I want the Minister to seek immediate talks with the management of Dairygold to see how these redundancies <Col N="484" /> can be averted.  If they go ahead, the Minister should call in the IDA and urge that special priority be given to an industrial development campaign in the area.</P>
    <P>It is particularly disappointing that this is a case of yet more redundancies in the food sector.  Despite our natural advantages in terms of climate and land, our food industry has remained scandalously under-developed.  Is it not appalling that we import more than £1,000 million worth of foodstuffs each year, much of which could and should be produced at home?  The food industry should be a source of growth, not job losses.  I strongly urge both Ministers to become involved in this issue straightaway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, who is on Government business.  I have spent 14 years in the co-operative industry &mdash; in the dairy processing, livestock marketing and wool exporting areas.  I understand the industry well.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on this matter which involves an industry which is so important to the Irish economy as a whole.  The Irish dairy sector currently includes almost 40 plants which are licensed to process milk.  Since Ireland's accession to the European Communities, the industry has evolved from a relatively under-capitalised, under-developed base to a modern, high-technology industry.  This success has been reflected, in particular, by the record export levels achieved by the industry which reached a peak of £1.483 billion in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the imposition of milk quotas in 1984, the emphasis in the industry had been on investment in plant and equipment in order to process continually increasing milk supplies.  The introduction of the Community's quota system, however, altered this developmental pattern.  The industry was accordingly required to refocus towards the rationalisation of our processing <Col N="485" /> facilities and on product and market development.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this reorientation in our approach has been recognised by the ICOS in their 1987 document, &ldquo;A Strategy for the Irish Dairy Industry,&rdquo; which recommended the establishment of three milk processing units.  The IDA in their plan entitled &ldquo;A Future in Food&rdquo; have similarly emphasised the importance of rationalisation to the future prosperity of the industry.  With the onset of the completion of the Internal Market by 1992, it is vital that the Irish dairy industry achieve the economies of scale necessary to compete in the post-1992 market.  The heavy reliance on the intervention outlet for both butter and skim milk powder in the past year or so underlines the vulnerability of our industry and emphasises yet again the need for change and expansion of our product portfolio.  Such expansion can only be achieved in the context of a rationalised and efficient industry with the scale to achieve penetration of the main consumer markets. One need only look at the move towards the creation of multi-national food companies in other member states to see the level of competition which will have to be faced in those markets post-1992.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised that failure to maximise this potential would seriously threaten the employment levels which exist in the industry at present.  It is in this context that the amalgamation of Ballyclough and Mitchelstown Co-ops must be judged.  The type of industrial restructuring now taking place will not alone ensure that the jobs which remain in the dairy industry are secure, but the resulting competitive structure will have the ability to generate new employment opportunities in the medium term.</P>
    <P>I trust this puts the matter in context for Deputy Sherlock and the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this very important issue.  A few weeks ago I met a retired civil servant and his wife who have seven <Col N="486" /> children, some still at school and university. They said it was difficult to survive but that they kept their bills at bay by making weekly instalment payments. They described their embarrassment and humiliation when their child was denied his third level grant aid by Westmeath County Council until service charges were paid up to date.  They borrowed the money to pay the charges so that their child could receive a grant and continue the university course.</P>
      <P>Another case brought to my attention within the past few days concerns a businessman going through very difficult times who has two sons at university.  He applied for and was granted grant aid for both his sons.  One has received his payment, but his brother has had his cheque withheld pending his father's paying a debt for charges to Westmeath County Council.</P>
      <P>These are genuine cases and I know both families personally.  Naturally they would prefer to remain anonymous.  I can appreciate that Westmeath County Council must collect charges legally due to them.  It is their business how they go about it.</P>
      <P>We must not become so obsessed with fiscal rectitude that we are prepared to withhold grant aid from a student.  This is money awarded to him from the Department of Education, not to his parents, and the money is being denied to him through no fault of his own.  Must he carry the misfortune and poverty of his parents on his shoulders?  Must his career be forfeited because of the council's inability to collect their dues? What has happened to our marvellous ideas of cherishing all our children equally, equality in education, equality of opportunity?</P>
      <P>Those are just two examples of students striving for an education to enable them to take their place in society and to enable them to get jobs.  Their futures are put in jeopardy by the action of Westmeath County Council and by the inaction of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Junior Minister at the Department of Education is not present <Col N="487" /> in the House this evening and this is disappointing but I know the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Calleary, will respond in a worthwhile fashion.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister for Education and her Department authorise this move by Westmeath County Council?  Does she condone it?  Are there other county councils who enforce the same injustice on our students?  What steps do the Department and the Minister propose to take to outlaw this denial of educational opportunity to our young people?  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have expected Deputy McGrath to go first to the county council to find out the exact position because then he would have been told that the administration of the higher education grants scheme is statutorily entrusted to the local authorities and that details of particular cases would not normally be available to the Department of Education.  The Department of Education were not inactive in this case once it was drawn to their attention. The Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 &mdash; a good year &mdash; provides the local authority with the power to set off amounts owing to them by a person in respect of a charge against amounts due to that person from the authority.</P>
      <P>The matter is being examined by the Department in conjunction with Westmeath County Council and I am sure an arrangement can be made and that the Department of Education will be in touch with the Deputy at a later stage.</P>

There are now 300 people on the waiting list, and these are extreme cases.  Many others are in need of housing but do not think it is worth their while applying.</P>
      <P>The acute problem is relatively recent because of the Government's failure to build a single house in the area since 1987 &mdash; all this despite the fact that a scheme for 101 houses in Maugheraboy actually went for tender before Fianna Fáil came to office.  The Minister has finally sanctioned a quarter of this scheme, but that is no use.  I call on the Minister, as a minimum gesture, to sanction an immediate start on all this scheme.</P>
      <P>Sligo County Council had almost got on top of the housing needs in their area in 1987, but since then no major new scheme has been started.  The council have been starved of funds and are gradually sinking back to the bad old days.  The Minister now has an opportunity to help put things right.  I would particularly appeal to him to provide funds for the housing scheme in Aclare, County Sligo, where the houses are badly needed and a generous donation to the project was made by a priest from the area.

It transpired that children in County Kerry are obliged to wait one year for an operation, whereas children in Mallow, County Cork, have to wait only three months and those going to the South Infirmary in Cork have to wait for between six and eight weeks. <Col N="490" /> Under the Constitution, the children of the nation are to be cherished equally and in a democracy it is desirable that this should be the position.  I am urging the Minister to instruct the Southern Health Board to implement the system where the waiting list can be wiped out in County Kerry by transferring the operations to Mallow and the South Infirmary, if that has to be done in the short term, and to provide a more adequate ENT service in County Kerry in the future.</P>

      <P>Sligo now has a magnificent new hospital. We are all very proud of it, and we are very thankful for it.  The new hospital was opened a short while ago but no sooner was it opened than we learned that, except for emergencies it was to be closed for five weeks in the summer and four weeks at Christmas, twice as long as last year.  The slow down before the closing of the wards and the build up afterwards, means that the hospital is being closed for three months of the year. The reason, of course, is due to the financial cutbacks.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board, the most efficient health board in the country, are being forced to take drastic action to make ends meet.  They were forced to take something like £250,000 from community care to balance their budget.  We have a magnificent new hospital but the result will be longer waiting lists, even than the present intolerable levels.  This is a crazy situation, as I am sure the Minister agrees.  I hope the Sligo experience will help him to squeeze more money from the Government for health purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say that there is a housing crisis in Sligo, or, for that matter, anywhere in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment recently published a &ldquo;Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; which introduced a range of complementary measures to meet the various housing needs throughout the country.  In the very near future, the Minister will be issuing the 1991 capital allocations for the local authority housing construction programme.  The capital provision for the programme as a whole has been increased by 38 per cent to £45.6 million this year.  This will enable local authorities to complete 1,300 houses and start a further 1,500 in 1991.  Deputy Nealon may be assured that Sligo will get an allocation appropriate to the needs of the area.</P>
      <P>In regard to Gweedore sewerage scheme, a preliminary report for a sewerage scheme to serve Gweedore was approved by the Department of the Environment in August 1983 and Donegal County Council was requested to carry out an estuarial survey in connection with the proposed sea outfall.  The survey was carried out in 1988 and showed that, even with a 2,000 metre outfall, the offshore waters at this location are unsuitable as a discharge point.  Rather than extend the survey the council have sought advice from EOLAS.  A further submission from the council is now awaited by the Department. The question of allocating resources for further survey work does not therefore arise at this time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Southern Health Board issue raised by Deputy Spring, at no stage has the Minister for Health promised that there will be an additional 1,000 hospital beds available this year. As has been said on previous occasions in the House by the Minister for Health and myself, the Government are committed to maintaining services in 1991 at a level not less than that which was approved for 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ear, nose and throat service as raised by Deputy O'Donoghue, these services are available <Col N="493" /> in the Southern Health Board area at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, which is the regional centre for ENT, the Mercy Hospital and Mallow Hospital. ENT services are provided at Tralee General Hospital by arrangement with two consultants from the Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee.  Extra resources were made available to the Southern Health Board in this regard in 1989 for the provision of in-patient paediatric ENT services at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>ENT waiting lists in the region have decreased dramatically in recent years. The waiting list has been reduced by over 80 per cent at the regional unit in the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital since 1987.  There are about 74 children awaiting admission to Tralee General Hospital for ENT treatment.  This represents a reduction of about 29 per cent in the numbers awaiting treatment since February 1990.</P>
    <P>The organisation and development of ENT services at Tralee General Hospital is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board.  Comhairle na nOspidéal examined ENT services in the Southern Health Board area and made recommendations on the future development of such services at consultant level. The report recommends the appointment of one wholetime consultant ENT surgeon at Tralee General Hospital subject to the Southern Health Board making, in advance, a formal contractual arrangement with the Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee, to provide consultant cover for the appointee at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Southern Health Board is at present considering the recommendations made in the comhairle report.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Sligo General Hospital, the provision of hospital services in Sligo General Hospital is a matter for the North-Western Health Board in the first instance.  Seasonal bed closures are a normal feature of hospital services since 1985.  The closure of 70 beds for five weeks in the summer and four weeks at Christmas is planned to coincide with the main holiday periods.  During that period <Col N="494" /> it would be difficult to maintain full staffing levels as it is sometimes difficult to recruit suitably qualified locums during these holidays periods.  During these periods the demand for hospital beds would be at its lowest level.  Emergency and trauma cases are not affected by the closures.</P>
    <P>The elective beds which are closed during these periods include some ENT, ophthalmology, gynaecology and orthopaedic beds.</P>
    <P>The development at Sligo Regional Hospital involves an eight story extension to Sligo Hospital opened on 13 January 1991.  The extension has a comprehensive A &amp; E department which includes its own theatre and skull X ray unit.  The development also has a new admissions area and a new obstetrics and gynaecology department with a delivery suite. The hospital has new medical wards, a new CCU and day theatres and ICU have also been provided.</P>
    <P>Stage 2 of the project involves alterations to the original hospital and will be completed in 1993.</P>
    <P>With regard to St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny raised by Deputy Hogan, the Minister has accepted that the provision of additional facilities at St. Luke's Hospital is a priority and in 1990 he gave his approval to the expenditure of £144,000 to proceed with the planning of the proposed three storey development. Building will commence as soon as resources are available.</P>
    <P>On-going discussions are taking place between officials of my Department and the South-Eastern Health Board to try to resolve some of the service difficulties at the hospital.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cardiac ambulance facility as raised by Deputy McGinley, the provision of ambulance services, including cardiac ambulance services in County Donegal, is a matter for the North-Western Health Board.  I understand that the board are supporting local voluntary efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>The board obtains the funding to provide ambulance services from their allocation. The question of cardiac <Col N="495" /> ambulances in general is being considered by my Department at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> The Dáil adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 March, 1991.</P>

      <P>Because of the complexity of the issues involved, it would be wrong of me to set a deadline at this stage for a decision. However, I can assure the House that I will deal with the matter as soon as possible. I can also state unequivocally that the Government are committed to a downstream crossing and it has been included in the operational programme on peripherality which envisages construction during the period 1993-96.</P>

      <P>I refer to page 6 of A Plan for Social Housing.  As indicated there, the new range of measures included in the plan, when taken together and fully operational, offer considerable potential for increased social housing provision.  If this potential is fully realised, it should result in the provision of suitable housing conditions for some 5,000 households each year.  This, together with a continuation of existing programmes and casual vacancies at current levels, would cater for at least 10,000 households a year.  This level of social housing provision would have a significant impact on waiting lists.</P>

The vehicle registration unit of my Department sends a reminder notice to each vehicle owner about two weeks in advance of the expiry of the existing tax disc.  This notice can be used as a tax renewal form and it contains preprinted details of the vehicle, including the appropriate quarterly, half-yearly and annual rate of tax.

Postal applications for motor tax renewals are, generally, processed on the day of receipt by the Tralee office.</P>

I have no function in relation to the exercise of that discretion. I have no doubt, however, that the elected members, in considering their annual estimates of expenses, have careful regard to the needs of their area, the level and range of services to be provided, and, all of the sources of revenue, including charges, available to finance those services.  Almost all local authorities currently charge for domestic services and have done so in successive years at their own discretion in order to provide and maintain the range of services which they consider appropriate.  It is also apparent that the collection levels of those charges have vastly improved and it is expected that over 80 per cent of charges <Col N="433" /> demanded this year will be collected, while those on low incomes benefit from the comprehensive waiver schemes operated at local level.</P>

      <P>The submission referred to by the Deputy is one of a number, oral and written, made to the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.  This particular submission was made by the Commission. It proposes for consideration by <Col N="435" /> the IGC a provision foreseeing the progressive integration of the Western European Union (WEU) into the European Political Union.</P>
      <P>This proposal will, like all others made to the conference, be considered by Ireland in the light of the position of principle set out by the Taoiseach to the Dáil on 1 November last, to the effect that &ldquo;if the Community were at some stage to embark on arrangements for its own security and with its own security concept, then Ireland as a fully committed member state would be willing to consider participation&rdquo;.  It will also be examined in the light of the conclusions of the European Council of 14/15 December last which envisage that the common foreign and security policy would aim at maintaining peace and international stability, developing friendly relations with all countries, promoting democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and encouraging the economic development of all nations, while also bearing in mind the special relations of individual member states.</P>
      <P>As regards common security, the Rome Conclusions envisage the gradual extension of the union's role in this area &mdash; in particular and initially with reference to issues debated in international organisations: arms control, disarmament and related issues; CSCE matters; certain questions debated in the United Nations, including peace-keeping operations; economic and technological co-operation in the armaments field; coordination of armaments export policy; and non-proliferation.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed at Rome that, with a view to the future, the prospect of a role for the union in defence matters should be considered.  This will be without prejudice to member states' existing obligations in this area, bearing in mind the importance of maintaining and strengthening the ties with the Atlantic alliance and without prejudice to the traditional positions of other member states.  We regard this latter provision as important.</P>

    <P>Given the financial circumstances of An Post it is understood that the company are not at this stage in a position to give a commitment to the decentralisation programme for the foreseeable future.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, centralised price control generally has ceased.  I do not have official information on the matters raised but in the absence of that it is still clear that profit margins on non-alcoholic drinks are very high in public houses, It would appear that the profit margin is often much higher than that quoted by the Deputy. I regret that fact that this is a disincentive to young people to consume non-alcoholic drinks.  I wish that publicans would begin to compete with one another in supplying soft drinks at reasonable profit margins.</P>

      <P>I have responsibility for the 3 per cent quota for the employment of disabled persons in the public service only.  The placing of disabled persons in the private sector is a matter for the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The 3 per cent quota for the public service was introduced following a Government decision of 1 March 1977 on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service, health boards, State bodies, local authorities and vocational education committees were all actively encouraged to facilitate recruitment through having flexible age and educational requirements and to hold special entry competitions confined to disabled persons.</P>
      <P>In the year ending 31 December 1989, the latest year for which complete statistics are available, 2,029 disabled persons were employed which represented approximately 1.3 per cent of the total employed in the public sector.</P>
      <P>Section IV, paragraph 115 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> outlines the Government's commitment to increasing on a gradual and sustained basis the number of people with disabilities employed in the public service, and provides for a monitoring committee comprising representatives of public service unions and management.</P>

Where persons transferred from other social welfare schemes, additional inquiries had to be made to calculate adjustments due. In the case in question, the small adjustment due was not given priority and was temporarily overlooked.  The delay is regretted.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 22 January 1991 after exhausting her entitlement to unemployment benefit and the social welfare officer was asked to investigate her means.</P>
      <P>These inquiries were completed and a deciding officer disallowed her claim on the grounds that she had failed to show that her yearly means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certificate.  This certificate would specify her means for unemployment assistance purposes.  In particular, she failed to provide the social welfare officer with details of bank transactions from 1 January 1989 to date.</P>
      <P>It is open to her to appeal against this decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the appalling increase in vandalism, robberies in dwelling houses and a general break down in law and order in the Rathcoole area of County Dublin; if he will arrange as a matter of urgency to (1) provide additional gardaí for the area along with all necessary resources for them and (2) have the local Garda station operational on a 24 hour basis having regard to the needs of the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Garda authorities do not accept the suggestion in the question that there has been a general break down in law and order in Rathcoole and I must say that I do not regard alarmist claims of this kind to be helpful in the fight against crime. <Col N="445" /> The fact of the matter is that there was a reduction of some 13 per cent in the overall level of crime in Rathcoole over the past three years and the local gardaí are using every endeavour to see to it that this favourable trend continues. While the number of crimes reported in the subdistrict in the first two months of this year shows an increase on the corresponding period in 1990, the Garda authorities inform me that measures are being taken to deal with the situation including the operation of mobile checkpoints. There is also, I am glad to say, a very effective neighbourhood watch scheme in operation and continuing co-operation between representatives of the scheme and the local gardaí.</P>
      <P>In relation to the strength of the local station party, I am informed that the question of assigning additional manpower there will be kept under review as additional manpower become available. I might mention that the Rathcoole patrol car formerly had considerable responsibilities also for patrolling of the Maynooth and Celbridge areas.  Since the allocation of patrol cars to those centres, the Rathcoole car has been able to devote more attention to patrols in the Rathcoole area leading to an enhanced Garda presence in the subdistrict.</P>
      <P>Rathcoole station was open on a 24 hour basis up to 1987 when the opening hours were reduced by the Garda authorities to allow a greater Garda presence on outdoor patrol duties.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that to reintroduce 24 hour opening would be a retrograde step.  It would necessitate a reduction in patrols by the local gardaí which would not be in the interests of the local community.  What the Garda regard as important is not the opening hours of the station, but the maximum possible deployment of the available manpower on outdoor crime prevention and detection duties.</P>
