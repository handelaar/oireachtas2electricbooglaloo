Will the Tánaiste also indicate whether the House will be provided with an opportunity to discuss the proposals before the board of Teagasc for wholesale closure of research stations in view of the very serious signals this gives about our commitment to agricultural development at a time when we are looking for support from other countries to that end?</P>

      <P>Yesterday I sought to raise a matter concerning the Industrial Relations Act.  Will the Tánaiste say when the Minister for Labour proposes to make the order introducing the code of practice under the Industrial Relations Act which was promised in the House about 11 months ago by the former Minister for Labour?  Will the House be enabled to debate the order?  I know it is not normal practice to debate orders in the House, but this order is important and should be discussed.  In relation to the decision of the European Court of Human rights in 1988&mdash;generally known as the Norris Case &mdash; which obliges the Government to introduce reform of the legislation to allow homosexual acts between consenting adults, when do the Government intend to introduce reforming legislation promised under the revised Programme for Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill amends and extends the Solicitors Acts, 1954 and 1960, and provides for related matters.  New legislation relating to solicitors occurs relatively rarely. The principal legislation in this area dates from 1954.  The legislation in 1960 was made necessary mainly as a result of a 1958 Supreme Court decision that certain disciplinary powers conferred under the 1954 Act were unconstitutional.  The present Bill, which is the product of many years work in my Department, is the third major measure in this area of the law since the foundation of the State.  I am very pleased and honoured to introduce it.</P>
      <P>The background to the Bill is that for some years past there have been continuing demands for changes in the law relating to solicitors.  Specific issues and problems arising from the provision of legal services by solicitors, have been raised frequently in parliamentary questions and adjournment debates in this House.  There has been persistent public criticism of the way in which complaints about solicitors are dealt with by the Law Society, and about difficulties in obtaining redress for alleged negligence of solicitors. Commitments have been given in this House by successive Ministers for Justice that legislation to amend the Solicitors Acts, 1954 and 1960, would be introduced in response to public demand and to take account of certain recommendations made by the former Restrictive Practices Commission and more recently by the Fair Trade Commission. The Bill will meet most of the demands for changes that have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes extensive changes in the law relating to solicitors.  It is a major reforming measure and is being introduced to better protect the interests of clients of solicitors, to promote the highest standards in the profession, and to enable solicitors to adapt and respond to the commercial and economic changes <Col N="8" /> which they are being exposed to, as part of a wider community.</P>
    <P>Although legislation exists to control other areas of professional practice, traditionally there has been a more extensive code of statutory measures to control the solicitors' profession, even before the foundation of the State.  This has been due, essentially, to the nature of the work of solicitors which involves handling large amounts of moneys belonging to their clients.  Unfortunately this can, on occasions, lead to dishonesty by solicitors and possible ruin for clients, if adequate safeguards are not provided.</P>
    <P>I hasten to add that the vast majority of solicitors are hard-working and honest professionals, and that the money misappropriated by dishonest solicitors is very small in comparison with the total amount handled by the profession in their dealings with the public.  However, it is in the interests of both the public and the profession that adequate statutory provisions are in place to prevent, as far as possible, acts of dishonesty by any member of the profession, and to deal quickly and effectively with such cases as do arise.  The proposals in the Bill deal with these concerns, and address other matters where it has been shown that the public need further protection in their dealings with solicitors.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill should be viewed also against a background of a rapidly expanding profession.  When the 1960 legislation was being debated there were about 1,354 solicitors holding practising certificates in the State, now there are about 3,500 solicitors in private practice. Changes in admission requirements introduced by the Law Society in the summer of 1989 have resulted in a large increase in the numbers of students being admitted to the Society's law school and this increase is likely to continue.</P>
    <P>The impact of changes affecting the legal profession will not be confined to the domestic market.  Irish lawyers are already entitled to establish practices in other European states under the terms of an EC Directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which was implemented here on 2 January 1991.  In <Col N="9" /> fact, Ireland was the first EC state to implement the Directive.  Already about 100 Irish qualified solicitors have been admitted to practise in England and Wales under the Directive.  Outside the EC the current negotiations on the GATT Uruguay Round extend to the provision of certain legal services, and liberalisation in this area may lead to further possibilities for Irish solicitors wishing to provide services abroad in the future. The increasingly international climate in which lawyers operate, and the general trend towards deregulation of services, needs to be reflected in the statutory provisions which govern members of the legal profession and the manner in which they can conduct their business.  This Bill pays due regard to that need.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the main focus of a Solicitors Bill will be on domestic matters. Perhaps the most important proposals in the Bill consist of a range of measures which are designed to strengthen the protection for members of the public who engage the services of solicitors and to deal with some specific problems that have arisen in this regard.  I believe that a continued policy of self-regulation with adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the public is the best system for controlling the solicitors' profession. The present law confers important powers on the Law Society to regulate and control solicitors.  However, adequate safeguards must be in place to protect the interests of the public where a profession is entrusted with self-regulation.</P>
    <P>There are major proposals in Part III of the Bill relating to complaints about solicitors.  Section 8 will give new powers to the Law Society to impose sanctions on solicitors who are found to have provided inadequate or shoddy services.  Heretofore the disciplinary powers under the solicitors Acts, have been confined to cases of misconduct only, which excludes allegations of inadequate or negligent services.  Penalties in such cases will include limiting the costs which a solicitor may recover from a client or requiring a solicitor to refund costs paid by a client, and to rectify any error at the solicitor's <Col N="10" /> own expense arising from the inadequate services.  Section 9 will empower the society to order solicitors, who are found to have charged excessive fees, to refund fees paid by their clients or to waive the right to recover costs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these extended powers will provide a speedy and inexpensive remedy for many complaints against solicitors, while not affecting a client's right to seek redress through the courts.</P>
    <P>Public concern has been expressed for some time about the lack of an effective system for dealing with complaints against solicitors, and the absence of any public involvement in the process.  To meet that public concern the Bill provides in section 15 for the establishment of an independent adjudicator, to investigate complaints about the society's handling of complaints by members of the public about solicitors.  Under the proposals my consent will be required for the appointment of the independent adjudicator, and it is specifically provided that the adjudicator, who must not be, or have been, a practising solicitor or barrister, will be independent in the exercise of his functions.  Among his or her wide powers, the adjudicator will be able to make recommendations to the society in relation to investigated cases, and in relation to the society's procedures for handling complaints.  The adjudicator will be required to report to me in relation to the discharge of his duties, and these reports will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Law Society will be required to meet the cost of this operation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Law Society are opposed to funding the independent adjudicator.  I would point out that the introduction of an adjudicator has become necessary here, as it became necessary in neighbouring jurisdictions, for one reason and one reason only &mdash; that is the failure of the solicitors profession to live up to the responsibilities implicit in a system of self-regulation, by providing a system for disciplining their members in a way that commands public confidence.  It is also necessary to protect <Col N="11" /> the taxpayer in this matter, and it is not unreasonable to expect that, if extra measures are needed to restore public confidence in the arrangements whereby a self-regulating profession deals with complaints from the public, then the profession itself should bear the cost involved, which should not be very great in this case.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 16 for the appointment, for the first time, of up to five lay members nominated by me to the Disciplinary Committee of the High Court, to represent the interests of the general public.  This committee, which is appointed by the President of the High Court, is responsible for conducting inquiries into allegations of misconduct against solicitors.  Another new provision, in section 21, will require the Law Society to publish information annually on the number and nature of complaints about the conduct of solicitors, and the outcome of their investigations.  This should help to maintain public confidence in the investigation of complaints by the Law Society, particularly in view of the important expansion in the scope of complaints of negligent or shoddy work by solicitors, proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is likely that for cases where serious loss arises as a result of alleged negligence by a solicitor, the client affected will seek redress through the courts. A serious problem in the past has been the absence of arrangements to ensure that funds will be available to meet the cost of damages awarded in such cases.</P>
    <P>I understand that the vast majority of practising solicitors are covered by professional indemnity insurance at present, but an important provision is included in section 25 that will enable the Law Society to require all solicitors to be covered by indemnity insurance against losses arising from civil liability claims. The detailed provisions in this section provide a flexible framework for the Law Society to achieve this, and include a provision for arbitration on disputes arising between a solicitor and his client in relation to any claim.  Every practising solicitor will have to satisfy the Law <Col N="12" /> Society that he or she is complying with the indemnity regulations, before a practising certificate may be issued to him or her for any practice year.  Although I have been assured that the Law Society will introduce the necessary arrangement under these provisions quickly, I have included a provision empowering me to direct the Law Society to make the necessary regulations, and to specify the terms and conditions on which indemnity cover shall be provided under the regulations.</P>
    <P>Another problem highlighted in the past, has been the difficulty encountered by some people in obtaining the services of a solicitor for the purposes of taking an action against another solicitor.  While acknowledging that the Law Society have made arrangements in recent years to assist such people to obtain the services of a solicitor, the matter is sufficiently important, in my view, to require statutory provisions.  Accordingly, section 61 places a statutory obligation on the Law Society to maintain a register of solicitors who are prepared to act for any person who is unable to engage the services of a solicitor to take civil proceedings against another solicitor.  The Law Society will also be required to take all reasonable measures to assist any person to obtain the services of a solicitor for such purposes.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 62 address some other very important issues which have come to my attention, and which affect many people who instruct solicitors. These are in the area of solicitor and client costs.  A solicitor's client should be entitled to know in advance, what a solicitor will charge or is likely to charge for providing legal services to him or her.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case.  The Bill places a duty on solicitors to provide clients, at the outset, with particulars in writing of the basis on which clients will be charged for legal services.</P>
    <P>In contentious business, for example in personal injury actions, a solicitor will also be required to inform the client of any circumstances in which he or she will be lible to pay additional costs to the solicitor, over and above those recovered from the losing party.  At the conclusion <Col N="13" /> of a successful litigated case, a solicitor will be required to provide the client with details of any fees claimed or received from the losing party, if the solicitor proposes to charge additional fees to the client.  I am particularly concerned about an apparently widespread practice among solicitors of deducting a substantial premium &mdash; often 10 per cent or more from the damages awarded to their clients in personal injury cases, over and above the costs payable by the losing party.  Those costs should normally cover most if not all of the necessary costs incurred by the successful client's legal representatives.  To deal with this problem, section 62 prohibits solicitors from deducting an amount from clients damages without the prior agreement in writing of the client, and it prohibits solicitors from charging costs to their clients on the basis of a percentage of any damages that may be awarded to a client.  A solicitor who is found to be in breach of the new costs provisions will be guilty of misconduct, and will be liable to disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>I expect these provisions are unlikely to be welcomed by some legal practitioners, but they are designed to reassure clients about the extent of their financial obligations to their solicitors, and should minimise the potential for disputes between solicitors and clients in this crucially important area.</P>
    <P>On the principle that prevention is better than cure, certain provisions have been included in the Bill to empower the Law Society to intervene in a solicitor's practice in certain circumstances to protect the interests of clients.  At present, the Law Society's powers of intervention are confined, for practical purposes, to situations where a solicitor has been guilty of dishonesty.  Under the provisions in sections 30 and 31, the Law Society will be empowered to intervene in the practice of a sole practitioner who has died or who is temporarily incapacitated by illness or accident, and to take whatever action they deem necessary in the interests of the clients.</P>
    <P>The circumstances where the Law Society may apply to the High Court <Col N="14" /> for freezing orders on solicitors' bank accounts are being extended under section 27, to protect clients' moneys held by solicitors.  Section 67 places an obligation on the Law Society to make regulations, with the concurrence of the President of the High Court, to require solicitors in general to maintain clients' moneys in deposit accounts, and to pay interest on such moneys to the client. I am aware that the Law Society have already made regulations in regard to this matter, but I believe that a statutory provision is appropriate to offer complete protection to solicitors' clients.</P>
    <P>Another proposal which may, on the surface, appear restrictive but which is designed to protect the public is the proposal in section 34 which restricts newly qualified solicitors from setting up in practice, without the consent of the Law Society, as sole practitioners, or in partnership, for a period of three years following qualification.  Similar restrictions apply in neighbouring jurisdictions, and solicitors affected by the restriction will have an opportunity to appeal to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill which I have mentioned so far fall within a general heading of proposals to strengthen the rights, and means of redress, for members of the public in their dealings with solicitors, and to increase the powers of the Law Society to act to protect the interests of such persons where necessary.</P>
    <P>There are other proposals in the Bill which will also benefit, directly or indirectly, the clients of solicitors.  In this regard I should like to refer to a particular change which is being made in the statutory provisions governing the compensation fund maintained by the Law Society to compensate for losses arising from dishonesty by solicitors.  That is a change introduced in section 28 of the Bill which will limit the scope of the statutory compensation fund to clients of solicitors only.  The change is necessary as a result of a Supreme Court decision in 1989 which decided that, as presently drafted, section 21 of the Solicitors Act, 1960, <Col N="15" /> gives access to the fund to financial institutions who incur loss as a result of undertakings given by solicitors.</P>
    <P>It was never the intention that financial institutions, engaged in large financial transactions, in pursuit of their own business and relying on undertakings from solicitors, should be able to claim against the compensation fund should the solicitor default in circumstances in which the financial institutions are not clients of the solicitors.</P>
    <P>Financial institutions, such as banks, have historically relied on solicitors' undertakings for purely business reasons and did so for many decades without any expectation that they would be entitled to have recourse to the compensation fund.  That possibility only arose in recent years because of a Supreme Court decision which I have referred to and which gave a particular interpretation to the existing law.  Financial institutions are sufficiently strong and have sufficient expert advice available to them to enable them to decide whether to accept a solicitor's undertaking, without having to rely on the compensation fund as a form of insurance.  Of course, if there is a default on the part of a solicitor, a bank incurring a loss would be entitled to sue the solicitor personally, or his firm, as at present.</P>
    <P>A very large claim against the compensation fund in favour of a financial institution as a result of a solicitor's undertaking, of, say, some millions of pounds could so deplete the fund as to deprive clients of solicitors, whom the fund is designed to protect, of the benefit of being able to claim against the fund.</P>
    <P>Solicitors are, of course, in a strong position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their clients and frequently have actual control of clients' moneys.  It is in the scheme of things, therefore, that it is the clients who require protection rather than institutions who are doing business with solicitors at arm's length, as opposed to depending on a solicitor and client relationship.</P>
    <P>Another group of proposals in the Bill is concerned with measures to increase <Col N="16" /> competition in the provision of legal services and to offer greater freedom of choice to the consumer of these services.</P>
    <P>Certain monopolies were created under the Solicitors Act, 1954, which restrict the preparation of particular legal documents for reward to solicitors.  These are given legislative expression in section 58 of that Act.  The principal monopolies created under the section relate to conveyancing and probate.</P>
    <P>Monopolies and restrictive practices reduce choice to the consumer and inhibit competition among suppliers wishing to provide the same service to the public. The solicitors' monopoly of conveyancing work was substantially diluted by the enactment of the provision in section 31 of the Building Societies Act, 1989, which empowers building societies to provide conveyancing services to the public subject to regulations which I am empowered to make.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission, in their report last year on restrictive practices in the legal profession, recommended that banks should be similarly empowered to provide conveyancing services.  I agree with the commission's recommendation. It would be clearly anomalous if building societies could provide such services but banks &mdash; who compete with the societies in providing other services in connection with property purchase &mdash; could not.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 74 of the Bill contains an enabling provision to empower banks to provide conveyancing services to the public.  The provision is based on similar provisions in section 31 of the Building Societies Act, 1989, and includes provisions to protect the public from conflicts of interests and to ensure that adequate compensation will be available in respect of negligence, fraud or dishonesty on the part of any bank providing these services.</P>
    <P>I also stress that in making the necessary regulations I intend to ensure that conveyancing services provided by banks and building societies will be provided under the supervision and responsibility of qualified solicitors employed by those institutions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I emphasise that this proposal <Col N="17" /> arises from the need to offer greater choice to the consumer in the area of conveyancing services.  It is not motivated by any concern about the interests of financial institutions.  If those institutions do not offer a sufficiently attractive conveyancing service to the public they will not gain business.  If they do then the public will gain.</P>
    <P>I believe that changes in the solicitors' monopoly position in regard to such an important matter as conveyancing should be limited for the present to allowing financial institutions to do this work.  I believe that it would be premature to go further, as the chairman of the Fair Trade Commission recommended, and permit the introduction of a completely new profession of licensed conveyancer.  I think we should wait and see what benefits result for the public from the changes proposed in the Bill, including fee advertising, to which I will shortly refer, before considering if there is a need for more radical measures.</P>
    <P>As regards probate, the position at present is that the drawing up of wills for reward is reserved to solicitors under section 58 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, although anybody can make a valid will either for himself or for another person without any professional legal advice if no fee or reward is involved.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, anybody may extract grants of probate or administration, both in the Probate Office and in many of the district probate registries, without the intervention of a solicitor if this is not done in return for reward.  However, the taking of instructions to apply for a grant of probate or administration when done for reward is reserved to solicitors under section 58 of the Solicitors Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>The proposal in section 73 of the Bill would permit banking companies and trust corporations to prepare wills and to take instructions for a grant of probate or administration, or to oppose such a grant, for reward.</P>
    <P>Such companies are already entitled to act as executors or administrators of an estate, either solely or jointly with other persons.  That is the position under section 30 of the Succession Act, 1965, <Col N="18" /> and I am not aware of any problems that have arisen for the public in connection with the services provided by banking companies and trust corporations in this area since 1965.  In effect, the changes proposed in section 73 of the Bill will extend the services which these companies can already provide in this area to the preparation of wills and applications for grants of probate and administration.</P>
    <P>For the public, this will introduce an element of consumer choice and the possibility of an alternative one-stop service being provided in regard to wills and probate.  Such competition should be to the benefit of clients.</P>
    <P>By confining the degree of deregulation in this area to banking companies and trust corporations, which was the minimum measure recommended by the Fair Trade Commission, the interests of the public should receive maximum protection both in regard to redress for complaints about any service provided and the availability of resources to provide compensation where necessary.</P>
    <P>Of course, the solicitors' profession may not welcome the prospect that very remunerative areas of legal work such as conveyancing and probate in which they have enjoyed a monopoly for so long are being opened up to others, even to the limited extent proposed in sections 73 and 74 of the Bill.  However, the Law Society has been preparing the profession for some time for the need for change and I am sure that the profession will adapt quickly enough to the climate of increased competition in the provision of legal services that is envisaged as part of the policy of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am aware that since the publication of the Bill the proposals in sections 73 and 74 to empower banks to provide conveyancing and probate services have received a lot of public comment.  I shall listen with particular interest to the views of Deputies in relation to these proposals. I consider that it would be appropriate and particularly useful to subject the detailed proposals in relation to these matters to careful examination and teasing out on Committee Stage.  But I would emphasise that these proposals <Col N="19" /> have been drawn up with the consumer in mind, and in light of the fact that statutory provisions have been enacted already to empower building societies to provide conveyancing services.</P>
    <P>Following regulations made by the Law Society in December 1988, solicitors are permitted to advertise their services, subject to certain general limitations contained in those regulations.  These limitations include a prohibition on specifying a fee for any service which a solicitor is willing to provide.  Advertising of fees is likely to encourage competition in fees, leading to lower costs for the consumer.  There is no restriction on solicitors advertising fees and charges in England and Wales.  That is believed to have resulted in substantial reductions in costs for the clients of solicitors there, particularly in the area of conveyancing.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Fair Trade Commission's conclusion that price advertising by solicitors could lead to increased efficiency, a reduction in costs and the provision of routine legal services at a reasonable cost.  Accordingly, section 63 of the Bill contains a provision that would prevent the Law Society from prohibiting fee advertising by solicitors for any specified legal service.  I am aware that the Law Society are opposed to this provision, but I have to say that their reaction seemed to me to be somewhat &ldquo;over-the-top&rdquo;, and their reservations not very convincing.</P>
    <P>While I would accept that it might not be possible or practicable to quote a fee for all legal services provided by solicitors, particularly where the service is not standardised, surely it is possible for a solicitor to quote a fee for the routine and standardised work that comprises much of the work for which a solicitor is instructed, for example in the areas of conveyancing and for drafting of wills and probate work.  In most of these areas standard scales of fees have applied traditionally, and many solicitors should be able to estimate the economic cost of providing such services to the public and to quote a fee.</P>
    <P>The Law Society have suggested that <Col N="20" /> fee advertising is likely to cause confusion and lead to the public being exposed to the risk of &ldquo;shoddy&rdquo; or careless work and unsatisfactory legal services.  I am rather surprised that the Law Society should take such a negative view of the general level of competence and expertise among qualified practising solicitors.  To the extent that individual cases could arise where work done by a solicitor falls short of acceptable professional standards &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; I would expect that the Law Society will be able to deal adequately with such cases under the extensive new powers that will be conferred on the society in this Bill.  It will remain the responsibility of the Law Society to maintain acceptable general standards of professional conduct in the profession as part of the policy of self-regulation.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of advertising, I would like to refer to one other aspect of solicitors advertising that is of concern to the Government, this is, the recourse by some solicitors to high profile advertising to make unsolicited approaches to the public inviting instructions in personal injury matters.  It is not in the public interest that solicitors freedom to advertise should be used to generate or encourage litigation that would not otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>The Government are very concerned about the explosion of litigation in the personal injuries area in recent years, and its impact on the cost of liability insurance.  There is evidence from remarks made by judges about the extent of spurious personal injury claims coming before the courts, that a compensation culture is becoming endemic whereby people are encouraged to initiate proceedings in the belief that the most trivial accidents are deserving of compensation as a matter of course.  This social development may have received added impetus with the introduction of advertising by solicitors.  Specific provisions are included in section 63 of the Bill to enable the Law Society to deal with this problem by prohibiting the type of &ldquo;ambulance chasing&rdquo; advertising indulged in by some solicitors and, generally, any advertising <Col N="21" /> that is contrary to the public interest. The type of advertising to which I have referred comes within that description. If the Law Society require any further guidance in this area, I shall be happy to provide it.</P>
    <P>A further group of proposals in Part III of the Bill is concerned with disciplinary matters in relation to solicitors.  They extend and amend the provisions in Part II of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960.  I have referred already to the fact that, for the first time, the society are being empowered to impose sanctions on solicitors in response to complaints about the provision of inadequate services and excessive charges; that is under sections 8 and 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Provisions for appeals by solicitors to the High Court against the society's decisions are included in section 11.  In addition, the society may require a disciplined solicitor, under section 13, to pay a contribution not exceeding £1,000 towards the cost of investigating complaints made against him.</P>
    <P>Formal inquiries into allegations of misconduct against solicitors will continue to be the responsibility of the disciplinary committee, appointed by the President of the High Court.  Under section 17 of the Bill, the disciplinary committee will be empowered to impose limited penalties where it finds that a solicitor has been guilty of misconduct. The disciplinary committee have no powers to impose penalties under the 1960 Solicitors Act.  They report findings of misconduct to the High Court, and the court deals with the issue of penalties. That position arose from the Supreme Court judgment in 1958 to which I referred at the outset.</P>
    <P>The giving of powers to the disciplinary committee to impose limited penalties, which was also recommended by the Fair Trade Commission, will enable the committee to dispose of some less serious cases of misconduct, without involving High Court proceedings.  Provisions are included in the section to enable appeals to be taken to the High Court against decisions of the disciplinary committee, including a right of appeal to clients on <Col N="22" /> the ground that a penalty imposed by the committee is inadequate.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the limited powers to impose penalties proposed for the committee will not breach the constitutional requirements laid down by the Supreme Court in the &ldquo;Solicitors Act&rdquo; case in 1958.  For more serious cases of misconduct the range of penalties which the High Court may impose is being extended to allow for greater choice. That is being done in section 18 of the Bill, which substitutes a new section 8 in the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>The restrictions on the employment of persons who have been struck off the roll of solicitors are being tightened by the provisions in sections 19 and 20 of the Bill. The control of the Law Society over the issue of practising certificates to solicitors will be strengthened by many of the provisions in Part IV of the Bill.  Section 55 extends the grounds upon which a practising certificate may be refused, or issued, subject to conditions.  There are important provisions in section 53 to enable the Law Society to impose conditions on a solicitor's current practising certificate.</P>
    <P>Under section 52 the Law Society will be entitled to apply to the High Court to have the practising certificate of a solicitor suspended where there has been a serious failure by the solicitor to comply with any regulations made under the Solicitors Acts.  Another new provision, in section 51, will clarify the position about solicitors in employment.</P>
    <P>Henceforth any qualified solicitor who is full-time employed in connection with the provision of any legal services will be deemed to be acting as a solicitor for the purposes of the Solicitors Acts.  This will mean that all such solicitors will require practising certificates.  They will come under the jurisdiction of the Law Society. All measures in the Solicitors Acts designed for the protection of clients will apply to them.</P>
    <P>While the changes made by the Law Society in 1989 in the admission requirements for solicitors has eased the position for law graduates wishing to <Col N="23" /> qualify as solicitors, the Bill contains further proposals to ease entry into the profession. Section 45 proposes more liberal arrangements for barristers who wish to qualify as solicitors.</P>
    <P>The period of practice required by a former barrister will be reduced to a maximum of three years, compared with five years practice at present.  The barrister will be exempted from any Law Society examinations in law which he passed as part of the examinations for the degree of barrister-at-law, and will not have to pass the compulsory Irish language examination for solicitors if he has already passed, or was exempted from the Irish language examination required for barristers.</P>
    <P>These changes should greatly assist the general policy of freer interchange between the branches of the legal profession recommended by the Fair Trade Commission.  I would hope that generous reciprocal arrangements will be offered by the professional bodies responsible for barristers, to enable practising solicitors to opt to become barristers.  There are no statutory provisions regulating that aspect of inter-professional transfer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission concluded that some form of apprenticeship in-training was necessary as part of the training of solicitors. However, unduly long periods of apprenticeship, or other restrictive provisions relating to apprenticeship requirements, can restrict or delay entry to the profession of solicitor.  The terms of apprenticeship should be consistent with the duration of the professional in-training provided by the Law Society in the Law School.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Terms of apprenticeship of up to five years, which can apply under the present statutory provisions, are clearly too long, having regard to the fact that the professional training provided by the Law Society can be completed within three years of admission to the Law School. Accordingly, section 38 of the Bill <Col N="24" /> empowers the Law Society to prescribe terms of indentures of apprenticeship not exceeding three years.  These regulations may be applied to indentures of apprenticeship in existence on the date when the regulations take effect, so that apprentices serving longer periods of apprenticeships at present will benefit from the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>A number of other provisions will assist the profession in providing apprenticeships for the increased numbers entering the professional law school.</P>
    <P>At present, a practising solicitor may not have more than one apprentice at the same time by statutory requirement, although a second apprentice may be taken on with the consent of the society in special circumstances.  Section 42 of the Bill will allow a solicitor who is a sole practitioner, or is in partnership, to take on an apprentice for every two assistant solicitors employed in the practice. Section 47 empowers the Law Society to make regulations providing for arrangements where apprenticeships may be served with qualified solicitors in Northern Ireland, England and Wales.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission recommended the introduction of common vocational training for solicitors and barristers leading, possibly, to the formation of an institute for legal education.</P>
    <P>For many years there has been concern about legal education.  A number of my predecessors have referred to this matter publicly.  Put simply, it is very unsatisfactory that the resources of so many law schools and colleges are involved in what seems to be an unco-ordinated way in the education and training of our lawyers. There is a considerable amount of duplication between the various bodies involved.</P>
    <P>There is a need to co-ordinate all this activity in a meaningful and planned way and streamline the process of legal training with a view to making economic use of the limited teaching resources that are available.  It is time to devise a better and more equitable way of channelling our highly qualified law graduates into the professional streams, than the present uneven arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> I am aware that the professional bodies and the universities are currently engaged in discussions about the reform of the present arrangements for providing legal education and training.  It would be preferable if new arrangements that will meet the concerns that have been expressed for some time about legal education, were introduced voluntarily by the various educational agencies involved.  If this does not happen within a reasonable time, I shall propose suitable measures to deal with the situation.  In the meantime, in anticipation that arrangements will be introduced for joint vocational training, I have included a provision in section 43 of the Bill to enable the Law Society to join with other bodies in providing joint or common examinations and courses leading, in appropriate cases, to a joint or common qualification.</P>
    <P>The final group of proposals in the Bill to which I would like to refer at this stage is concerned with the removal of restrictions on the form of working arrangements within which solicitors may practice, and the admission of foreign qualified solicitors to practise here.</P>
    <P>There is a statutory prohibition in section 64 of the Solicitors Act, 1954 on a corporate body acting as a solicitor. Accordingly a solicitor may practise only as a sole practitioner, or in partnership with another solicitor.</P>
    <P>The absolute prohibition of incorporation by solicitors may be unnecessarily restrictive in modern circumstances. Similar prohibitions have been removed in the case of solicitors practising in England, Wales and Scotland.  Section 64 of the Bill contains an enabling provision that will allow the Law Society to make regulations providing for the incorporation of solicitors' practices.</P>
    <P>These regulations will require my concurrence and prior consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that regard.  I can assure the House that I shall be vigilant to ensure that adequate safeguards will be included in any such regulations to protect the clients of incorporated practices.  In particular, the inclusion of this enabling provision does <Col N="26" /> not reflect any settled view as to whether and in what circumstances, solicitors will be able to practise in corporate form with limited liability.</P>
    <P>Further enabling provisions in section 65 of the Bill relate to the possible establishment, first, of multi-disciplinary practices involving solicitors and persons from other professions, and second, of multi-national practices involving Irish solicitors and lawyers in other jurisdictions. Such partnerships are prohibited at present by section 59 of the Solicitors Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is considerable debate in the profession about the pros and cons of establishing multi-disciplinary practices, and that vital considerations arise which affect the public interest in regard to such issues as solicitors' independence, standards of conduct, and conflicts of interest, in relation to any potential working association between solicitors and non-solicitors.</P>
    <P>These issues are being debated at present, and it may be some time before a consensus emerges in the profession about the question of multidisciplinary practices.  If proposals are eventually made by the Law Society to enable such practices to be established, my concurrence will be needed for the necessary regulations, and I shall have to consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce before giving my consent.</P>
    <P>The increasingly international dimension in legal practice, and the implications for the provision of legal services of the European Community provisions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, are widely recognised.  These developments have led to debate here and elsewhere on the justification for restrictions on multinational practices of lawyers.</P>
    <P>The statutory restriction has been removed in England and Wales for both multidisciplinary and multinational practices. Similar proposals have been published in the case of Northern Ireland.  The enabling provisions in section 65 of the Bill will require my concurrence before regulations can be <Col N="27" /> made by the Law Society to permit multinational practices.  The establishment of such practices raises important issues of principle regarding safeguards for clients and disciplinary and regulatory arrangements.</P>
    <P>Another aspect arising from the international mobility of lawyers is the need for flexible arrangements to allow for the reciprocal recognition of lawyers qualifications and their right of establishment in foreign jurisdictions.  This is now possible for lawyers qualified in any EC country under the EC Directive on the mutual recognition of higher education diplomas which, as I have already mentioned, came into force in Ireland last January. Under it, Irish solicitors and barristers, among others, are entitled to establish a practice in any other EC state, subject to any aptitude test that the designated authorities in the foreign state are entitled to apply.  The Law Societies here and in Britain and Northern Ireland have agreed not to apply any aptitude test to solicitors from one of those jurisdictions wishing to establish in another.</P>
    <P>Section 46 of the Bill provides a framework to enable reciprocal provisions to be negotiated to allow lawyers who are qualified to practise in non-EC states, to be admitted to practise as solicitors in this State, and for Irish solicitors to be admitted to practise in the foreign jurisdiction. While any such arrangements would be negotiated by the Law Society, the section provides that they cannot be introduced in respect of any jurisdiction without an order being made by me, and I shall have to be satisfied that reciprocal provisions will be in operation in respect of Irish solicitors before I can make an order that would allow lawyers from any such foreign jurisdiction to practise as solicitors here, under these provisions.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to most of the miscellaneous provisions in Part VII of the Bill.  The proposal in section 66 provides that every solicitor holding a practising certificate will be entitled to act as a commissioner for oaths.  That has been the position in neighbouring jurisdictions for some time.  There are many other <Col N="28" /> proposals in the Bill of a minor or technical nature to which I do not propose to refer at this stage.  We will have an opportunity to study all of the proposals in the Bill in detail later.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill I have been conscious of the need to strike a balance between the demand for legislation that will give adequate protection to members of the public who need to consult and instruct solicitors, and which will at the same time provide a framework that will give members of the solicitors profession the maximum latitude to provide the range of services required by the public, in an increasingly international context.</P>
    <P>The many proposals in the Bill in relation to complaints, sanctions, discipline and regulatory controls against solicitors must be seen in the context of the overall policy of self-regulation by the profession, which is maintained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned, in the light of the recommendations made by the Fair Trade Commission, to do away with unnecessary statutory monopolies enjoyed by solicitors, which can no longer be justified in the public interest. The changes that are proposed in this Bill to allow increased competition with solicitors in the areas of conveyancing and probate are not radical ones, and I am very conscious of the paramount need to safeguard the public interest in putting forward these proposals.</P>
    <P>There has been long and comprehensive consultation with the Law Society in regard to the proposals in the Bill.  I would like to express my thanks for the ready co-operation of successive presidents of the Law Society, and of the <i>ad hoc</i> working group of the council of the society who were involved in the discussions with my Department.  I think it is fair to say that there is a large measure of agreement with the Law Society on the proposals in the Bill, even if some sharp differences of opinion remain on some issues.  Indeed it would be surprising if it were otherwise given the range and size of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill will benefit the public and profession alike.  It will help <Col N="29" /> to revitalise a profession which is already educating itself to changes arising from domestic and external developments.</P>
    <P>The public can look forward to legal services being provided in a competitive and more user-friendly environment where cost, efficiency and quality of service will increasingly determine consumer choice.  And the Law Society and the High Court will be given adequate powers to deal promptly and effectively with the activities of the few solicitors who fail to maintain the high standards of service and honesty which we have come to expect from members of the profession, and which many people, including Members of the House, will, I am sure, readily acknowledge from personal experience.</P>
    <P>During the debate I shall be keen to hear the views of Deputies on the many proposals contained in the Bill and I shall be open to ideas from all sides of the House that would improve the Bill.  I believe this measure is ideally suited to be dealt with on Committee Stage by a Special Committee of the House and I will so propose at the end of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very aware that calls have been made for some time to introduce changes in the law relating to the solicitors' profession.  While the Bill before us contains many important changes it is difficult to understand why the Government should confine reform to only one aspect of the legal environment and totally disregard the rest.  The entire legal arena is badly in need of radical reform.  It is fair to say that the public perceive the legal environment in which we operate to be antiquated, clumsy, inefficient and not adequately serving the public.  It is only when something goes wrong that the public see the reality of the system and its failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of a civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis in the area of civil law excludes many individuals from pursuing a just grievance through our courts simply because of a lack of finance.  In the interests of democracy, it is important <Col N="30" /> that every citizen should have the right of access to our courts in order to achieve justice.  Until this happens there will continue to be a lack of confidence on the part of the public in our system.  I was appalled to read in a recent Sunday newspaper that the results of a survey showed that only 9 per cent of the public have absolute confidence in our courts.  This should not be allowed to continue.  It is the responsibility of the Government to make the necessary changes to restore public confidence in our courts.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to knock the legal profession as I am well aware that the vast majority of those operating our legal system are honourable, decent and upright people who do an important job on behalf of society.  Solicitors are not merely members of a profession acting for private clients or private interests; they are officers of the court, they handle trust money and the property of their clients and are the repositories of the secrets of their clients.  The general public interest requires from the members of that profession, both individually and as a profession, high standards of efficiency, integrity and, above all, honesty.  For these reasons this Bill must not alone seek to regulate the general affairs of the solicitors' profession but must also safeguard the public interest.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the various sections of the Bill I should like to refer to some areas which are badly in need of urgent reform.  I should like first to deal with the inefficiency of the courts system. As a layman I am often appalled to see court rooms at 10 a.m. full of solicitors, barristers, gardaí, witnesses, and so on waiting for cases to be called.  It appears that there is no proper listing system and, consequently, everyone arrives at 10 a.m. resulting in an enormous waste of man hours by the legal profession and others. This must add to the overall costs which are funded by the taxpayer.  Surely in this age of highly trained public servants and computer technology we could have a more simplified and efficient system.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to the changing of barristers at the last moment.  It is not unusual for a barrister to return a <Col N="31" /> brief to a solicitor on very short notice. This can occur after a case has been in existence in a solicitor's office for as long as three years or more.  To the clients it is the most important matter in their lives and very often they have built up a relationship with the barristers, but a different barrister may be asked to take the brief at the last moment.  He or she will not know the client and the client will be grossly disillusioned by the change.  Very often the client may feel insecure as a result of this change.  Whatever the reasons, changes must be made to prevent this continuing.  It does nothing for the image of either profession to allow it to continue.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the training and appointment of judges.  It is difficult for the public to understand the considerable variations in thinking between judges up to and including the High Court.  Those wishing to serve as judges in our courts should undergo some training prior to appointment and guidelines should be set to determine the suitability of individuals to serve in that capacity. Judges should also have the benefit of in-service training.  Many areas of law require great sensitivity in dealing with particular problems.  One of these areas is family law.  I do not see why a member of the solicitors' profession should not be considered for appointment to any of our courts provided, of course, that the person in question is a suitable candidate. I am told that frequently a barrister in assessing the chances of success of a case with solicitors and clients will make specific assessments depending on which judge will hear the case.  If this is so ways and means should be found to prevent it continuing.  I sincerely hope the Minister will take these points on board and deal with them quickly.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the manner in which we deal with small claims.  There is an urgent need to set up a small claims tribunal to deal with consumer problems and a small claims court to deal with petty claims and very minor offences.  These courts should be informal and there should be no need to engage either a <Col N="32" /> solicitor or barrister to appear on behalf of clients.  Fees charged in these type of cases by the legal profession very often eliminate the amount of the award to the client.  It often takes a considerable period of time for these petty claims to be settled.  They also clog up the business of the District Court where they should not be heard in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the work of the Law Reform Commission.  The Law Reform Commission have produced excellent reports over the past number of years but, unfortunately, many of these are gathering dust on shelves in the Department of Justice.  What is the advantage of having an excellent body such as the Law Reform Commission when many of their recommendations are not followed?  The Law Reform Commission are capable of producing legislation to progress their recommendations and the Government should encourage this body to publish a Bill embodying many aspects of the reports they prepare. Any changes the Government may wish to make subsequently could be introduced on Committee Stage of such a Bill. This would mean that changes in our laws would come about far quicker than through use of the present system.  Many of our criminal laws are out of date and, as I suggested previously, the Government set up a criminal law reform commission to deal specifically with this area of law.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to conveyancing law which is dealt with in the Bill.  There is a need for the introduction of a modern conveyancing Act to update the law relating to house and property transactions in order to simplify procedures and reduce costs.  The truth is that the legal profession is burdened with antiquated laws created for a different generation conveying title in totally different circumstances from the type of conveyancing that is in operation at present.  An example of this is the Statute of Uses which provides that if certain words are not used in a conveyance, then the purchaser will acquire a life interest when it was intended that he should receive the freehold.  Surely it is time <Col N="33" /> these types of changes in our ancient laws were dealt with.</P>
    <P>Another area that causes a great deal of concern to every Member of this House, and has been raised on many occasions here, is the Land Registry.  I regard the delays in the Land Registry as nothing short of appalling.  It has been shown over and over again that changes in this area would not alone lead to greater efficiency but would also be self-financing. Delays in having land registered can have serious effects on our economy and can also cause a great deal of extra expense and annoyance for the individuals concerned.  It is time the Minister announced changes and introduced legislation to bring them about.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this very comprehensive Bill.  It has seven parts, 75 sections and covers a wide range of issues.  However, it is not my intention at this stage to deal with every part.  The Minister has dealt with the Bill in detail but I should like to concentrate on some of the proposals which I feel need to be commented on.  I would also mention that it is my intention on Committee Stage to table amendments to bring about improvements in this legislation.  I sincerely hope the Minister will live up to his offer at the end of his Second Stage contribution and accept positive suggestions and worthwhile amendments from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>Part III of this Bill is concerned with disciplinary matters and provides for the investigation of complaints about inadequate services provided and excessive fees charged by solicitors.  I welcome the fact that new powers are being given to the Law Society to impose sanctions for inadequate or poor quality work.  As a public representative I very often receive complaints from members of the public about the standard of work and the long delays in dealing with particular cases by some solicitors.  I welcome also the fact that steps can be taken where excessive fees are being charged which are clearly unjustified.  It is most important that those carrying out investigations are seen to be doing so in an independent fashion. <Col N="34" /> The fact that provisions are being made in this Bill for lay representation on the disciplinary committee is welcome. Under this Part of the Bill I note there is provision for the appointment of an ombudsman.  This too is a welcome development.</P>

      <P>As I read it, there is provision under this Bill for the appointment of an ombudsman &mdash; you can call it something else if you wish.  This is a very welcome development and should apply in many professions, including the insurance industry.  The banks and the financial institutions have an ombudsman; the legal profession and the solicitors will have one and I think this development should be extended to many other areas.  It is difficult to understand why the Minister is not extending the role of the ombudsman to deal with complaints involving barristers and officers in the courts and registries.  I do not see why it should be confined solely to solicitors and I intend raising this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the general public are concerned, Part IV of this Bill is very important as it contains proposals for the protection of clients.  As I stated earlier, the general public interest requires that the solicitors profession, individually and collectively, have high standards of integrity and honesty.  Strong measures must be available to deal with solicitors who attempt to behave in a dishonest fashion or who fail to provide a proper and efficient service to the client.  Unfortunately, the solicitors profession, as in <Col N="35" /> many other professions, has some members who abuse the trust placed in them.  That is why the provisions in this Part of the Bill are necessary.</P>
    <P>A compensation fund is essential and I am pleased that this Bill requires the society to maintain a fund of £1 million after deducting outstanding liabilities.  I note from comments made by the Law Society that they are seeking to have a cap placed on claims made under the compensation fund so that the maximum paid in any one claim would be £250,000. I ask the Minister when replying to comment on this proposal, particularly in view of the fact that other professions, such as stockbrokers and auctioneers, do not have an open-ended liability.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the introduction of professional indemnity insurance in respect of claims of negligence on the part of solicitors or those in their employment, and I sincerely hope it will be compulsory for solicitors to carry this indemnity insurance.  This can only be to the benefit of the public because it is essential that they be protected in this way.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with educational requirements for apprenticeship and for qualifying for admission as a solicitor. There is a feeling abroad that entry to the legal profession is controlled, thus leading to a closed shop mentality.  It is difficult to understand why an individual who has attained legal qualifications and a certain level of competence cannot be allowed to practice as either a solicitor or a barrister.  The required standards of the Law Society and the Bar Counsel should allow those who are qualified in law to practice in either area of the law.  If this were done, market forces would dictate who would do what and we could avoid the necessity for controlling fees, etc. Similarly those qualified in law should be entitled to be considered for appointment to the Bench, whether they come from the solicitor profession or the barrister profession.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on these important points when he is replying to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> Part VII of the Bill contains miscellaneous provisions.  This Part deals with a number of very important matters, for example, solicitors' fees.  Regular comments are made regarding the level of fees charged by solicitors for various services provided.  From the consumers' point of view, it is important that competition should result in the consumer getting the best service at the cheapest cost, but it is important that the consumer is also protected from false advertising because what appears to be cheap at the outset can very often turn out to be very expensive in the long term.  Maintaining a scale of fees to be charged for different services is a thing of the past and should be discontinued.  Market forces should dictate fees charged by individual solicitors for different types of services.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that fee advertising would benefit the consumer in the long term.  I have come across cases where a solicitor offered a bargain fee for conveyancing but the client ended up on bridging finance for a long period simply because the level of service provided was very poor.  I am not convinced that the cheapest is always the best.  The Minister must ensure, in the public interest, that this proposal to allow fee advertising does not result in a lowering of professional standards to the detriment of the public.</P>
    <P>We have seen in other countries the spectacle of what is known as &ldquo;ambulance chasing&rdquo;, where members of the legal profession encourage individuals to pursue what are very often very dubious legal actions based on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis.  I welcome the provision which prohibits the charging of fees by reference to a percentage of the damages awarded to a client.  I intend pursuing that whole issue of fee advertising on Committee Stage and I look forward to a positive and constructive debate at that stage.</P>
    <P>On a minor matter in relation to Part VII of the Bill, I respectfully suggest that it is time to abolish compulsory Irish and that the Law Society should be required to retain a panel of solicitors competent to conduct legal business in Irish.  If this <Col N="37" /> was done the requirement of those seeking to conduct their business in Irish would be satisfied.  The element of compulsion disappeared some time ago and we should remove it in this instance also.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why banks and trust corporations should be allowed to do probate work under this legislation. About 70 per cent of wills not made by solicitors end up in court.  That is not in the best interests of the consumer.  There is a recent trend in legislation to allow outside groups engage in business in which they do not normally engage.  I refer here to the banks, and I disclose a personal interest in that I am involved as an insurance broker.  People will have to accept that while my comments are being made in all sincerity they could be coloured by my involvement in insurance. The banks were given power to engage in the insurance business in the hope that they would provide a better service to the public, a wider choice and so on.</P>
    <P>I have come across abuses by the banks in conducting their insurance business. Counter staff are being set targets to sell insurance and when the bank doors close at 3 p.m. staff are being asked to contact clients of the banks in order to sell insurance.  Bank managers have been reported to the Insurance Brokers Association for interfering with direct debits.  When they see a direct debit for insurance from a different company they have often contacted the client and asked for a chance to quote for insurance.  This is an abuse of information.</P>
    <P>There has not been a reduction in costs to the public as a result of the banks engaging in insurance business.  Bank charges have not been reduced nor have interest rates been reduced.  Why then would those charges be reduced when the bank is running an insurance business from banking costs, from a branch office and the unfortunate individual has to carry all those costs?  It is bad enough that they are engaging in insurance business but they now will engage in probate work where again vital confidential information on clients will be now made available to the banks.  I am not at all happy that this is a correct move forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> It is important that a person's private secrets can be communicated to a professional and that standards will be followed. In this Bill we are giving additional powers to the Law Society to ensure that people maintain certain standards and, if they do not, penalties can be imposed. Who will impose penalties on a bank manager or on whoever will conduct the probate work?  I am not happy with this trendy concept of opening up things, weakening the professions and letting more people work in areas where heretofore only professionals worked.  I am not happy that that is in the interests of the consumer.  There are horses for courses.  People are trained to think in a certain way, to do something well and they are expected to do it well.  If there are abuses or monopolies in certain professions I would not support that but it is not wise to encourage someone to get a carpenter when he really needs a plumber.</P>
    <P>As legislators we should ensure that the consumer gets the best service at the cheapest price.  The consumer's interest and the public interest must be protected. Banks seem to be empowered to engage in many activities but before we ask them to take on more work, they should concentrate on doing better what they are supposed to do.  Then we can think about allowing them to do other work.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that in the area of probate work it is appropriate that clients of a bank could be persuaded to make their wills with the bank.  If the Minister intends allowing banks and trust corporations to engage in probate work he should provide legislative safeguards to ensure that the work will be done by legally qualified persons and that there will be arrangements for compensation to cover dishonesty, professional indemnity insurance to cover negligence and rules which would prevent conflict of interest. I do not understand why the banks and trust corporations are being singled out in this way.  I hope the Minister on Committee Stage will explain why this is being done.</P>
    <P>With regard to conveyancing I do not make any apology for saying that I do <Col N="39" /> not understand why the Minister feels that banks should now be empowered to provide conveyancing services.  If we intend maintaining a solicitors' profession, which I support, the more services we allow to be carried out by others the greater the chance that the remaining services provided by solicitors will be carried out at a much higher cost to the consumer.  Maybe this is the direction we should be taking, but it deserves a lot more debate before a final decision is taken.  Conveyancing is an area of work that should be reserved for properly trained persons.  Can the Minister guarantee that such a professional service will be provided by banks or any other person he wishes to allow do this type of work?  It is not my intention to support a closed shop approach, but before agreeing to radical changes of this nature, I wish to be satisfied that the consumer will get a better service at a cheaper cost by such changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister can argue that building societies were empowered to do conveyancing under the Building Societies Act.  That may be so, but I am not saying that was wise.  I have seen some practices on the part of building societies that I certainly would not think were in the public interest.  When they were relieved of their power to force people to take out their insurance with them we saw what happened.  They suddenly introduced a reading fee.  The unfortunate borrower who wished to take out insurance in the normal way with their own insurance broker who presented the policy to the building society and who was not going to be blackmailed into taking out insurance with a company the building society had their arrangements with &mdash; getting higher commission than most brokers because of the volume of business &mdash; found himself having to pay a reading fee for the building society to read the policy to satisfy themselves that it came up to their standards and their requirements.  What nonsense. It is only another way of extracting money from people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see every Tom, Dick <Col N="40" /> and Harry being able to do conveyancing and probate work.  They might be seen to be doing it at a cheaper cost but if, at the end of the day, I am left on bridging finance for six months and end up paying interest that I should never have had to pay simply because of gross inefficiency on the part of whoever is doing the work, I might have no come back.  At least in this Bill we are giving the Law Society the power to deal with people who do not do their business in a proper and honest fashion.  If this work is spread out to other people, will the same standards apply?  It is our job as legislators, before making radical changes like this, to be sure that it is in the public interest, that it will be in the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat what I said at the outset. This legislation is very important.  I have posed some questions which I hope the Minister will address.  I admit that some of the points I made did not relate directly to the Solicitors Bill as it is before us. However it is quite legitimate for an Opposition, when presented with legislation, to query why an opportunity like this is not used to deal in a comprehensive way with more matters than are in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is not much in this Bill that most Members of the House could honestly disagree with but there are some changes I would like to see in the whole area of probate and conveyancing work.  Those are fundamental issues that have to be dealt with.  I would expect that there will be differences of opinion in this regard. However before we make changes we need to be convinced that they are in the interests of the public.  It is a shame that when we get an opportunity, which we get so seldom, to deal with legislation in this area, we are not getting the opportunity to make many other changes that are necessary to provide the type of service the public we represent require.</P>
    <P>We are regulating the solicitors profession, but there are many other areas to be dealt with.  Even if we got the solicitors acting in a totally honest manner with total efficiency etc., as long as we have a courts system that is perceived by the <Col N="41" /> public to be inefficient we are not providing a good service.  When laymen go down to the courts the place is full; nobody seems to know when a case will come up; they are wandering around, waiting for hours and the whole system seems to be geared towards keeping a judge busy.  Not being a member of the legal profession, I think that is a load of nonsense.  Whatever about a judge not being busy for half the day if there are hundreds of others wasting man hours at a cost to the public, that is a total waste. Surely it should be the other way around. Surely the system should operate in an efficient manner.  If the judge has an hour or two off in the course of the day because cases were settled out of court that he thought he was going to hear, so be it.  If a person does not settle within a fortnight of a hearing and subsequently settles ten minutes before the case is due in court there should be a fine imposed.  That would build up a practice of making certain that cases are dealt with out of court without affecting the list system.  As long as we tolerate the sort of chaos witnessed every day in the courts, with people hanging around, including professional witnesses, at enormous cost to the insurance companies, which ultimately falls back on the insured persons, the public will not have confidence in our courts.</P>
    <P>Tied into this whole question is the solicitors' profession, the barristers, the relationship between barristers and solicitors, the question of whether people should be able to move from one profession to the other without having to go through a whole rigmarole to do so. There is also the question of who sits on the bench, the type of persons they are, the type of training they have had, their consistency in sentencing, in awarding damages and so on.  The public want to see all these matters dealt with but as things are at the moment they are confused. They cannot understand what is going on.  That is why only 9 per cent showed absolute confidence in our courts according to the recent survey carried out.  That is a very dangerous trend and should not be allowed continue.</P>
    <P>There is a need for radical reform and <Col N="42" /> just reforming the solicitors profession or introducing changes in it will not solve the problem because that area is only part of a very big problem.  I would like to see the solicitors profession continue but as an efficient profession that everybody can be proud of, a profession in which those engaged would be proud of what they were doing so that they would not have to keep looking over their shoulders knowing that there was a watchdog in the form of a Bill that has the teeth and the power to deal with them if they step out of line.  At the end of the day it is important to the whole system that we get this legislation right.</P>
    <P>Maybe in reply to the Second Stage the Minister will have proposals to deal with the other aspects I spoke about.  If he has I would be delighted to hear them and I would certainly support changes in the areas I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased and honoured to have an opportunity to make a comment on this most important piece of legislation.  I say that primarily as a Member of this House as spokesperson for The Workers' Party but also as someone who has been an active member of the legal profession as a solicitor for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been described by the Minister in his opening speech as a product of many years work in his Department. He also admits that new legislation relating to solicitors occurs relatively rarely; in fact he might have gone on to point out also that in regard to the other arm of the legal profession, the barristers, it never occurs.  For both these reasons the legislation is a great disappointment. Apart from the one area of discipline, the Bill provides little by way of substantial reform.  Huge issues and opportunities have been missed at a time of rising and unmet legal needs.  This is due to poor legal services being provided <Col N="43" /> by the Minister on behalf of the Government, to an antiquated Court structure imposed and imported from the era when we were a dominion colony of the British Empire and which has changed little since then, and from our having a two-arm profession which is both costly and unnecessary.  The Minister, therefore, has missed huge opportunities to address major gaps in the service generally.  Even in areas where he has attempted to take action, apart from the area of discipline and policing, he has made mistakes he will regret for some time to come.  For example, he has copped out entirely on the question of appointing an ombudsman in this area.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the previous speaker in his contribution welcome the appointment of an ombudsman because such an appointment is not contemplated under the legislation.  What is contemplated is that the Minister will have a permissive power to introduce regulations under which he will be allowed to appoint a creature to be known as an adjudicator to comment on, make findings and observations on an investigation carried out by the Law Society into their own procedures.  That is far removed from the concept of an ombudsman who, according to the meaning of the Swedish word, is someone who represents someone. What we will be getting is a statutory commentator or observer, certainly not someone who will have any serious powers of investigation.  I will deal with that matter in more detail later.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister has neglected the central issue of fusing the two arms of the profession into one singular, efficient and cost effective service.  In relation to legal education he has fallen again for the long established ploy of the profession who have suggested to him that they are engaged in discussions and negotiations which will lead to an advancement, if not unifiction, in this area.</P>
    <P>In regard to the compulsory requirement on the Irish language, which is both anachronistic and ineffective and to which the Law Society only pay lip service, as the Minister well knows, he has <Col N="44" /> allowed this anachronism to remain in place.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the substance of the Bill, I should like to correct the record on one issue.  At Question Time in the House on 26 November the Minister made a gratuitous remark which was both unnecessary and inaccurate.  He said that I had in some way sought to delay or avoid a debate on this Bill.  In response to a question I had put to him in an effort to get some detail in regard to legislation relating to extradition the Minister said, as reported at column 821 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>With regard to my attendance in the House, I find it extraordinary that the Deputy should take this attitude, having spent six months, practically every morning, asking for a solicitor's Bill to be taken, and now that it has been published for about a month, finds it inconvenient to take it every week.</P>
    <P>In the crossfire I attempted to correct that when I said &ldquo;I have no difficulty in taking it&rdquo; to which the Minister responded, &ldquo;that is not what is happening, and the Deputy knows it&rdquo;.  I then pointed out that the matter rested with the Government Whip.</P>
    <P>It is true that when the Minister for Justice approached me in the corridor outside the Chamber to inquire as to what my views on the legislation were we had an informal discussion on it.  In the course of that discussion I pointed out to him that the Law Society were anxious to be given the opportunity to meet representatives of the parties in the House to make their views on the legislation known.  In his contribution the Minister acknowledged the co-operation he received from that society in preparing the legislation.  Indeed, they established a committee of the council to deal with it.  It was not, therefore, unreasonable for them to ask that they be given an opportunity to meet with representatives of the parties to make their views known to them on legislation which will directly affect their operations and organisation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his speech, it <Col N="45" /> took a long time to prepare the legislation which was published on 23 October this year.  I indicated to the Minister in the course of our casual conversation that the society were due to come to the House the following week and that it was hoped the debate on the Bill would not begin until we had an opportunity to meet with them.  That was as much as I said to the Minister for Justice.  I conveyed this view, as I understand did the Whip of another party, to the Government Chief Whip on the scheduling of the Bill.  On the one occasion the Government Chief Whip proposed that the debate on the Bill be scheduled for today I immediately agreed.  I do not know the reason the Minister made that remark in the House; he may want to correct it.  That is a matter, ultimately, for the Minister.  All I want to do is put the record straight and not leave on the record a suggestion that I was shilly-shallying or shying away from a discussion on legislation which is virtually second nature to me.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that a Special Committee will be established to deal with Committee Stage of the Bill. That is a good decision and it should be welcomed.  I hope all groups in the House will have an opportunity to sit on the special committee and contribute.  I also hope that the proposed reforms contained in the new joint Programme for Government, agreed between the two parties in Government, will be in place before the Special Committee begin their deliberations.  It is important that this Special Committee, once established, will be workable and efficient.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the officials of the Department should be allowed to make contributions, answer queries and make suggestions on the legislation at the Special Committee.  I am aware that the Acting Chairman contributed long and hard at the Special Committee on the Child Care Bill.  Within the confines of the room when a committee are working hard on legislation if a question is raised the Minister must consult with the officials sitting directly behind him and convey the answer to the committee.  I <Col N="46" /> see no reason why the officials who constructed the legislation and who will be responsible for implementing its provisions subsequently cannot be allowed to contribute directly without voting or in any way influencing the decisions of the Special Committee.</P>
    <P>It is important that interested groups should be permitted to attend and make submissions to the Special Committee, when sitting.  This is a very pertinent point given that we are aware that the Law Society have had an intimate working relationship with the Department in drafting the legislation.  There is no reason why they should not be present to make a submission to the Special Committee and answer questions raised by Deputies who are concerned and worried about the way sections are constructed or the impact they will have when they are eventually put into operation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear those points in mind.  They are provided for in the general outline of the proposals contained in the new joint Programme for Government.  It would be of assistance if those proposals were brought forward without delay and the Special Committee established under the new regime of a democratic and more efficient Dáil operation.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party will not approach this legislation from the narrow standpoint of the profession to see how it will be served by it but from the broader viewpoint of the public and consumer. That is evident from the Minister's contribution. I do not accept however that the Minister has gone as far as he could have in protecting the interests of the consumer but at least we agree on a similar approach.  In discussing the terms of the Bill we should consider how the service will be delivered and how the legislation will serve the customer, consumer and the citizen.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the report of the Fair Trade Commission which was published a short time ago, in March 1990, in deference to the monumental work carried out by them when they studied restrictive practices in the legal profession, although it should be said that <Col N="47" /> the Minister had little regard to this report in drafting the legislation.  In their report the commission said:</P>
    <P>The Commission considers that there is a fundamental requirement that the public should have available an adequate supply of legal services, of sufficient quality, with a wide degree of choice among practitioners, and delivered efficiently at a reasonable price.  It accepts also that it is in the public interest that the suppliers of legal services should maintain a high standard of competence, conduct, integrity and independence, for the protection of consumers.</P>
    <P>That is a very good, useful and succinct fundamental statement of our concerns in dealing with legislation in the area of legal services and the legal profession generally.  It reflects the working principle on which The Workers' Party will approach this legislation.  However, we must ask how the Bill addresses this fundamental proposition.</P>
    <P>It is also important to put on the record that The Workers' Party have a very high regard for the solicitors' profession.  It is long established and has worked very well; the majority of its members are well intentioned and provide a very competent professional service for the public. It must also be acknowledged that it is singularly the most policed profession in the country; the Minister made a reference to this being grounded in tradition but did not give a serious analysis of the reason, apart from referring to the fact that solicitors have within their authority the power to look after or control resources, moneys and property of their clients.  However, that can be said of every other profession in the financial area; banks, banking institutions, accountants and so on can be on a par with solicitors in that regard and indeed the physical well-being of an individaul is reposited in the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Is there inconsistency on the part of the Government with regard to the concept of policing professionals in the course of their duty?  It is a good <Col N="48" /> principle to have democratic controls and accountability but I must advise the Minister and the Government that there is a very grave sense of injustice felt by solicitors not so much on the basis that they are policed and controlled, but because they are singled out for having this very onerous regime imposed on them and which will be extended under this legislation.  The Government should look at other professions who have as much control over the rights and interests of individuals and who are not subjected to the accountability, responsibilities and controls included in this legislation, for example, the very substantial compensation fund and the overall powers of the High Court to impose draconian sanctions in justifiable cases.  Why does that not apply to other professions?</P>
    <P>The attitude of the legal profession generally &mdash; and of solicitors in particular &mdash; is that it is a private profession which has never seen its function as providing a social need of equal access and ease of hearing for all citizens.  Legal aid and the legal aid services have arisen from the inability of people to provide or find an adequate service in the private profession. The Airey judgment of the European Court clearly identified that the delivery of legal aid services and support to the poor in a community is the responsibility of the State.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, in resonse to the Airey judgment, established the Pringle Commission on Legal Services which reported nearly 12 years ago on the need for setting up a comprehensive system of legal aid, providing not just for the delivery of a service but for education and supporting people in having access to the courts.  The commission at the time recommended that an interim service should be provided before the comprehensive system was established providing for legal services throughout the country, including all major provincial towns.  The Minister of the day acted on the interim service and we have been living with the fruits of the interim service ever since.</P>
    <P>In the area of the legal profession generally &mdash; in particular solicitors &mdash; and the <Col N="49" /> delivery of the service to the consumer in that context, the Government have not yet fully complied with the findings of the European Court in the context of the Josie Airey case.  The Government &mdash; and previous Governments &mdash; have relied on a stop-gap interim system which is totally inadequate.  The inadequate service has been subjected to previous criticisms and it led to the resignation of the chairman of the Legal Aid Board last year in protest at the way successive Governments have failed to seriously address this aspect of legal services generally, the provision of a service for those who cannot afford it or find it in the private profession of solicitors and barristers. In the wake of the resignation of the then chairman, Mr. Fennelly, the Minister had the opportunity to nominate a chairman, Mr. Landy.  If one looks at the reports of the Legal Aid Board signed by Mr. Landy, published recently, for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, the Minister must be dismayed to note &mdash; but cannot be surprised &mdash; that the criticisms continued unabated.</P>
    <P>The chairman said, by way of foreword on page 3:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has recently informed the board that he is making the necessary funding available to the board to enable it to establish three additional one centre law centres in 1991.  While this is a welcome step, much still remains to be done and I will continue to press for the resources required to provide a comprehensive legal aid service.  The Minister has recently assured me that work on a draft statute is nearing completion in his Department for the establishment of legal services on a statutory basis. We have, however, been told that many times before.  The present spread of law centres is inadequate with large areas of the country not having a full-time law centre.  I am disappointed that in many instances the availability of legal services under the scheme has become a test of perseverance rather than a test of eligibility with applicants, <Col N="50" /> often in very distressing circumstances, having to wait long periods for even an initial appointment with a solicitor.</P>
    <P>We cannot lose sight of the fact that legal aid and legal services arise directly from the legal needs of people in the community not being met by solicitors, barristers and the legal profession generally. Therefore, when one drafts legislation to improve the delivery of the service to the consumer, to which the Minister referred, he cannot but be reminded &mdash; and it is the duty of every spokesperson on legal affairs in the House to remind him &mdash; that there is a vast area of the consumer public who cannot and will never have the opportunity of getting any kind of legal service because the Government have failed to honour their commitments under the Airey judgment and the provisions of the European Court on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The situation was highlighted yet again by the Law Society in their review of the performance of the legal aid services. The report was sent to the Minister in November and it is worth noting some of its basic recommendations for which the Minister has failed to provide in any meaningful way in the legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>They made the point that the number of legal aid centres must be increased and that there should be at least one centre in every principal county town in the country.  They go on to say that private practitioners should also be involved in the scheme in dealing with adjournments and providing replacements for the Legal Aid Board solicitors who are absent. That is a very simple proposition which has been advocated by the Legal Aid Board and by people directly concerned with the service over the years.  Where there are major gaps geographically and logistically in the service provided, solicitors should be brought in from the private sector on contract to fill these vacancies.  However, there is nothing in the Bill before us today to deal with that small item.  There is an urgent need to involve the private practitioner in the <Col N="51" /> extension of the service so that a comprehensive service is provided to the public without delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his introductory speech, referred time and again to the report of the Fair Trade Commission on the legal profession.  It is fair to suggest that publication of the Bill in October of this year was delayed for 12 to 18 months while this report was being finalised, presented to the Government and considered. It is therefore regrettable that major parts of the report have been totally ignored by the Minister in drafting the final legislation.  These include issues such as fusion of the profession, statutory regulation of barristers, judicial appointments and support services to be given to judges once appointed, and the general area of legal education, access to it, the need for a single service, the need to modify and improve the conditions of apprenticeship and the extension of third level education grants to students attending legal education courses.</P>
    <P>This report is a unique and comprehensive document.  It represents the first analysis of the legal services in Ireland from the point of view of fair trade and of eliminating from the legal profession many of the anachronisms, rules and devices drafted by the profession to suit their purposes as opposed to improving on the service delivered to the consumer.  Therefore, it is a particularly valuable document.  The report was presented to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is a lawyer, even though it deals with an area that is fully within the remit of the Department of Justice, namely, the legal profession. There appears to have been a disagreement by two Ministers as to who should have responsibility for the report and who should act on its recommendations. There was an unnecessary delay in publication of the Bill while it was being considered.  It appears that my predictions were correct, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had more influence with regard to the recommendations of the report than has been admitted.  As I have said before in the <Col N="52" /> House, while that Minister is a vocal advocate for reform and is often critical of the structures of the legal profession he has yet to introduce legislation or promote an idea to further his views in this area.</P>
    <P>When I was a student in 1972 I remember Deputy O'Malley, as Minister for Justice, making what was then considered a remarkable speech outside the House, stating that the fusion of the legal profession was an inevitable consequence in the streamlining and development of an efficient and modern service in this country.  That was almost 20 years ago and nothing has happened since in that respect.  What is particularly sad is that this Bill avoids the issue entirely.</P>
    <P>The issue of fusion of the profession is the single most important and urgent matter in the development of a modern, efficient and cost effective profession. The existence of a two-arm profession &mdash; the suggestion has been made of the enhancement of the position of the legal executive, which could be regarded as a third arm &mdash; is entirely confusing to the consumer.  The diversity of responsibilities between solicitors and barristers is a haven for incompetence.  It provides ease of buck passing, and is the most often used device to pass responsibility for one arm of the profession to the other when queries are raised by the consumer with regard to the service delivered. Because there are two arms of the profession the service proves to be more costly and certainly more confusing.  The profession is too small for such a division to be maintained.  There should be one profession with a pool of resources available to it to enable it to provide an efficient and cost effective service.  Ours is much too small a country to maintain two professions.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about protecting the taxpayer, but all costs with regard to maintenance of the profession fall to the consumer.  It is the taxpayer or consumer who is currently maintaining a divided, profession that is cumbersome and unnecessary.  Fusion of the two professions would lead to a more open and accountable profession particularly <Col N="53" /> because, as I have illustrated, solicitors are the most heavily policed and disciplined profession in the community, and fusion would inevitably bring barristers under a similar regime.  It is a scandal that barristers have never been made accountable to any independent structure as solicitors have been since the foundation of the State.  Such fusion would also lead to the establishment of the barristers' profession on a statutory basis as is recommended so strongly by the Fair Trade Commission.  That commission fail to understand why what is inevitable and necessary for one arm of the profession &mdash; namely, the solicitors &mdash; has never been contemplated for the other arm.  The reason I advocate fusion so strongly and have done so in this House so often is not because I am a member of the solicitors' profession but because I believe that the Bar is one of, if not the most, conservative collection of workers in the country.  They are organised on a club basis, lodged in one location at the Bar Library.  Voices of independence and radicalism are quickly stifled and drawn into line.</P>
    <P>It is no accident that the main conservative parties in the country are heavily supported by barristers and they are to be seen to the fore in each of those parties.  This conservatism which is prevalent throughout the barristers' profession leads to conservative law and absence of challenge and independence. That is the central problem with maintaining the barristers' profession independent of and without fusion with solicitors.  Their innate, conservative existence leads to the development and advancement of a very conservative attitude to law, a law which lacks challenge or independence.</P>
    <P>It is this independence that is used as the one real asset of the Bar and as the reason it should be allowed continue under its existing structures.  It is, we are told, representative of a bulwark against administrative oppression.  There is no real security from the libertarian to be found anywhere in the Bar.  Ironically, it is those with some modicum of independence who argue this point the <Col N="54" /> strongest.  The club structure is inward looking in every respect.  What other factor gives rise to the Bar adhering to ancient traditions of meal eating as a means of admission to their practice or of the wearing of wig and gowns to everyday work?  The Bar has proclaimed itself as an institution that never intends and is never willing to change.  It is remarkable that no Government and no Minister has ever challenged its existence.  It is clear that that profession is intertwined with the political structures of the day and is in no way independent.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons I believe the continued existence of the Bar is not in the interests of the overall delivery of a comprehensive legal service to the consumer. The two arms of the profession should be fused into one efficient outward looking modern body, thus providing a cost effective service for the public at large.  I have to acknowledge that the Fair Trade Commission do not emphatically call for the fusion of the professions as I do, but they note in their report that there is a great deal of merit in a gradual move towards such a fusion. They do not see merit in the argument against fusing the professions from the viewpoint of delivery of a service.  The Fair Trade Commission conclude at page 313 of their report:</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Commission does not consider that it would be unfair or contrary to the common good if there were to be a single, fused profession. Indeed, it believes that a fused profession might, without being a cause of concern, evolve gradually over time. In its view, nothing should be done to frustrate such a development.</P>
    <P>By totally ignoring and failing to address this issue, the Bill has put a major obstacle in the way of a gradual move towards fusion.  As the Minister has rightly pointed out, it is the rare occasion on which we come to deliberate on legislation in this area.  It will be a long time before we return to it again.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the Fair Trade Commission report, the Bar have issued an ultimatum that should Government dare <Col N="55" /> address any of the issues affecting their independent existence and cosy relationship in the Bar Library, they will revolt against Government.  It is quite clear that Government have run scared of the Bar yet again.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will be able to point out anything in the Bill that supports or suggests he is addressing any of the issues raised in the Fair Trade Commission report.</P>
      <P>I am dismayed by the Minister's failure to appoint an ombudsman to deal with the affairs of this important institution. Members of the public have campaigned long and hard for an ombudsman to deal with legal matters.  Section 15 provides for a system of independent adjudication. Section 15 (1) states the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; appoint an adjudicator and on Committee Stage I will be seeking to make this obligatory so that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; appoint such a person.  The section provides for an independent adjudicator to examine and investigate written allegations or complaints made by or on behalf of a member of the public.  The Minister has talked time and again about the practice in England, Scotland and Wales, but before they appointed a legal ombudsman, complaints were dealt with by a lay assessor.  I do not know where the Minister got the concept of an independent adjudicator but as he has borrowed so much else from English practice, I am surprised he did not draw on the concept of a lay assessor.</P>
      <P>Section 15 (1) provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations, <Col N="56" /> require the Society to establish, maintain and fund a scheme for the examination and investigation by an independent adjudicator of any written allegations or complaint made by or on behalf of a member of the public against the Society, concerning the handling by the Society of a complaint made to it by any person about a solicitor.</P>
    <P>The function of the adjudicator is simply to look at the way the Law Society have handled a complaint from a member of the public.  The adjudicator has no power or authority to investigate complaints or pursue an issue as far as the solicitor's office or elsewhere or to make representations to the Law Society directly on behalf of a client.  The functions of the adjudicator are to watch, sit in on and make representations about the overall conduct of matters generally.  That is far removed from the functions of the Ombudsman, as I understand it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to change the terms of reference of this minuscule office of adjudicator, I urge him at least to change the name from adjudicator to ombudsman.  Everybody believes this appointee should carry out the functions of an ombudsman.  We have been living with the office of Ombudsman and everybody knows what an ombudsman is and the public respect and admire the office of Ombudsman.  Anything less will do a disservice to the job expected of the person appointed under section 15.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have extended the existing remit of the Ombudsman to include legal affairs and the legal profession but consequent on that it would have been necessary to increase the powers and the resources available to the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman has been working under difficult conditions, nonetheless he has provided a very valuable and highly respected service and clearly his office is the most suitable vehicle to investigate the area.  There is no reason the services of the Ombudsman should not have been extended to cover the legal profession.  This would have <Col N="57" /> provided a simple, convenient administrative way of addressing this as the body of expertise is already in place. Many of them who are lawyers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The adjudicator is supposed to be an independent person but is it possible that independence rests in an office designed to adjudicate on matters of the Law Society which at the same time they have to fund?  The Minister says the reason for this is that the Law Society have failed to adequately police themselves and to maintain adequate standards.  I accept that as a reason for introducing an office of Ombudsman, but I am concerned that the Law Society should pay the piper.  I do not believe this will lead to the exercise of independence. In any event, the cost of providing the services of an adjudicator, while carried initially by the profession will be simply passed on as a cost to the consumer, the taxpayer, in increased fees.  That is inevitable and it happens in every area of service.</P>
      <P>Overheads and charges go up, costs increase and the cost to the consumer increases.  The charge of the ombudsman, although it may be carried by the society, will be passed on to the solicitors in an increased contribution to the registration fee and that will in time be passed down the line to the consumer who goes through the solicitor's door as a client. Therefore, the argument that the taxpayer is being protected does not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to think again.  If the desire is to have a seriously independent office operating in that regard then the office should be assured of independence in the full sense and its funding should come from a source outside of the organisation that it is to police.  That is not simply an attempt to save costs to the <Col N="58" /> society or the profession.  The Minister has pointed out that overall cost of maintenance of the office will not be onerous or excessive.  Therefore, the funding of the office should not come from the society.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that the opportunity to appoint an ombudsman is being missed and that in place of an ombudsman there will be a lesser creature, known as an adjudicator.  The function I envisaged for an ombudsman would not have been confined to the solicitors' profession but would have included responsibility to deal with legal services generally.  The ombudsman would have had the power, authority and responsibility to examine all aspects of legal services, not just services dealt with by solicitors but also those dealt with by barristers.  The ombudsman would deal with issues that would arise in the course of the administration of justice and the way the listing system, which has been refered to, and other systems operated by the courts in the administration of justice were dealt with.  The ombudsman would have the authority to make recommendations and present them to the societies, the Bar, the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Minister to be acted upon.  Those authorities and bodies would have responsibility to take on board what was suggested.</P>
    <P>I always understood the office of ombudsman to be an office that would take on individual causes and complaints and pursue them to a satisfactory end. That is not what is proposed in section 15.  I had thought that the office to be set up would have the authority to make recommendations and insist that actions be taken and systems be changed to improve the system.  Again, that is not envisaged in the Bill.  For those reasons, the Minister has copped out and has, in fact, misled the House and the public when he said he was bowing to the pressures and demands for the establishment of an ombudsman when he is doing something entirely different.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are by and large, happy with the provisions in relation to <Col N="59" /> the discipline and policing of the profession. The measures providing for different systems, and in particular the extension of what amounts to misconduct, are to be welcomed.  How often in the past did those of us who tried to pursue with the Law Society the interests of an aggrieved client get in response a standard letter stating that while what has been complained of amounted to shoddy or non-professional practice and while it might have been negligent &mdash; which was a matter for another tribunal or court &mdash; it did not amount to misconduct in the concept of the Society and, therefore, the Society had no responsibility and nothing could be done?  The frequency with which such standard letters was issued, in some of the most remarkable circumstances, has inevitably led to the law being amended in the way suggested by the Minister in the Bill.  That change is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The inclusion in the concept of misconduct of the overcharging of fees to clients is particularly welcome.  I am sure other Deputies will give specific illustrations of the many times we hear of the highway robbery &mdash; that is the only way I could describe the practice &mdash; carried out by some solicitors on their clients. Solicitors have used devices such as the percentage fee charged on top of the collection of fees from the losing party in an action.  They introduced a demand for the payment of a top-up percentage fee on the day that a client went to the office to collect his or her compensation cheque, resulting in clients facing the proapect of a compensation cheque not being handed over unless agreement was reached.  Another device used has been that of solicitors' retaining a client's cheque and handing out their own cheque for a lower amount, allowing for the virtual robbery out of clients' pockets of their hard-earned and awarded moneys. A provision should have been included in the Bill stating that the cheque sent by a losing party &mdash; whether that party be an insurance company, an individual or some other organisation &mdash; should be <Col N="60" /> physically handed over and delivered up to the client.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of lodging such cheques into a solicitors' account and keeping them on deposit within the solicitors' firm for a period, which may run into some weeks if not months, to be later delivered over without reference to the amount of interest earned is grossly unfair and represents dishonesty.  That matter should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to outlaw &mdash; a word I use advisedly &mdash; the use of the percentage fee system.  The concept used is 10 per cent but, unfortunately, 20 per cent, 25 per cent and higher percentages, we do not hear about, because people simply do not know how to complain, were used. Indeed, if such complaints were made, the answer of the Law Society to date has been that the matter was regrettable but did not amount to misconduct in their concept and that there was, therefore, nothing they could do.  The Law Society would refer an aggrieved party to the Taxing Master and, again, substantial fees would be required to pursue the matter.  What has happened time and again is that clients, often under pressure because they had borrowed on the strength of an upcoming settlement, took the cheque, slammed the solicitor's door but did nothing else in their anger over what had occurred.</P>
      <P>Many such practices are being addressed and will be stamped out by the absolute ban on the percentage charge fee and the power and, more important, the responsibility of the Law Society to treat over-charging in such circumstances as amounting to misconduct.</P>
      <P>The Bill should provide a maximum time limit that a settlement cheque may be retained in a solicitor's office before being handed over at the request of the client.  Any undue delay in that regard should amount to an act of misconduct and should be inquired into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to appoint lay members to the disciplinary <Col N="61" /> committee.  However, I am concerned about the way it is intended to appoint those members.  In effect, the Minister will nominate his own to that committee and no person should be appointed to the committee in that way.  There are well-established organisations and associations within the community who should have the power to nominate their representatives to the disciplinary committee. In that regard I am thinking particularly of the Consumers Association and other consumer organisations, of bodies acting in the interests of clients of the legal profession and of institutions such as trade unions and the Federated Union of Employers, representing business and professionals.  Through that mechanism I will be proposing, on Committee Stage, that people be appointed as lay members to that committee.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the mandatory insurance provision in this Bill.  Indeed, it is something that should be required of every person working in a professional area, holding themselves out as persons with professional expertise &mdash; no matter what the area &mdash; that they have this expertise but are also supported by a reasonable policy of indemnity insurance to hedge themselves against misconduct or failure to act properly on behalf of their clients.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other provisions in this general area of the powers of the Law Society to intervene at early and advanced stages with regard to practices and their conduct, with regard to the right to investigate bank accounts and also the right to insist that moneys be laid on deposit where necessary.</P>
    <P>The provision with regard to the three year minimum qualification period before a person can set up practice is a very good one and has been long overdue. It is coupled with the saving clause that the Law Society, in certain circumstances, can consent &mdash; and there are circumstances in which it would be prudent and proper &mdash; that a person be allowed establish practice where they have not been qualified for three years <Col N="62" /> or more.  It is proper that the Law Society have the power to do that.</P>
    <P>I am happy also that the Minister is addressing the position and status of a person to be re-employed in the legal profession in any capacity having been once struck off the roll for misconduct. Heretofore the practice that a solicitor struck off the roll could delegate a junior assistant to run the office while in reality he or she operated the practice behind that facade was completely objectionable and unacceptable.  The direct employment of people in a legal profession or practice, where they have been struck off the roll on issues of dishonesty, begs the question in regard to the legislation.</P>
    <P>In the particular area in which I practise it is and has been a source of gross annoyance to me that where, in the past, the President of the High Court has struck solicitors off the roll for misconduct or professional malpractice, nonetheless he has entitled them to limited practice as solicitors in the criminal legal aid area.  That has always reflected on that area of practice as suggesting that it is an area requiring lower standards and less vigilance on the part of the professional; while a solicitor is not capable and competent to deal with the money and accounts of a client, nonetheless he or she is regarded as competent to deal with the liberty and rights of the individual. I could never understand that line of thinking and reasoning.  Indeed, it is offensive to those who practise in the legal aid area, in particular the criminal legal aid area, to see solicitors fired from the profession because of their lack of competence &mdash; or more particularly because of dishonesty &mdash; being given permission to come before the law courts and the other criminal courts to practise as criminal legal aid solicitors, as has happened on occasions in the past.  I am glad to note that this issue is being addressed, at least in part, in the Bill.  I intend to table amendments to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In this general area it is about time that the issue of practising certificates was properly addressed.  For too long, and there are still today, solicitors have <Col N="63" /> presented themselves as competent to practise in the area and deliver legal services generally when they do not carry the licence or authority of the Law Society in the form of a practising certificate in order to operate.  The Law Society themselves have been negligent in this area in not being able to ensure that solicitors' accounts are delivered to them within a reasonable period, properly accounted for and certified annually.  Consequently, there are people in practice whose accounts for periods going back five and six years have not been settled with the Law Society.  Then when major frauds and problems arise for the profession, we wonder how this can happen.  If we are ever to police this area properly we must ensure that annual accounts are lodged promptly, that one does not receive a practising certificate until one's accounts have been lodged with and approved by the Law Society so that, in turn, one cannot practise without a certificate because if one does, one is guilty of gross misconduct.  All that is provided for in sections 19, 20 and 55 of the Bill, which is long overdue and much to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the extension of certain services to the banking institutions and trust management companies or corporations.  I do not think any objection in principle can be taken to such an extension.  The Fair Trade Commission argue that monopoly, where it is unjustifiable, unsupported, where it is not in the interests of the consumer or the common good, cannot and should not be stood over.  The Minister takes that point on board and proceeds to deal with it.  What concerns me is that the same regime of guarantee, security and compensation, when things go wrong, will not be in existence when a body, other than a solicitor's practice or profession is dealing with it.  For example, the compensation fund, indemnity insurance, the policing and control by the Law Society, will not be available under the provisions of the Bill as at present drafted.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister suggests, that his regulations in this general area, when introduced, will ensure that the services <Col N="64" /> to be provided by these institutions must be done under the supervision of an &ldquo;inhouse&rdquo; solicitor properly qualified.  The Minister departed from his text at that point; he may have used the phrase &mdash; by a lawyer properly qualified.  A lawyer &mdash; it could be a barrister, a legal executive or someone academically qualified &mdash; supervising the work will not necessarily bring them within the controls and safeguards to be provided by the Law Society under the provisions of this Bill.  Therefore, the Minister needs to be more explicit about that.  Because it is of such central importance it should be an active provision of the Bill to be introduced on Committee Stage and not left to be dealt with under the relevant regulations.  The Law Society, the Members of this House and the public deserve at least that fundamental consideration &mdash; that whatever the Minister proposes in terms of ensuring the extension of the existing safeguards provided by the profession will be extended to these types of services when provided by banks or other organisations, that that be an active part of the Bill as opposed to being left to regulations to be introduced at some later date.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider that important point.</P>
    <P>I take the point also raised by Deputy Seán Barrett with regard to potential conflicts of interests where, for example, a trust corporation or a bank is given the power and authority to regulate and deal with the moneys of a client already featuring in their accounts, to be disposed of and dealt with.  There have been many instances of banks having been shown to withdraw moneys from accounts to be used for other purposes in the short term. They have authority to do so in certain circumstances within standard banking practices, that of moving money around, to fill a gap here or a need there and then rejuggle such moneys within their general reserve as the market fluctuates or demand requires.  For example, how would the interests of a client depositor, who is also availing of their probate and trust administration facilities, stand in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>These are issues that must be clarified <Col N="65" /> by the Minister before my party will agree to the extension of these powers in this general area.  As I said, there is no objection in general or in principle to the idea of the extension of these services. Indeed, I would say to the Law Society and their members that the way to approach the extension of these provisions is to be positive about them, to see them not as an attack on their institution or establishment but rather as a challenge requiring them to improve their service, to render their service more cost effective and efficient.  They have a very substantial head start on their competitors and if they get into the field more actively, efficiently and effectively, they will have little difficulty in beating off competition from all comers.  If, on the other hand, they whinge that their spoils are being taken away, they will be left behind.  One-stop shops and other institutions will emerge which will be far more cost effective and attractive to the consumer than anything the profession has been providing to date.  It is a challenge the profession can and should take up and it will lead in time to a much better service to the public.</P>
    <P>The issue of legal education has been crying out for action by the Department for a long time.  It is an area which has been so grossly neglected that it verges on the criminal.  Access to the solicitors profession has been opened up to some extent in recent times simply because a particular student had the temerity, the courage and, some might say, the unbelievable neck to challenge in the Supreme Court the society to which he was seeking admission to qualify as a solicitor.  I had direct dealings with the individual involved because he was for a time my apprentice before I came into this House.  I advised him time and again to hold back from what he was attempting to do.  It was David taking on Goliath. The amount of correspondence, the pressures and the way in which the society so vigorously challenged those proceedings, as they were entitled to do, led me to believe that he was on a hiding to nothing.  Ultimately his persistence and the good work of his lawyers won the <Col N="66" /> day and the society recognised that they had to come into this century, with less than a decade of it remaining.</P>
    <P>It should always have been the case that anyone with a third level legal degree from a recognised university or institution had the right to go on to study to be a solicitor and to participate in that profession.  During the seventies when the Law Society were in the process of establishing their fine law school at Blackhall Place, the universities attempted to negotiate with them.  The society, however, were not interested because they did not want to lose control of the numbers who would be admitted annually into the profession.  That to them was the single major issue.  It had nothing to do with the delivery of the service or the adequacy of the service on a geographical or other basis; it had nothing to do with providing the lawyers who could be employed by Government in the delivery of a national civil and criminal legal aid scheme; it had nothing to do with the quality of the education to be provided or with co-operation and co-ordination with other legal education institutions.  It had to do only with maintaining a closed shop, controlling admission and ensuring that the cake would be divided as generously as possible among as few as possible.  That was the single guiding principle.</P>
    <P>The universities said that the Law Society were belittling their degrees and putting them in an invidious position because they could not guarantee their graduates the ultimate right to move on into the professions by access to the Law Society and the King's Inns.  My criticism of the Law Society applies equally to that anachronistic institution, the King's Inns. The Law Society would not negotiate with the universities and insisted on keeping their numbers at a particular level. When they tried to impose that in 1987-88, the student I have mentioned complained that the marking of one of the seven or eight papers he sat was unfair. The whole issue was brought before the courts and the Law Society were forced to give in.  If ever a kingdom was lost for the want of a nail, here was one.  Had the <Col N="67" /> Law Society negotiated and been reasonable and amenable to the representations of the student or of myself as his then master, they would not be in the current position.</P>
    <P>Every graduate of a university or third level institution with a recognised law degree now has the right of admission to Blackhall Place and the opportunity to study to be a solicitor, but there is one additional requirement, namely, that person be apprenticed.  What is now happening is that the opportunity to take on apprentices is drying up.  Despite the fact that the Minister provides for multiple apprentices to be taken on in large firms, the society and their members are conspiring to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> Students and their parents are coming to my advice centres, perhaps because they know I was at one stage a solicitor and am still a member of the Law Society, asking if I can find an apprenticeship opportunity for themselves or their children. Solicitors who are interested in maintaining a small profession will simply refuse to take on apprentices and ensure by that device that numbers will be kept in check.</P>
    <P>The same kind of problem exists in the barristers' profession.  The Fair Trade Commission were solid in their recommendation when they stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission considers that there should be a common vocational course for solicitors and barristers, with the minimum of separate training....</P>
    <P>The Commission recommends that there be established, as a matter of urgency, by the Minister for Justice, an Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Training, charged with reviewing the education and training of lawyers at all stages and with implementing a system of common vocational training, and comprised of a majority of non-lawyers.</P>
    <P>They argue for the establishment of an institute of legal education and say that common vocational training should considerably facilitate the interchange of persons between the two branches at a <Col N="68" /> later stage.  It goes on to say that the Irish language requirement, that ridiculous anachronism which still exists, should be abolished and that the EC Directive on mutual recognition of higher diplomas should be implemented in a liberal rather than restrictive way.</P>
    <P>What does this Bill, this majestic monument to years of work by the Minister, have to say in this regard?  It contains a half-hearted and shifty provision which says that the Law Society may, if they wish, co-operate with other persons or institutions in providing common legal education and legal educational services. There is no reference to the other arm of the profession, the barristers.  No recognition is given to the fact that fusion of the educational process would lead to a better understanding between the two arms of the profession about their respective jobs and functions, facilitate interchange which in time can only lead to a better delivery of service and, more important, would be a first step towards fusing the professions which is an essential prerequisite of a modern, efficient and cost-effective service.</P>
    <P>The Irish language requirement is preposterous in this day and age.  I recognise that the Minister is lifting this requirement for people outside Ireland who wish to come here to practise as solicitors. The maintenance of the Irish language requirement by both societies with a view to ensuring that every solicitor, judge and official is proficient in the use of Irish before our courts is ridiculous.  I know people who arrived from Africa one day, started their legal studies the next and within one year or less sat their Irish exam and passed it because they had learned off a few basic phrases.  The stories told about the fun one can have at oral Irish exams either at the Bar or Law Society are legend if not multitudinous. Lip service is paid by the professions to this requirement, and the Minister knows that well.</P>
    <P>One Government Minister insists that this ridiculous anachronism should remain.  He was referred to as a pedant by the Taoiseach the other day.  The Minister for Justice should be realistic <Col N="69" /> and modern in his outlook and say to that pedant, or any other obscurist within the Government, that we and the professions have to move on.  The nonsensical compulsory Irish requirement which has been long abolished in schools and elsewhere should be abolished in this area also.  This is not to say that people who want their proceedings conducted in Irish should not be entitled to hire a lawyer or solicitor to do this.  I went through the legal system and I passed the Law Society's Irish requirements without much difficulty. However, if I was asked to conduct proceedings in Irish I would have to tell that person to find another solicitor as I would not be prepared to do so.  It is not that I am not prepared to do it, I simply cannot do it.  I could not do justice to a legal issue before a court or anywhere in Irish and I am not prepared to make pretences in that regard.</P>
    <P>The EC Directive on mutual recognition requires us to have regard to the fact that we are now a member of a community of nations which has a diversity of languages, structures and educational systems.  It is ridiculous to think that we still place this mandatory requirement in relation to Irish on our citizens when we will not apply it to other Community citizens who wish to study here. I say that with the greatest respect for the language.  I believe we would do a greater service to the Irish language if we abolished the anachronistic structures which, if anything, do more to bring it into disrepute than develop it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look at a problem in relation to the discipline of solicitors, the inadequacy of the existing fraud laws to deal with solicitors who misappropriate or wrongly handle their clients' funds while in their accounts.  I understand that when the fraud squad visit a solicitor's office in the course of an investigation and make inquiries a solicitor has the opportunity of saying that he moved money from the account but it will be moved back to the account or he never intended to permanently deprive the owner client of the money.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister introduced an offence at criminal law for the handling <Col N="70" /> by solicitors of clients' money in ways other than they are authorised to do in writing.  This should be made a strict liability offence.  A solicitor who has money on account on behalf of a client should ensure that it remains on account for that client exclusively.  If the money is moved or used in any other way by the solicitor that should become an offence under criminal law.  The inclusion of such a provision in the Bill would underline the point that solicitors who handle money above and beyond the instructions given to them are being dishonest and criminal in their activities and should be made answerable to the criminal law.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the issue of advertising which has been dealt with by the Minister in the Bill and elsewhere.  I support, as do my party, the position set out by the Commission on Fair Trade in their report.  I will not quote it unnecessarily; it is there for the Minister and Deputies to read.  Restrictions in this area should be lifted.  The worries of the Law Society in this regard are somewhat unnecessary.  I do not believe standards will be reduced.  The Bill takes on board what the Fair Trade Commission said in regard to their right to regulate the overall content and style of advertising so as to ensure there will not be a lowering of standards or of the public regard for the profession generally.  This is a useful way to approach the issue.  However, the one area of discord relates to advertising of the fee.  Advertising, by its very nature, must inform and the public are entitled to know in general terms what they can expect by way of costs.  If one takes out the so-called ambulance chaser from the regime what is left in place is responsible and workable and reflects the ongoing modernisation of the profession.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Bill as proposed for the very grave and fundamental reasons I have outlined.  Nonetheless the Bill represents an advancement in regard to one arm of the profession generally and legal services on the whole.  I look forward to working with the Minister in the Special Committee.  I hope he will not simply confine himself to dealing with drafting, typographical or constructional <Col N="71" /> amendments but will be amenable to addressing some of the more fundamental issues which will be raised so that the Special Committee will be a working committee in the way I have suggested.</P>

      <P>Tá sé an-deacair figiúir mar sin a thabhairt.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana, is é an t-aon fhoinse atá agam ná daonáireamh 1986 nuair a cuireadh in iúl go raibh suas le milliún duine ábalta Gaeilge a labhairt.  Ní hionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil líofacht Ghaeilge acu.  An daonáireamh a bhí ann le déanaí, cuireadh ceist ar dhaoine faoi chumas Gaeilge: cén líon daoine nach raibh ach Gaeilge acu, a raibh Gaeilge agus Béarla acu, agus an líon daoine a raibh léamh na Gaeilge acu ach nach raibh ar a gcumas í a labhairt.  Nuair a bheidh toradh an daonáirimh sin ar fáil beidh eolas níos cruinne againn, ach níl eolas cruinn againn faoi láthair.</P>

      <P>An bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta leis na modhanna múinte atá againn faoi láthair maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Tá daltaí na tíre seo ag freastal ar scoil ar feadh níos mó ná dhá bhliain déag ach ní bhíonn ach fíorbheagán Gaeilge ag an mórchuid acu.  An bhfuil tú sásta leis na modhanna múinte, agus ní an caighdeán amháin atá i gceist agam, ach na modhanna múinte iad féin.  Bíonn cuid de na daltaí seo in ann Fraincis, Gearmáinis agus Spáinnis a fhoghlaim ag an am céanna agus díospóireacht bheith acu sna teangacha sin.  An raibh baint ag an Aire Stáit leis an Roinn Oideachais maidir leis na modhanna múinte Gaeilge atá ann faoi láthair?</P>

      <P>Níl baint agamsa go pearsanta leis an churaclam, ach caithfidh mé a rá nach bhféadfaí bheidh sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh maidir le leathadh na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Is ceist í seo a chuirtear go minic: bíonn daoine ag freastal ar scoil ar feadh dhá bhliain déag, agus cuid mhaith acu siúd ag leanúint ar aghaidh ar mheánscoil agus ar ollscoil agus gan líofacht na Gaeilge bheith acu tar éis sin ar fad.  Tá ceist thábhachtach ansin.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil an Fhraincis, an Ghearmáinis agus teangacha eile á múineadh sna meánscoileanna agus go bhfuil na teangacha sin ag daoine ach ní hionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil siad acu go líofa ach an oiread.  Ionas go mbeadh daoine in ann <Col N="73" /> an Ghaeilge a labhairt go líofa ba cheart go mbeadh atmaisféar ceart, ní amháin sa scoil, ach lasmuigh den scoil chomh maith.  Ní shílim gur féidir an locht a chur ar na múinteoirí ná ar an chóras. Caithfear a rá go bhfuil an-bhéim á cur anois ar na canúintí éagsúla.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil fadhb ansin, go bhfuil leabhair ann agus gan an chumas daoine, abair, ó réigiúin éagsúla mar an tuaisceart nó an deisceart nó ón iarthar iad a thuiscint, ó thaobh na gcanúintí de.  I láthair na huaire tá eagraíocht na scoileanna Gaeilge ag obair air seo.  Lainseáil mé féin leabhar le déanaí i gcanúint Dhún na nGall agus tá súil agam go gcuideoidh sé sin leis na daltaí.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to comments made in the newsletter of PDFORRA (details supplied) which suggest that those who run and administer the Defence Forces show a lack of willingness to comply not so much with the letter of agreements reached, but the spirit in which they were reached; if he intends to take any steps to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of representative associations is one of the most significant and far-reaching developments to have taken place in the Permanent Defence Force in recent times.</P>
      <P>The Defence Force Regulations which provide for the representative arrangements were signed by my predecessor last May.  In a minute accompanying the regulations he reiterated the commitment of the Government to the new arrangements and emphasised that the active co-operation of all concerned would be required to put the new institutional arrangements in place, and to do so without interfering with the essential ethos of the Defence Forces and the traditional values enshrined in that ethos.</P>
      <P>In the short time since the making of the regulations on 16 May 1991, very substantial progress in the implementation of the representative structures has been achieved.  At national level, very considerable rapport has been built up between representatives of my Department, including representatives of the military authorities and the two associations &mdash; PDFORRA and RACO.  Meetings are taking place at that level on a regular basis in a business-like and cordial way.  The arrangements for the holding of meetings between the appropriate military authorities and the local representatives at barracks and command levels have also been put in place and it is anticipated that, with the development of representation at these levels, some of the issues which hitherto have been processed at national level will be discussed and disposed of at the other levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since assuming office, I have met with members of the national executive of <Col N="78" /> each of the two associations &mdash; PDFORRA and RACO &mdash; and they have advised me of the progress made in the implementation of the representative structures.  I have also met representatives of the associations at barracks level during visits to barracks.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the development of the representative structures, which are provided for in the regulations drawn up in agreement with the representatives of members of the Permanent Defence Force, is proceeding satisfactorily.  I have every confidence that all who participate in them will do so in a positive spirit and that in time representation will prove to be a very beneficial development for the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the new Minister and wish him well in his portfolio. I appreciate that the new Minister for Defence has taken the opportunity to fully endorse the establishment of the representative associations as outlined in the legislation, but he has not said if he is aware of the comments in the PDFORRA newsletter of November where a substantial complaint was made that there is no co-operation not only within the Defence Forces but within the Department towards meeting the associations and negotiating with them.  Can the Minister confirm whether, as yet, the General Command staff of the Defence Forces have met with the national elected officers of PDFORRA to discuss issues of common interest?  This meeting has been sought for some time but has not been granted to PDFORRA because the Defence Forces staff insist that the representatives present themselves in uniform despite the regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to meeting with the National Command of General Staff, the Assistant Chief of Staff attends meetings at national level on a regular basis and he acts as liaison between the national forum and the General Staff, briefing them on relevant issues.  While there have been meetings at HQ level with representatives of the General Staff there has not been a meeting between members of the General Staff and the national executive of the association. This was one of the points I discussed with the executive of PDFORRA at my meeting last week.  I am aware of the difficulty there and it is my intention to pursue the difficulty and have the matter resolved at an early stage.</P>

Will he consider engaging in a small scheme of promotion with regard to educating all the soldiers as to the importance and usefulness of this procedure?  Will he give a lead with regard to the importance of this structure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very strong evidence of willing co-operation of the military authorities with representative associations.  This structure is new to the members of PDFORRA and to the General Staff.  Obviously there are teething problems.  However, we should not overlook the fact that tremendous progress has been made in a short time.  Confirmation of that progress was given to me by the national executives of the two associations.  There are still some outstanding matters of which I am aware, and it is my intention to endeavour to <Col N="80" /> have the difficulties resolved as quickly as possible because it is very important that co-operation should continue in the interests of the Defence Forces and their members.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Defence Force Regulations A. 14 &mdash; Seirbhís Altranais An Airm &mdash; contain, in relation to the Army Nursing Service, provisions in regard to appointments, pay and allowances, discipline, leave &mdash; including maternity leave &mdash; resignation, termination of service, uniform, etc. of the members.</P>
      <P>Specifically in regard to maternity leave the position of members of the Army Nursing Service is that they are granted the same leave allowances as employees in the public service generally &mdash; 14 weeks on full pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish the Minister well in his new appointment and he can be sure of our support as far as it goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the existing equality legislation, namely, the Anti-Discrimination Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, which outline discrimination on grounds of sex and on marital status in <Col N="81" /> employment, would the Minister accept that his Department, and indeed the Government, are in breach of the general principles of that legislation when one considers that a male nurse who recently applied for a position in the nursing service was not even afforded the opportunity of an interview because he was a man?  Given that discrimination, would he be in a position to consider that case? Will he accept that there is grave discrimination there and will he indicate how he proposes to deal with this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already pointed out, the terms and provisions are very similar to those prevailing in the general health services.  In relation to the matter the Deputy mentioned I am not fully aware of it.  The regulations contain provisions which are set out in detail, relating to the employment of members of the Army Nursing Service.  The provisions relate to various matters such as appointments, pay and allowances, discipline, sick leave, maternity leave, etc.  The regulations are set out in such a way as to take cognisance of all aspects of service, particularly in relation to equality between the Army Nursing Service and the general health service.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and he lets me have the details, I will be glad to look into it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome the opportunity to outline that case to the Minister. Will the Minister accept that the regulations pertaining to the Army Nursing Service as outlined in A14 are outdated and outmoded, particularly in the context of members retiring on marriage and candidates for appointment being unmarried or widowed?  That is what is in the document the Department have to work on. While acknowledging that the Defence Forces are not covered by the equality legislation, I put it to the Minister that the principle of equality must be contained in that document.  I ask him to meet the representatives of the staff in question, internal and external, to ensure that the principle of equality is contained in that <Col N="82" /> document.  The point has been made briefly and I would ask for a response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12, 20 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the end of October 1991 Irish troops or positions in UNIFIL have come under fire on eight occasions.  All of these firings have been attributed to the <i>de facto</i> forces.  The most serious incident, which occurred on 15 November 1991, <Col N="84" /> resulted in the death of Corporal Michael McCarthy and the wounding of Private Richard McGrath.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs met the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland on 19 November 1991 to express the Government's deep sense of shock and anger at this incident.  This was the correct and appropriate way in which to have conveyed to the Israeli authorities at the highest level the deep displeasure and grave concern of the Irish Government at the killing and wounding of Irish soldiers. At the same time, assurances were sought regarding the control of the <i>de facto</i> forces and the steps necessary to prevent a recurrence.  It may be taken that the incident has been protested to the Israeli authorities on behalf of the Government at the highest level and in the strongest possible terms.  The incident was also the subject of a strong official protest by the United Nations Secretariat to the israeli Permanent Representative on 18 November.</P>
    <P>Protests in respect of all firings and other serious incidents involving the <i>de facto</i> forces or the Israeli Defence Forces are made through UNIFIL Headquarters to the Israeli authorities.</P>
    <P>All developments affecting the safety of Irish personnel serving in UNIFIL are closely monitored and security procedures are continually reviewed.  Prior to departure on overseas service, troops undergo a comprehensive training programme which is specifically designed to assist them in carrying out their peace-keeping duties with maximum protection. Personnel are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment. Operating procedures in Lebanon are geared to provide maximum safety for our troops.  Irish positions are defensively fortified and bunker facilities are provided for all personnel.  Every effort will continue to be made to ensure the greatest possible protection for our troops on overseas service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply, particularly in relation to the present defence positions that are being taken to ensure as much <Col N="85" /> security as possible for our soldiers.  In the past, the Minister for Foreign Affairs made strong objections to the Israeli Ambassador and so have the UN.  Those channels have been gone through in relation to the previous eight attacks on Irish troops in Lebanon but unfortunately, they seem to have been of no avail.  The end result has been that this misfortunate member of the Army, Corporal McCarthy, was killed and Corporal McGrath was wounded.  While those protests have been made, and the Minister has made a protest very recently, they seem to have been ineffective since a member of the Irish Army has been killed, is the Minister in a position to meet the Israeli Minister for Defence and, indeed any other member of the Israeli Government soon to register directly the strongest possible protest about the appalling behaviour of the <i>de facto</i> forces in Lebanon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective and appropriate way to convey the Government's feelings and views to the Israeli Government is through our Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Israeli Ambassador. The Minister made a very strong case, objected very strongly and conveyed the serious concern of the Government about recent happenings in Lebanon.  I understand that the Israeli military authorities sent, for the first time, a message of sympathy and regret to our military authorities.  When I visited Lebanon in 1988 I took the opportunity to visit Israel to meet with the then Israeli Minister for Defence, Mr. Rabin, when I conveyed to him in the strongest possible terms the Government's concern and objections to the methods applied by the Israelis in South Lebanon.  A large number of incidents have occurred since then.  Indeed, since the killing of Corporal McCarthy, there has been a number of less serious incidents in South Lebanon, again, involving <i>de facto</i> forces. I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government are concerned about these incidents.  Should they continue to occur we will lodge, in the most <Col N="86" /> forceful manner possible, our protests and objections.  The Government will obviously also have to consider what other action can be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Department, an assistant principal officer deals with communications with the media on a part-time basis.  Routine inquiries are normally dealt with without formal reference to any higher authority.  Where necessary, approval for statements is normally given by the head of the section dealing with the subject matter.  Any formal statements issued on behalf of the Minister would, of course, be cleared by me in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the Defence Forces, media <Col N="87" /> communications are handled by the Defence Forces press officer &mdash; a commandant &mdash; who has a deputy holding the rank of captain and a staff of one sergeant.  The Defence Forces press officer has a delegated authority to make statements in response to media inquiries about military matters which do not have major financial or policy implications. Again, in practice, the majority of inquiries are dealt with without formal reference to higher authority for approval.</P>
    <P>In each of the four Army Commands and in the Air Corps and Naval Service, officers are appointed as part-time press officers.  In addition, in certain circumstances, a commander in an operational situation may make factual statements to the media pertaining to his own immediate command.</P>
    <P>Quite separately, Defence Forces regulations give the two representative associations which have been established to represent military personnel on pay and certain conditions of service the right to make statements to the media on matters which fall within the scope of the system of representation.  There is, of course, no obligation to obtain official clearance for such statements.</P>

The arrangements now in place for dealing with the media broadly conform with the Gleeson recommendations and the great majority of media inquiries are dealt with by the Defence Forces press office without any reference to the Minister or anybody in the Department.  The Defence Forces press office, which formerly formed part of the Office of the Director of Intelligence, now forms part of a new public relations section which reports to the assistant Chief of Staff.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18 and 22 together.  A total of 15 women have been recruited to the Permanent Defence Force to date in 1991.  Of this total seven were apprentices, six were cadets, one was a dental officer and one a chemist.</P>
      <P>The number of women enlisted in the FCÁ to date is 196.  The enlistment of a further four women is currently in progress. This will bring the total of female FCÁ personnel to 200.</P>
      <P>The female FCÁ recruits are being assigned to an FCÁ basic training course the syllabus for which is the same in all respects as that used for male FCÁ recruits.  Women in the FCÁ will fill a range of appointments subject to the same restrictions that apply to women serving in the Permanent Defence Force whereby women do not serve in appointments which would require them to undertake operational duties.  In practice this means that women will be mainly employed in service corps units such as signals, supply and transport, military policy and the medical corps.</P>
      <P>A military board is at present carrying out a review of the whole question of the employment of women in the Defence Forces.</P>

Would the Minister explain the reason there has been this substantial fall-off?  Can he advise the House if he intends to introduce a quota for the overall number of female members in the Defence Forces and would he not agree that this would be the most effective way of ensuring that we redress this antiquated and antediluvian attitude on the part of the Government which keeps women out of the Defence Forces?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of his predecessors gave a commitment in this House that he would seriously examine the question of involving women in duties other than service duties?  He also said he hoped to be in a position shortly to make an announcement that women would be involved in the Army and FCÁ in operational duties. Has progress been made in that regard? It was suggested earlier this year that 500 women would be recruited to the FCÁ in 1991.  Has this been done?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether 200 females were enlisted in the FCÁ this year and, if so, will more women be recruited next spring?  Is the Minister happy with the provision of non-officers' sleeping and toilet facilities in the various establishments at Glen of Imaal, Gormanston and Castlebar for FCÁ personnel, particularly females?

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>So far this year 196 women have been recruited to the FCÁ and a further four are being recruited at present, which will bring the number to 200, in line with the undertaking given.  I am not happy with the facilities.  A great deal of work and expenditure will be involved in bringing them up to a reasonable and acceptable standard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the Minister's answer to my question in regard to the minimum quota of women in the Defence Forces is one of the items which will be the subject matter of the committee of review on the recruitment of women to the Defence Forces?  Some time ago we were advised in the House that it was not intended to recruit female members to the Naval Service.  Will the Minister indicate whether that is still the position?  If so, what steps will be taken to end this invidious discrimination against female members of the community who wish to serve at sea on behalf of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, duties in the Naval Service are mainly of an operational nature and, consequently, <Col N="93" /> there has not been any recruitment of women to the Naval Service.  This is in line with the general policy which I outlined of the non-recruitment of women in operational areas in the Permanent Defence Force.  I should point out that all Naval Service personnel are required to serve at sea and the limitations in regard to space on naval vessels make it very difficult &mdash; and indeed impracticable &mdash; for male and female crew members to have separate accommodation.  There are difficulties and problems of a practical nature in that regard.  The whole matter is under consideration by the review group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that his explanation of difficulties in accommodating men and women aboard naval ships is a spurious justification which is not available to any other employer of men and women in the workplace?  Will he agree it is time the Government recognised they are hiding behind a very embarrassing reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that it is unreasonable.  If women are employed in a particular occupation there should be certain standards, indeed I would insist on them.  In those circumstances, it is not unreasonable to state the reasons for not being able to accommodate them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an operational matter and not one in which the Minister would wish to intrude.  It is a matter for the military authorities.  They recently made a submission to the Department regarding the implementation of directives in regard to information which envisages the suppression or replacement of other types of established posts.  The Defence Forces are not standing still, changes and reviews are taking place and it is a question of making progress and moving into a new era.  As far as the FCÁ are concerned, I assure the Deputy that there is no question of disbanding them. It is a question of operational tactics by the military authorities and they are the people who know exactly what should be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

However, I will convey the views of Members to the military authorities if the Deputy wishes me to do so.  The FCÁ are changing very rapidly and the fact that a colonel is not in charge of a command does not mean that a lieutenant colonel does not have clout.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 23, 44, 49, 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated by my predecessor in reply to a parliamentary question on 31 October 1991, the Efficiency Audit Group recommended the establishment of a review team to examine the administrative structures and systems within the Defence Forces with terms of reference which he outlined.  The team has been set up and its deliberations which are proceeding extend into the areas of the management of resources, securing economies particularly as regards the number of military personnel engaged in administrative duties, the simplification of procedures, arrangements for financial management and delegation of authority as well as the use of information technology. As regards the various other recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group, particulars of which were given to the House on 31 October 1991, these are being examined with particular reference to the likely legislative implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile there have been various developments in the matter of financial delegation to the Defence Forces on an ongoing basis.  I propose to circulate in the Official Report a detailed statement of the major items which have already been delegated.  In the area of Defence Forces' allowances the authorisation of expenditure of the order of £15.6 million <Col N="99" /> per annum is managed by the military authorities.</P>
    <P>Further areas of administration which might be delegated are being examined and as the implications of delegation are identified and suitable administrative systems are established within the Defence Forces they will be introduced.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Department of the Taoiseach that the working group which was set up by the Efficiency Audit Group to conduct a scrutiny of my Department made inquiries as to the financial administration of the armed forces <Col N="100" /> of other European Community member states.  I have transmitted to that Department the request to have a copy of the report of the Efficiency Audit Group placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  However, I had hoped that the Efficiency Audit Group report would have been placed in the Library before now because it was promised by the Minister's predecessor on 31 October. Each of the spokespersons had asked for a copy of the report but to date we have not received it.  Could the Minister be more specific as regards consideration of the financial controls?  What financial controls are being considered for change? As regards the member states of the EC, what aspects were investigated by the group, from whom did they seek information and in what way was that request made?  Was it made with a view to overall <Col N="102" /> co-operation in the future or specifically for information purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the delegation of financial functions to the Defence Forces, in the engineer services area, for example, the Defence Forces regulations provide for the authorisation of certain works and contracts by the Corps of Engineers within the limits provided for in the Vote for such works. Directors of engineering and command engineers will be authorised to carry out minor new works not exceeding £2,000, excluding work in canteens, messes and public quarters.  In the area of maintenance the maximum amount is £4,000. In the case of a barrack etc. where there is no maintenance staff or where such staff is inadequate the Corps of Engineers may enter into a contract for the execution of work of an urgent nature, for example, making good damage caused by storm, urgent plumbing and electrical repairs, the total cost of which is not to exceed £800.  The officers holding the appointments mentioned may also place contracts for the supply of materials urgently required for ordinary maintenance or authorised works within the limits.  For example, for the director of engineering the annual limit is £4,000 and for an officer commanding a maintenance company, corps of engineers, the limit is also £4,000.</P>
      <P>With regard to ongoing contracts, again in respect of certain items the contracts provide that local military commanders may draw down on these contracts as and when required within the relevant financial restraints.  There is a list of items on which they may decide but I will not take up the time of the House with it because the details are included in the reply.  This reply also refers to Defence Forces allowances.  For 1991 security duty allowance amounts to £8 million; patrol duty allowance, £600,000; Border duty allowance, £3 million and subsistence allowances, home and foreign, £4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all of these cases payment is made by the Department's accounts branch subject to certification by the appropriate <Col N="103" /> military authority and to random checking as to the appropriateness of the disbursements. This random check is carried out by the Department to ensure that administration is running quite smoothly in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the recommendations of the Gleeson report will not be supplanted or set aside by the working group but did he exhort the group to take on board some of the recommendations of the Gleeson report to see if they could be actively implemented through their recommendations on savings, particularly in regard to the geographic location of barracks, the dispersement of soldiers and the duplication of administrative structures in the Department and the Defence Forces?</P>

      <Quest> the reason two fishery patrol helicopters, acquired in July, 1986 at a cost of £7.4 million, were used for fishery protection operations for ten flying hours over the four years ending 31 December 1990; if he will outline his response to the criticism of this matter raised in the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The five Dauphin helicopters, which were acquired in 1986 have been in continuous use in many roles since their acquisition.  The operation of these helicopters, which are very significantly more sophisticated and complicated than the Alouette helicopters on which the Air Corps had acquired their expertise in helicopter handling, entailed the development of a planned training programme in terms of flying and maintaining them.  This programme was structured to equip the crews first with Dauphin daytime training experience, then, in series, with instrument flying experience, with winch training in daytime search and rescue, with night-time maritime experience and then with winch training for night-time search and rescue. In the case of the two Dauphin helicopters acquired for use in conjunction with <i>LE Eithne</i> in the fisheries surveillance role, the next stage in the development of expertise was in the area of deck landing and operations experience by day, and finally with deck landing and operations experience at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was vital that the training programme should be fully in place if crew members were not to be put at risk.  In the event the project proved to be very complex technically and the build up of Air Corps expertise was slower than anticipated primarily because, in the period 1987 to 1989 a large number of skilled technicians left the Air Corps to take up civilian employment and, in the period 1987 to 1990, an equally serious loss of skilled pilots occurred for the same reason.  The unusual measure of refusing <Col N="106" /> to allow pilots to retire early was imposed to halt this trend.</P>
    <P>A further factor which retarded the training programme was that the Dauphins were fitted with new aviation electronic packages which took between two and three years to prove and to eliminate teething problems.  In practice it took far longer to get the necessary training to a level at which ship-helicopter operations could be mounted with confidence than was originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>The present position is that steps are being taken to locate a helicopter in Cork to advance the operation.  When not embarked on <i>LE Eithne</i>, the helicopter will be deployed to Cork for operation on search and rescue.  I expect the relocation of the Dauphin helicopter and its integration operationally with <i>LE Eithne</i> to become established in the early weeks in 1992.  To date in 1991 a total of 100 deck landings on <i>LE Eithne</i> have been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the news that a helicopter will be located in Cork. However, the Minister missed the point of my question.  Does the Minister realise that the <i>Le Eithne</i> which cost £28 million &mdash; double the cost of most other ships &mdash; is running at 60 per cent capacity because of the absence of a helicopter on deck resulting in reduced effectiveness of <i>LE Eithne</i> with consequences for our fishing stocks and the efforts to keep down poaching levels off our coasts?  What planning procedures are in place in the Department, if an investment of £28 million can be made in a ship which is not being used to its full potential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the five Dauphin helicopters delivered in 1986, two were intended to operate on maritime patrols in conjunction with <i>LE Eithne</i> and were part-funded by the EC Commission for this purpose.  Accordingly, both were fitted with specialised equipment for ship borne operations.  Since October 1986 the Dauphin helicopters have been conducting operational training missions from the deck of <i>LE Eithne.</i>  To date in 1991 a total of 100 deck landing have <Col N="107" /> been made, however training on search and rescue operations was given priority and this militated against the allocation of a helicopter to <i>LE Eithne</i> on a full-time basis.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that taking off and landing on the ship is just a way of raising the figures to make them look more impressive but that the Dauphin helicopters have played no role in the operations of <i>LE Eithne</i>?  Will he agree that until such time as the Dauphin helicopters take part in the operations of <i>LE Eithne</i>, its effectiveness is reduced by about 60 per cent?  Is this not a farcical use of resources?  Should there not be greater emphasis on planning and training?</P>

      <P>I totally reject the point made by Deputy Allen.  Since 1987 the Dauphins have carried out 321 sea and air rescue missions.  I know that this matter will be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts of which the Deputy is a member very shortly.</P>

The Dauphins conducted sea and air rescue missions on 321 occasions.  I know that this does not agree with the figure in the report, but it is a matter of opinion and obviously, it will be sorted out by the witnesses before the committee.</P>

      <P>As is the Comptroller and Auditor General I too am dismayed at the cost of and under utilisation of the <i>LE Eithne</i>-Dauphin operation. However, I welcome the Minister's announcement that the helicopter will be deployed to Cork early in the new year. <Col N="108" /> Will the Minister give a clear unequivocal assurance that the Dauphin will be fully operational in Cork and will not simply be deployed in training operations because to date it appears that is all it has been engaged in?  Could the Minister assure the House that when it goes to Cork early in the new year it will be fully operational in conjunction with the <i>LE Eithne</i> in fishery protection?</P>

I can only give an assurance that when those steps have been taken and are finalised, no further training will be required except, of course, the usual ongoing training to keep personnel up to date with what may be required in sea and air rescue missions. Training does not stop overnight, it has to be sustained.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that there appears to be a lack of serious commitment from the top to this matter in that his predecessor made a promise that the system would be operational before last summer and then said that it would be operational before the end of the year?  While I welcome the Minister's announcement that the system will be operational at the beginning of 1992, I wonder how true that is because the commitment has already been made in the House.  Indeed, during the summer season many felt that the fishing stocks were severely exploited because of the lack of a helicopter on the <i>LE Eithne.</i>  As it involves only one helicopter and the necessary crew, one wonders why it should be so difficult to combine the <i>LE Eithne</i> and a helicopter.  Would the Minister not agree that at this stage there is a need for a definite commitment from the top to make sure that the system becomes operational?</P>

Does the Minister know that in the past month there were two occasions &mdash; one well known incident involving a collision in Dublin Bay and the other incident off Wicklow Head &mdash; on which no helicopter from Baldonnel was available for search and rescue missions, search and rescue being the main purpose for helicopters in this country?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has misinterpreted my reply.  My reply is that 877 flying hours in the past three years have been taken up transporting Ministers around the country.  I do not have the details, but I assure the Deputy that the use of Air Corps aircraft by Ministers and Ministers of State is kept to the minimum.</P>
      <P>That policy is in line with a Government decision taken on 14 July 1983 that Ministers and Ministers of State should be permitted to use Army helicopters only in exceptional circumstances and on official visits, and provided that it would not be possible for them to carry out such business by the use of alternative forms of transport.

      <P>In page 20, lines 24 and 25, to delete &ldquo;, at his descretion,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this deletion is that, when the Minister's order is made under section 31 (2), the examination tasks involved will be obligatory on the Controller rather than discretionary.  The amendment was inspired by the debate on this subsection on Committee Stage, in particular by Deputy Barry's wish to have this subsection strengthened.  It is appreciated that Deputy Barry wanted a different approach to patents examination from that provided in the Bill, but it was explained, on Committee Stage, that his approach involved the continuance of the present old style examination on applications which has led to the current unacceptably large backlog in the Patents Office.  For that reason Deputy Barry's approach is not acceptable but I went as far as I could in relation to his proposals.</P>

    <P>Again, this amendment is in response to Deputy Barry's Committee Stage amendment No. 26 in which he also proposed the deletion of the words &ldquo;or suggesting amendments to,&rdquo;.  In the Minister's present amendment, however, those <Col N="176" /> words are being replaced by the words &ldquo;requiring amendment of&rdquo;, the connotation being that more positive action will be involved on the part of the Controller.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) Any application referred to in subsection (1) which is published under the Treaty shall be treated for the purposes of section 11 (3) as published when, and only when, a copy of the application has been supplied to the European Patent Office in English, French or German and the relevant fee has been paid under the European Patent Convention.</P>
      <P>(6) Any application referred to in subsection (1) which is published under the treaty in a language other than English, French or German shall be treated for the purposes of section 56 as published when, and only when, it is re-published in English, French or German by the European Patent Office under the European Patent Convention.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, which adds two new subsections to section 127, is in response to an amendment tabled by Deputy Barry on Committee Stage.  On reconsideration of the Deputy's Committee Stage amendment it was considered that the addition of two subsections would add greater clarity to the section and would be a suitable supplement thereto.  The purpose of the two additional subsections is to make more clear how section 120 will <Col N="177" /> operate in relation to international applications designating the State whose publication under the Patent Co-operation Treaty may take place initially in a language other than English, French or German.  The mechanisms of section 120 itself already deal with applications designating the State which are published in English, French or German.  I reiterate that the points advanced by Deputy Barry were fully taken into account in the drafting of this amendment.  I thank the Deputy for his contribution.</P>

He asked me to withdraw them on Committee Stage to afford him an opportunity to consider them and, if necessary, reintroduce them.  I appreciate that he has done that.  This Bill is now better than originally drafted.  I do not make that point in any triumphal sense.

      <P>In page 68, to delete lines 30 to 37.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not taken on board the ideas I advanced on Committee Stage, although I was not very hopeful he would do so.  Nevertheless, I thought there might have been a possibility he would reconsider the matter.  Therefore, I must reiterate the arguments I advanced on Committee Stage in favour of my amendment which involves the deletion of section 128 of the Bill.  This Bill basically is to give effect to international agreements relating to patents and, I contend, gives the Minister powers way beyond those he should possess to change the laws and procedures in relation to patents.  For that reason I opposed the section on Committee Stage <Col N="178" /> and made the point that, if any changes were required in patent regulations or law, they should be made in this House and not by way of regulation to be introduced by the Minister.  This is a principle that applies to many different Bills. There is an important point of principle involved here.  I continue to feel very strongly that this section should be omitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept Deputy Garland's amendment which proposes to delete all of section 128.  This section provides necessary flexibility to the Minister to enable him respond to future amendments to the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty without having to revert each time to the Dáil with primary amending legislation. It is proposed that he be able to make any necessary adjustments by order.  That is not seeking too much latitude since purely technical adjustments only could be made in this way.  Every such order would have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and could be annulled by a resolution of either House of the Oireachtas.  I recommend this approach and in the circumstances, cannot accept Deputy Garland's amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 70, to delete lines 30 to 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to the First Schedule to the Bill dealing with transitional provisions.  Paragraph 2 (1) of the First <Col N="179" /> Schedule is the offering one as far as I am concerned.  I see its deletion.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>2.  (1) The term of any patent granted under the Act of 1964 and in force at the commencement of this Act shall be extended to 20 years, subject to the payment of the prescribed renewal fees, within the period prescribed, in respect of each year of the additional term.</P>
    <P>We had an extensive debate on this matter on Committee Stage.  If this section were deleted it appears to me that existing patents would expire after 16 years which, as the House will recall, is the position obtaining.  The House may recall also that the nub of this Bill was to extend the patent period from 16 to 20 years in respect of new patents, which proposal was fought competitively in the House with an amendment of mine having been defeated on that question.</P>
    <P>We come to deal with the transitional provisions, that is, the position of patents already in existence which would expire after 16 years in the normal way.  The purpose of this subparagraph is to extend the period of these patents to 20 years in the same way and for the same period for which new patents are granted.  There is an entirely different matter of principle involved here which it is important to get across.</P>
    <P>If a new chemical is patented here, the generic chemical companies know that in years to come that patent will run out.  The position is quite different in respect of existing patents.  The generic companies have been gearing themselves up to claim a market share of previously patented medicines.  Under this Bill patents that were to expire next year or the year after will have a further four years of life. This represents a grave disadvantage and encumbrance for the generic companies. It is in a sense a form of retrospective legislation.  I feel strongly that we should take out that clause and at least let existing patents run for 16 years.  We have lost <Col N="180" /> the battle on the new patents which are to run for 20 years.</P>

During the past 16 years various pharmaceutical companies applied for and obtained patents for chemical medicine products, which patents were to last for 16 years.  That was the law at the time and there was no hint or suggestion that the period would be any longer or shorter than 16 years. When these companies carried out their research and produced their products they did so in the sure and certain knowledge and expectation that they would have 16 years patented cover for their products.  They have made very large sums of money on that basis.  The cost of patented medicines is extraordinarily high.  Prescriptions can cost £15, £20 or £50. These prices are artificially high at this latest stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the behest of the EC Commission the Government and the Minister asked us to give an extra four years right of patent on those products, something not asked for or expected but representing a huge windfall worth millions of pounds for the wealthiest companies in the world, the multinationals who sell their products across the globe.  They are being given an unasked for handout of an extra four years during which they can charge artificially high prices for their medicines. In the view of the Labour Party this is an outrage of the highest order to which the House should not agree.  Indigenous chemical companies and manufacturers have been watching the expiry date of patents and gearing themselves to go into business here, to take on workers and <Col N="181" /> open up factories to produce generic drugs of the same variety when the patents expire.  Some of these patents are due to expire next year, some the following year and others the year after.  As a result of this Bill the generic manufacturers will have to wait four years beyond the anticipated expiry date.  The projected employment will be lost and that is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>It is also very serious that the public who have to buy these medicines will have to pay the multi-national prices, which may be ten or 20 times the generic prices, for four years longer.  Why impose this on ourselves?  We are not obligated to do it.  We are forming legislation and we do not have to do this.  If the EC tell us they want an extension, let us give them a token extension.  I have proposed in amendment No. 9 a token extension of three months, which is more than the manufacturers bargained for when they were granted their patents.  The directors of these companies must be most surprised and gratified, sitting in their luxurious boardrooms in London, New York, Paris, Bonn and Berlin.  They must be amazed that we are giving them an extra four years in which to gain extra millions. It is the kind of bonus which very few people get and in this case the recipients are those who need it least.  We should not do this and I appeal to every Member to vote this down and show our protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the <Col N="182" /> decision in respect of the earlier amendments. I will deal first with the amendment before us.  Amendment No. 8 cannot be accepted.  It proposes to delete the paragraph which adds four years to the term of patents life when the Bill becomes law.  It is not, as Deputy Garland claimed, retrospective legislation. Any patent which expires before this Bill is enacted will not be increased by four years.  This provision applies to patents which are in force when the Bill becomes law.  Deputy Taylor's amendment proposes that all patents live on the entry into force of the Bill be given an extra three months.  This is equally unacceptable. There was an extensive discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and I explained at length why these patents were being given the extra four years.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 (1) of the transitional provisions permits an additional four years to be added on to the term of patents which are still live when the Bill comes into force.  These patents will have a 20 year term instead of a 16 year term.  Paragraph 2 (1) gives expression to this provision and it is important to note that it applies in respect of all patents irrespective of subject matter.</P>
      <P>Ireland is now some 12 to 15 years behind its European partners in providing a patent term of 20 years.  To refuse to do so now, as provided for in paragraph 2 (1), would give the wrong signals to the international community as regards our seriousness about protecting inventions.  In addition, individual patent holders who have been kept waiting for so long for a patent term in Ireland comparable to other European countries would, to say the least, feel very let down. We owe them a gesture of goodwill. However, it should not be forgotten that we are also taking away certain rights which patent holders have under the present law. I will deal with these in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated earlier, paragraph 2 (1) applies across the board irrespective of the subject matter of a patent.  The only sector which has demurred in relation to <Col N="183" /> paragraph 2 (1) is the generic pharmaceutical industry.  Nevertheless, their representations have been given serious consideration and the opportunity has been taken to include certain restrictive provisions in paragraph 2 (3) and paragraphs 3 and 4 of the transitional provisions.</P>
    <P>It is worth considering the effect of these latter provisions which will directly benefit the interests of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers.  This subparagraph bans the making of petitions to extend the term of patents granted under the Act after the entry into force of the Bill.  This is a significant curtailment of existing rights.  At present a patent holder is entitled to make a petition to the court or the controller for an extension of his patent term and the law allows for the grant of an extension of five years or, in certain circumstances, up to ten years.  The curtailment of this right brought about by paragraph 2 (3) will be of direct benefit to generic manufacturers who will be able to make future plans on the basis of the certainty provided by that paragraph.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 (1) of the transitional provisions deals with the treatment of petitions for the extension of 1964 Act patents which are still pending when the Bill becomes law.  The paragraph, as amended by the Minister's amendment No. 73a, was prepared with a view to curtailing as much as possible, and within constitutional constraints, the duration of extensions in these cases.  The amendment will abolish the link between the extension possible and the length of time an extension petition was pending, provide for a four-year extension in all cases where a petition has not been opposed and provide in any case where an extension has been opposed that the extension should be decided under the provisions of the 1964 Act.  Even though this might result in a few cases in an extension of more than four years, it is necessary for constitutional reasons to permit the continued operation of the 1964 Act in those cases and not to wipe out proceedings already in train before the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> Strong submissions have been made by the industry in relation to this matter.  A submission was also made by them in relation to the termination of court proceedings in cases already before the courts and which have a third party objection. Those cases must proceed in the same manner.  It would be inappropriate for us in this House to bring forward legislation which would restrict third party objections which have already been lodged before the courts.  It would also be an infringement of the rights of the court in this regard.  From a constitutional point of view, I would find this very difficult to justify.  I have discussed this matter with the industry.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (4) of the transitional provisions was included with the specific interests of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in mind.  With regard to patents extended under paragraph 2 (1) or paragraph 3 (1), it is provided that any third party may, during the final two years of such an extension, make all such preparations &mdash; except the importation or marketing of a patented product &mdash; as would normally have to be undertaken to place a generic version of a pharmaceutical product on the market.  Such preparatory work will be immune from actions for infringement of the relevant patent and will provide a valuable head start for full commercial marketing after the term of the patented product expires. Generic manufacturers are being catered for in this provision.  As the House is aware, it can take up to eight or ten years before a product is placed on the market. Generic companies have to undertake considerable research, as would normally be undertaken in relation to a branded patented product.  The preparatory work can proceed two years before the expiry date of the patent.  This is an important provision which has been included in the Bill.  The generic industry sought a three-year period and other companies sought a one-year period.  We struck a balance between both submissions and I believe the two-year period is acceptable to both sides of the industry.</P>
    <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, I do not think Deputy Taylor has taken into <Col N="185" /> account the contribution the branded patented multinational companies make to our economy.  As I said, they are employers in this economy.  They employ approximately 8,000 people while the generic companies employ approximately 1,000 people.  Therefore, we must, on balance, recognise the contribution they make.  It is grossly unfair to stress the fact that they are multinational companies.  As Deputy Barry knows, multinational companies provide very worthwhile employment in his constituency and give tremendous support to the economy.  They also make a major contribution to our success in the export field.  Therefore, we need to be very careful that we do not give the impression that multinational companies are somehow against the national interest.  They make a major contribution to our economy and it is our task to encourage such inward investment.  The IDA are doing a tremendous job in this respect.</P>
    <P>Many of the points made by Deputy Taylor are unfair.  It is somewhat emotive to talk about costs in this regard because at times the generic equivalent can be quite expensive.  However, we have to bear in mind the costs incurred by companies in the research and development of a new product.  That contribution should also be recognised.  The generic companies are involved in a particular area &mdash; I welcome such a choice &mdash; but they should also be engaged in research and development so as to ensure that they bring new products, where possible, onto the market.</P>
    <P>In 1990 exports by the Irish chemical industry amounted to £2.274 billion. This accounted for approximately 23 per cent of total manufacturing exports that year. Exports this year are currently 12 per cent higher than the 1990 level.  The chemical sector provide over 14,000 jobs in the economy both directly and indirectly and support many thousands more in that area.  They play a very important role in our economy and in the circumstances I cannot accept the amendments put down by Deputy Garland and Deputy Taylor. I want to reiterate that multinational <Col N="186" /> companies make a tremendous contribution to our economy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue.  It was originally brought before the House in 1982 but because of changes in Government and the internal case which was taken at the time unfortunately it was not dealt with quicker.  This legislation is very important to the industry.  I believe the extension proposed in the Bill is reasonable and in the circumstances I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that this has become a dispute between the generic side &mdash; as Deputy Taylor said there is a lot more involved &mdash; and the multi-national side of the chemical industry, because they both have a role to play in employment creation in Ireland.  There is no doubt we would have found it very difficult to attract chemical companies to this country and provide the type of employment to which the Minister referred if this Bill was not enacted.</P>
      <P>I understand from the IDA that one thing that inhibited their ability to attract other major chemical industries to this country was the fact that we had not ratified the patent convention, to which we have added our signature, to extend to 20 years the life of a patent.  However, the generic industry &mdash; as it is called &mdash; has an important role to play.  I have to say that on balance, given the conflicting claims on both sides, the Solomon's judgment of a three year extension is about the best the Minister could do.  I repeat the plea I made to the Minister on Second Stage that he examine the generic side of this industry when the Bill has been passed to see what assistance he can give them because they also perform a role in job creation.  It is an expanding side of the industry in the United States and there is no reason it should not be so in Europe in the future.  As the Minister has now assisted the international chemical industry he should also try to assist the generic side and help them expand their role, find new markets and give them every assistance to create jobs.  The Minister's Solomon's judgment is fair to neither side but it is the best he can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the stance the Minister has taken in relation to this issue.  I endorse the comments of Deputy Barry that it is a pity this debate has gone down the road of a conflict between the generic and the chemical industries. From my perspective, representing the constituency of Cork South-Central, I must place on record the fact that I acknowledge the contribution the chemical industry has made to the local economy in Cork.  In an era when manufacturing industry is in decline and when service industries are increasing the type of employment provided in my constituency is well paid, the average wage and salaries are very high compared with other employments.  The contribution to the national economy is significant &mdash; as outlined by the Minister, 14,000 jobs, directly or indirectly, are provided &mdash; and the contribution to exports is also significant.  We should get away from the niggardly criticism we hear from time to time about people in their luxurious board rooms. That type of terminology is inappropriate and somewhat immature. We are not all responsible for the state of the world economy.  Those industries have made a significant contribution to the local and national economy.</P>
      <P>The research and development component of that industry is also significant. The Minister has made the point that it takes considerable investment in research and development to produce many of these products and it would be wrong not to acknowledge that.  The Minister sought to achieve a balance between the competing interests in the Bill.  He has achieved that balance to the best of his ability within the constraints in which he has to operate and he should be complimented.  I agree with Deputy Barry that measures should be taken by the Government to improve the situation concerning the generic companies so that their contribution can become even more significant in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>We are having a rehash of the debate on Committee Stage.  There does not appear to be any sign of a move <Col N="188" /> by the Minister on this matter.  The Minister, and Deputy Martin, are trying to devalue the ideological element in this debate.  There should be a clear differentiation between native industry which is controlled here, where the profits are ploughed back into the Irish economy, and the multinational companies who take their profits out of this country. I am sure the Minister will agree there is a vast difference between them.  Employment is very important but the destination of profits is important also.  The profits from indigenous Irish owned industries remain in Ireland while the profits of multinationals are part of the big black hole, are part of the huge shift of money out of the economy.  The Minister is not comparing like with like, 1,000 jobs in the generic industry are worth more than 1,000 jobs in the multi-national industry.</P>
      <P>I wish to reiterate the point I made on Committee Stage, that the multinational companies make an enormous contribution to job creation and nobody denies that &mdash; 8,000 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs.  I put it to the Minister that those jobs could be provided by the generic industry.  I propose to withdraw my amendment but I will support Deputy Taylor's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 44, line 5, after &ldquo;share&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in common&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not a matter of any controversy.  It is simply to be helpful from the point of view of clarification. The section deals with equal undivided shares.  There are two categories of equal undivided shares.  There is the &ldquo;in common&rdquo; variety and the joint variety. Clearly what is envisaged is that it is the &ldquo;in common&rdquo; position that would apply in respect of two or more people owning a patent.  That is to say that in the event of the death of one of them it should not go by survivorship to the survivor but that the half share or one-third share, as the case may be, should carry on to the person who represented him.</P>
      <P>I know that subsection (6) deals with that up to a point but it does not clarify it to my satisfaction.  I am also aware that perhaps the provisions of the Partnership Act, 1890 might also cover the point if it was a business concern that was going on.  However, some patents might not be deemed to come within the provisions of the Partnership Act so I am suggesting this amendment for the Minister's consideration to make it abundantly clear that the principle of survivorship would not apply to two or more people owning a joint patent in the event of the death of one or other of them.</P>

      <P>I want to express my thanks to Deputy Taylor for tabling this amendment which we discussed on Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage I requested the Deputy to put that down as I felt that, as outlined by Deputy Taylor, section 81 needed clarification and it should be made clear whether the share of a co-owner of a patent passed, on his death, to his next of kin or to the surviving co-owner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor's amendment clarifies the matter satisfactorily and under his amendment the next of kin will benefit. I, therefore, accept this amendment.  It certainly improves the Bill and clarifies that point which could be a very serious bone of contention.  Again I want to express my thanks for the wisdom of the contributions made by both Deputies Barry and Taylor in relation to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 51, line 42, to delete &ldquo;being a person to whom section 106 (3) applies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This concerns the question of what person or persons are entitled to represent a party in a proceeding before the controller.  That could be an application <Col N="193" /> for a patent or some other consequential matter that the controller would be dealing with under the patent law legislation.</P>
    <P>As the section stands it provides that the person may be represented by a solicitor or counsel or by a patent agent, or can represent himself, or can be represented by any other person provided it is a person to whom section 106 (3) applies, and that is, a person whom the Minister approves of.  I felt that that qualification was really unnecessary and that the Minister need not set himself up as an examiner of the competence or otherwise of a person to go before the controller.  I am sure the Minister has enough to do without being involved in that.</P>
    <P>Essentially, it should be a matter for the person who is bringing the application before the controller, the owner of the patent, or the applicant for the patent, as the case may be, to decide whom they want to have with them.  If they decide that a particular person is appropriate for them or can do best justice to their cause, then that should be sufficient.  It is on that person's head if he decides to bring an unqualified person or has confidence in the person.  That should be adequate and I do not think it matters.  In many tribunals unqualified people are entitled to appear and do appear. That is the reason for the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this amendment put down by Deputy Taylor, I outlined on Committee Stage that I really could not accept the amendment.  This is because of the importance of having a person suitable to assist in the submission of a patent application.  It is a very important area and we have registered patent agents, about six in total at the moment.  We are broadening that and we are allowing a liberalisation of this provision.  I believe that having some control over the applicant's advisers is an acceptable approach and I would say in 99.9 per cent of cases there would be no objection to the person making the application or assisting the applicant in making the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to have a patent agent <Col N="194" /> or a representative on behalf of the patentee. In fact, they will be able to make their own submission and application. This will also be acceptable.  However, on an issue like this, when important commercial considerations have to be taken into account, it would be practical to avail of the advice and assistance of patent agents.  I also believe that by giving people a choice engineers, chemists and others will be able to assist a person submitting an application.  I can assure Deputy Taylor that we will expeditiously approve any such submissions.  A panel of people, who would be regarded as suitably qualified to assist people in making a submission and putting in an application, will be formed.  Therefore it will not be necessary for a suitably qualified person to keep re-applying.</P>
    <P>This is a very important matter. Indeed, last Saturday in my constituency I met a person who had a product for which he was seeking a patent and who was going to submit his own application. However, I would advise people to seek assistance in making an application because they could save a considerable amount of time and effort.  To be quite frank about it, people need to get the best possible advice before submitting an application for a patent not just in relation to the paperwork involved but in relation to the question of whether it would be worthwhile, commercially, to obtain a patent in the first instance.  The provision in the Bill therefore is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor's point would have more relevance if we had decided that patent agents would have the sole and exclusive right to assist an applicant in making a submission.  We have liberalised the provision and will allow competition in this area.  In the circumstances, although I accept Deputy Taylor's point, which is a reasonable one, I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to repeat a point I made some months ago that this is not the appropriate place to deal with complicated and difficult legislation.  Through the Minister of State, I would like to thank the civil servants who assisted him for their courtesy and help but we should consider whether we should deal with difficult and complex legislation such as this outside the Chamber in a small room where we can receive advice as the Bill goes through.  Any political points can be dealt with in the House.  We are anxious to ensure that the best possible legislation is enacted in this area.  Perhaps we could have ended up with better legislation if the Bill had been dealt with in a more intimate atmosphere.  Having said that, I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy during the course of the debate on the Bill and his readiness to listen to this side of the House and take on board suggested amendments.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse the remarks made by Deputy Barry and to thank my collegues and the Minister of State for their work on this technical Bill.  It is welcome when a Minister does listen to suggestions.  That is the purpose of the House.  I agree with Deputy Barry when he says that a measure such as this <Col N="197" /> should be sent to a special committee. Only rarely is this done and this is regrettable. The Committee Stage of this Bill should have been dealt with by a special committee.  This has been done before &mdash; it was done with great effect in the case of the bankruptcy Bill and the judicial separation Bill.  During the years there have been forlorn voices calling for this but the Taoiseach of the day always said that he would look at it favourably. However, when it came to the crunch for some strange reason he was always reluctant to do so.  This is regrettable.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcome the main thrust of this important legislation which is long overdue, just like other legislation in the area of Justice. We will support the Bill but hope that during the course of the debate on Committee Stage the Minister will be receptive to amendments just like the Minister of State was during the course of the debate on the Patents Bill.  We welcome, in particular, the decision to establish a special committee of the House to deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill.  We strongly feel that much of the real work can be done by such a committee.  As my colleague, Deputy Taylor, has said, many other Bills could be teased out more efficiently and amended to the satisfaction of the House by such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are we calling it the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill?  I have inquired but, so far, I have not received a reply.  Other groups, apart from solicitors, are <Col N="198" /> involved in the due process of the law. Are we excluding barristers, including senior counsel, from the Bill?  Have we a three-tier system of legislation which will effectively deal with the lowest rank in the legal profession and leave the other two tiers alone?  Will there not be any responsibility in relation to them apart from the existing legislation which, as I said, in many cases is outdated and badly needs to be amended?  I will be very interested to hear the Minister's explanation for the Bill's title.</P>
    <P>I assume that all the ills in relation to the administration of justice about which we hear from time to time &mdash; quite frequently we hear complaints from clients or solicitors within the legal profession &mdash; are not confined to complaints about solicitors.  Maybe there is a logical and reasonable explanation for this and I would be very interested to hear it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposed special committee of the House.  Will the Minister say what form of representation will comprise the committee?  When does he expect them to meet?  What sort of party representation will be on the committee? It is important to prepare for that committee because the debate in the House is only window-dressing compared to the real work which must be put in.</P>
    <P>Courthouses throughout the country &mdash; including buildings housing the High Court &mdash; are out of the Stone Age.  The facilities for solicitors and the legal profession generally are, to say the least, antiquated.  Many of the old courts are like pig-sties and should have been knocked down years ago.  Some of the buildings are over 100 years old, badly in need of repair and do not have any acoustics.  People have to stand in hallways or draughty corridors and solicitors and barristers often have to consult their clients on the footpath.  If we do not have proper facilities for the public and for those who administer justice, legislation will not make much difference.  The problem is not confined to my constituency, I understand from colleagues that the situation is the same all over the country.</P>
    <P>I was in London recently in connection <Col N="199" /> with a court case; it was held in a relatively new courthouse complex which was like the Gresham Hotel compared to the facilities the general public have to put up with here.  As Deputy Seán Barrett said, many people arrive at our courthouses at 10 a.m., sit there all day in appalling conditions and are then told to come back the following day.  There is not even a facility for making a cup of tea or a meal.  Indeed, even toilet facilities are inadequate; this applies to the facilities for judges, barristers, solicitors and in particular the public who pay big money to go to court, win or lose.  They must suffer the indignity of the facilities as well as perhaps losing a case.  While this matter is not referred to in the Bill it is relevant in the overall administration of justice in respect of the practitioners who have to operate in deplorable conditions. There was a big furore when the court clerks went on strike looking for better conditions.  If they went on strike &mdash; justifiably &mdash; because of the conditions in which they have to operate there would be a strike in virtually every courthouse in the land.  No other sector of workers would tolerate the conditions under which they have to operate.</P>
    <P>In my home town we do not even have a courthouse.  It has been shifted from a Gaelic club to a parochial hall because it has been condemned.  The buck is being passed from the Department of Justice to Louth County Council.  I have been a member of the council for nearly 20 years and I am tired of Ministers passing the buck.  There is no money to do repair work, the courthouse nearly fell and if Drogheda Corporation had not moved their chamber out of the building, they would probably still be operating in a condemned building.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the length of time it takes to process injury claims under the road traffic Acts.  I am concerned too about injuries in the work-place. I have been dealing with quite a number of them recently and they have been going on for years.  There will be a letter from the solicitor to a client and <Col N="200" /> nothing is done in spite of constant telephone calls.  This Bill should lay down some standard in relation to that because it is not good enough that someone who has been injured by a machine in a factory should have to wait several years for compensation. It is nonsense.  Many of my collegues in the legal profession have told me that this is the case and it happens because of lazy people operating on behalf of clients.  They are not carrying out their functions properly and effectively. Of course that does not apply to everyone in the legal profession; on the contrary, the efficient people show up the inefficiences of others.  I heard of a case of a man who has been waiting to be compensated for the past six years.  If he got even half the money he will eventually get and put it on deposit in a bank he would probably receive more money at the end.</P>
    <P>I have come across quite a number of cases &mdash; we will be dealing with it in the Bill &mdash; where clients' money has been lodged in a solicitor's account.  I have had to contact solicitors and barristers directly and tell them that unless the money is paid I would have to take furthere action.  I should not have to do that, it should be dealt with by statute within the confines of this Bill.  It should state that a solicitor or anyone in the legal profession should not be able to hold money in a client's account after a given period.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested to hear comments on that matter from colleagues on both sides of the house who are involved in the profession.  Perhaps they will be able to explain why it is necessary to transfer clients' money from one account to another.  I wonder why this cannot be dealt with in the Bill because it has not been adequately covered under existing legislation.  That matter should be dealt with clearly and decisively and I hope to see an amendment along those lines on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>What would happen if a client's money is stolen by malpractice?  The Incorporated Law Society are very conscious of this practice and have tried to come to grips with it.  There is an insurance <Col N="201" /> scheme to cover compensation under certain circumstances.  As the Law Society will point out, the law at present does not allow for the prosecution of a solicitor or barrister who may, for example, take £250,000 belonging to a client.  Yet if a member of the travelling community or a poor person takes groceries from a supermarket they may be imprisoned for six months.  There is no justice in that system.  The law needs to be strengthened to ensure that it applies equally to all citizens of the State.  There should not be one law for the ordinary Joe Soap and another law which protects the people who are supposed to administer it.  The Law Society would welcome a change in the law to allow for prosecution of the small minority of people in the profession who tend to give a bad name to the whole organisation of solicitors and barristers.</P>
    <P>A question that frequently comes to my attention, and I am sure to the attention of other Members of the House, is the delay in dealing with complaints through the Incorporated Law Society.  One can understand why that is so because a great number of complaints have to be dealt with regarding the handling of clients' affairs by individual solicitors or firms of solicitors.  Some of these complaints may be justified while others may not.  Nevertheless the frustrating delays could be dealt with to some degree in this Bill by the appointment of the co-called ombudsman.  I understood that such an ombudsman would be appointed on the same basis as the present Ombudsman, Michael Mills, who operates on an independent basis, funded by the State and is responsible to the Oireachtas.  If an ombudsman is appointed under this Bill how would he function?  He would be paid by the people whom he is appointed to investigate.  That would be like a production manager in a factory investigating the managing director and expecting to get all the answers he requires.  More importantly, the appointment of an ombudsman would not have the full support of the general public. That person would not be above suspicion no matter what he or she would find in any individual case.  The people <Col N="202" /> would take the attitude that he is not going to bite the hand that is feeding him.  Regardless of what is laid down in legislation or regulations no other interpretation would be put on it.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Incorporated Law Society would agree to an ombudsman being appointed and paid by the State, with the facilities made available by the State, as is the case with the present Ombudsman.  That is the only way the appointment could be made. However, the Department of Finance are not going to give the Department of Justice the money to make such an appointment. The Department of Justice agree to the appointment of an ombudsman who would be paid by the State and would operate independently with certain powers set down by the Oireachtas, but the Department of Finance will not provide the money for such an office. That is possibly one of the reasons it has taken so long for this important Bill to surface.</P>
    <P>There is very little reference in the Bill to training and education.  The whole question of training for solicitors and the legal profession as a whole within the context of EC law is of vital importance. Our citizens will have to be represented at that level on an increasing basis during the next 15 or 20 years.  I doubt that the legal profession have the capacity to train and retrain their people in the same way as workers had to adapt to new technology in the area of footwear, clothing, textiles and electronics.  It would be a very big step and I am not convinced, nor indeed are many people within the legal profession, that adequate provision is being made for that.  As a result, the public will suffer because the legal people will not be sufficiently trained to represent them.</P>
    <P>There should be some provision in the Bill for consultation with clients.  In the High Court, large sums of money are involved in compensation for injuries resulting from road accidents and so on, and on occasion when I was present to give evidence regarding wages and conditions of employment in factories I witnessed people being introduced to senior <Col N="203" /> counsel and barristers 15 minutes before a case was due to be heard.  In the High Court barristers run from one court to another to represent clients, without consultation with the clients and in many cases depending on notes from a solicitor. The Bill should deal with the rights of clients.  Again, while this practice is evident only in a minority of cases it gives the legal profession a bad name.  People sometimes claim they are not adequately represented.  In the High Court I have witnessed a junior counsel representing a client in one court while at the same time senior counsel was in another court representing a different client.  I do not know whether that is the responsibility of the administration of the High Court or of any court &mdash; I assume it is not likely to happen to the same degree in the District or Circuit Courts.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Barrett that there are huge queues of people in the hallways waiting for their case to be heard in the District Court and in the Circuit Court. Surely people, whether on a panel for jury service or being prosecuted, have some rights and I do not think that any attempt is being made in this Bill to afford them the rights due to any person.  In this Bill we are dealing with changes in the law in relation to the legal profession, but we are not doing anything to change the facilities and the service to clients. The members of the legal profession freely admit that without clients there would be no legal profession and therefore the service must be loaded in favour of the clients.  If the clients are not paying the bill directly, they are paying it through PAYE or through taxation in general.</P>
    <P>The question of the compulsory Irish examination was raised.  We would all like to see everybody speaking Irish, but let us face the fact that that is not going to happen.  Everybody has a love of the Irish language to some degree, depending on his upbringing or where he lives, but in this day and age we should be talking about barristers and solicitors learning to speak French and German or other European languages.  Indeed, if we <Col N="204" /> were to have a debate in this House on any aspect of the Irish language, a simultaneous translation would be provided. I understand that the Incorporated Law Society were prepared to provide a panel of solicitors who have adequate Irish to conduct a court case through the medium of Irish.  Indeed, Deputy McCartan freely admitted this morning that he would not take a case in Irish because he would not feel competent to conduct the case in Irish.  I think that is an honourable position to adopt.</P>
    <P>I know a number of my colleagues would like to contribute to the debate before it concludes at 7 p.m. so I will deal with just one more aspect of the Bill.  The purpose of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill is to effect a major reform of the law relating to solicitors.  The Bill will give greater protection to solicitors' clients and increase the Law Society's powers to intervene in solicitors' practices.  Reform of the legal service should not be allowed to proceed without action being taken on the precarious position of the legal aid system.  At present the Bill is only relevant to the section of the population who can afford to pay for legal services and consequently it is irrelevant to the larger section of the community who cannot afford legal services and have to rely on the skeleton service provided under the legal aid scheme.  The Labour Party maintain that until the present Minister or any other Minister in the Department of Justice places our free legal aid system on a statutory basis, access to the legal service will continue to depend on the ability to pay rather than on the principle of equal access to justice for all and equal justice for all.  It is essential that all eligible people have access to free legal aid.  It is essential to the whole concept of democracy.  In my opinion it is unconstitutional to provide a service for one section of the community and deny it to the vast majority of the population.  At present it takes a minimum of three months to get an appointment to see a lawyer in any of the legal aid centres throughout the country.  In Dublin the position is much worse and the doors of the centres are effectively <Col N="205" /> closed.  The crisis in both the funding and staffing of legal aid has led to the point of its virtual collapse.  Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas who have to deal with the system will agree with that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, centres that are in any way operational have to try to plan to deal with a 25 per cent increase in the number of clients as a result of the Judicial Separation Act.  The legal remedy provided under this Act is not available to hundreds of families.  The failure of the State to provide the less well off with the means of access to the law flies in the face of the spirit of the undertakings given at the European Court of Justice and in my opinion this is a fundamental breach of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The underfunded, understaffed legal aid scheme is limited to the substantial minority of the population who need it and those who are in a position to avail of its services are compelled to face long and frequently impractical delays before they even get to see a solicitor.  The scheme lacks a statutory basis and is not clearly defined in any legislation that I am aware of, but perhaps my colleague, Deputy Andrews, might be able to shed some light on that.</P>
    <P>In theory the legal aid service is restricted in the type of problems that can be entertained but in practice it can consider only the most urgent matters from the most needy, and those who are unable to avail of the service are forced to rely on the charity of the staff of the free legal aid centres and other practitioners.  I know that many solicitors and barristers give of their time for nothing.  People who have been prosecuted and have had to go to a family court are not in a position to wait for six months to get an appointment with a solicitor and another six months before the solicitor can go to court.</P>
    <P>The Minister must pay close attention to the State's moral and international obligations in this regard.  As I had pointed out, many years ago the Government would have to meet their obligations under the social welfare code and <Col N="206" /> because of their failure to do so they are now faced with a very substantial sum, which amounts to £400 million or thereabouts, even though it started off at £40 million.  Something similar may happen in relation to the free legal aid system when it is discovered that peoples' rights are being infringed and that the people who cannot afford to pay are not getting adequate and proper legal representation. I have seen barristers and solicitors virtually running out of the court into the hallway to consult clients and then go back in to make a case for the client under that system.  That is not justice.  There should be regulations in the Bill and it should be clearly defined.</P>
    <P>If someone were able to pay a fairly large sum of money for the top people in the business then he or she would pretty soon get an appointment and would get all of the consultation and the expert witnesses who were available &mdash; investigators, engineers, architects, soldiers and so on.  In this country one can buy anything with money; but if one has no money then one cannot buy justice, one cannot have justice.  In my opinion there are many hundreds of people in our jails who are there because they were inadequately represented.  Most of them are people from the lower income groups such as those in receipt of social welfare benefits &mdash; people who in many cases could not afford to employ a solicitor, even one from the bottom end of the ladder.</P>
    <P>Advertising, my foot.  I laughed when I saw the subject of advertisements introduced. It is all right to talk about advertising fees, but what about the very substantial proportion of people who would not be able to pay a solicitor irrespective of what was advertised?  If fees were advertised the only people who would be able to pay are those who can already pay, those to whom effectively the question of money does not matter all that much.</P>
    <P>Another question is raised: who is to pay for the advertising?  At the moment an advertisement in a local paper for a &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; costs about £60.  It cost £50, £60 or £100 for a solicitor, depending on the <Col N="207" /> case and depending on the level of representation opted for.  In other words, advertising would become a major part of the expense incurred in relation to court cases themselves, but it would not be the legal profession who pay.  The legal profession would freely admit that they are not about to pay hundreds and thousands of pounds to advertise their fees in local and national newspapers.  They will claim the expense somewhere.  Solicitors will charge their clients; it is the clients who will pay the bill.  Advertising fees will not reduce the level of charges made by solicitors; it will increase the charges to the people who have to pay, many of whom cannot afford to pay anyway.  The Labour Party have continuously demanded the establishment of a statutory right to legal aid as a priority in order to provide more equitable access to justice in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to state that I have been reliably informed that a Legal Services Bill has already been drafted and is lying dormant in the Department of Justice and that the passage of that Bill is all that it would take to give the free legal aid system the statutory basis it requires in order to operate as a comprehensive service.  The position is scandalous and if that is true, I have good reason to believe that it is true.  But this urgently required Bill has not yet been brought before the Dáil.  I ask the Minister to explain the reason for that.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the Minister's reply he will give some positive answers to the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall speak in the same mould as Deputy Michael Bell of the Labour Party and I shall be relatively brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a matter that I am concerned about, although it is a matter that the Chair need not necessarily be concerned with.  I feel that the length of contributions on a matter of this nature is damaging to the operability of the House. I feel that anybody who had to say anything could say it within a reasonable period of time.  The idea of spending <Col N="208" /> more than an hour and a half on a contribution is unfair to the spirit and intention of free access to a democratic Parliament such as this.  However, that is for another day.  As I say, it is my personal view that to a certain degree such contributions devalue the House.  But that does not bind any other person to my view; it is one I express myself.</P>
    <P>I first thank the Minister for the manner in which he met the two branches of the profession.  It is grotesque of The Workers' Party to come to the House and accuse the Minister for Justice of not facing up to his responsibilities to the two branches of the profession.  I also declare an interest in this regard.  As a practising barrister of long standing, I have an interest in this legislation in that I deal with solicitors on a daily basis.  I have always found them to be people of the very highest integrity, realising that in any profession there are weaknesses and there are weak people.  Taking all of that into account, I believe that the Minister has discharged his functions to the legal profession extremely well since taking over his portfolio.  The Bar Council have met the Minister, to my certain knowledge, on several occasions.  I attended the Minister's visit to the Bar Library, when he was made most welcome.  As a result of the Minister's discussions with the Bar Council much has happened, both before the visit and after it.  The Minister paid tribute to the Incorporated Law Society for the manner in which they met him to express their views on the Bill.  This goes to the very heart and spirit of the profession.</P>
    <P>It is right that the Minister met the two branches of the profession in the manner in which he did and he is to be thanked for that.  I am not a sycophant and I do not wish to be seen in that light.  I would not want to be seen in any way as being a lickspittle.  However, I do think that the present Minister for Justice is a good Minister for Justice.  He has engaged in a package of social reform on the one hand and has also engaged in a gentle campaign of persuasion, persuading both branches of the legal profession to face up to the realities of this decade and the <Col N="209" /> future millennium.  He has not taken either branch of the profession head on, and correctly so.  He has indicated to them his concerns about their future viability.</P>
    <P>In an area of which I am particularly aware, that relating to the Bar, changes have been made that have to be thought of as being almost revolutionary in the context of the way in which the Bar has existed for many years.  The abolition of a compulsory junior was, of course, one such reform.  Another was the abolition of two seniors in one case, for which only one could be taxed, and if a client wanted a second senior he or she would have to pay in the ordinary way.  Set fees have also been abolished; fees are now negotiable, inevitably downwards.</P>
    <P>Yet another reform has been the abolition of juries, at the request of the insurance companies.  I am not so sure that that was a particularly advantageous reform for personal injury awards, but again that is a matter that will be exposed over the years by experience.  In practice the abolition of juries will be seen to either work or not work.  That will be a matter of time.  My declaration of interest is in relation to my profession as a practising barrister of many years standing but also with a concern and support for that side of the profession in close contact with the public, namely solicitors.  I believe there is a genuine need for solicitors and barristers in this society to declare such special interest.  Those who speak about the fusion of the professions do so with little knowledge of either or both professions and the requirement for both professions to exist side by side but separately.  I will deal later with the fusion of the professions and the views expressed by the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council to the Fair Trade Commission &mdash; the report of Study into Restrictive Practices in the Legal Profession, two very worthy contributions from those two bodies.</P>
    <P>We are dealing now with the solicitors' branch of the legal profession.  As a public representative I have received literature, as I am sure have all Members, expressing criticisms of the Bill as its provisions relate to the solicitors' profession <Col N="210" /> while positively welcoming various other important, fundamental matters relating to that profession.  I contend that the Incorporated Law Society have met their obligations to their society on the one hand and, by definition, the body of their members on the other.  One must remember that there were 3,600 practising certificates issued by the Incorporated Law Society in the past legal year and that there are 1,600 legal practices throughout the length and breadth of this country. This Bill must be viewed in the context of that number of people its provisions will affect directly.  The Incorporated Law Society have thoroughly studied its provisions, on the one hand, welcoming the Bill and, on the other offered their criticisms in a non-hectoring, civilised fashion.</P>
    <P>My belief is that both elements of the legal profession, namely, the Bar and solicitors, must offer a new image and meet new challenges for the remainder of this decade, into the new millennium. This Bill offers the possibility of such changed image and the new challenges of which I speak.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Justice who is prepared to listen to reasonable amendments to this Bill, who will seek to enhance a group of professionals who have responded positively to a Bill whose provisions will go to the very heart and spirit of their existence for many years to come.  In that regard I was pleased to note the following remarks of the Minister at the end of his introductory speech:</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate I shall be keen to hear the views of Deputies on the many proposals contained in the Bill and I shall be open to ideas from all sides of the House that would improve the Bill.  I believe that this measure is ideally suited to be dealt with on Committee Stage by a Special Committee of the House and I so propose.</P>
    <P>Before resuming the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1991 this afternoon we had the Report and Final Stages of the Patents Bill, 1991 which I presume has gone to <Col N="211" /> the Seanad and will end up on the President's table in Aras an Uachtáráin to be signed into law.  It was very interesting to hear Deputy Peter Barry make the very point the Minister made in regard to this Bill, that he very wisely proposes to take the Bill out of the House into a special committee of the House.  Legislatively that is the direction in which we should be moving.  Such a move would make for closer contact with the Minister and greater efficiency in expression of points of view.  It would add to Members' views and would be backed up by the presence of officials immediately available for advice either to the Minister or to Members present.  That is a very wise proposal of the Minister.  It is a good development and coincides with the views expressed by Deputy Peter Barry, Deputy Leader of Fine Gael in his concluding remarks on the Patents Bill.</P>
    <P>We had a long discussion within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party on this Bill.  It is fair to say that the views expressed by Members were very trenchant, knowledgeable and detailed on what they considered to be its less worthy aspects.  It was heart-warming to hear Members' concern about the Bill.  One of the great merits of all political parties, something of which people outside this House and the parliamentary part rooms are unaware, is that before a Bill reaches the Floor of this House it is discussed in depth within the parliamentary parties. That is the treatment it had from the Fianna Fáil Party when discussion of it was deep, concerned, trenchant and extremely worthwhile.</P>
    <P>On that basis it comes as no great surprise to me to hear the Incorporated Law Society express reservations in relation to a number of areas, not least of which would be the question of probate by banks and trust corporations, and conveyancing by banks.  At a meeting held within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party some short time ago, a meeting at which the Minister for Justice was present, he said he would take into account the views expressed by Members &mdash; and I know he will because he is that <Col N="212" /> sort of Minister &mdash; the concerns expressed by the Incorporated Law Society, those expressed by the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and its members in the context of the movement of conveyancing and probate out of solicitors' practices.  Not being a solicitor myself I realise that solicitors in the House would have some difficulty saying what I am about to say in that they would be seen to be engaging in special pleading, would be seen to be making a special appeal for the continued existence of the bread and butter of their practices.  I see nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I hope that when solicitor Members come into the House they will make a special plea for the Minister to concern himself with the need to amend what I perceive to be a very unusual proposal, that is, to hand over the very heart of a solicitor's practice, particularly in rural areas, to the banks.  I have nothing against banks.  Like everybody else I have an overdraft, have had it for years and probably will continue to have one for many years to come.  I have always found the people with whom I deal in my bank good, decent people with the interests of their clients, on the one hand, and, more particularly those of the bank on the other.  But it is important to remember that banking staff are mobile, that they move from one branch to another, so that there is no certainty of continuity within a community of a particularly good, decent, well-minded and well-intentioned official.  That does not happen in the case of a solicitor's practice in that usually he is at the same location from the day he puts up his plate until the day he dies.</P>
    <P>It is being provided here that a corporation, an institution, will take over what is considered to be fundamental in a relationship between solicitor and client, particularly in rural Ireland.  This is a wrong move and I ask the Minister to consider amending the legislation to ensure that probate and conveyancing by banks and trust corporations will not occur.</P>
    <P>I will briefly advert to the submission made by the Incorporated Law Society <Col N="213" /> in this regard, a submission made by professionals for professionals but in the best interests of the community.  The submission states:</P>
    <P>Allowing banks and trust corporations to do probate work is, in the Society's view, an extremely ill-advised step and we would put forward four main arguments against it&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  probate and administrations involve complex legal work that has to be done by legally qualified persons;</P>
    <P>(ii) there will be no protection for clients funds (such as the Solicitors Compensation Fund) and, unless the work is done by solicitors, there may be no professional indemnity insurance to cover negligence;</P>
    <P>(iii) there is a serious risk of a conflict of interest if banks act for their own customers, the client would not have independent legal advice;</P>
    <P>(iv) the overheads of the banks are such that they could not provide a cheaper service than solicitors and their fees are not subject to any controls.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Trust Corporations</i>
    </P>
    <P>We are strongly against opening this area up to trust corporations.  The level of protection afforded to the public would be substantially weakened if trust corporations, as defined in Section 30 of the Succession Act, 1965, were allowed to do this work.  A trust corporation, includes a company with an issued share capital of only £250,000 of which only £100,000 must be paid up in cash.  A level of paid up share capital of less than £5 million would not, in our view, be adequate to ensure reasonable protection for the public in this important area.  The Bill does not make this change.</P>
    <P>Conveyancing by banks is then dealt with.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Incorporated Law Society that this area of work must be <Col N="214" /> reserved for properly trained persons, supported by professional indemnity insurance, a compensation fund and a disciplinary procedure to deal adequately with complaints from the public.  Solicitors are the only persons with the required expertise, insurance cover and regulatory control.  That is a reasonable proposition which I am sure the Minister will note.</P>
    <P>On the question of the removal of probate and conveyancing from the small rural practice, I have some expertise in that I married a solicitor's daughter from Ballyjamesduff in County Cavan.  Her father, now deceased, had an extraordinarily far-reaching role as the local solicitor in a small town.  He attracted small industry to the area and, with the co-operation of the local community, he effectively won for Ballyjamesduff the Tidy Towns Competition on a couple of occasions.  He set up an extremely attractive review which ran for ten successive years and attracted people from many parts of rural Ireland.  A solicitor does not just open the door for a client and close it behind him.  Rural solicitors have a very important role to play in the community. I use my father-in-law as an example of a good man doing a good job, at considerable loss to himself in many cases.  He did not die a wealthy man &mdash; quite the contrary &mdash; but he died a very satisfied man, knowing that he did his duty to his community and to his practice, which was widely respected.  That is the sort of practice this Bill will damage if conveyancing and probate, the bread and butter of the rural solicitor, are handed over to an institution.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support the views put forward by the Incorporated Law Society and endorsed by the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  They are some of the reasons why the Minister might consider the possibility of amending those sections of the Bill.  I believe he will look at them seriously on Committee Stage when Deputies will have an opportunity of expressing their views on what is seen to be an unintentional but unfair attack on the heart of the solicitor's practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> The records of the registrar's committee of the Incorporated Law Society reveal that there are 3,600 solicitors with practising certificates and approximately 1,600 practices.  The society is composed of a council, five standing committees and committees of the council numbering 15 altogether.  Any organisation with that multiplicity of committees dealing with various subjects is giving very considerable attention to its reason for existence. It represents the functions and the traditions of the solicitors extremely well.</P>
    <P>I again advert to some of the more important and positive features of the Bill.  The provision relating to education is fundamental to the survival of the two branches of the profession.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>For many years there has been concern about legal education.  A number of my predecessors have referred to this matter publicly.  Put simply, it is very unsatisfactory that the resources of so many law schools and colleges are involved in what seems to be an unco-ordinated way, in the education and training of our lawyers.  There is a considerable amount of duplication between the various bodies involved.</P>
    <P>There is a need to co-ordinate all this activity in a meaningful and planned way, and streamline the process of legal training with a view to making economic use of the limited teaching resources that are available.  It is time to devise a better and more equitable way of channelling our highly qualified law graduates into the professional streams, than the present uneven arrangements.</P>
    <P>That goes to the heart of the argument, the need to update both branches of the profession.</P>
    <P>People who talk in a glib way about the need for fusing both branches of the profession should, in the context of the educational requirements of both branches of the profession, understand the need for people to keep in mind whether they want to be barristers or solicitors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> The Minister has legislated for this very worthy point and it is one which must be supported.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid tribute to the Law Society and expressed his thanks for the ready co-operation of successive presidents of the society and of the <i>ad hoc</i> working group of the council of the society who were involved in discussions with his Department.  He continued, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that there is a large measure of agreement with the Law Society on the proposals in the Bill, even if some sharp differences of opinion remain on some issues.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I would be surprised if there was not a sharp divergence of opinion on some aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister is tackling the issue of solicitor and client costs and party and party costs.  The vast majority of solicitors &mdash; I speak from personal experience &mdash; are good, decent men and women.  However, as I see it, a tiny minority of solicitors do a disservice to the entire profession, both the Bar and the solicitor's profession.  As we know, party and party costs are the standard costs as between the winning party and the losing party.  When a case is settled the plaintiff gets his or her award outside of court, the losing party, the defendant, pays the costs and the solicitor gets his reasonable costs out of that transaction. In addition, there are the solicitor and client costs.  The majority of solicitors will take out of pocket costs, such as payments to expert witnesses, for example, engineers and doctors and any other reasonable out of pocket expenses as between the solicitor and client from the solicitor and client costs.  Like me, the Incorporated Law Society believe an unfortunate practice has grown up over the years &mdash;&mdash;they have not complained about what the Minister intends doing in the Bill in this regard &mdash; whereby solicitors take a large cut from the client's award.  This is unfair.  The Minister seeks to ensure, by enshrining a provision in law, that solicitors can no longer do that. <Col N="217" /> This is a good provision which, I understand, has been welcomed by the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up too much time of the House and if the opportunity presents itself at a later stage I will refer to the Bill in more detail.  However, before concluding I should like to take up a fair point which was very decently put by Deputy Bell.  This relates to the conditions under which the average litigant has to operate.  The conditions of some courthouses in so far as litigants are concerned &mdash; these are the people about whom we should be concerned in the first instance &mdash; are deplorable.  These ordinary people who seek justice in our courts often have to wait for their cases to be heard in the most awful weather and without any decent or appropriate facilities.  The accommodation for judges, barristers and solicitors can also be found wanting, to say the very least. I totally support the points made by Deputy Bell in this regard.</P>
    <P>The image of the long faced lawyer does nothing for our legal system.  This really relates to the facilities provided for litigants and the treatment of them by the legal profession.  If decent facilities were provided for litigants I believe they would respond positively to the legal system which does not have a good image at present.  If, on the other hand, litigants are treated with contempt instead of being given the respect and entitlements they are due then they will meet that contempt with contempt.  I know that the vast majority of lawyers treat their clients with courtesy, civility and the respect to which they are entitled as of right under our Constitution.  After all, they bring the business to the profession.  It is not as if the profession bring the business to them.  They are the people who pay the piper and, as I said, they should be treated with respect and courtesy.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bell rightly said, the conditions in some courthouses are deplorable. At present some district justices have to operate out of dance halls and buildings which are nothing short of barns.  I believe people who have to operate in such conditions will not only hold <Col N="218" /> the law and what it stands for in low esteem but will also hold judges, solicitors and barristers in equally low esteem.  The Minister needs to examine the condition of courthouses at District Court level, Circuit Court level and to a lesser extent the High Court.  On the basis that the Supreme Court has a fixed venue in the Four Courts I imagine that the conditions there are not all that bad.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Bell, I am pleased that the dispute involving the court clerks has been resolved.  It upset me and many members of the legal profession to see these decent people picketing outside the various courthouses which we visit during the year.  When one takes into account the fact that these decent taxpayers had to picket for what is their basic right and entitlement while other activities have taken place at a higher level in our society one wonders where the justice is in all of this.  I am pleased that the Minister responded, in his fashion, to resolve this dispute.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a letter I received from a solicitor in which he set out his views on this Bill.  This is one of a number of letters I received from solicitors.  He asked me to mention his concerns under various headings.  I do not intend reading out this letter as I know the rules of the House will not allow me to quote it <i>in extenso.</i>  He is concerned about the compensation fund and fee advertising on the basis that cheaper does not necessarily mean better.  He believes that the introduction of fee advertising &mdash; I do not agree with him in this regard &mdash; will introduce an element of ambulance chasing which will again demean the legal profession. No matter what one says, professions are always open to this sort of abuse by a very tiny minority.  However, it is this tiny minority who give the profession a bad name.  I have already referred to the questions of conveyancing and probate by banks and corporations. Generally this solicitor was of the opinion that solicitors ultimately are accountable to the President of the High Court and may be struck off if they do not act properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> In relation to probate services and conveyancing by the banks, who regulates the banks?  That is not an unreasonable question.  Juvenal in the 6th century posed the question &ldquo;Who guards the guardians&rdquo;?  Who guards the banks?  We know the legal profession is well structured, in the context of this legislation and existing legislation, to protect its clients and its members by virtue of the rules and regulations that concern its operation.  This solicitor asks: who guards the banks?  In order to kill once and for all the question of the fusion of the professions raised by The Workers' Party and to put an end to the mythology which says that the fusion of the professions will give better law and create a more streamlined legal profession, I believe that both branches of the profession must, in the interest of the community, continue to exist separately and apart.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission in their report <i>Study into Restrictive Practices in the Legal Profession</i> set out views expressed by the Law Society at paragraph 6.11, page 63.  Those views are effectively repeated at paragraph 6.23, page 66, as the views of the Bar Council. In relation to the fusion of the profession, the Bar Council made a number of very cogent and reasonable points as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  It would reduce the quality of judicial decisions.</P>
    <P>(b)  It would damage the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>(c)  It would restrict the freedom of choice for the lay client.</P>
    <P>(d)  It would particularly ensure to the disadvantage of small rural solicitors' firms and to the advantage of large firms of solicitors.</P>
    <P>(e)  It would dilute an available reservoir of specialist knowledge presently available at the Bar.</P>
    <P>(f)  It would result in the appointment of judges with little or no experence of advocacy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> (g)  It would result in Court proceedings becoming more protracted and less well ordered, as is the case in countries where there is fusion of the profession, with the resulting increase in the cost of litigation both to the litigants and to the State.</P>
    <P>(h)  It would be contrary to the trend within the legal profession as a whole towards greater specialisation.</P>
    <P>In a fused legal profession do we want to see what can only be described as a circus in the United States in the context of the Kennedy trial?  Do we want to reduce law in this country to trial by television?  That is the most grotesque performance I have ever seen.  That cannot be justice; it certainly is not law.  The greatest merit apparently of this court is that the lady judge, with great respect to her, is seen to be a character.  She dresses up, as most women do, and puts on the most florid face with a particular type of lipstick which appeals to the onlooker.  This is meant to be taken as an exposition of the law.  The unfortunate Kennedy family are harangued and abused by the lowest form of media exposure known to mankind and to womankind.  This is meant to be the law and the fused professions.  Is that what we want in this country?  I do not think so.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I know you would be the last person to want the fusion of the legal professions to bring about such as that.</P>
    <P>I conclude by expressing my confidence in the Minister for Justice, not only in this area but in other areas on which he has touched in his capacity as Minister for Justice since his appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I enjoyed Deputy Andrews' contribution.  I begin by congratulating the Minister for introducing the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill.  It deals with reform of the law relating to solicitors and the practices they carry on. Solicitors in general are a very fine bunch of people.  Generally they are people of great integrity who have made a good contribution to the evolution of this State to date.  There is a danger when speaking on a Bill such as this that we tend to concentrate entirely on certain negative things we know about the profession and fail to acknowledge the very good things which are now and have always been in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and many Members of this House are concerned about the public perception of our system of justice.  I am referring to the results of an opinion poll I saw recently, which would apply also to politicians because at this time we are not in the ascendancy. According to that opinion poll about 9 per cent of the public at large had confidence in the administration of justice; the remainder of the public have lesser degrees of confidence in how our system of justice is administered.  That is a worry. It is a reflection on our courts and on our legal system in general.  The problem is that the public are probably right in their perception.  They believe the courts waste a lot of time &mdash; many Deputies today have also referred to that aspect &mdash; that they are disorganised and haphazard and that peculiar decisions are often made. That perception is widespread and the opinion poll points to that fact.  When people go to court they spend an inordinate amount of time in the court waiting for something to happen; in many cases they spend not just hours but days in the courts.  It is no wonder they come away with the perception that the court is disorganised and haphazard.  Those of us who are lay Members in the legal sense would hardly leave the court with a sense <Col N="222" /> that business was carried on in a very efficient manner.  That is not the way things work or are perceived to work in the courts.</P>
    <P>The listings system has been referred to by a number of speakers, including Deputy Barrett.  I agree with his comments. He referred to the fact that out of court settlements are often made on the morning on which the case is listed to be taken in court.  That is a nuisance.  It interrupts the business of the court and another case cannot be substituted on the list at such short notice.  Time is wasted and it is not anybody's fault.  It is just that the settlement occurred on that morning and there is not any need for the case to be taken that day.  We should give thought to Deputy Barrett's suggestion with regard to fines, or at least that a day should be set aside beyond which a settlement could not take place.  That might force settlement before the list is published so that substitutions could be made and days in court could then be properly organised, at least with regard to the taking of cases.  Public perception is based very much on what the public sees when they go to court.</P>
    <P>There is also a public perception that peculiar decisions emanate from courts, and it is hardly any wonder because quite often a lot of publicity is given to decisions which seem to be at odds with the norm.  I have often heard people say they hope that Justice X will not be in court today because, if he is, they will get a tough sentence; or they hope that Justice Y is there, because their perception of him is that he is fair.  Obviously, we are dealing with people in the courts system and it is impossible for people to totally lack prejudice.  That is not in the nature of the human condition.  We have to remember that the public are generally unhappy with the way things go in court. Taking that into account, we should consider in what way we can change the system in order to make it more efficient, more effective and more user friendly.</P>
    <P>When appointments to companies are being made the applicant is required to undergo various tests.  Looking at it from the layman's point of view, people who <Col N="223" /> are appointed to the Judiciary do not seem to be required to undergo any tests, not even a medical.  That is a bit unfair because they have responsible positions and they often shape people's view of what it is to be a citizen.  There should be more openness about the appointments to the Judiciary and we should be able to get more information about the procedures involved.  If the procedures are as I have suggested, they should be changed.  It is not fair to put in charge of family law an individual with little experience or background that would suit him to the position.  A person appointed to a specialist position needs specialist training.  A person needs to be suited to the kind of position vacant.  He would need some sort of training to give him some understanding of the dynamics of the business so as to make the law more amenable to dealing with cases &mdash; for instance family law cases.  My perception might be wrong, and perhaps there are procedures of which I am not aware, but the appointments to the Judiciary seem to be a closed business.</P>
    <P>Often the only contact the public have with the legal profession arises from conveyancing or probate work.  It is hardly any wonder that the public have a poor view of how solicitors run their businesses when simple cases of conveyancing can take from two to three years.  I know of an individual who put a piece of conveyancing underway and seven years later discovered that the conveyancing had not been carried out.  The man was relaxed about it and was not pushing the issue, but he assumed that if he required the deeds of the property they would be available.  He required the deed urgently and he found out that they were not available seven years later.  The old file was still in the cabinet, the first letter had been written, but a combination of incompetence in the office and delays in the Land Registry meant that the case was not processed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not have been charged by the hour, but nevertheless that is an example of unbelievable incompetence. People get quite angry when they realise that it takes so long for simple conveyancing work to be carried out.  We are well aware that part of the problem lies in the Land Registry due to their staffing problems, but part of the problem is solicitor centred.  One would be foolish to generalise, but some solicitors' offices are quaint places even in this modern world, places where the public perception is very much a reality, where there are files piled on every flat surface and a total lack of order.  That is not general but it is the case in some offices and the public cannot expect any sort of a service when that is the basic organisation in the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three or four weeks ago a young lad and his father came to see me about a case.  The young lad had just passed 21 and he told me that when he reached 21 he had expected a cheque to pop through the front door as a result of an accident he had had when he was three and a half years old.  The cheque did not come through so he went around and checked with the solicitor.  The solicitor appeared perplexed.  There was no file or anything to show what had occurred.  That young man and his father pursued the matter and called on a regular basis to the solicitor who, some time ago, was struck off.  He was struck off before he never managed to produce any documentation to say, first, that there had been an accident, second, that there had been a settlement out of court with an insurance company and, third, that the money had been lodged in Government bonds as was supposed to have been done.  Nothing of that nature was produced and this young lad, who in anticipation had bought himself a site and decided that with the proceeds he would build himself a house, is in a very sorry state now.  I understand that even the records an insurance company would have might, 17 years later, be entirely inadequate, or might have been destroyed.  I have a feeling that this poor lad may suffer the consequences of, probably, incompetence rather than <Col N="225" /> criminality.  That solicitor was basically disorganised and incompetent rather than a criminal.</P>
    <P>We meet some strange cases from time to time.  We must be careful not to generalise. There are some great practitioners in every town in whom the public can and do have confidence. However, there are some practices that are hard to understand.  A solicitor may take a case and charge a particular fee while in another case he charges a bigger fee.  In fact, he becomes an investor in an individual's hopes for the future by charging a percentage of an award rather than setting down his costs and charging in the normal way.  I could never understand how that was allowed to happen, but it has happened and it is still going on.  It is inexplicable that the public would stand for it in the first place that a solicitor would decide to take a lump of money from an individual who was awarded it in court because he had suffered some ill health or disability or his earning power was diminished in some way or another. That a solicitor could decide beforehand that he would take a percentage of that reward rather than charge his usual costs and present his bill in the usual way is inexplicable.  Surely it could only be described as a sort of extortion.  There has been a change in that respect and this Bill is an indication of that.</P>
    <P>I have to agree with the other speakers who have expressed concern about the banks and financial institutions being involved in the conveyancing and probate business.  Deputy Andrews put it very well when he asked who would keep an eye on those people as they carry out that kind of business.  The solicitors' profession is highly regulated and the client is protected to a large extent.  However, there is a grave danger in the banks getting involved in this kind of business.  I am not casting aspersions on anybody working in any bank anywhere, but the banks' first concern is the amount of profit they can make.  That is their business. Financial institutions I imagine in giving advice have one eye firmly fixed on the bank account.  The advice, maybe not deliberately so, given to a client could <Col N="226" /> be coloured by the fact that he owed the bank a substantial amount of money.  He might be advised to do something with property that would be to the advantage of the bank.  It would be difficult to prove but certainly it would be natural for the banks to adopt that approach.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the banks would organise their business in order to take on the business of probate and conveyancing.  I cannot imagine bank managers, or any member of the staff in a small branch down the country, doing it.  I expect it would be centralised in some office in Dublin and the client would never see the person carrying out the business for him.  In my view it is a dangerous move and it needs to be examined in more detail to ensure that the protection clients have been used to will be available to them in this instance.</P>
    <P>I agree that bringing competition into the business is good.  It should lead to more efficiency in the delivery of services to clients.  It should lead to a lowering of costs.  If the protection of the client can also be included in that equation then it would be a good thing.  The Minister is certainly moving in the right direction. It will probably be good for the legal profession in the long run.  Most people say that the legal profession is very conservative and not given to change.  Some of the changes brought about as a result of this Bill will force change on it.  It may have to brush off the cobwebs; it may have to do some thinking and change the way it is doing its business.</P>
    <P>The perception of the public is of dusty offices and files piled one on top of the other.  This is hardly suited to the computer age that we live in.  Whereas it is not generally true anyway, there is a need for the profession to change what it is doing and how it is doing it.  It has to modernise and this Bill will definitely help it do that.</P>
    <P>The advertising that has been allowed to solicitors in the past year or so has led to people being critical of solicitors advertising that they will work on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis, as they call it.  The Minister was critical of this because it would tend to encourage people to take <Col N="227" /> cases before the courts.  I cannot understand that attitude because the courts are available to everybody.  If I think I have a case I should have the right to take it before the court.  If a solicitor advises somebody wrongly, the court will deal with that.  It is important that poor people in particular are given an opportunity to have their rights vindicated in court. Certainly if the system was different and one had to put one's money down before the case was heard, many people could not do that.  Many people, because of the inadequacy of the legal aid system, depend on their solicitors not insisting on money up front.  Therefore, I would not be entirely critical of solicitors who work on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis.  Under this practice people who might not otherwise be able to do so are able to gain access to the courts.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for proposing that the Bill be dealt with by a special committee of the House.  That is quite generous of him in the circumstances. This should however happen on a regular basis.  It will present us with a good opportunity to examine the Bill line by line, word by word, to see what aspects are defective and to put forward amendments to improve it.  I hope to be one of those who will be given the opportunity to sit on the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  This Bill, which will be welcomed by the public in general, contains important provisions to protect consumers of legal services.  Sections 8 and 9, which will give the Law Society new powers to penalise solicitors for providing a bad service and to deal with cases of overcharging, are particularly important.</P>
      <P>Section 25 is perhaps the most important section of the Bill.  It will enable the Law Society to require solicitors to take out professional indemnity insurance to ensure that where a person establishes negligence on the part of a solicitor which resulted in a loss he will be able to recover the loss from an insurance fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Most of the provisions will be welcomed by the solicitors' profession and by the public.  I have however serious reservations about the proposal contained in section 74 of the Bill which will allow the banks to effectively act as solicitors in conveyancing transactions. From my experience as a Deputy I know only too well how ruthless the banks and building societies can be in seeking to throw people out of their homes when they are in arrears no matter how slight. I concur with Deputy Andrews who said that the people we meet in the banks and building societies are excellent people, are courteous and helpful; but, unfortunately, they are not the people who make the decisions to which I am referring. I am concerned about the change proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many constituents of mine have had to rely on solicitors to represent them against the banks and building societies and have found that most solicitors will do so even when they know that the client will be unable to pay the fee.  I have yet to see a bank or building society do anything for nothing &mdash; profit is their God and they have no sense of professional responsibility.  I should say that I hold no brief for solicitors in this matter.  Most Members of the House have come across cases where solicitors failed their clients in financial transactions and so on.  Certainly, people have been left in very difficult and serious situations by certain solicitors.  I should say that we cannot include everyone as the same is true in the case of other professions such as the medical profession.  However, it is essential that the implications of this decision to allow the banks to do this work are fully considered and any changes that are made must be made for the benefit of the public and not in the interests of either solicitors or banks.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which is not dealt with in the Bill and that is the anomalous position of solicitors in the matter of judicial appointments.  At present solicitors have the right to appear before judges in the Circuit Court and High Court without a barrister.  I understand, however, that this right is rarely availed <Col N="229" /> of because of the attitude adopted by judges who are themselves barristers. The solicitors' profession is subject to greater statutory regulation than any other profession in the country.  It is a mark of the professional responsibility of the solicitors' professional that for the most part the profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bradford is in possession.  The Deputy has nine minutes to his credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, they are nine very valuable minutes.  I must remark on my disappointment that the limited time available to discuss this very important Bill has now been limited further.  I suppose that it is not the first time and will not, unfortunately, be the last time that issues affecting young people are pushed back further and further to the margins of our political activity.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, I listened with great interest to the debate throughout the past three nights.  Many of those who spoke talked about youth involvement in the political process and said that they were gravely concerned that young people were quickly becoming very cynical about the entire political process.  The content of many speeches in the debate, and in particular the Government's attitude towards the Bill, will certainly do nothing to change the public perception, particularly the perception of young people, of politicians.  In a sense it was amusing, but also appalling, to hear speaker after speaker from the Government give a certain amount of praise to Deputy Deenihan for his efforts in bringing forward the Bill but equally quickly point out why they could not support the Bill.  It has been disappointing to hear such a response from the Government when neither the Minister nor Government members have presented any clear-cut policy decisions or initiatives.  That is a matter I could not address in the six or seven minutes remaining to me.  Nonetheless, I must express my disappointment at that negative attitude on the part of the Minister and Government.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal briefly with two problems in relation to youth, the first being those faced by youth in rural areas and, second, the difficulties caused within the juvenile justice area.  In relation to youth in rural areas it will have been noted that over the years the two organisations that have done most for the development and enhancement of youth have been the GAA and Macra na Feirme, who have advanced successfully the cause of young people.  As a former member of Macra na Feirme I must say that organisation has been a marvellous vehicle for the personal development of all its members and of the communities it serves.  Unfortunately, it is one of the many organisations that has been hit by Government cutbacks on youth services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are all aware, there was a certain commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to youth services. However, the Government's reneging on that commitment has had a fairly disastrous effect on Macra na Feirme, resulting in the loss of three youth workers within that organisation. It is not only Macra na Feirme who will lose as a result of these cutbacks, but tens of thousands of young people in rural areas who have and would continue to benefit from the types of services they have delivered.  Never has there been a greater need for a youth development organisation in rural areas than at present.  On account of the Common <Col N="239" /> Agricultural Policy reform measures we are told that rural Ireland &mdash; unfortunately I think we can take this prediction to be correct &mdash; will be decimated with many young people leaving the land and deserting rural areas for urban towns and centres.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposed by Deputy Deenihan and the types of structures he would like to see in place would constitute a forum for youth groups in both urban and rural areas to voice their concerns and causes, at least affording them an opportunity to believe that somebody is listening because at present they appear to feel nobody listens.</P>
    <P>There are at present three or four specific problems confronting rural areas which are having a detrimental effect on the lives of young people there and which will be exacerbated considerably by the Brussels proposals.  These include the enormous cutbacks in agricultural support, resulting in farmers leaving the land, in young people seeing no future on the land and leading to a position over the next ten years in which the numbers of people working in agriculture will be halved.  We must remember these people will not disappear off the map or out of the country but will join the ever-increasing dole queues when the present problems of our towns and villages will quickly become those of rural areas.  It was unheard of a number of years ago to have the vast majority of people in townlands throughout rural Ireland approach politicians seeking unemployment assistance and other forms of State assistance.  It is no longer any surprise to find people attending politicians' clinics weekly seeking such social welfare entitlements.  That practice will continue as a result of the cutback regime emanating from Brussels.  It is disappointing that the forum younger people in agriculture would have had available to them to discuss these difficulties will henceforth be removed.</P>
    <P>One area in need of immediate response from Government is that of the training of young people in agriculture. At a time when young people perceive <Col N="240" /> very little future in agriculture &mdash; perhaps rightly so &mdash; those who are sufficiently brave to enter that field should be given every possible assistance by Government. Unfortunately, the difference between agricultural education funding and that available to participants in FÁS courses is quite different, again something which has not been properly addressed by Government.  That is also something that the committee envisaged in Deputy Deenihan's Bill would have highlighted and made a priority for discussion. As Members may know, people who are sufficiently fortunate to train for a job in industry or to acquire an apprenticeship skill with FÁS receive a weekly allowance giving them some form of subsistence throughout the period of their training.  The same type of allowance should apply to those who train in agriculture, but it does not.  However, the position has changed somewhat in that people attending a full time agricultural course will have their college fees paid but receive no weekly allowance, which practice should be revised.  More importantly, those hundreds of farmers who participate in green certificate courses, spending two or three days weekly on such courses, receive no allowance whatsoever.  Such people receive no incentive to improve their farming skills or knowledge.  That is a most disappointing aspect of present Government policy towards young people in rural areas.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that it sounds like a cliché for me to thank Deputy Deenihan for having introduced this Bill leading to the present debate.  I know the Deputy quite well and have never doubted his interest in young people at home or abroad.  I wish to thank him sincerely for having introduced this Bill. While I do not agree with its provisions I always welcome Members from any party outside the Government party doing what Deputy Deenihan has done.</P>
      <P>In the short time available I should like to express my views on the present position with regard to young people in our society.  I know a number of speakers have referred to the fact that possibly in the past our youth services were malefocused. That is a valid point.  However, the Minister of State at the Department of Education in his term in office always has striven to ensure equality of treatment for young men and women in co-operation with the various youth services, many of whose representatives are present this evening in the Visitors' Gallery. I support that approach.</P>
      <P>I become worried when somebody introduces a Bill calling for more reports, policy documents and advisory committees, especially in this area.  There are many tiers of organisations dealing with services for young people to whom many tributes have been paid in the course of this debate, and I should like to add mine. The Minister became angry when he spoke here &mdash; I am glad he did &mdash; because he spoke with conviction on the need for more investment in youth services.  He has made £10 million available.  I know he would like to do much more.  I support him in his appeal and hope that the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance will listen to the strong case he has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Debate on our young people inevitably broadens into a wider one on Irish society, on the quality of life here, on our <Col N="242" /> attitudes, values and standards.  I would have to say it goes much deeper than simply throwing up a prefabricated youth centre in a disadvantaged area.  There is a danger of the debate being steered in that direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the whole question of juvenile justice, which has received a great deal of media attention in recent weeks when there were a number of reported incidents of vandalism and crimes against property in Dublin's western suburbs.  Crime involving juveniles is a serious problem in this country.  It is a problem recognised by young people themselves and by the various youth organisations, including the National Youth Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The decision of the former Minister for Education, now Minister for Health, Deputy O'Rourke, to make new regulations governing the sale of solvents to those under the age of 18 is a welcome development.  I know the Minister was concerned at the high level of deaths resulting from abuse of solvents.  It would be my hope that these regulations will go some way to alleviate this problem. Obviously there needs to be a degree of public health education in this area which I am sure the Department of Health will endeavour to provide.  Of course, many youth organisations provide such educational programmes at present.  It is an issue that has been well documented in the Garda probation and welfare annual reports.  Indeed the Costello and Whitaker reports also have recognised the problem.  It is also worth noting that crime among juveniles has been increasing since the late seventies.  Probably the most worrying aspect is the increase in violent crime.  All of this is despite the efforts of State agenies and the many youth services.</P>
    <P>Why do people commit crime?  Is it related to the socio-economic background of the young people involved? What we witnessed in the past few weeks was no doubt accentuated by media coverage of the events.  It is not the case that all crime is found in areas of socio-economic deprivation, but I have no doubt that poor housing, unstable family <Col N="243" /> background, unemployment and a family history of alcohol or drug abuse or crime can be contributing factors to young person's becoming involved in crime.</P>
    <P>While the carrying out of a criminal act is a deliberate, conscious and deeply personal act, peer pressure also puts the young person in a vulnerable position.  I am not trying to find excuses for the individual's lack of responsibility in society.  We must recognise that there is a tremendous lack of respect for the Garda among many who are from disadvantged areas.  They ask why they should not be involved in crime.  It is clear that the very rich can escape their debts, seek protection from their creditors in the courts and use insider or privileged information to make fortunes; yet a young man or woman, or even a child, can be sent to prison for evading a DART fare. What is known as white collar crime can go unnoticed by the system and those involved in such practices know that the laws in this area are hopelessly out of date.  Sentencing reform in the last century was designed to reflect a degree of proportion between the offence and the crime.  I would warn of the danger of allowing the evolution of a system of justice which at times operates in a two-tiered fashion.  Some of the instances of juvenile penalties are exceptional, but the law must be seen to be fair and just. The quality of the administration of the law is at the very core of our democratic system.  Young people deserve to be treated as equals by those who monitor our behaviour as a society.</P>
    <P>We have the bleak urban environment of rows of semi-detached housing, often poorly built, situated in what were once the green fields of County Dublin.  Proper facilities have not been provided.  Lack of employment is the backdrop for disillusionment and discontent.  The individual's contact with society may amount to no more than seeing corporation rent collectors, social welfare inspectors, money-lenders and so on.  I have witnessed this in County Dublin during the past few years.  Where there is a lack of respect for society there will develop a <Col N="244" /> lack of regard for others and their property. This manifests itself in the destruction of property, larceny and minor assault &mdash; all crimes which tend to be committed by juveniles.  Parental attitude, where it is ambivalent on this subject, contributes to the mentality that crime pays and is OK as long as you do not get caught.</P>
    <P>One solution is obviously jobs.  People without jobs are depressed.  Unemployment scourges families and individuals. Pressure builds up on individual family members.  Of course there are people who have reared their families while under the strain of poverty, low wages or unemployment, without ever engaging in criminal activity and they deserve our support.  It has been asserted that social welfare recipients should be encouraged into meaningful employment. This deserves attention.  Perhaps employers could top up social welfare payments.  The family income supplement scheme might be re-examined.</P>
    <P>Traditional family structures have disintegrated in the past 20 years.  The focus on the family unit and the influences of the Church and school have diminished. The voluntary youth services have compensated for that lack of security in the family home.  If young people are out unsupervised or causing damage to property, do the parents know where they are or do they care?  If the answer is no, society has a problem which must be addressed.  Familes who lived in small, close-knit communities in the inner city were moved to vast public housing schemes.  The population of Dublin has doubled in the past 20 to 30 years and 20 per cent of the workforce are unemployed.</P>
    <P>This debate must address the broader issue.  There is a responsibility on political leaders, planners, public servants, teachers, social workers and health board employees to work with the voluntary agencies to provide support structures for the unemployed, single parents and others who because of their circumstances and environment find it difficult to raise children.  We must not try to apply traditional solutions to complex, <Col N="245" /> long term modern problems.  The &ldquo;hang `em, flog 'em and whip 'em&rdquo; mentality will not resolve this problem but will only contribute to existing problems.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of this Government that they have done many commendable things in trying to address this problem. In education the bias has been in favour of disadvantaged areas and there has been an emphasis on links with home. The Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, has outlined what he has endeavoured to do by increasing investment in youth services.  I warmly welcome the interdepartmental committee on child care and homelessness chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Chris Flood. There are three Departments involved&mdash; Health, Education and Justice.</P>
    <P>In the short term we need to provide costly and secure detention centres for young offenders, male and female.  It is absurd and immoral that children have to be remanded in custody in Garda barracks. We have all witnessed the spectacle of district justices being forced to plead from the bench to the Government to address this problem.  Disturbed and dangerous young people need to be in an environment of constant supervision, attention, counselling and rehabilitation if they are to re-enter society.  There should be an extension of the juvenile liaison scheme, the probation and welfare service and the community service order scheme, to ensure that as many young people as possible are kept out of the prison regime.  More effort needs to be expended on the non-custodial option. Community service orders have proved to be most effective.  The Whitaker report shows how little is spent on this option. The youth organisations believe that this emphasis must change if young people are to be prevented from committing crime rather than rehabilitated after the criminal act has been committed.  The Whitaker report recommended that St. Patrick's Institution be closed without delay because rehabilitation is not possible where the physical conditions are such as to nullify any proper personal development programme.</P>
    <P>Life and social skills training should <Col N="246" /> be part of the curricula in primary and secondary schools.  The youth services have said consistently that young people are not given the necessary skills to cope with adolescent and adult social life. Because many young people have to develop a sense of belonging to society, criminal activity becomes easier.  The individual has a lack of awareness of duty to society.  The Minister must ensure that funding to community and youth groups is increased substantially to support and help these people in a constructive way. The youth services should be streamlined and the number of State Departments involved should be reduced.  I pay tribute to the voluntary organisations.  The services they offer are extremely good value for money and further investment should be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford and others referred to emigration.  Many of our emigrants are looking for jobs, housing and social contacts.  I would encourage the interlinking of FÁS services with those provided by their counterparts in the UK, the co-ordination of these services and the computerisation of information so that young people going abroad will be well aware of what to expect.  Schools should provide information on health care, AIDS and so on.  There are many things young people are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>This Bill has facilitated a very good debate and I wish we could give it more time.  Most Deputies have emphasised that there is a void in respect of the age group from 12 to 17.  It is necessary to follow the child from primary level through second level and into third level and to provide equality of opportunity. As I said, there is much more to this debate than putting up prefabricated youth centres here and there.  I welcome the fact that many Deputies have recognised this and referred to it during the course of the debate.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to compliment Deputy Deenihan for bringing this Bill before the House.  The Bill contains many sound, solid and well worked out proposals.  Even if the Bill is voted down in the House tonight, Deputy Deenihan can be certain that many of the ideas put forward by him and other speakers will be incorporated in future legislation on the provision of youth services. I am sure that many of his ideas will be taken on board by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in his efforts to extend youth services in the years ahead. For this, Deputy Deenihan has earned the gratitude of this House and of young people who are reaching out for the kind of services proposed in his Bill.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that young people today are growing up in a world vastly at variance with the world in which we were reared.  At one end of the spectrum the pressure for points and third level places has taken a stranglehold on the growing years of thousands of youngsters, stripping them of the freedoms, joys and delights which ought to be the hallmarks of their childhood.  At the other end of the spectrum many thousands of school leavers are forced to grow up in an environment of extreme social, cultural and economic deprivation.  Irrespective of the social setting in which they live, all youngsters have to make their way in a world riven with commercial exploitation and moral uncertainties.  In addition, for the first time in human history the faults, foibles, deceits and dishonesty of the adult world have been cruelly exposed to young people through the medium of television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing we have to do is acknowledge the unprecedented difficulties with which this generation of young people have to grapple.  Having done that, we must then resolve to put in place proper provision proportionate to the scale of difficulties.  In short, we cannot confront today's problems with the recipes of yesterday.  In relation to youth services, we must aim to put in place a comprehensive youth development policy based on current and emerging needs.  We must make proper <Col N="248" /> financial provision to ensure that this policy is fully implemented on the ground in every corner of the country.  We must make policy decisions which will discriminate positively in favour of the more disadvantaged young people in our society.</P>
    <P>There is much talk at present about the principle of cohesion at European level. That principle is based on the idea that areas of greater wealth will transfer at least some of their wealth to the poorer regions thereby bringing about a greater balance in terms of justice.  At the Maastricht Summit which will take place next week our representatives will argue very strongly for the adoption and implementation of that principle.  I hope they succeed resoundingly in their argument.</P>
    <P>However, there is an equal need for us to put in place the very same principle in relation to domestic matters.  We must look at the enormous imbalance which exists here between areas of high disadvantage and areas which are less disadvantaged. We must adopt the principle of cohesion we will be pursuing at Maastricht in any future policy making, funding or planning.  As I said recently, much of the money from lottery sources which was granted to golf clubs and amenities of that nature in the past number of years ought to be directed to areas of high disadvantage, especially disadvantaged urban areas, the hallmarks of which have been well defined for us in recent times. I am talking in particular about areas which have a high level of long term unemployment, very high social deprivation, very poor housing, poor recreational facilities and very poor physical planning.  In conscience, we can no longer afford to ignore the special problems which are emerging in such areas.  We have to apply the principle of cohesion to these areas.</P>
    <P>In any reappraisal of the present system we will first have to examine the gaps which exist.  Despite the value of the youth service work currently being carried out both on a voluntary and statutory basis, these services do not reach a large number of people.  We must bear this in mind in any future improvements, <Col N="249" /> new legislation or new policy directions. For example, I have noticed that the people who benefit from adult education are those who had the benefit of first level, second level and third level education as a basic educational qualification. They are the people who gain further qualifications later in life through adult education.  We need to ensure from here on in that our first commitment is to the people who did badly from the start.  We must give these people a second chance.  We must also do the same in terms of our youth services.  We must aim to reach out to the people who have not been brought on board to date, people in disadvantaged areas.  We must also reach out to young women.  A feature of much of the youth work which has been carried out to date has been the exclusion of young women.  We must ensure that this is not repeated in the future.</P>
    <P>I fully support the convincing argument put forward by the Minister for additional funding for his Department. He has the right commitment and idea and we must all support him in his demand for national funding.  The Progressive Democrats believe that the main core of that funding has to be put on a statutory basis, must come within the ambit of education and must be part of the annual Estimates.  This would put the funding on a much firmer basis.  It could also be topped up from lottery sources.  I do not think we can leave an issue as important as youth services to the vagaries of lottery funding.  We need to put it on a more statutory basis.  I would support the Minister in his efforts to do this.</P>

      <P>That provision is in line with the recommendations on youth policy produced by the Progressive Democrats and I have no difficulty in supporting it.  It is an idea that must be developed further.</P>
      <P>The training of youth leaders will have to be put on a much more formal basis.  I would like to see us working towards a situation where there would be proper certification of the qualifications of youth workers so that all youth workers, no matter what part of the country they work in, would be of uniform standard.  In that way we would be better able to monitor and appraise the progress of their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who are concerned about youth services and youth cannot ignore the major problems that young people have to confront as a result of under <Col N="251" /> age drinking.  If that is not confronted in legislation and in the enforcement of legislation all the youth services in the world will not be able to assist those young people.  In the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, two provisions deal directly with the control of sale of drink to young people.  Section 40 deals with the putting in place of a system of age cards and section 47 deals with the regulation of the sale of drink in supermarkets and off-licences. Those sections have not been enforced because the appropriate ministerial order is not in place.  This evening, in the context of a Bill dealing with youth, I appeal to the Minister for Justice to make the order that will make those two sections effective.  Those who go into a supermarket between now and Christmas will see barrels, tubs, flagons, six packs and cans of drink littered around the floor.  It is most accessible to young people.  That would not be the case if the provisions of the Act were implemented. I appeal to the Minister to make the necessary order and assist his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy F. Fahey, and all of us including Deputy Deenihan, in implementing the aspirations of this Bill.</P>

Strange bedfellows <Col N="252" /> though we are, I am grateful to them for being generous with their time.</P>
      <P>In the last few weeks we have heard much in this House about the national interest.  Those two words have been bandied about in debates on the completion of the Single Market.  The national interest was regarded as being paramount in our society and in this House.  What does it mean?  Is it a cliche that politicians put forward when they are in a tight corner?  The national interest means nothing unless it means people, and especially our young people.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a response to the problems of young people in our society.  It is an important measure and it at least attempts to give priority to young people in our society.  It also marks out the special problems of young people and it goes some way towards co-ordinating youth services.  That is not a bad landmark or objective.  In the course of his remarks Deputy Deenihan said there was a 27 per cent unemployment rate and he pinpointed emigration as being the scourge of young people.  Young people are entitled to the best possible start in life we can give them.  We must try to lay a good foundation for future society.</P>
      <P>Our job as public representatives is to lay a framework for people to lead decent lives.  Instead, we find great humiliation, disillusionment and cynicism among young people who are trying to find work. It is a tough, rough traumatic transition from school to the market place.  Many young people are introduced to unemployment on the first day they leave school.  That is a very sad, sobering thought in our society.  It is difficult for any young boy or girl to have to hustle in the labour market.  It is almost impossible today for any young boy or girl to get a decent job without influence.  We are back to the bad old days of the thirties, forties and fifties again.  It is difficult even to get in a FÁS training course which should be their right.  In many cases if they do find employment they receive low wages and are exploited.  The training allowances paid to young people on FÁS courses are very low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teenagers in our society, especially <Col N="253" /> those who are unemployed, should have the same rights as anybody else but this is not the case.  Discrimination in social welfare is widespread and examples have been given of the difficulties for young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We welcome the specific provision to appoint an advisory board and recognise in this a mechanism of accountability and co-ordination rather than a bureaucratic obstacle that has been referred to by some Government speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my time is so short, and lest I am caught short like Deputy Kemmy, I should like to pay tribute to the youth service, to youth workers, to the youth members of many organisations who make up the youth service.  Their dedication, and commitment and, in most cases, their voluntary effort, keeps our <Col N="254" /> youth service going against all the odds. Indeed, the theme used at this year's annual assembly of the National Youth Council of Ireland was &ldquo;Achievement against the Odds&rdquo;.  According to their magazine the president of the National Youth Council of Ireland said:</P>
    <P>Our young people are fighting a grim battle to receive a proper education, obtain meaningful employment and become meaningful participating members of our society ... our young people, the future of our country, without doubt receive a raw deal.  They are the ones who bear the brunt of education cuts, rises in unemployment and rampant emigration.  Young people have been excluded from our society to the extent that they have become alienated, disillusioned and willingly disenfranchised.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs was not present to hear the debate at the National Youth Council annual meeting.  It was not the first occasion on which he failed to attend the annual assembly of the National Youth Council of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that apparently he has reached the conclusion that if there is not uncritical acceptance of what young people consider to be his patronising lectures he will absent himself entirely.  Several of those involved in youth organisations &mdash; I say respectfully &mdash; have told me that young people working in the youth service are becoming increasingly resentful of the Minister's patronising approach to their policy aspirations for the development of a youth service by their organisations here. I also regret having to say that the Minister seems to regard dispensing funds from the budget available to the particular section of the Department of Education &mdash; like Fianna Fáil regard <Col N="255" /> dispensing funds from the national lottery &mdash; as a matter of &ldquo;look after your own backyard first and then let the rest scramble for what is left&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Waving good luck to our soccer team is very popular but waving farewell to young emigrants is less glamorous but more consistent with reality.  Foreign travel is so much more attractive than domestic travel to places like Neilstown, Ronanstown and other places.  All of this is a far cry from the hope expressed by the same youth organisations in 1987, at the time of the Minister's appointment. Indeed, the journal of the National Youth Council of Ireland entitled <i>Output</i> welcomed the Minister's appointment at the time and the front page posed the question, &ldquo;Will he give the youth services a lift?&rdquo;  Four years later we know that the youth service has in fact been taken for a ride.</P>
      <P>I found it difficult to listen to Deputy Kitt praising the Minister of State for getting angry last week.  I am sorry Deputy Kemmy has left because it reminds me of his famous remark about the Minister's colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, when he reminded him that he was a mighty mouse in the constituency but a mini-mouse when it came to the House.  I would have a great deal more respect for the Minister if instead of roaring in the Chamber, he roared at the Cabinet table at his Minister to get more funding for the service.  It is depressing for youth organisations to have to hear the Minister's impotent pleas, as if he was an Opposition Deputy, in this debate, the same Minister who imposed savage cuts in the year underway.  Thirty-five full-time workers have lost their jobs as a result of the cuts introduced by the Minister. I am not impressed by the Minister's anger.  I would be much more impressed if he was more successful in arguing for adequate funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a reflection on this House, and particularly on the Minister with responsibility for youth affairs, that we <Col N="256" /> have not discussed this question since 1985.  It is all the more regrettable that the Minister and the Government have decided to vote down this Bill which The Workers' Party are prepared to welcome as a stepping stone towards the evolution of such a policy.  The Minister seems to be opposed in principle to evolving a policy on youth services.  He would prefer to continue the existing patronising system where he is seen to dispense funding to grateful recipients as he determines. The Minister seems disinterested in the hostility his approach has invited from across the spectrum of youth organisation. The Minister's refusal to attend the last meeting of the National Youth Council is evidence of this.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, youth organisations cannot plan, do not have budgets and cannot guarantee full-time jobs.  It is arguable that youth organisations have never before confronted such a challenge. To allow this Bill to pass Committee Stage would offer the prospect of a statutory framework within which a coherent policy on youth services could evolve.  Any Minister with responsibility for youth affairs worth his salt would give this Bill the nod into Committee Stage. Those in the public gallery watching us tonight, or those who will read this Bill, do not appreciate that if the Minister was prepared to take his courage in his hands and nod this Bill into Committee Stage the Government would reassert control over its development from there.  If the Minister has amendments that would strengthen the Bill, I am quite sure Deputy Deenihan would be prepared to consider them.  Instead, the Minister seems to be prepared to continue his preference for the other half of his portfolio, posing for high profile shots with Jack Charlton and waving the soccer team goodbye or accompanying them to Rome, while at the same time offering a £45,000 pittance from he budget, for youth services, the other £9.8 million to be made up from lottery funding.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Deenihan in bringing this Youth Services Bill before the House.  It is something we have come to expect from Deputy Deenihan who is a man of action, a man who knows sport and youth work in its many dimensions, a man who, possibly better than anyone else in both Houses, has a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; knowledge of what exactly is involved.  Apart from providing the House with an opportunity to debate in some detail youth services in general, this Bill marks another legislative milestone in Fine Gael's putting forward of policy issues in legislative form.  I refer to the vocational education committee Bill which was much maligned by the previous Minister for Education, the mistress of novices, now gone as a fugitive to Health.  I refer also to the Fine Gael <Col N="258" /> Education Bill which should have provided a stimulus for the Government to act but unfortunately the Green Paper has gone by the way for the fifth time in succession.  I compliment the proposer of this Bill.  I can only criticise in concert with Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister's ungraciousness in not having the magnanimity to accept this Bill for what it is. For somebody who comes from a party who are supposed to expouse positive politics, the Minister's reaction has been very negative and disappointing.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Fahey, has developed somewhat of a reputation as being precipitative and lacking in mature judgment.  Was it not the Minister, Deputy Fahey, who launched Eamon Coughlan into the chief executive position in Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann? The subsequent history of that appointment speaks for itself.  I recall one occasion when Deputy Fahey took a public swipe at Irish American politicians for not doing enough to regularise the situation of the illegal Irish immigrants and was publicly rebuked by the venerable Tip O'Nell who said &ldquo;Young Fahey has not quite made it; he does not understand&rdquo;.  I am afraid that &ldquo;young Fahey&rdquo; still does not understand that one can fool some of the people some of the time but not all of the people all of the time.</P>
      <P>The positive and affirmative response from the youth organisations to this Bill speaks for itself.  It is good to see the people in the public gallery, people with their lanyards, with their neckerchiefs, the people from the scouting organisations and from the various youth organisations who have come as a collective force to say that they are not satisfied with the performance of the Government and that they think that this measure deserves a positive response from Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Minister of State to describe this Bill as being totally useless is insulting coming from the Minister but it is a further insult to the youth organisations. <Col N="259" /> For the Minister to proceed for 25 minutes to deliver a whinging, snivelling performance about having no money for youth services was pathetic to the point of disbelief.  Two weeks ago the Minister told us that he had to get the message across to the Taoiseach, to the Minister for Finance and to the Government that more money should be put into this area. Would the Minister like Deputy Deenihan and Fine Gael to arrange a deputation to the Minister for Finance which he could join so as to make the point?</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the sentiments expressed in the Bill.  In 1989 the lottery had a profit of £44 million.  In 1990 it has a profit of £53 million.  Section 5 of the National Lottery Act states specifically that the primary purpose of this is for youth and recreation purposes.  It is scandalous to see huge amounts of the limited budget available for sport and a substantial number of FÁS programmes, going to golf clubs and to chauvinist organisations.  It is a scandal that EC Structural Funds have been diverted in this way as well.  It is an indication of the priorities of this Government that £600,000 of EC Structural Funds went to Dr. Smurfit's K Club while Voluntary Service International, North Great George's Street, had their budget cut from £28,700 in 1990 to £4,000 this year. That resulted in the loss of two permanent staff, the scrapping of numerous programmes involving community integration and the leaving aside of a whole work programme.  I put it to the Minister that if we got something like these resources into Neilstown and Ronanstown we would not have the Minister coming in here pumping the air and protesting that he has been cut back by his own colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>I would further make the point that the Government are lucky to have been given an early warning shot in relation to Neilstown and Ballyfermot.  These are only the bush fires that will break out into an inferno unless money is put into these <Col N="260" /> areas, unless jobs, education, shopping facilities and youth services are provided.</P>
    <P>There are Neilstowns scattered the length and breadth of Ireland.  They are particularly on the periphery of the big cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Unless positive action is taken by way of targeting resources at these areas these issues will boil over and we will have not brush fires but an inferno.  Again, I want to congratulate Deputy Deenihan.  He has put forward a positive, practical Bill with legislative proposals that any Government worth its salt would take on board and have debated subjectively, objectively and coolly in a quiet committee chamber.  The Minister of State would not let up the blinds on his blinkered thinking but blasted it out of the water.  This has been a bad night for the Government but a good night for youth services because we are convinced that in Government Deputy Deenihan would deliver on every one of these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to thank those Deputies who have supported my Bill over the last two weeks.  I believe those Deputies who have supported me understand that the youth service needs a permanent stable base from which to operate.  For their support I must express my thanks.  However, I am most disappointed at the Minister's lack of enthusiasm for my Bill and, in particular, I take offence at the offhand and flippant way that he has dismissed my proposal.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to counter some, at least, of the more outrageous allegations made by the Minister and other speakers on behalf of the Government in their attempts to cloud and muddy the issue in order to frustrate the passage of this Bill through the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was often confused during this debate because I was not sure which side the Government speakers were on.  Deputies Lawlor, Martin, Coughlan and Wallace and tonight Deputies Kitt and Quill spoke about the splendid work youth <Col N="261" /> organisations were doing.  They spoke of the need to avoid duplication and fragmentation. Do they not understand that this Bill and the establishment of the advisory committee would make it possible to avoid duplication and fragmentation. I am at a loss to understand why when somebody else calls for co-ordination the Government call it bureaucracy, but when the Government appoint a committee such as the interdepartmental committee on crime they call it co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I was shocked last night in the House when Deputy Lawlor referred to the young people of Neilstown as brats. These are his constituents.  He seems to forget that it was Government policy to move people to Neilstown without facilities or jobs, and he calls them brats. Minister Fahey is on record as saying that if he was living there he could be also engaged in violent activity.  Is Deputy Lawlor calling him a brat as well?</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised again and again the need for money to be pumped into the youth service.  I recognise this need.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a national advisory committee would anticipate problems, would plan ahead, would co-ordinate and regulate.  We would not need knee jerk reactions like we had last week by the Government with the establishment of an interdepartmental committee by the Minister for Justice.  Are they knee jerk reactions or window dressing I wonder?</P>
    <P>Once the youth service is given a legislative base then funding can be more easily obtained.  The system will have been regularised, there will be accountability, there will be monitoring, and there will be less disquiet among the public, the Government and the Taoiseach with regard to funding for the youth service.  It is the Minister's responsibility to secure adequate funding for youth services. It is juvenile of him to go to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; and wring his hands &mdash; and in the same breath say he needs <Col N="262" /> more money.  It is his job to get the funding so let him wipe away the crocodile tears and get down to work Minister.  He must accept collective Cabinet responsibility. The Minister has mislead the public into believing that youth services are paid for by the taxpayer.  That is not the case: the taxpayer contributes £45,000 and the national lottery £9.8 million.</P>
    <P>Moving to another topic, the Minister has made it quite clear that when he came into power in 1987 he did not intend to &ldquo;have any more policy documents, reports or committees&rdquo;, that we had sufficient documentation and talk and what we really want is action.  Thus, by extension, the Minister states that an advisory committee would be a waste of time because it would be merely further discussion leading to bureaucracy.  But the Minister has missed the whole point of the Bill.  The point of the Bill has been missed by the Minister because he has isolated each section and treated each as if it should stand alone.  The Bill is clear enough to be read in one sitting.</P>
    <P>The clear intention of the Bill, in case this was missed, was not only to provide a statutory advisory committee but also to give the youth service the platform, the recognition and the kudos it needs to ensure financial stability and increased funds.  The Minister has stated that there is need for politicians, civil servants and the general public to recognise that the best value for Government expenditure comes from the youth service.  I wholeheartedly believe this to be true and I agree with the Minister; but where is the evidence that the Minister has in any way attempted to convince all these parties that this is in fact the case.  This Bill provides the opportunity of placing the youth service on a plane where it will be recognised, where the Minister's task of convincing the powers that be that more funding needs to be allocated will be that much easier.  So, again, I must strongly assert that the Minister's dismissal of my Bill is not based on any <Col N="263" /> concrete reasons but rather is politically motivated and is certainly not in the best interests of the young people.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister a major inconsistency in his argument against my Bill.  He states there is no need for any more policy reports or committees. If that is so, why is the Minister at European level working on the development of a European youth policy?  As I understand it the prerequisite for a European youth policy is that member states have their own policies formulated first and they bring them to the negotiating table.  Because we have no policy the Minister had nothing to bring to the meetings and indeed less to bring home.  If we are serious about giving our young people a real chance to prosper and develop in the broader European context we must first show our commitment to promoting their welfare at national level.  Only then will we have a legitimate contribution to make to the development of European youth policy.</P>
    <P>Another point which the Minister makes in his reply to my opening speech is that this Bill would merely put another layer of bureaucracy on existing structures. I do not think that I have to remind the Minister that he has been pressing very hard over the last number of years to ensure that youth organisations do co-operate. The Minister knows that youth organisations have been making a sustained effort to increase co-operation. Yet when the Minister is asked to co-operate, as he is in this Bill, he calls it mere bureaucracy and states that the committee would go into areas which are not the responsibility of the Department of Education.  This is exactly the point of the Bill.  We need a holistic approach to the management and policy development of the youth services of this country and this committee, which spans a wide range of Departments and interests, will provide for such a holistic approach.</P>
    <P>It is cynical and two-faced in the <Col N="264" /> extreme of the Minister to call on youth organisations to co-operate more closely but yet when asked to co-operate himself he sees fit to interpret this as mere bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>As far as my proposal for local advisory committees are concerned, the Minister has stated that what we will be doing here is merely adding another bureaucratic layer which will conflict with the local voluntary youth councils already established. I must pointedly state to the Minister that it was certainly never the intention to create a further layer to the local voluntary youth councils.  The proposal is that the current local voluntary youth councils in operation will be absorbed into the new structures, their powers and funding increased, and thus there will be no duplication.  Rather there will be an expansion of what was already in place.</P>
    <P>I must also add that the Minister has never been a great champion of the local voluntary youth councils structure despite what may have been said.  Their work has largely gone unnoticed and unrecognised.  Neither the Minister nor his Department have responded in any way to the submissions made by them, in particular, the annual reports and requests for funding which, I regret to say, have not even been acknowledged.  Today, I attended the launch of the report of the County Dublin Voluntary Youth Council. Not only is the Minister failing to provide services for young people in large areas of County Dublin, he is also ignoring those who work for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated he can see no reason why there should be a register for youth organisations, yet, in the same speech he maintained that, &ldquo;the main difficulty which has always existed in relation to youth service provision is that it is not taken seriously by the general public or politicians on all sides of the House&rdquo;.  In his speech he made the case for registration.  He may have all the information at his disposal and his Department may have all the information <Col N="265" /> they need on youth organisations and on the way funding is allocated but who else has this information?</P>
    <P>This register would be of help to those with an interest in youth affairs and also to those who have little or no idea of the work youth organisations do.  They have recognised standards, criteria for action, methods of operation and standards of procedure.  In other words, such a register would be of help to youth organisations in getting more money.  I should point out that we have lost three quarters of an hour during the course of this debate.  This reflects the attitude of politicians and the Government towards young people whose representatives are sitting in the Public Gallery tonight.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank you for affording me the opportunity to raise this very important matter. I am aware that the ESB board met today and if the Minister can tell us that the matter has been resolved I will be more than happy.</P>
      <P>The Minister's role in this whole affair is questionable.  As a result of negotiations which took place over three years an agreement was reached earlier this year between the ESBOA and ESB management involving the Joint Industrial Council of the ESB.  It had been accepted by the union that management had given an unequivocal assurance that what was agreed would be delivered.  The negotiations led to an agreement that would be of benefit to the staff of the company as well as the customers.</P>
      <P>The Minister's intervention &mdash; I refer specifically to a letter which the Minister wrote to Dr. Moriarty on 29 November &mdash; totally undermines and sabotages the industrial relations machinery within the company.  It opposes the ICTU position on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and negates all existing categories of group negotiations.  Furthermore it will sour industrial relations which have been improving gradually down the years despite some very acrimonious exchanges in the past between union and management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB Joint Industrial Council on 13 June last produced recommendations, which were accepted by both sides, on the scale of payments arising from a claim by the ESBOA which was originally served in 1988.  As late as mid-November last the chief executive of the ESB informed the company's unions which cover eight categories of workers that proposals on productivity and change would be progressed.  On 29 November 1991 the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, communicated with Dr. Moriarty and informed him that the proposals <Col N="270" /> were not to go ahead.  What we are witnessing here by Deputy Molloy &mdash; it seems he has the full backing of the Cabinet &mdash; is interference in the internal industrial relations of the ESB and this is most undesirable and unprecedented.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to establish is what the Government are up to in this case. Are they trying to use the ESB unions as a lever to pressurise Congress to accept the revised provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i>  If so, they are playing with fire and are treading on very dangerous ground.  As a result we may have no electricity supply over the Christmas period and that would be undesirable.  We were guaranteed three years of industrial peace if this agreement was allowed to go ahead, with a special charter for customers which would ensure a better service to the community, at no extra cost to the company.  This cannot now be achieved by virtue of the fact that the Minister has interfered in what has been the traditional method of industrial relations, thereby creating the present crisis.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for allowing me to share his time.  I put down a Private Notice Question on this matter yesterday but it was ruled out of order.  It is appalling that for the second time this year we are facing the prospect of a cut in ESB supplies and it is particularly unacceptable at this time of the year.  Taking into account the 30 day requirement perhaps a cut in ESB supply over the Christmas period is ruled out but we could face a cut in January or February if the issues are not resolved urgently.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan about the way this dispute is being handled by the Minister in that it seems that megaphone industrial relations communications are taking place.  Headlines of communications with the Minister &mdash; perhaps he is not directly responsible for these publications &mdash; certainly read extremely badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> The new chief executive is trying to reestablish satisfactory industrial relations in a historically poisoned environment. The handling of the dispute to date is certainly unacceptable.  If it is to be solved what is required is consumate skill and sensitivity.  It is inappropriate that the ESB should become a football in sorting out the current problems in relation to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Arising out of the last dispute, a labour relations group was established in the ESB under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Cassells.  Are that group up and running and are they in a position to be of assistance in resolving this dispute quietly and hopefully without cutting off electricity supplies from the Irish public once more?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it somewhat regrettable that we are here tonight discussing what best might be described as a hypothetical industrial action.  The House can be assured that as Minister responsible for the secure supply of energy all steps are automatically taken to make sure that essential energy services are not disrupted. This concern is not just restricted to periods of potential difficulty but facilitates all worthwhile change and development in our semi-State bodies which have responsibility for delivery of energy services. Similarly the Ministers for Finance and Labour who have their own particular responsibilities in the current ESB industrial relations situation have taken and will take all the necessary steps to ensure that a fair and reasonable solution will be found consistent with Government pay policies.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility, however, for an uninterrupted supply of electricity lies with the management and unions within the company.  I am informed that both parties are concentrating all their efforts to avoid any unnecessary industrial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the hypothetical situation <Col N="272" /> put down by Deputy by O'Sullivan, including the unhelpful emotional suggestion that ESB staff would restrict electricity supplies during Christmas, I am very conscious how inappropriate the timing of his motion is.  At this moment the ESB management and unions are engaged in what I believe are constructive discussions with a view to finding an equitable solution which conforms to the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  A public airing of criticism, prejudies and misgivings could only have the effect of making those discussions more difficult and in certain circumstances could jeopardise the goodwill of the negotiating parties.  However unwelcome this discussion is at this time I will use the occasion to record the silient facts of the current industrial relations situation in the ESB.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was agreed earlier this year following extensive discussions among the social partners about the most appropriate framework for the development of Ireland's economy.  Particular consideration was given to balancing everyone's natural desire for improvements in their personal financial situation with the requirements for economic growth, additional employment and improvement in the national finances. The pay provisions contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were the result of this process and they represented a consensus among the social partners as to what the economy could afford.</P>
    <P>We are all now aware that Ireland's economic growth in 1990 was exceptional and that the current estimates of much lower growth in 1991 represent a sharp contrast.  If anything, this points to a reduction in our ability, as a nation, to pay ourselves more.  There is certainly no evidence that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> underestimated our ability to accommodate pay increases.</P>
    <P>When the terms of the ESB Industrial Council recommendation for the ESB <Col N="273" /> Officers' Association were examined in the Department of Finance and in my Department it was not clear that they conformed with the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The matter was considered by Government and it was concluded that the proposals in the form originally agreed could not be approved.  In particular, the Government decided that self-financing pay increases are only permissible provided there is no increase in the total payroll costs for the group concerned.</P>
    <P>On foot of the Government decision I wrote to the ESB on Friday advising them that pay increases for their staff must be compatible with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the effect of this was to require re-examination of pay proposals which had been negotiated between ESB management and unions based on a different interpretation of self-financing.  This reconsideration is now underway within the ESB and I am hopeful that a settlement will be achieved and industrial action avoided.</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is to ensure that the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are not exceeded.  In these circumstances there would be no justification for industrial action which results in power cuts so that one sector of our community can use its key role in the supply of an essential service in order to get more than provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  As negotiations are already underway I do not propose to complicate the matter by making any additional unnecessary comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Local authority tenants in Dublin were last given the opportunity to purchase their houses during the Millennium. The same situation applies <Col N="274" /> throughout the country.  However in Dublin a large number of tenants who applied to purchase their houses during the Millennium still have not completed the transaction and signed the deeds of ownership: the process has been slowed down at the local authority end because of the need for resources and support from the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>The practice in the past was that, if not every year at least on a very regular basis, new local authority sale schemes would issue; but there has been none since the much heralded tenant purchase scheme in the Millennium year.  People who did not take the opportunity to purchase their local authority house during the Millennium have not been able to purchase their local authority house since then.  Despite numerous requests to the Minister for the Environment, he has given no indication in the recent past that he intends to remedy this by introducing another tenant purchase scheme.  What effect does this have on the local authority tenants, who may be living in a house for up to 40 years?  If an elderly widow who has not purchased her house passes on, the house reverts to the local authority despite the fact that she may have been a tenant for 40 years.  She may have paid for the property many times over, but she does not now have the opportunity to will it to her relatives.  This is grossly unfair.  It is now the best part of four years since local authority tenants were given the opportunity to purchase their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only should people who want to purchase their houses be allowed to do so but people living in local authority flats and maisonettes should also be allowed to do so.  I have been instrumental in informing the Department of the Environment through pointing out to the local authority how such schemes work in other countries.  Yet despite our efforts over the years to press the Department to allow the local authority sell the flats and maisonettes to the tenants they are still saying there are legal problems <Col N="275" /> because someone has to be made responsible for the roof, the drain pipes and the gardens.  Who is responsible for the maintenance of the roof and drains in flat complexes in England?  The schemes in England have worked very well for a very long time and why can we not find a way of doing the same here?  Indeed what arrangements are made for the maintenance of the roof and drains in private apartment blocks?  Surely it should be possible to use this as a precedent.  Why has it taken so long to allow this to happen?</P>
    <P>There are many corporation flat complexes in inner city Dublin that would benefit greatly if individual flats were sold off to the tenants because people would now have a vested interest in refurbishing the flats.  The Government have been very remiss in not providing a tenant purchase scheme.  It is nothing short of outrageous that people have not been able to apply to purchase their homes for almost four years.  There used to be a very regular straightforward tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, will the Minister introduce a scheme immediately?  Many people are now paying more in rent than they would pay to purchase their house. It is grossly unfair that that should be the case.  I ask the Minister to introduce a new tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1988 tenant purchase scheme referred to by the Deputy was a special once-off scheme which offered very generous terms to encourage the maximum number of tenants to become the owners of the houses in which they lived.  Under the terms of the scheme, which applied countrywide, tenants were able to acquire their houses at less than 50 per cent of the market value.  The scheme proved to be very popular, with a total of over 40,000 applications to purchase being received by authorities, and over 30,000 sales have been completed to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> There was a huge interest in the scheme in Dublin and Dublin Corporation received almost 11,000 applications. While the corporation have made considerable progress in finalising sales there are still approximately 3,800 applications in respect of houses and flats awaiting completion.  Certain difficulties have arisen in relation to the sale of flats and the forthcoming Housing Bill will include new provisions to overcome these problems.  I appreciate the pressure which the administration of the scheme has put on the staff of Dublin Corporation but I am anxious that the remaining sales should be cleared as quickly as possible and the backlog reduced before another scheme is introduced.</P>
    <P>The promotion of home ownership remains a plank of the Government's housing policy.  The main threat of the social housing plan launched earlier this year is to reduce the traditional degree of dependence on local authority housing by the introduction of a range of new measures to provide for a better choice in housing, thus leading to a more efficient and equitable use of the available resources.  A number of new schemes is specifically aimed at local authority tenants who wish to become owner-occupiers.  The options include the mortgage allowance scheme, the shared ownership scheme, increases in the local authority house purchase loan and income limits and the provision of subsidised sites.  These new options have been devised to bring about changes in the functions of local authorities in the social housing area.  They widen the approach to meeting housing needs from an overwhelming emphasis on building dwellings for renting.  It is important of course, that local authorities should have a pool of houses available from which vacancies are generated for letting to persons for whom other schemes in the plan are not a feasible option.  It is necessary that the new options in the plan be given <Col N="277" /> time to be fully implemented and assessed and that local authorities should be allowed fulfil their new promotional and enabling role in housing.  I am anxious that local authorities should concentrate their efforts on promoting the new measures, focus resources on their implementation and realise their full potential on terms of meeting the social housing need.</P>
    <P>In 1988, 40,000 houses were sold to the local authority tenants and it must be admitted that this was a very good response to the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The graphic pictures and descriptions of the appalling conditions at Baltydaniel national school in Cork that appeared in yesterday's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> will, I am sure, have shocked the readers of that paper, but they are all to well known to the public representatives of the area and to local parents, who have been trying for more than ten years to force the Department of Education to do something about the school.  In my years as a councillor and a TD I have rarely seen worse conditions in any school.  No <Col N="278" /> child should be forced to attend classes in the kind of conditions at Baltydaniel national school and no teacher should be asked to teach classes in such dilapidated. dangerous and unhygienic surroundings.</P>
    <P>Baltydaniel national school is a disgrace to our society, to successive Governments and, especially to the Department of Education.  The 115 pupils who attend that school are the victims of official indifference and neglect. One might expect to find such conditions in an underdeveloped Third World country but they should have no place in a country that likes to think of itself as being a modern, progressive member of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Baltydaniel national school was built in 1884 and the conditions there have improved little since.  An extra room was added in 1928.  Its structure is dilapidated and the windows and doors are falling to pieces.  The toilets are sited some 50 yards away from the school building and do not have even wash basins or taps.  The local medical officer has warned that the toilets are a potential source of salmonella and hepatitis.  The teachers have no separate toilets and have to share the same dreadful facilities as the children.  In the past the school has also been condemned by fire authorities for, among other reasons, the dangerous timber-lined walls, the lack of fire alarms and inadequate means of escape.</P>
    <P>Over the years parents have done what they could to improve conditions at the school.  They have clubbed together to provide portable heaters and, later, a central heating system.  The more they did, however, the less the Department seemed to do.</P>
    <P>The saga of a replacement for Baltydaniel national school has been going on for more than ten years.  In 1982 the Department gave their approval for an extension and renovation.  Planning permission was granted but nothing happened. In 1986 there was a further announcement of an extension and renovation but again nothing happened.  In <Col N="279" /> 1988 parents had their hopes raised when approval was given for a completely new school, planning permission was secured, but &mdash; as was the case so often before &mdash; that is as far as it went.</P>
    <P>We all know of the budgetary difficulties and the pressures on Government finances but, as the new General Secretary of INTO, Senator Joe O'Toole, recently asked, how is it that we can find millions to pay land speculators for Carysfort but cannot make money available for the school building programme?</P>
    <P>The parents and pupils of Baltydaniel national school have been waiting too long and are now entitled to fair play.  It is not the only school in the country in need of replacement but it is one of the most urgent cases.  Given the conditions and the length of time that the people of Baltydaniel have been waiting, Baltydaniel national school surely deserves some kind of priority.  The project must now be put to tender without further delay and a definite date must be fixed for the commencement of building.  The main thing I ask of the Minister tonight is to sanction the invitation of tenders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to Baltydaniel national school.  The school is the property of the State and is approximately 135 years old.  It had originally been proposed to provide an extension of a general purposes room, one new classroom and the conversion of the existing school to two good classrooms.  Planning permission was obtained for that proposal in 1987 but, because of my Department's policy since 1987 of concentrating the available resources on essential classroom accommodation, it was not possible for that scheme to proceed in that the expenditure would have been much too great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 my Department's architect visited the school authorities and outlined <Col N="280" /> the various options for an alternative proposal on the new modified basis on which it is possible to provide perfectly acceptable essential accommodation at a lesser cost than heretofore expected.  Following meetings in 1988 and correspondence in 1989 my Department outlined their reservations to the school's authorities about the possibility of using the existing school site.  It was pointed out that the site was considered too small, being approximately half an acre, and the chairman of the board of management was urged to investigate the possibility of a new site of acceptable size of about 1.75 acres.  However, the school authorities informed the Department that the acquisition of a new site was not possible as the existing school serves an area that has a high concentration of children and the present location was the only site available.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the existing building will have to be demolished to allow for the construction of a new school, which will consist of four classrooms, toilets, a teachers' room and stores.</P>
    <P>The present position in relation to the project is that tender documents are nearing completion and should be ready early in 1992, at which point the question of the invitation of tenders will be considered urgently.  It is my intention that the new school will be available at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Because of the conditions of the existing accommodation and the case outlined by Deputy Sherlock, I will be willing to grant-aid essential minimal improvements at this stage in order to improve the facilities pending provision of the new accommodation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I accept the very valid case put forward by the Deputy that Baltydaniel national school is one of the worst school buildings in the country and I assure the House that it is an urgent priority of my Department to have it replaced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair sincerely for giving me this opportunity. I have a very simple, straightforward proposal. On behalf of the people of Tuam and its hinterland, I request the Government to locate a Government Department or a section of a Government Department in Tuam town as part of the decentralisation plan.</P>
      <P>As the House will know, Tuam and its hinterland have been devastated by the closure of the Sugar Company five years ago.  At the time of closure more than 350 people were working full-time or part-time at the factory and, as we know, they all lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>At one point in its history the factory employed 650 people.  The recent Census of Population figures show part of north Galway &mdash; part of the greater Tuam area &mdash; still losing its population.  In fact its population has been shown to be declining over recent censuses so that it is now like County Leitrim.  There was an absolute commitment given to replace the Tuam sugar factory.  Volumes have been written and spoken about it but, five years later, after several false industrial starts, all there is in Tuam is a big wild site where the factory once stood.  The Sugar Company, Goodman International and the Government all raised hopes in one form or another that were unfulfilled. If there is no reasonably-sized industry in the IDA pipeline &mdash; and I understand there is not &mdash; the Government must earmark Tuam for decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope the Minister would not remind me that there has been some decentralisation to Tuam with the location there of units of the Ordnance Survey Office.  it is good that they have seen fit to locate in Tuam but there are eight jobs only involved whereas I am speaking of a much higher number, somehow or other, to replace the permanent, full-time jobs in the sugar factory. There is a moral responsibility on the Government to provide jobs in the <Col N="282" /> Tuam area.  I contend that decentralisation constitutes the answer at this point.</P>

      <P>I want first to apologise to Deputy Connaughton and to the House for the absence of the Minister for Finance which is unavoidable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance availed of the opportunity last week to place on the record of the House the success of the Government's decentralisation programme to date.  He stated also that the Government are fully committed to the concept of decentralisation and are determined to ensure that the present programme &mdash; expanded by the Government in June last &mdash; is completed as speedily as possible to ensure its success so that the economic and social benefits for the 18 centres selected by Government to date will be fully secured.</P>
      <P>The main difficulty, of course, relating to this ambitious programme is that the task of selecting centres to benefit from the programme, from a very large number considered, is a difficult one.  It is unfortunate that many towns and communities, which have been considered by Government, have been disappointed.</P>
      <P>The beneficial effects of the decentralisation projects completed at this point are already being experienced in those centres.  I have no doubt that the widespread relocation of public service employment and services will reverse the regional imbalance brought about over the years by the extensive migration from the provinces when practically all public services Departments were located in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy and I, coming from the north-west and west will fully appreciate the advantage of the decentralisation programme which my party in Government set in train in 1980.  I do not want to sound acrimonious or political at this time of the evening but I would have to say it was shelved for a number of years. <Col N="283" /> Nonetheless, we have observed its advantages from Letterkenny, to Sligo, to Ballina, to Galway, to Ennis, to Nenagh, to Athlone, to Killarney.</P>

      <Quest>if he will communicate with the Minister for Health in relation to the fact that medical practitioners who serve in the Army, are being discriminated against when they subsequently apply for acceptance into the GMS by most health boards in so far as their years of medical service in the Defence Forces are not accepted as part of the five years general practice required; and if he will strive to ensure that this discriminatory practice will end.</Quest>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply by my colleague, the Minister for Health, to Question No. 154 on 19 November 1991, which outlined the different means by which general practitioners may be granted entry to the GMS scheme.  In that regard I understand that the arrangements governing entry to the scheme by doctors who have at least five years service in whole-time general practice have been the subject of negotiations and agreement between successive Ministers for Health and the Irish Medical Organisation since the inception of the scheme. It is open to former and serving Army doctors through their membership of the Irish Medical Organisation to pursue any claim they may wish to make to bring about changes in these arrangements. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the matter.</P>

      <P>In the training of FCA personnel there has been an increased emphasis in recent years on giving the fullest possible training during summer camps.  Accordingly, it is desirable that the camps should be held at locations which have the best training facilities.  Because of the wider range of such facilities available at other locations, there has been a reduction in the past few years in the number of FCA personnel attending summer camps at Lahinch.</P>

      <P>Special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts were introduced to give a measure of support to veterans of the Wars of Independence who, on account of age or incapacity, are not in a position to support themselves.  The means test applicable to the special allowance has been relaxed progressively over the years and is now far from severe.  Veterans with no assessible means already qualify for the maximum special allowance, and the abolition of the means test would confer no extra benefit on them.</P>

      <P>Barrack damages are required to be paid when military buildings or fixtures are damaged by members of the Permanent Defence Force or, Reserve Defence Force.  Where damage occurs, the amount of the damage is assessed and, where no individual can be identified as the cause of the damage, the cost is levied on all troops occupying the barracks or camp at the time the damage occurred.</P>
      <P>The amount levied against each member and the names of the individuals concerned are published in unit routine orders and appropriate deductions are made from the pay of these individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain difficulties have been encountered in adopting the recommendation in the Gleeson report that deductions <Col N="135" /> below £5 for barrack damages should be collected locally rather than through the payroll system.  The matter is, however, being examined further.</P>

      <P>Following consideration of military proposals in the matter the officer rank structure in An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil was reorganised in 1989 in order to bring it more into line with the structure in the Permanent Defence Forces.  The main features of the re-structuring were the upgrading of the company commander appointments in the Infantry Corps from captain to commandant, a total of 83 appointments; the upgrading of the staff officer appointments in the corps units in the cavalry, signal, supply and transport, medical and military police corps from captain to commandant &mdash; a total of 21 appointments; the consequential upgrading of the second-in-command <Col N="136" /> appointments in the infantry companies and appointments in the relevant corps units from lieutenant to captain; and the gradual phasing out of the commandant appointments of area commander and the re-distribution of those appointments as the company commander and staff officer appointments already referred to.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation also involved the redeployment of a number of commandant appointments from command FCA staffs.</P>
      <P>The appointment of area commander was deleted from FCA establishments and the officers who held sole appointments of area commander were gradually absorbed into the new structure.</P>
      <P>While the structure and functioning of the FCA is under constant review there are no proposals at present for any further changes in the officer rank structure.</P>

      <P>Members of the Permanent Defence Force are classified into medical categories according to their physical efficiency as determined by their constitution, keenness of vision, keenness of hearing and ability to march.  They are graded under each of these headings and the combinations of the grades obtained finally determine the category in which they are placed.  There are 14 such categories from A.1, the highest to E, the lowest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defence Forces Regulations prescribe that all members of the Permanent Defence Forces shall undergo a medical examination at least once in every 12 <Col N="137" /> month period.  If as a result of such examination, the examining officer is of the opinion that a member should be reclassified he shall initiate the necessary action in that regard.</P>
    <P>Members graded in all of the A and B categories are eligible medically for promotion.  Members in category C are eligible for promotion subject to being certified medically fit for specific vacancies. Members in categories D and E are ineligible for promotion.</P>
    <P>As a general rule a member who is graded category E is regarded as not possessing the medical standard required for service in the Permanent Defence Forces and the necessary action towards his retirement, relinquishment of commission or discharge as the case may be, is initiated.  However a member who is employed in a capacity in which the disability or disabilities which occasioned his being graded E does not interfere with, or occasion him undue strain in, the efficient performance of his duties, may be retained in service.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply on 21 May 1991, to a similar question, Ireland's network of diplomatic relations, both resident and non-resident, is small and must remain so for the forseeable future, given our limited financial and personnel resources.  Possibilities for its extension are examined from time to time in the light of our national and international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.  It is established practice in regard to diplomatic relations to proceed only by agreement between the countries concerned.  Announcements are made by agreement at the appropriate time and it would be contrary to international practice to speculate publicly in advance of any such announcement.</P>

However, this was set off against the taxpayer's liability for the years 1984-85 and 1985-86, i.e. £870.70 and £518.10 respectively.  Therefore, no refund arises.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together. Given that Ross Castle has, of necessity, been closed to the public for essential <Col N="145" /> works, it cannot be construed that there has been a loss of earnings to the State. Ross Castle was taken into the Guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works in November 1973.  The commissioners became owners of the castle in 1979 when the McShain estate was transferred to the National Park in Killarney. At that stage a considerable amount of work had been carried out to the monument to ensure its safety.</P>
      <P>The Ross Castle site has served as the National Monuments Maintenance Depot of the Office of Public Works for the entire Kerry-Limerick region.  Due to the restricted level of resources available and the need to maintain a large number of monuments in the region as a whole, much of the earlier works could only be carried out on a limited scale, as overall commitments in the region permitted.  It was not until the beginning of 1989 and the allocation of EC structural funding, that sufficient resources could be devoted to tackle the project comprehensively. The structural stabilisation of Ross Castle has proved to be a demanding and complex restoration project.  This 16th century castle was greatly altered in the intervening centuries.  These alterations, together with a general decline over the centuries, led to a weakening of the structure. Particularly serious problems arose in the mid-1980s when it was found that the substantial cross-walls were structurally unsound.  This necessitated considerable additional work, and the main part of the castle had to be buttressed with steel supports to prevent collapse.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that these major structural problems have now been resolved and that substantial progress has been made with restoration works.  It is hoped that the reconstruction work and fitting-out will be completed to enable Ross Castle to be opened to visitors in 1993.  The total estimated cost of works to completion is £1,800,000 of which almost £1,100,000 has been expended to date.</P>

      <P>I understand that there is no single comprehensive source of data on the incidence of different incapacities in the population at large.</P>
      <P>In the event, people eligible for disability benefit are limited to those who are insured under the Social Welfare Acts, and therefore they differ from the population as a whole in terms of characteristics such as age, gender, work experience etc. which are likely to influence illness trends.  Given these differences I do not consider that one can draw any conclusion as to the extent to which divergences in disability benefit claims by sex of claimant reflect the incidence of specific illnesses in the population at large.</P>
      <P>In relation to disability benefit claimants generally, I would point out that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report commented that &ldquo;the over-representation of women in the Irish Disability Benefit population is not unusual when compared to experience in both public and private schemes in Britain&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There are over 170 contracts currently in force in my Department.  These relate to the supply and maintenance of office and computing equipment; consultancy services, mostly in connection with the development of new computer systems; office maintenance, cleaning and hygiene services; security and postal delivery services.</P>
      <P>In general, when contracts expire competitive tenders or quotations are sought from suppliers.  Some contracts are awarded for a period, e.g. two to four years, while others are awarded on the basis of a specification of service or supply to be delivered.  In some cases, a maintenance contract is negotiated with the supplier at the time of purchase of equipment and renewed annually.</P>
      <P>All contracts, whether for supply of goods or services, are awarded in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines on Government contract procedures. These set out the rules for competitive tendering and provide for the award of a contract on the basis of either the lowest suitable tender or the most economically advntageous tender having regard to the circumstances.  Where full competitive tendering is not practical, for example for a highly specialised computer requirement, proposals are vetted by a formal interdepartmental committee which operates under the aegis of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>In the past the method by which a social welfare client was paid was dictated by the particular type of benefit or pension being paid.  For the future I want to achieve a situation where the client has a range of options from which to choose. This will obviously take a number of years to achieve.</P>
      <P>The majority of unemployed persons are paid in cash at local offices of my Department or at post offices.  It is my intention to eliminate, over time, cash payments at the Department's local offices and to introduce alternative payment methods including cheques, order books etc.  This move will improve the quality of service for unemployed persons and the need to attend at the local social welfare office each week to receive payment will be reduced.</P>
      <P>The other payment methods currently in operation for unemployment clients are order books and postdrafts which are encashable at post offices.  The use of these payment methods ensures that a range of payment options are available to unemployment clients and it also ensures that my Department are not relying on one sole paying agent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to cheques, the arrangements now in place for some unemployment assistance clients are similar to those that have been in operation for disability benefit clients for many years. The general client response to this payment method is very favourable.  The majority of clients cash their cheques at <Col N="154" /> banks and building societies and, in general, an encashment fee is not charged in shops and supermarkets.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any particular difficulties being experienced by unemployment assistance clients in cashing cheque payments.  However, this is a matter that will be kept constantly under review as the new methods are introduced and expanded.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year I made orders under the Video Recordings Act, 1989 which enable the film censor to grant licences to wholesale and retail video dealers and to prohibit the supply of pornographic videos. Additional staff were made available to the censor's office to deal with the extra work arising from those measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to make a further order and regulations in the coming months to enable the film censor to examine all new videos intended for supply and also to commence the systematic examination of all videos already on the market.  Further additional staff will be required by the <Col N="157" /> censor to assist him with the extra work which will result from this order and I am making arrangements to ensure that this staff will be made available to the censor as required.</P>
