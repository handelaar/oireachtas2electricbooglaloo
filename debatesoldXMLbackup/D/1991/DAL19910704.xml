      <P>I ask the Government to withdraw No. 6 from today's Order Paper as it involves an attempt to get the Dáil to guillotine through the approval of expenditure of £6.8 billion of taxpayers' money at a rate of approximately £550 million an hour.  We believe this is directly in defiance of the Constitution, which requires the Dáil to consider the Estimates.  This proposal is not consideration; this is asking the Dáil to rubber stamp the Estimates and excluding the majority of Deputies from any participation in the discussion on the Estimates. This comes at the end of a session during which the Government have used the guillotine in such a fashion as to deny normal parliamentary discussion and to deny Members on this side of the House the opportunity to propose amendments to most of the Bills which are presented <Col N="774" /> here for discussion.  If the Government proceed with No. 6 &mdash; I appeal to them to withdraw it from today's Order Paper &mdash; the Fine Gael Party will engage in the most extreme opposition tactics available to them to prevent this fundamentally unconstitutional and undemocratic procedure from going ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished.  The Government, in an endeavour to meet the wishes of the Opposition, have agreed to an extra week's sitting in order that the House can discuss the situation in Europe and the proposals in relation to agriculture.  These are two very important matters and I agree that the House should be given an opportunity to discuss both of them fully.  My original suggestion was that two days would be devoted fully to these matters but apparently the Opposition insisted on having Question <Col N="775" /> Time and Private Members' Time, which shortens the amount of time available for the debate on these subjects very considerably.  Last year we gave ten and a quarter hours to the debate on the Estimates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips have had considerable discussions on how to deal with this year's Estimates.  The Labour Party <Col N="776" /> were anxious to have a more inclusive debate rather than take each Estimate separately.  We put this proposal to the Taoiseach.  We also sought &mdash; this has been discussed by the sub-committee on Dáil reform of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; a question and answer type session in relation to Estimates rather than the present system where Members make statements which simply rest there unanswered.  Therefore, the whole methodology for dealing with the Estimates should be addressed.  I do not know whether there is any value in adding endless time to enable each Member of the House to make a statement on the Estimates, but we do need adequate time.  It is very important &mdash; we argued trenchantly for this &mdash; to have Private Members' Time and Question Time next week, normal parliamentary business which is inclusive of all Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach's initial response but I want to make a request on behalf of the Labour Party to him not to move No. 6 for one hour so that the Whips can meet to see if they can agree a formulation which would deal with the Estimates in a sensible way and allow us to conduct our business in an orderly way at the conclusion of this busy schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly prepared to agree to that suggestion.  It seems to be the proper way to proceed in the conduct of our parliamentary business.  The only thing I would suggest is that we need not confine ourselves to one hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to say that we are not pre-empting any particular form of debate on the Estimates.  On that basis I am prepared not to move No. 6 so that the Whips can get together and see if they can arrive at some agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his indication of flexibility on this matter.  It is not appropriate that we should deal with a major issue such as the Estimates on the basis of parties having ten minutes to make a contribution, as is proposed in regard to many of the Estimates under the current schedule of business.  However, I would question why it is not possible for these arrangements to be made at Whips' meeting level when it is possible to do so on the floor of this House.  We need to look seriously at what is going on at Whips meetings when rows like this have to be brought onto the Floor of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that in virtually every parliament in Europe, and in North America, there is a proper committee system which allows most business to be dealt with in a businesslike way off the floor of the House?  The problem with time allocation motions here is that we do not have a committee system and we are forced to do all our business on the floor of the House in an unconstitutional and unbusinesslike way which erodes the rights of elected Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am pleased the Taoiseach has stated that he will defer moving item No. 6, the talk has centred on the arrangements for the taking of the <Col N="779" /> Estimates which are clearly unsatisfactory. I would also like to make the point to the Taoiseach that the arrangements for the making of statements on the recent European Council meeting are also unsatisfactory.  As usual no provision has been made for either me or the other independent Deputies to make a contribution. As we can make no input at Whips meetings I would ask the Whips to consider this matter when they next meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped to give one day to that debate but, from my point of view, unfortunately and regrettably, the Opposition insisted on having Question Time and that considerably shortened the time available.</P>

      <P>On next week's business, may I ask the Taoiseach if it is his intention when making a statement on the recent meeting of EC Heads of State or Government to refer to the meeting he had with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can always do that. I understood that the Opposition were concerned &mdash; I sympathised with their views &mdash; to give as much time as possible to a discussion on the European situation: political union, a common foreign and security policy and economic and monetary union.  They are all major issues. What I want to do, with the agreement of the House, is to start a major debate on all these issues which can go on until the final European Council meeting at Maastricht.</P>

      <P>In relation to item No. 6 which is being deferred for one hour, one aspect which is of some importance and which, perhaps, will colour people's attitude to what will ultimately be proposed in the House, is the question of the resumption date in the autumn. Clearly, if it is the intention not to resume until some time in mid-October then a strong case could be made for the House to sit an extra week to do its business in a proper way before it goes into recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 32, after &ldquo;gratuity&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or other payment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is proposed in this amendment that the words &ldquo;or other payment&rdquo; be inserted in the definition of &ldquo;wages&rdquo; in section 1, the definition section.  The section states:</P>
      <P>Provided however that the following payments shall not be regarded as wages for the purposes of this definition:</P>
      <P> (i)  any payment in respect of expenses incurred by the employee in carrying out his employment,</P>
      <P>(ii)  any payment by way of a pension, allowance or gratuity in connection with the death, or the retirement or resignation from his employment, of the employee or as compensation for loss of office, </P>
      <P>I propose that in paragraph (ii) the words &ldquo;or other payment&rdquo; be inserted after the word &ldquo;gratuity&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have proposed this amendment because the FIE have expressed some concern that the definition as currently contained in the Bill may give rise to some problems.  The FIE in their submission say that section 1 (1) (a) (ii) should include the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; as well as the words &ldquo;pension, allowance, or gratuity&rdquo; as the sum may be negotiated in relation to retirement which does not fit into any of these wordings but which is of the same general category.  They suggest that a negotiated payment agreed by the employer to be paid on foot of certain circumstances relating to the resignation or retirement may not fall within the heading of gratuity, but such payments should not be construed to be wages for the purpose of the legislation, and as it is a widespread practice on termination of employment to make one <Col N="784" /> payment normally by cheque covering all outstanding moneys due, they strongly suggest that compensation for holidays not taken at the date of termination and pay in lieu of notice should be treated in the same way as any payment referable to the employees' redundancy.  They suggest that this should be included in a separate paragraph and this is covered by amendment No. 2 in my name.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if amendment No. 1 involves just a semantical difference and it may be that the amendment is not strictly necessary.  However, as one of the social partners has raised this issue I felt that I should bring it to the floor of the House and give the Minister an opportunity to respond to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Shatter for the spirit in which he made his contribution. We have examined the FIE submission and in our view amendment No. 1 is not necessary.  I expect that an example of the type of payment that the FIE have in mind is payment to an employee on foot of an agreement that the employee would not open a competitive business in the same area as a particular person, which often happens on the break-up of a partnership or some similar arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of wages divides payments into three categories: first, those comprising wages which are specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of &ldquo;wages&rdquo;, second, those payments listed in paragraphs (i) to (v) but which are specifically excluded from the definition of &ldquo;wages&rdquo; for the avoidance of doubt; and third, all other payments, in other words, those which are not wages and which are not likely to be mistaken for such.  The type of payment which Deputy Shatter's amendment deals with is the third type.  If Deputy Shatter's amendment was accepted, and Deputy Shatter has said so himself, it would not put beyond doubt the question of whether such contractual sums are wages and it could be open to the interpretation that these and other sums might well be regarded as wages but for the exclusions <Col N="785" /> in the Bill.  For that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's reply, let me say that it is not my intention to push the matter unduly. However, it appears to me that the FIE have a valid concern in this area and in the light of the fact that I will be withdrawing the amendment I would ask that the Department consult directly with the FIE to satisfy them about the matter and that we might come back to this at a later stage should we need to.  I ask the Minister to consider it in that light.  I do not intend to press the matter unduly.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iv)  any payment referable to the termination of the employee's employment,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having given the reasons for raising amendment No. 1, I started incorrectly to go into the the reasons for amendment No. 2.  The FIE have made the point that as it is widespread practice on termination of employment to make one payment normally by cheque covering all outstanding moneys due, compensation for holidays not taken on the date of termination and pay in lieu of notice should be treated in the same way as &ldquo;any payment referable to the employee's redundancy&rdquo; as in section 1 (1) (iii).  They suggest that all these areas should be included in a separate paragraph and they suggest &ldquo;any payment referable to the termination of the employee's employment&rdquo; should replace subparagrph (iii) and should also cover <i>ex gratia</i> payments on termination of employment by the employer which did not fall into the category of redundancy, retirement or resignation&rdquo;. Rather than proposing replacing subparagraph (iii) by the FIE wording, it occurred to me that a better way to deal with the matter would be to <Col N="786" /> insert a new subparagraph in the section and I quote: &ldquo;(iv) any payment referable to the termination of the employee's employment&rdquo; and exclude such payments from the concept of wages as defined in the subsection.</P>
    <P>This would not do any damage to the Minister's intentions but would address the concern that has been expressed. Again, I am raising the concern that the FIE have expressed and I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to it in the context of the working of the Bill and whether he would be willing to take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment appears to be the removal from the definition of wages of payments in lieu of notice.  In the meetings we have had with the FIE we have referred to what has happened in the United Kingdom under the similar Wages Act, 1986.  That Act remains silent on whether such payments are or are not wages.  The result has been that hundreds of cases have been brought annually before the Industrial Tribunal regarding final payments on terminations of employment, as employers used final payments to make indiscriminate deductions.</P>
      <P>A major problem for the British Industrial Tribunal was to decide whether payments in lieu of notice were to be considered as wages within the meaning of the legislation.  Some tribunals determined that they were and went on to hear the complaints but others determined that they were not and refused to hear the complaints.  When we were examining this issue a few months back, the British experience led me to the conclusion that our legislation would have to be unambiguous on the subject so as to avoid these hundreds of cases that are still going through the British tribunals. This explains why payments in lieu of notice are to be considered as &ldquo;wages&rdquo; within the meaning of the Bill.  I decided to include them in this definition because such payments are moneys which the employee would have earned as wages had he worked out his notice.  I think they are rightly considered as wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> I have also included them so as to discourage employers from making unfair deductions from the final payment in the knowledge that the payment could not be open to an examination by a Rights Commissioner.  This was my main concern because if this payment was in the category of exclusions, an employer could use the final payment to make excessive or unfair deductions which would not be open to any kind of examination afterwards.  That is why we came to that conclusion, and I think the Deputy will understand why I cannot accept his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g)  by transfer or other mode of payment to an account specified by an employee in a credit union,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that we had the lengthy debate about the pros and cons of workers having to go through the banking system and pay the charges levied on cheques and accounts.  We must be aware that huge numbers of people are involved in savings and loans with credit unions. The Bill mentions banking institutions, post offices and trustee savings banks. The Fine Gael spokesperson claimed that all blue collar workers have banking accounts, but this is not a fact.  Since the Bill deals with manual workers and will have a knock-on effect on the ultimate value of their wages, we should consider <Col N="788" /> the institution with which they deal in the main, namely, the credit union.  It has been said that credit unions are not big players among the financial institutions but it is important to note that the Irish League of Credit Unions has 1.2 million members, which is a very large number, given our small population.  I would argue that a substantial number of those members would be manual workers.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have about £800 million in savings with the Irish League of Credit Unions and £600 million is advanced in loans on an annual basis.  Their investment of about £200 million is of value to the State and they have an annual turnover of billions.  Savings protection reserves amount to £80 million.  Credit unions play a major role in Irish life, perhaps especially in the case of manual workers.  The Minister has accepted to some degree the argument that there should be a specific mention of the role of credit unions.  He said that it is possible to have money paid direct to a credit union and an agreement is reached with an employer, this is another option.  I am told that the credit unions structure is such that they will accept the transfer of wages into a member's account and this should be written into the Bill.  I believe the Minister will support this notion.  He has said that because of the high level of bank charges not every employee could decide to open a current account in a banking institution.  The amendment could be accepted without undue problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything Deputy Byrne says with regard to credit unions.  They have for many years played an increasingly important role.  Credit unions now provide a far more acceptable form of banking than the main banking institutions, providing a more customer conscious service.  They were set up with the aim of providing a service for the community rather than a service to maximise profit from the work done for customers who require their assistance. There is an entirely different ethos between the banking system and the <Col N="789" /> credit union movement.  Banks are entitled to make profits, but they should be competitive.  In our type of economy there is far too little competitiveness between banks.  Large numbers of people who currently use the banking system might be better served by using credit unions and they should be encouraged to do so.</P>
      <P>My understanding of section 2 is such that this amendment is not necessary.  My reading of section 2 (1) (f) leads me to understand that an employee who wants payments made directly to a credit union account can so request.  It is provided that wages may be paid by a credit transfer or another mode of payment whereby an amount is credited to an account specified by the employee.  My understanding is that the Bill is designed to allow an employee to direct his employer to pay his wages into a credit union account which he maintains.  I would encourage employees to use the credit union system and I would urge those who do not currently have credit union accounts to open them.  Most communities now have a credit union and there are inhouse credit unions in major industries.  Within my constituency a number of credit unions are operated.  I have had a lot of contact with Rathfarnham Credit Union and the headquarters of the credit union movement is situated in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widespread use of credit unions by employees who direct their wages to be paid directly into credit union accounts will force the banks to reduce charges and to facilitate customers with regard to hours of business.  Current banking hours do not allow people who work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to use bank facilities. Banks have designed their opening hours for their own convenience rather than the convenience of their customers.  That has happened because of the lack of competitiveness. If following the enactment of this legislation there is a widespread use of credit unions by employees who to date have not been using them and if it is arranged that wage transfers be made to credit unions rather than bank accounts, the major banks will be <Col N="790" /> required to examine the level and type of service they provide.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the sentiments Deputy Byrne has expressed, but I do not believe the amendment is required because section 2 (1) (f) adequately addresses the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage Deputy Brian Hillery made a very interesting contribution.  He saw this legislation as a means of closing the gap between the blue collar and white collar worker.  He said that the Bill would promote greater contact between manual workers and financial institutions.  I thought that remark a little patronising and I still hold that view.  It was as though the Minister was doing the manual worker a great favour by giving him access to these awe-inspiring financial institutions.  Deputy Byrne's amendment would go a long way to ensuring that people who have been described as blue collar workers have access to a system with which they are familiar and where they do not feel under a compliment.  It is extremely sensible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter identified another area where it is going to be an advantage to the worker, that is, the hours of opening. At the moment it can be said the banks do not actually cater for the ordinary working man or woman.  There is no way you can get your cheque cashed in a bank on a Friday evening, for instance, or whatever the case may be.  The credit union could provide the necessary service. I do not see why the Minister cannot take this amendment on board; maybe he will.  He has not yet indicated his intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of a credit union for many years, since its foundation.  The credit union movement has provided a service.  It has filled a void.  Many people felt the banking system was intimidating and for that reason did not become involved in it.  An added consideration is that the cost of banking has put it beyond the reach of ordinary working people. The charges for service are outrageous and until something is done about this and the Minister for Finance takes it in <Col N="791" /> hand people will be at a disadvantage.  I support the amendment.  I will be interested to hear if this matter is already catered for within the Bill.  If so I will be happy to go along with that, but Deputy Byrne has been quite specific and I think what he advocates is the right course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept this very reasonable, acceptable amendment.  It is necessary that the credit union movement be incorporated in a Bill of this nature.  I do not like the tags of &ldquo;blue&rdquo; or &ldquo;white&rdquo; collar, but the credit union movement is the only banking system many workers know and understand. The banking system would not even accept them.  I have known of people in the place where I worked in Cork whose cheques the banks refused to handle and the people had to resort to the credit union to cash their cheques because they had no accounts in the banks.  Over the years the credit unions have shown what they can do and how they can utilise their funding to the advantage of the community to which these workers belong.  They are much more at ease transferring their cheques through the credit union than they would be in doing so through the banking system.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan said, banking opening hours are very limited. I accept that the Trustee Savings Banks have shown great flexibility in their working hours, but until the credit union movement took up the cause of working class people the banks did not even want to know about them and people had to tailor the cashing of their cheques to the bank opening hours.  If the provisions of the amendment are not included in the Bill already &mdash; from my reading of it I do not think they are &mdash; I urge the Minister to accept what I consider a very reasonable and good amendment to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the points that have been made by the Deputies on Deputy Eric Byrne's amendment. We had some discussion on this on Second Stage and I too would like to be <Col N="792" /> associated with acknowledging the good work done nationally by the credit union movement and its difference from other banking services.  It is community based and undertakes an excellent function.</P>
      <P>The arrangement proposed in this amendment is, as has been pointed out already, permitted in section 2 (1) (f) which provides that wages may be paid by &ldquo;a credit transfer or other mode of payment whereby an amount is credited to an account specified by the employee concerned&rdquo;.  The provision is drafted to be sufficiently broad to encompass the lodgment of wage payments to a credit union.  We have taken into account Deputy Byrne's views expressed on Second Stage.  It could be a credit union or a building society or some other organisation, provided the account concerned is nominated by the employee involved. That would be the determining factor in this.  This being the case, in the light of the points Deputy Byrne made on Second Stage his very well intentioned amendment is unnecessary because its provisions are covered in paragraph (f).  As this legislation develops and we move away from cash, I hope the number of people, particularly those who have savings accounts and deductions from their payroll through credit unions &mdash; as one fairly large company in my constituency has &mdash; will increase and this area will expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I anticipated that type of response.  I am aware of section 2 (1) (f) but let me ask the Minister if he will consider, for example &mdash; it may not be in order but if so I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will tell me quickly enough &mdash; inserting even the words &ldquo;credit union&rdquo; after &ldquo;employee concerned&rdquo; and thus include credit unions. My concern is that the Bill as structured will be read by employers and trade unions and they will be thinking in terms of the banking institutions as they are. There are 410 credit union branches spread throughout the country.  A cursory glance at the list reveals that BTE have one and I know the TUI and the ASTI <Col N="793" /> have them, so there is a direct relationship between the trade union member if it is the TUI or ASTI, who are dealing regularly with their own credit union, and employees of BTE.  Direct financial dealing is going on all the time between them.  Therefore, it seems logical and very easy to encourage both trade unions and employers to transfer the salaries of their workforce into credit unions.  I cannot swear to it but surely some of the major companies such as Guinness have credit union branches.  A little extra push is all that is necessary to give recognition to the credit unions.</P>
      <P>I am aware that it is difficult at the moment to make cash withdrawals from credit unions on the traditional banking system.  They are building in high technology and they are very keen to develop rapidly.  Where current account systems are not already in existence the intention is to introduce them in the near future enabling members to use credit unions as they would a savings bank or other banks. There are little technical difficulties at the moment but they are on the verge of being overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that a credit union is ideally suited to the vast bulk of workers affected by this legislation because the opening hours are far more socially acceptable to workers than are the banks' opening hours.  It is important that we do not drive workers into the clutches of bankers who then would gain on the double from this legislation, first by getting far more customers who are transferring from cash payment to other modes and then the more extra customers they attract the more bank levies, bank charges and profits the banks will make. The banking institutions will gain under a second heading by overheads being reduced, because presumably the insurance coverage and the cost of transferring large sums of cash from banking institutions to building sites will be diminished. The workers who will be forced to use the banking services &mdash; and we will come to this in greater detail later in the Bill &mdash; will be net losers.  I would ask the Minister, to accept, if at all possible, the words &ldquo;including credit unions&rdquo; even <Col N="794" /> under the provisions of paragraph (f) which would read:</P>
    <P>A credit transfer or another mode of payment whereby an amount is credited to an account specified by the employee concerned including credit unions.</P>
    <P>It is my experience, as has been pointed out by other speakers, that banks do not really want to deal with the worker who goes in to cash a cheque.  By virtue of my background as a building worker I am aware that building workers and manual workers have often been insulted because of a bank's refusal to honour employers' cheques because those workers did not have a bank account there.  I do not think we should encourage workers to deal with these institutions when there is the prospect of an excellent alternative banking system being available through the credit unions.  I would ask for some commitment from the Minister to include &ldquo;credit union&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">

      <P>I too would like to acknowledge the role of the credit union in the development of Irish society and particularly in rural Ireland.  They have made a major contribution to the development in the fabric of life that exists there.  I agree with the Minister that the amendment is unnecessary as the Deputy's request is covered in paragraph (f).  The difficulty is that if we were to include credit unions we would have to name a number of savings institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge Deputy Byrne's point.  I want to make it clear that under paragraph (f) credit unions and also building societies, savings banks, trustee savings banks and other groupings can be availed of.  They are becoming far more flexible and, as I said on Second Stage, as technology moves ahead more competition will be involved in these areas.  I acknowledge the point made by Deputy Byrne that there are difficulties with some banks but they are also moving to a far more flexible stage because of competition from others.  It is not appropriate to add credit unions to paragraph <Col N="795" /> (f) because if so a question would be raised as to why the others were not being added.  If we added credit unions we would certainly have to add the various forms of savings banks: trustee savings banks, building societies and different cashing arrangements.  For the record of the House the understanding of the Minister of the day is that paragraph (f) provides clearly that an employee may use the facilities and the benefits of the credit union to have their money transferred from an employer.  I think that makes it clear for the record.</P>

      <P>Section 2, which we are discussing in the context of these amendments, provides for the various modes of payment of wages.  Having gone through the various modes that apply in practical terms under our current financial systems and arrangements, the provision has an allembracing clause, paragraph (h), which states, in relation to the payment of wages, that:</P>
      <P>any other mode of payment standing specified for the time being by regulations made by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said rightly that technology is changing rapidly.  Within a very short time there will be other methods of <Col N="796" /> making payments that may not be covered by the specific references contained in section 2 (1).  I suspect that in the not too distant future the concept of a cheque will be regarded as about as relevant to modern financial dealings as the unfortunate extinct dinosaur is relevant to the animals in the world of today. We are heading into an entirely new area. All of this will work only in the context of the way in which the various financial institutions and the banking system, through to the credit unions and retail outlets agree to designate the transference and the acceptance of moneys.</P>
    <P>The Payment of Wages Bill is the product of a general agreement that has been reached as between the social partners. There are minor disagreements between Congress and the employers with regard to certain sections in the Bill but, in principle, all social partners are now agreed on the need for this legislation.  The Minister has adopted a consultative rather than a confrontational approach, which is to be commended.  He consults with the various groups throughout the economy and in particular with the relevant social partners, in the context of wages, to whom the legislation to be enacted will apply.</P>
    <P>I was a little puzzled by paragraph (h). It is accepted that new modes of payment be taken on board by way of regulation rather than having to wait for time in this House to amend the legislation, but it seems that as the Bill is drafted the only person who needs to be consulted is the Minister for Finance.  I cannot for the life of me see why it is the Minister for Finance who should be consulted about the type of order a Minister for Labour should make with regard to modes of payment of wages.  The Minister for Labour is the relevant Minister in Government who deals with this area. Somewhere down the line there may be a Minister for Labour who does not believe in a consultative but in a confrontational approach and, indeed, there may be a Minister for Finance and a Minister for Labour who believe in a confrontational approach.  It seems to me that a Minister for Labour who deems it <Col N="797" /> desirable that other modes of payment be taken on board should not have to consult with the Minister for Finance exclusively.  Presumably the Minister for Labour would bring a proposal to Cabinet and Cabinet would then agree to the proposal.  It may be that the Minister for Finance in Cabinet may not want to go along with it but the Minister for Finance may be overruled in Cabinet by his colleagues and by the persuasive arguments of the Minister for Labour.  We know that the present Minister for Labour, in his own modest way, can be a very persuasive personality and may, perhaps, go about things in a somewhat different way to the current Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I would not want this to be interpreted as meaning that a Minister for Finance, for example, might have a veto on the use of new technology in the context of modes of payment.  Although the Act does not give him a veto when he talks about consultation, behind the scenes in Cabinet it may be regarded as something that should not be done if the consent of the Minister for Finance is not forthcoming to taking on board a new mode of payment to which all the social partners were agreeable.  It is my proposal that the Minister for Labour, should not, on the basis of how the Cabinet is supposed to operate, give some sort of special role or recognition to the Minister for Finance in this matter.  The regulation should be made by the Minister for Labour but only after consultation with the relevant trade unions and employers organisations.  I propose that we delete the reference to the &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; and insert instead &ldquo;relevant trade unions and employers organisations&rdquo;.  I think I am right in saying that Congress have expressed views on this and that they are anxious to have it included.  Although I do not think it is in the FIE submission, I presume that they would also like to be consulted with regard to the implications for employers as a result of the Minister adopting a new mode.  Of course, in some instances the relevant employers' organisations might not be covered by the FIE so I have not simply referred to the Irish <Col N="798" /> Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers, as Deputy Byrne has, although there is a similarity between my amendment and the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that there can be a degree of disharmony within unions and that there are still unions outside Congress.  It may be necessary, particularly if the regulation here affected a particular sector with which Congress &mdash; for reasons which may be unrelated to this issue &mdash; had difficulties outside of Congress to put an obligation on the Minister of the day to consult the relevant trade unions and employers' organisations. I do not see why the Minister for Finance should be given a special role in this.  It is a bit like the role we gave the Catholic Church until 1972 when we had a referendum on the issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider taking this amendment on board in the spirit in which it is meant.  I fully accept that the Minister would have consultations in regard to these regulations.  Indeed if I had the good fortune to be sitting in his seat &mdash; and he had the ill-fortune to be in Opposition &mdash; it would also be my view that there should be consultations. However, there is a lacuna in the legislation in that the only obligation to consult applies to the Minister for Finance, who is the least relevant person in all this. The obligation to consult should rest with the social partners.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on his remarks.  The legislation relating to methods of payment of wages goes back to 1464, it was upgraded in 1743 and again in 1896.  It is impossible to say what will happen in relation to payment of wages in the future because technology is moving at such a rapid rate. There is talk about a cashless society; in its simplest form this can be seen in the arguments against paying cash on the buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (1) provides that wages may be paid by cheque, paying order, credit transfer or in cash.  The Minister may add to this list by regulation.  Given the <Col N="799" /> insecurity of future methods of payment, it is important to accept our amendments. Relevant trade unions, employers' organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers should be consulted.  I will not labour the point, but if regulations are to be made in consultation with the Minister for Finance, equally the rights of the workforce affected by the change should be taken into consideration.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are the appropriate body with whom to have consultations as they represent most of the organised workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The three amendments are seeking to ensure that a consultative process will be developed to cope with the growth in technology in methods of payments.  I do not put the same emphasis on consultation with the Minister for Finance as Deputy Shatter because throughout many Bills there is provision for various Ministers having to consult the Minister for Finance.  There are ample precedents in this regard and it is not unique to this Bill.  When there are financial implications there must be consultation between the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance. For that reason I do not have an objection to it as the provision has not worked to the detriment of people in other Bills.</P>
      <P>If there is a change in the methods of payment as a result of the growth of technology there must be safeguards by way of the consultative process between employers and trade unions.  Some unions are outside Congress, but they should not be discriminated against because they are not affiliated to it.  From time to time there are shifts within the representative bodies, including employers' organisations, and any changes must be catered for in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered in detail the proposals contained in these amendments. As Deputy Shatter said, it is acknowledged that I &mdash; and my predecessors from all parties &mdash; and the <Col N="800" /> Department of Labour since its foundation have established a record in the matter of consultation with the social partners.  It is now accepted practice by the employer organisations.  The same applies to Congress; and, while there are not many groups outside Congress, there are different bodies with representative groupings who hold that position as well. The Department always have consultations regardless of what the Minister of the day might say.  My concern about the proposed amendment arises not from an effort to avoid the normal consultations, which are routine in the Department, but from an interest in minimising the difficulties which can arise from statutory commitments to consult interest groups.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne's amendment names the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers as the parties to be consulted.  As I have said, other employer groups may feel they should have a statutory entitlement to similar consultative arrangements.  In most legislation nowadays, apart from a number of fringe bodies, the IMI, IPM and small business firms have to be consulted. Groupings such as the IBOA, the Garda representative body and the Army representative body, not to mention the MBU and others, also have to be consulted on major matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments from Deputy Shatter and Deputy O'Sullivan take a broader approach but would be likely in practice to tie up any draft regulations in an unwieldy consultative process.  The consultative process normally takes place but it can become much too unwieldy if it was written into legislation that all the trade union and employer organisations interested were to be consulted.  Often when one tries to take action quickly, especially at this time of year when groupings &mdash; normally voluntary groupings &mdash; go on holidays and are not meeting, it can take months to receive replies to submissions.  That is fine if the process is carried out in the normal course of events, but if it is laid down in Statute it would unnecessarily tie the hands of future Ministers for Labour who may not <Col N="801" /> have the same relationships with these groups.  I and recent Ministers have been lucky in having good relationships with these bodies but as Deputy Shatter pointed out this may not always be the case.</P>
    <P>In addition to these practical difficulties there may be exceptional circumstances where it would be counterproductive to circumscribe the scope of the Minister of the day to make regulations by statutory requirement to consult employer and trade union interests. I am thinking here of cases of urgency or circumstances where broader objectives can be achieved only at some cost to sectional interests.  That can happen from time to time.  In addition, the amendments could lead to interest groups using any perceived failure by a Minister to consult fully and exhaustively, irrespective of the circumstances, as a basis for legal challenge to the regulations on procedural grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the question of the Minister for Finance, and Deputy O'Sullivan has given a fairly good answer to that.  The Minister for Finance, as the regulatory authority for all financial instruments, has a clear role in any such regulations.  It is nothing more than that. The Minister for Labour must consult with him.  He does not have a veto, and it is important that we understand that.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated it is not necessary to include these amendments. In all other legislation that I have passed it has not been written into the legislation that consultations take place with the social partners.  It has been taken as good practice and a good working arrangement that this be done, not only by this Government but by a number of Governments over the last 20 years.  It is was written into legislation it would have to be written in full, including all the different bodies, and this would create difficulties. Some bodies are not recognised by others and some do not accept the existence of others, but the Minister for Labour would have to recognise all of them.  For that reason it is best to leave the matter stand. The present system has worked well over the years.</P>

      <P>I omitted to ask the Minister whether it would be possible, by having such a provision, to avoid confrontation on the shop floor.

      <P>That may be so, but as Deputies know, particularly Deputies dealing with the Labour brief, it is very much a matter of form to carry out checks.  For example, as regards regulations that we introduce in any area, whether we are dealing with a matter at European level or local level, out of courtesy we consult the relevant officers of FIE and ICTU.  By making this a statutory provision difficulties could arise if at some time a Minister has to take action.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Shatter's point that in 20 years time a Minister for Labour or a Minister for Finance might take a different view, but at that stage Ministers would have their own problems and they would be brought to heel.</P>

    <P>It is important that this amendment be accepted.  It is a very straightforward request.  It would strengthen the legislation and would lead in the future to less confusion and to a clearer understanding of the legislation.  There would be less industrial conflict as a result of this amendment.  What we are requesting is that the words &ldquo;in writing&rdquo; be inserted after the words &ldquo;agreed upon.&rdquo;  The provision would then read: &ldquo;continue to pay those wages to him in cash unless any other mode of payment specified in section 2 is agreed upon in writing by the employer or an organisation representative of employers.&rdquo;  We believe it would be much better to have agreement in writing.  It is normal practice when <Col N="804" /> negotiations are taking place and a conclusion arrived at that minutes are put in writing.  Agreements to transfer from payment of cash by employers should be recorded very clearly.  This amendment seeks to make it clear that a change-over to non-cash methods of payment must be by written agreement as against verbal agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern of the Deputies in putting down these amendments.  In other sections of the Bill such as sections 4 and 5 I am imposing obligations on employers to undertake in writing certain transactions with their employees.  Section 4 provides for written pay statements and section 5 contains the requirement for written notification in connection with certain deductions and written receipts for certain payments.</P>
      <P>However, in this instance I am disposed to the view that the parties to the agreement are those best qualified to decide whether agreement should be oral or in writing.  In many cases I expect that a written agreement will be made.  In other cases the parties concerned may come to an accommodation orally.  I do not intend to impose the level of formality involved in drawing up a written agreement in every instance.  If an employee wants a written agreement, the negotiating position as a result of the transitional provisions in the Bill is sufficient to allow him to make that arrangement with his employer.  However, if both parties are satisfied with an oral arrangement, as is likely to be the case in many small employment areas, I do not intend to require otherwise by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point with the transitional arrangements moving from the 1979 position is that if an employer wishes to get an <Col N="805" /> employee to agree then the employer must obtain that agreement; the strength rests with the employee.  If the employee does not like the suggestions or arrangments put to him then he need not abide by them.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 8, the following is the position.  Since 1979 many employees, in accordance with agreements made with their employers under section 3 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1979, have been and are being paid wages by a mode other than cash.  At present under such arrangements those employees have a right to revert to cash payment of wages at the end of the period of such agreement or, when there is no specific termination date for the agreement, at any time by giving the employer four weeks' notice of the wish to revert to cash payment of wages.  The purpose of section 3 (2) (b) is to guarantee for employees arrangements for reversion to cash payment of wages similar to those that they accepted at the time they agreed to non-cash payment of wages under the 1979 legislation.  Amendment No. 8 seeks to provide by law for the voiding of certain provisins of the post-1979 agreement. The provisions proposed to be void are those relating to the right to reversion to cash payment of wages, the very provisions that were central to the agreements in the first place.  Acceptance of the arrangement would therefore result in withdrawing compulsorily from employees their existing right to revert to the cash payment of wages.  While the purpose of the amendment is to facilitate a more speedy changeover to the non-cash payment of wages, such action would have serious industrial relations implications and, further, would be an inequity in that employees who entered into agreements under the 1979 legislation in good faith would find that as a result of this Bill the very basis of such agreements, the right to revert to cash payment of wages, had been abrogated on a unilateral basis.</P>
    <P>I realise that some of the employer groups have criticised the transitional arrangements contained in section 3 and have said in particular that the provisions <Col N="806" /> do not go far enough in pushing the move to non-cash methods in payment. However, I think that I have made it clear that I am not prepared to countenance a move to non-cash methods of payment that is based simply on compulsion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking to amendment No. 10, I may ask for an explanation as to the reason for that.  I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) employers following consultation and agreement with employee representatives will provide for time off to facilitate cashing of cheques or alternative arrangements by agreement to have cheques cashed and paid to employees during working hours.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the House is aware that this Bill results from a growth in the rate of crime and the danger of conveying cash between employers and employees and between banks and employers in many cases.  The principle behind the Bill is to be welcomed and the Minister is to be complimented for his initiative in that regard.</P>
      <P>The one drawback to the Bill is that any advantage is geared towards employers. Other speakers have mentioned the reduction in costs involved by paying wages by cheque or other modern methods of payment such as electronic and computerised methods of payment. However, at the end of the day employees have to go to their own local bank or other financial institution to cash pay cheques in their own time and at a loss to themselves.  They may have to travel a lengthy distance from their place of employment to the point at which they cash a cheque.  It is unfair to expect employees to bear the entire cost of that.  I feel that there is an onus on the employer to make provision, cash provision, to compensate for time lost, distance travelled and inconvenience caused by employees having to go to cash wages cheques when in the past their wages would have been paid in cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many of the major urban areas problems have arisen in that banks have pulled out from different localities because of a <Col N="808" /> lack of business.  Both in Cork and in Dublin banks have actually closed down and in parts of Dublin there is no banking service available.  That position puts employees in those areas at a very definite disadvantage.  I have tabled the amendment for that reason.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister will take the amendment on board as there is an imbalance in the Bill at the moment. I consider the amendment to be the corrective measure required to ensure that fair play occurs right across the spectrum. One of the Minister's colleagues has in the past used the term &ldquo;levelling the playing pitch&rdquo;.  In this instance the playing pitch is a long way from being level in as much as any advantage goes to the employer.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept this amendment as being the commonsense approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue on which Deputies must stand up and be counted. The Minister is clearly aware of the position of the Congress of Trade Unions.  I refer to the two issues that comprised the sticking point when the Payment of Wages Act, 1979, was under negotiation and that resulted in a conclusion not being arrived at then.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that I believe very strongly that the Bill will be of much greater benefit to employers and banking institutions than to employees.  The Bill presents a potential saving of millions of pounds to both employers and banking institutions, but I do not recognise any real benefit, in the form of cash or otherwise, accruing to the employees.  I do not understand why legislation that was initially good &mdash; the old Truck Acts, which were designed to protect exploited employees down through the centuries &mdash; should in 1991 revert to being legislation not in defence of workers but to accrue savings to employers and banking institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to go through with this legislation there must, in fairness, be some clearly marked areas where workers will share the benefits. Manual workers, very often working for an hourly rate of pay, have been paid traditionally in cash.  Why <Col N="809" /> should they sacrifice this, with all the potential financial savings to their employers and in turn not get a penny out of it.  The ICTU are right to feel sore about this issue.  The Minister is kicking to touch, saying it is open to negotiation and let the unions and the employers kick it about among themselves but that he, as Minister, will do nothing to assist in bending it in favour of workers.  I think that is very wrong.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that employers recognise the rights of workers who are being paid in any form other than cash.  In the case of payment by cheque workers should be allowed time off to cash their cheques.  These workers still need their money in cash form on a Thursday or Friday night to pay their bills, and banking hours are so incredibly unsuited to their needs.  One could argue if they were open on a Saturday or there were late night openings that people could cash their cheques outside working hours.  The reality is that banks are open during working hours and there is this continuous demand that workers have ready access to cash after their week's work. There is no reason whatsoever why some of the benefits accruing to employers and banks from this legislation should not be passed on to the workers.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister most strongly to accept the amendment which is very simple and reasonable.  Where an employee is paid by any mode other than cash the employer should be obliged to provide reasonable paid time off to facilitate the encashment of such mode of payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point that Deputies Byrne and O'Sullivan are making, that the benefits of a changeover should be shared.  However, I feel that bringing in a statutory provision requiring time off would be going too far.  The real problem is the attitude of the banks.  It is a disgrace that the banks are charging 17p for an automatic teller machine transaction which is the real alternative for people who are being paid by cheque. That is very unreasonable of the banks. The issue really should be to contest with <Col N="810" /> them their opening hours and their charges. It is probably going too far to say that we should make a statutory provision so that employers would carry the can for the banks which is in effect what we would be asking.  Obviously employers should be very reasonable with employees when trying to bring about change in the way they pay wages. However I would tend to the view that it would be going too far to insert a statutory provision requiring time off in the law.</P>

      <P>Not alone is there a saving to the banks but there is a saving to the employers.  I would ask the Minister to incorporate this requirement in the Bill to allow time off.  I remember when there was a changeover in the firm where I worked we were told that the banks would come and cash cheques at the gate of the factory; the company, after consultation with the trade unions, decided to bring the day of payment forward to Thursday which was of great benefit to everyone.  There was a cheque payment on a Thursday so that people who were working shifts could bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are times when due to working arrangements, having to work a double shift in times of emergency, for example, when people cannot go to the bank and have to either cash their cheques in a shop that will facilitate them or wait until the following Monday.  That can be a grave inconvenience to anyone.  When the banks are looking for this change they go to extremes, being polite and cooperative to the workers, but a short while later when the change is implemented the boot is on the other foot; they change their hours, they do not turn up and they even close branches in areas that were already cashing cheques for workers.  The onus should be on the employer to facilitate employees who are willing to change their method of payment at great inconvenience to themselves. There should be some allocation of time.  It could be in the form of changing the time of payment from one day to another which helps enormously. <Col N="811" /> However, some employers will not facilitate employees.  They will say that now that the law is changed employees will have to accept payment by cheque and put up with the inconvenience.  The fact remains that there are huge savings for employers in this change.</P>
    <P>With the escalation of crime there is certainly a great need to change from cash to cheque payments.  A man or woman's life could be in jeopardy because of the possibility of a payroll snatch.  This fact has helped to change a lot of peoples' minds about the change-over from cash to cheque payments.  I think the amendments are reasonable. This changeover certainly benefits the banks and also the employers, and the risk of payroll snatches would be eliminated. The least that can be done is to incorporate in the Bill a provision that would give the employee the facility to cash his cheque.  The vast majority of employers will make that concession because they feel it is in their interests anyway.  However there are employers who will not give the concession to the employees to go out to cash their cheques.  Incorporating the requirement in law would safeguard the employee and be of great benefit to him.  I would ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not realised that my amendment No. 13 was out of order.  I would like to make some reference to it. It was to the effect that any additional costs to an employee, such as bank charges or charges for cashcards arising from transfer to a non-cash system of payment shall be borne by the employer.  I understand that is out of order and I am not quite sure why.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the State itself is a big employer and in so far as your amendment would impose an additional charge on the State it is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling that it is out of order.  However, it is important <Col N="812" /> to make the case again on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the workers who will be affected by this legislation. Having highlighted on Second Stage the potential extra charges which may be imposed on employees who will be forced out of cash wages, it is worth reminding the House today that a survey by <i>Consumer Choice</i> shows that tremendous charges are levied on people with accounts in banks.  The figures in <i>Consumer Choice</i> are greater than the figures I mentioned here on 18 June.  The survey shows that there can be a difference of as much as 9p in bank charges for writing a cheque, ranging from 22p in Cork and in the Limerick Saving Bank to 31p at the AIB.  A charge of 31p for every cheque that is written can amount to a lot of money and there are a complex range of other charges as well.  Workers receiving cash payments know the exact value of their labour and they can budget accordingly. Why should we be unsympathetic to people who will move into the banking institutions to face all these extra charges which actually devalue the rate of return for their labour?  We are not sure by how much wages will be devalued.  It will differ between individuals depending on where they bank, on how many cheques they write and so on.  If savings are to be made by employers and banking institutions why should the rights of workers not be protected?  An amendment to impose an extra charge on the Revenue is out of order but at least people should be allowed reasonable time off to cash cheques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion I suggested that a different system must operate in Denmark where 90 per cent of the workforce receive payments in forms other than in cash.  I argued that here there were not many manual workers in receipt of non-cash payments.  I referred to the resistance to non-cash payments and the Minister replied that 70 per cent of blue collar workers here already have accounts with the banks and that this was great.  Is it great?  Just because a person has a current account with the bank does not mean that he has any money.  In fact a lot of people are in hock to the bank.  Because of this <Col N="813" /> Bill many more people will probably end up in debt to the banks.  The fact that 70 per cent of blue collar employees already have bank accounts is not a great argument for this.  I am trying to keep manual workers who will be affected by this legislation out of the claws of the banks.  The minimum that should be afforded to workers is a reasonable time off to cash their cheques in the banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with whether or not people should have time off in order to cash cheques.  I will explain the contents of the Bill to some Deputies again because the point has been missed.  Section 3 (2) of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>(a) Where, immediately before the commencement of this Act, an employee's wages were being paid to him in cash, the employer shall, while the employee is in the employment concerned, continue to pay those wages to him in cash unless any other mode of payment specified in section 2 is agreed upon by the employer or an organisation representative of employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This makes it clear that nobody will be railroaded into non-cash payments.  This means that if through negotiations in the collective bargaining system all concerned agree to non-cash payments they can implement it.  This does not refer only to banks.  It could involve credit unions, building societies, trustee saving accounts and so on.  The Congress of Trade Unions are in favour of this Bill but the FIE, as mentioned by Deputies Shatter and Bruton earlier, do not want the transitional arrangements.  The employers would prefer on the passage of this Bill to be able to tell their employees that next Monday morning they will be paid in other than cash payments. That will not be the case.  There are transitional arrangements and this can only be done by negotiation.  It is not for me to tell the trade unions or employers how to negotiate.  Trade unions in their negotiations will ensure that workers are compensated in some <Col N="814" /> way.  The detailed arrangements involved in time off is best left to local bargaining. It is not appropriate to legislation.  If the amendment was accepted it would mean that paid time off for banking should be given to all employees regardless of where the bank was.  That is not what we are seeking to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne's amendment seeks to enable all employees paid by cheque to have time off.  In the case of some employees, time off is not an issue.  In many cases employees may be in a position to drop into a local bank at lunch time and would not require time off and in other cases employees may require flexibility to do banking business.  Time off for banking is hardly appropriate to night workers or employees who work non-banking hours or non-post office or non-credit union hours.  The proposal to confine paid time off to cheque paid employees would be unlikely to find favour with employees generally.  Those paid by payable order, bank draft or similar money transfer instruments would appear to have an equal case for time off but they are not mentioned in the amendments.  If I were even to consider an amendment like this, which I am not, it would be unfair to say that a person paid by money order or through the credit union should not be entitled to the same time off.</P>
    <P>Neither of the amendments tackled the problem of the amount of time off to be given although they impose a general obligation on employers to grant time off.  Twenty minutes may be an average time, but how does one deal with the question of reasonable time off for an air hostess on transatlanic flight or for farm workers in a remote area?  These are all things for local negotiation and I have no doubt that before they concede the right to move from cash payments the trade union movement will ensure that it is negotiated properly.  This certainly cannot be negotiated in a general ambiguous amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is naive of the Minister to say that the Members do not understand the implications of this <Col N="815" /> section.  I understand why employers are opposed to this.  It is a good bargaining position as distinct from the position of the Congress of Trade Unions.  This is putting the employee at a tremendous disadvantage.  I do not know why the Minister cannot take this on board.  The Minister emphasised agreement before the introduction of a cheque payment system.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the position of two or three people employed in an office and who may not be organised.  If they do not wish to be paid by cheque they have the option of going to either the commission or the tribunal.  However, this could adversely affect the promotion prospects of those individuals within that firm. Indeed, they could be ostracised by their employer if they refuse to accept payment by cheque.  This legislation will put people who object to this system of payment out on a limb.  A vindictive employer who wants to introduce such a system of payment for his employees could make life very difficult for employees who are not protected by this legislation.  For this reason I ask the Minister to give further consideration to these amendments which propose to safeguard the rights of workers who could be placed in a disadvantaged position as a result of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Employees who decide to continue with the present system of cash payments will be protected under the legislation and they will have the backing of the tribunal in any negotiations. There are many precedents in this area.  One of the first things employers who introduce a non-cash system of payment do is offer time off to employees to cash their cheques, which is the easy way out for them.  I do not think the trade unions accept that time off is the only option; they believe there is a longer list of options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne was of the view that under this Bill employees would have to accept a non-cash system of payment. That will not be the case.  They will only move to a system of cashless pay with <Col N="816" /> their agreement.  Therefore, their rights will not be taken away from them.  As Deputy O'Sullivan rightly said, it will be more difficult for those in a small company where the staff are not well organised. However, I believe the <i>status quo</i> will remain in such cases as small companies would not make big savings with the introduction of a non-cash pay system.  It is the big employers who will make the savings.  The introduction of a non-cash pay system will mean almost irrelevant savings for an employer of five or ten people.  The big savings will be made by employers who have a workforce of 100, 200 or 300 people.  These are the employees for whom the trade union movement will negotiate settlements. The Bill provides that employees do not have to agree to a non-cash system of payment until there is a negotiated settlement.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a brief question.  As far as I am aware, up to now if a person opted out of a non-cash system of payment the entire system fell.  If a person wishes to opt out of the system in future will the entire system fall under this legislation or will it depend on a majority decision?  Under the old legislation a non-cash system of payment could not be brought in if a person did not agree to it.  Will this be the case in future?</P>

      <P>Under this Bill workers will have an opportunity to negotiate agreements with their employers.  People who are being paid by cheque at present under the 1979 Act will have an opportunity of renegotiating agreements with their employers.  Once they negotiate a new agreement under the 1991 Act they will have to remain in the system and will not be able to drift in and out of it.  People who already have an arrangement with their employer will be able to negotiate a new agreement.</P>

On Second Stage a member <Col N="817" /> of the Fine Gael Party deplored my suggestion that people should be allowed time off to cash their cheques.  He went on to ask why the trade union mentality sought to equate work with obstructionism. That was a disgraceful remark, an insult to my socialist colleagues and The Workers' Party.

      <P>I am quoting from the Second Stage contribution of Deputy McGahon on this Bill on 18 June 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take great offence at the allegations made.  The Labour Party, and The Workers' Party, have attempted today &mdash; obviously the Minister is not going to accept our amendments &mdash; to get some concessions for employees.  It is important that employers give their employees reasonable paid time off to cash their cheques.  However, for some reason this proposal is like a red flag to a bull.  Fine Gael would like to see greater restrictions imposed on the trade union movement. The remarks made by Deputy McGahon on Second Stage were uncalled for and if the Deputy representing the Fine Gael <Col N="818" /> Party today would like to apologise on his behalf, it would be accepted by us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>Deputy Byrne is using cheap tactics in a debate on a Bill wich is constrained by time.  Every Deputy is entitled to express his view and Deputy McGahon can be particularly colourful when expressing his point of view.  It is offensive and naive for a Deputy to impute to an entire party the views of one Deputy.</P>
      <P>The amendment sponsored by Deputy Byrne is not progressive.  It would not be good for the creation of employment to build into our legislation a statutory provision for time off on a long term basis in every case.  This should be done by way of negotiation.  As we all know, the manner of a transaction can change over time.  The positions of workers, trade unions and employers have to be balanced in a reasonable way in the context of the issues confronting them.  This should not be dealt with by way of legislation. As I made clear when I spoke on the amendment sponsored by Deputy Byrne, there is an onus on employers who will gain from changes of this nature to make reasonable agreements.  It was cheap of Deputy Byrne to try to smear the Fine Gael Party by quoting the views of a colourful Deputy.  If I sought to quote what was said in this House by some of his party's predecessors he would be quick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would be very irresponsible of me to accept amendments which make reference to the question of time off without mentioning who would be covered.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to combine, in one body, the functions which have up to now been carried out by two organisations, Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council.  It is intended that the new board will be called An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; The Irish Trade Board and that it will come into being on 1 September 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála is a statutory body <Col N="820" /> established and operating under the Export Promotion Acts, 1959 to 1987.  Its function is to promote, assist and develop the exportation of goods and services. The Irish Goods Council is a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital.  Its primary function is to assist the sale and marketing of Irish goods and services in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The objective of creating one board is to ensue that the State provides marketing support to Irish companies from a single source.  The circumstances that face Irish companies, both in the local marketplace and in the wider one outside, are changing radically.  To survive in these new circumstances, and especially to thrive, our companies must develop and deepen their marketing efforts.  So too must the State review the support it provides to assist them in this task.  The decision to merge Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council was announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his preface to the Review of Industrial Performance, published in December 1990.</P>
    <P>This legislation is the latest in a series of significant developments which have taken place since 1987 in the restructuring of State agencies involved in industrial development and promotion. Among the most notable developments were: the establishment of FÁS to take over the functions previously undertaken by AnCO, YEA and the National Manpower Service and; the merger of the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and standards to form EOLAS, a single agency with responsibility for the development, application, co-ordination and promotion of science and technology in Irish industry.  Legislation is currently being prepared to provide for the amalgamation of the activities of NADCORP with those of the IDA.</P>
    <P>In moving this Bill today to merge the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála I would like to reflect briefly on the history of these organisations and on the changing nature of the Irish economy, its products and its exports in which these <Col N="821" /> organisations have played their part since their inception.</P>
    <P>The older of these two existing bodies was established as Córas Tráchtála Teoranta almost 40 years ago on 21 December 1951.  Its architect was the man who created many of the institutions that still today serve our industry and commerce &mdash; the late Séan Lemass.  Sometime after CTT was set up, the late Séan Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, addressed its board and several of the things he said will sound familiar to us after nearly four decades.  His message was that export development was now the main aim of industrial policy.  &ldquo;Success in this aim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is essential to secure the speedy rectification of the country's adverse trade balance and an increase of production and employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps hard for us now in another generation to realise just how much things have changed since the early fifties. At that time we had an inward looking, highly protected economy &mdash; overwhelmingly dependent on the British market, which took more than 70 per cent of our very moderate level of exports.  Our trade balance was chronically in deficit and our industrial base was almost entirely Irish-owned and in traditional sectors.  Economic growth in the country had failed to match our political and institutional development since independence.</P>
    <P>To indicate the relative narrowness of perspective of the period it is worth recalling that CTT itself was set up not to develop exports in general, but for a specific purpose &mdash; to increase Ireland's earnings of US dollars.  That was perceived to be the most pressing need of the time.  CTT was the Dollar Export Promotion Board and accordingly its first overseas offices were in North America &mdash; in New York, Chicago and Montreal. Very soon its role was expanded &mdash; first to the British market, then to export markets worldwide.  Its role deepened, too &mdash; from being an <i>ad hoc</i> response to an emergency to being a long term development organisation, centred on the task of building market share for Irish goods in overseas markets, not just by selling and <Col N="822" /> promotion but also by helping Irish companies develop in the ways that were necessary to make them producers of goods that were marketable overseas.</P>
    <P>In order to strengthen Córas Tráchtála's ability to contribute towards the realisation of the Programme for Economic Expansion, in 1959, Jack Lynch, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced legislation in this House to change CTT from being a limited company to a statutory body set up under an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council was established in 1978.  It was, itself, a merger of two existing organisations &mdash; the National Development Association and the working group on the promotion and sale of Irish goods to assist Irish manufacturing industry to win new business in the domestic market.  The Irish Goods Council came into being at a time when Irish industry across the board faced the dual challenge of market share erosion as a result of increased competitive pressures and insufficient marketing capability to exploit opportunities.  Most firms were focussed inwardly on production instead of outwardly on the customer and the market-place.  Poor marketing performance was identified as the single biggest barrier to growth, particularly among indigenous firms in the small to medium sized categories.</P>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council embarked on a long term programme of assisting firms to build up their own marketing strengths, first on a sectoral marketing basis, then by providing a series of kickstart marketing supports to companies which had commitment and potential but which were being held back, in the main, because of marketing shortcomings.  One example of this is the Irish Goods Council's Marketplace programme, which places young business graduates with Irish companies as first-time marketing executives on a one-year, mutual trial basis.  Since the programme was started in 1983 almost 600 placements have been made.</P>
    <P>Over the years both the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála have worked with remarkable energy and zest <Col N="823" /> at their respective tasks.  Their effectiveness can best be measured in the now almost total acceptance among Irish firms of the importance of professional marketing in the widest sense and their willingness to invest, often from very limited resources, in marketing planning and activities.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the broad changes that have taken place in the last four decades and the circumstances that now demand a further structural change: in 1951 our annual exports were £81.5 million &mdash; today they are in the region of £15 billion; the destination of our exports has shifted dramatically.  In the fifties three quarters of our exports were to Britain.  Today Britain accounts for only about one third of our total exports.  Our trade now is overwhelmingly with the EC, which of course includes Britain.  It is the EC that now takes more than three quarters of our exports; Two thirds of our people employed in manufacturing are directly concerned in exports; there are few people in Ireland today whose economic well-being is not affected by the level of our success in external trade; and in recent decades the inward looking, protectionist philosophy of the thirties and fifties has finally been laid to rest.  In its place we have built an outward-looking, open economy.  We are building a new tradition based on a strong belief in the unfettered movement between countries, of goods, capital and people.  In the sixties we achieved free trade with Britain.  In the seventies we took the great leap forward in joining the European Community.</P>
    <P>We have heard, of course, a vast amount over the past few years about the opportunities and threats arising from the 1992 process.  I have no wish to rehash them now.  But a few quick remarks are highly relevant to our business here today.  The first point is that there is no automatic bonanza in the Single European Market.  An opportunity is just that &mdash; an opportunity.  We are not guaranteed a greater market share in the EC. Market share in the post-1991 era will have to be earned.  And earning it will <Col N="824" /> not be easy.  In fact, for a number of reasons, it will be very difficult.  So Irish companies will need to work harder than before, and they will need the most effective support we can give them.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why growth for Irish companies in the Single Market will be difficult is that the markets that make up the new Europe are changing fast. They are changing because of the Single Market process, and they are changing because of long term European and world trends that are independent of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The task is to sell into markets in a state of flux.  What is true of a market in the EC this month may not be true next month.  Tastes are changing, distribution patterns are changing, the balance of market forces are changing, the very relationship between buyers and sellers is changing.  What this means is that a company selling into this new situation &mdash; and no-one has any choice about it &mdash; must have a higher market awareness than ever before, a greater readiness, than ever before, to look beyond traditional ways of doing business and to set up new kinds of trading relationships.</P>
    <P>The days when people export in a hands-off way were dying anyway.  The Single Market is now about to kill them off altogether.  It will no longer be enough to find an agent in a foreign country who will take what you produce and somehow find a buyer for it in his marketplace. Selling successfully in the new Europe means being committed to being in Europe.  It means a commitment to developing close commercial links, a deep knowledge of the particular needs of the marketplace, and a readiness to tailor one's product or service precisely to those needs.  All this implies a deeper commitment by companies to marketing, to quality and to product innovation.</P>
    <P>The Single Market also means that there will be a greater need than ever before to defend our existing market share.  Let me dwell for a moment on Britaon.  We should be in no doubt whatever that Britain is still and will remain a vitally important market for Irish industry. It is even more vital than the overall <Col N="825" /> export figures would suggest &mdash; because indigenous industry, Irish-owned industry, relies more heavily on Britain than do our exports overall.</P>
    <P>As far as our British market is concerned, what the Single Market means is far more competition for out market share from other EC countries.  Across a wide range of product sectors, the Single Market will not mean better access for us to the British market.  What it will mean is that it will be easier for others to compete with us there.  We could never take the British market for granted.  In the years ahead, we will have to fight harder than ever before to maintain our level of sales there if not increase them.  That is another part of the new reality.  In fact, many Irish companies have in recent years built strong market positions in Britain, in that market's years of growth. They are now taking an aggressive stance to maintain and expand their market share so that when the British market recovers they will be in a position to gain extra business.  Córas Tráchtála helped most of these firms establish their presence in this key marketplace.  Its successor will help them to stay and grow there.</P>
    <P>However, that new reality comes even closer to home &mdash; to the local market here on our doorstep.  The Single Market will make it significantly more attractive for foreign firms to sell into Ireland.  Many firms who were discouraged from being active here because the small size of our market did not make it worth the trouble involved, will now take an interest because it will be so much easier to penetrate.</P>
    <P>What this means is that all Irish manufacturing firms &mdash; and indeed, many service firms as well &mdash; will for the first time find the need to be internationally competitive on their own doorstep.  I am not talking about exporters now, but about companies who have been concerned entirely with the Irish market. They have not been protected by tariff barriers, but nevertheless many of them have up to now been sheltered from the full rigours of international competition. That is going to change very quickly.</P>
    <P>The Single Market calls totally into <Col N="826" /> question the distinction we have traditionally made between the Irish market and the markets outside, between home sales and export sales, between being an exporter and not being an exporter.  The Single Market places every firm in the same boat &mdash; a boat in which the prerequisite for survival is the ability to be internationally competitive.</P>
    <P>Up to now, we could operate a two-tier system.  The home market was one thing, export markets quite something else.  What you needed to succeed on the home market was not necessarily at all the same as you needed abroad.  And for many companies who would never graduate to exporting, the need to be internationally competitive did not arise. Accordingly, we had two agencies &mdash; one agency serving firms that were developing in the home market &mdash; the Irish Goods Council &mdash; and one agency serving firms that were developing in export markets &mdash; Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>The two agencies worked together quite closely: they have shared the same building for nearly two decades, they have co-operated well together whenever it has been appropriate but the two agencies have been separate, nonetheless. This has had a number of consequences that we no longer wish to live with.  I will mention just three reasons for change.</P>
    <P>The first reason is that companies who graduated to exporting had to start an entirely new relationship with another agency: their early development was with the Irish Goods Council, and then when they moved to exporting they had to start all over again with Córas Tráchtála. Those Deputies who have experience in business will know that the success of company development through agencies depends to a very important extent on the nature of the relationship that is built up on both sides &mdash; and that building this relationship is a time-consuming process and one that involves personal commitment in both company and agency.  To ask growing companies, whose resources are always stretched, to develop two relationships, where one could serve the need, is placing an unnecessary burden <Col N="827" /> on companies &mdash; and one which it is now time to remove.</P>
    <P>The second reason that we need one agency is that we want more companies to make the transition to exporting, and we want them to make it sooner.  Because of the small size of our home market, Irish companies must move to exporting much earlier than companies of the same size would in, say, Britain or France. Companies there have a large familiar home market that they grow quite large in.  But if Irish companies are to grow significantly, they must move outside this market at an early stage.  By that I do not necessarily mean that they should export straightaway.  What I mean is that their strategic focus should from the start be on a wider market than Ireland.</P>
    <P>We do not want companies to grow with their sights fixed only on the Irish market, who start thinking about the outside world only when they need to look outside for growth.  The approach means that their initial strategies will be moulded exclusively in terms of the Irish market.  This increases the likelihood that they will approach exporting on the basis of trying to sell outside the country what they have done well with here.  That is not the way.  We want companies to be thinking about being internationally competitive from the start.  If they do so, then what they do in the Irish market will be a suitable basis on which to expand abroad when the time comes.  There will be no need to develop a new philosophy, a new approach.</P>
    <P>The third main reason that we need one agency rather than two is that we have found over the years that most effective help that agencies can give is on a sectoral basis.  To assist companies in the furniture business, for instance, requires professional people in the agency who have deep experience of that sector. Companies who are in the same business, even though some might be exporting and some not, have needs that are closer to one another than companies from different sectors.  Specialist help is the requirement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> There are many sectors across the spectrum of industry and service and the resources of the State are limited.  So what we are doing by having two agencies is spreading the available special resources more thinly than they need be spread.  With one agency we can gather together the specialist sectoral knowledge in more efficient units and increase the value of the service they deliver to client companies.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the technical details of the Bill before us.  The mechanism being proposed to effect the merger is as follows: Section 5 provides that the name of Córas Tráchtála will be changed to An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; The Irish Trade Board.  Section 2 proposes that the new board will come into operation on 1 September 1991.  Section 6 conveys to the new board functions which combine the current functions of Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council.  The primary functions of the new board will be to promote, assist and develop the marketing of Irish goods and services.</P>
    <P>I want to state at this point that a good deal of thought went into seeking a description of what the new board will be about.  We have sought to give the new board a clear mandate without getting bogged down in the theoretical debates about the meanings of particular words. For example, I know that Deputies will be aware that the word &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; can be defined in a variety of ways by practitioners and academics.  I like to take a very straightforward stance on this matter.  Marketing in the broadest sense is the link between society's material requirements and its economic pattern of response.</P>
    <P>The task of the new board will be to assist companies in identifying markets and in the development of their marketing skills to enable them to meet society's material requirements so far as is possible with Irish products.  That is what the Government envisage the board will be promoting, assisting and developing. If we look at what makes a company excellent we will find that an excellent company knows how to adapt and <Col N="829" /> respond to a continuously changing marketplace. The excellent company and its employees are committed to creating customers and to satisfying customers.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 to 15 deal with the dissolution of the Irish Goods Council and the transfer of its staff, property, rights and liabilities to the new board.  I want to make it clear that there will be no job losses on foot of the merger.  The Government recognise that there is a major job of work to be done in improving the marketing capability of Irish industry and all the staff of the combined agencies have a key role in that work.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill proposes that the aggregate amount of the sums which may be paid to the board for the purpose of enabling it to perform its functions will be increased to £400 million.  The current statutory limit, as set in the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1987, is £260 million and that figure will be reached in late August or early September this year. For this reason it is highly desirable that this Bill be passed in this session.  If we cannot met this deadline arrangements will have to be made for Córas Tráchtála to undertake short term borrowings to maintain its operations until the Bill is enacted.  I am quite confident that this Bill will be enacted before the recess.  I should also add that it is estimated that, based on the spending projections contained in the <i>Programme for Industrial Development,</i> the new limit of £400 million will cover Exchequer funding of the board until the end of 1994.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also being availed of to bring some of the statutory provisions relating to the board in line with other agencies. Section 7 provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have power to give the board general policy directives. Section 10 contains a standard provision covering restrictions on the disclosure of information by staff or advisers to the board.</P>
    <P>Section 11 extends the provisions of the 1959 Act relating to the nomination and/or election of board members and staff to the Houses of the Oireachtas to elections to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Section 9 increases the number of <Col N="830" /> board members from the present maximum of seven to eight, thus allowing the Minister scope to increase the spread of expertise on the new board to reflect its wider responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This legislation will improve the cohesion of State support for the marketing efforts of Irish industry.  The State must go for the optimal approach in the organisation of its support services.  The creation of the Single European Market requires all commercial institutions in this country to look hard at their operations and adjust their strategies to the new demands made on them.  This Bill, following the increased allocation of national resources to the marketing area, shows that the Government are also responding to the new environment.  We are, in a nutshell, providing a single marketing agency for the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>What will be the characteristics of the new organisation?  I see it as having four main strands.  First of all it will have a clear client group in mind.  Its services will be overwhelmingly provided to and sought by indigenous companies.  We are talking here mainly, but not exclusively, of Irish-owned companies, and mainly, but not exclusively, of small and medium-sized companies.  Essentially what we mean by indigenous companies are those firms that have a significant amount of their strategic functions based here in Ireland, companies that have their marketing centred in Ireland, companies that are firmly rooted in the Irish economy. This includes, I am glad to say, a growing number of foreign owned companies.</P>
    <P>CTT at the moment serve some 1,200 exporting companies on a regular basis. The Irish Goods Council have a core client base of some 800 companies, most of whom do not export yet.  The aim of the new organisation will be to accelerate the sales growth of all these companies, wherever the opportunities present themselves.</P>
    <P>CTT have, and the new organisation will continue to have, trade board functions which include the promotion of Ireland's trade in general.  The new board will continue to have advisory functions <Col N="831" /> to the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to all trade and marketing matters, but in terms of its development thrust the concentration will be on indigenous companies, most of which are Irish owned, and most of which are small and medium sized.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the new agency will concentrate initially on one central task: helping Irish industry to take full advantage of the Single Market.  Again, that is not the whole task &mdash; the new organisation will, as before, have a vital role to play in the development of export markets around the world, particularly in such important areas as North America, Japan and Australia.  However, the concentration must be on Europe: for those companies who do not export, to prepare them for competition from within the EC; and for those companies who do export, to help them develop markets in what will be the world's biggest trading entity.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the new organisation will provide financial support for marketing by firms.  Both CTT and the Irish Goods Council have begun to benefit from major increases in their resources via the European Structural Funds.  CTT's allocation this year of £31.25 million is almost 60 per cent higher than the 1988 figure.  The Irish Goods Council's allocation for 1991, at just over £2 million, is 100 per cent higher than the 1988 figure.  These resources will be available to the new board to help firms develop their markets and to help them make whatever changes are needed to compete effectively in the new international conditions.  These funds offer Irish companies a once off opportunity to restructure themselves for the new world we are moving into.  They will be available only to assist those companies who demonstrate that they are in earnest about the achievement of new markets and growth in market share.</P>
    <P>Finally this agency will be the eyes and ears of many emerging Irish companies in the marketplace, not replacing but supplementing and enriching the company's own presence.  Through this new agency a company will be able to <Col N="832" /> get initial access to markets across the EC and to the main markets around the world.  One of the great strengths of the organisation will be the combination of the deep knowledge of the marketplace available to CTT and the hands-on development skills of the IGC.</P>
    <P>In the economic sphere, Governments of every ideological hue strive to create a favourable environment for industrial development.  Characteristics of such an environment are a stable currency, low inflation and a positive balance of trade. We have arrived at such a situation in this country, largely through determined and successful efforts since 1987 to bring our public finances under control. Government and the social partners have co-operated in a unique way to achieve this vital requirement for our economic survival.</P>
    <P>A further economic priority for this Government has been to provide the best possible institutional structures to assist industry to increase production, sales and employment.  If any lesson can be drawn from recent history it is that the State cannot do everything, but what it does it must do well.  The best guarantee of such efficiency is to create institutions that precisely fill the needs of the day.  The Bill before us aims to do exactly that and I commend it for the approval of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, by and large.  It provides for the merger of the Irish Goods Council and the Irish Export Board &mdash; Córas Tráchtála &mdash; to form An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must face up to rationalisation in the marketplace and I see this as rationalisation, but the success of this board will depend on the teeth the Minister gives them and on the personnel operating within them.  Before I develop that theme I would like to comment on Minister O'Malley's attitude in rushing this Bill through the Dáil, a Minister who regularly will castigate operators, businesses and firms for not doing their job properly and not giving it sufficient thought.  I believe he has not given sufficient time in <Col N="833" /> the House for proper debate of this very important development.  I am disappointed at his attitude.  This is a major, very important development.  The primary objective of rationalising industrial policy is to promote the development of a strong international competitive industrial sector in Ireland which will make the maximum contribution to employment growth and higher living standards.  The uncertainty regarding over all growth in the international and domestic market poses a major challenge for our manufacturing base.  In many cases the expansion of the manufacturing sector will require an increase in market share; that goes without saying.  We need people out there who can develop the market for us.</P>
    <P>I might cite a fine example of a person with ability and of an organisation who brought outstanding achievements to this country in the late seventies and early eighties.  I refer to another semi-State body, An Bord Bainne, led by Joe McGough.  They penetrated world markets for dairy produce, established brand names and succeeded.  Joe McGough and his team succeeded because they were selling a product they could stand over. They set the highest possible standards for their suppliers.  Before that central marketing board came into being cooperatives all over the country vied with each other internationally in the marketplace, competing and bringing down the price against themselves.  I see it as the purpose of An Bord Tráchtála to bring together the manufacturers in this country and to have them co-operate in seeking and developing markets abroad. Our skilled young people whom we have in abundance, our one claim to fame left, our growing population, well educated and highly trained, are able to adapt.  The product has been of excellent quality but the marketing has let us down on numerous occasions.  If we do not have people out there who know about marketing and about penetrating the marketplace, we will not succeed.  Small businesses could not afford to employ marketing personnel and for that reason An Bord Tráchtála will be the key to helping those people to get to the marketplace but the <Col N="834" /> key to the success will be the quality of the people there.</P>
    <P>I will cite criticism I have heard of people in the tourist organisation, Bord Fáilte, going abroad on trips that were nothing more than junkets.  It is not good enough to travel to New York, Paris, London or wherever, book into a plush hotel, wine and dine some few people you make contact with and come back home and say, &ldquo;I have done a good job.&rdquo; That is not marketing.  You must go out to meet the customer.  You must go out to the large supermarkets and to the wholesalers in those countries and talk to them.</P>
    <P>Let me go back to An Bord Bainne and their demise in the marketplace. When we had achieved markets and set a brand name for many of our dairy products such as &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; which was a household name in many cities all over the world and on world airlines, Government pulled back the funding to An Bord Bainne and their personnel had to be brought home.  What happened?  Our competitors moved in behind our backs and our market collapsed.  Likewise with CBF, the meat marketing board.  It was a stop-go policy.  When there were gluts of beef, people were sent out to gain markets.  When that succeeded and we got our beef marketing again the funding was pulled back.  That is not marketing. You cannot afford to let up.  You must have your people out there at all times. You must keep meeting and talking to the customers, listening to what they have to say, watching our competitors, because there are always changes in marketing strategy, and in the type of product the customer is looking for.</P>
    <P>The £460 million over a number of years looks fine on paper but how will it be allocated?  Will the board be told in year one that they are getting X amount of money and in year two find their budget increased?  At all times there must be sufficient to do the job on the day. This is a vitally important development. We have the manufacturer.  We have the people who can do the job at home, but if we have not got the people out in the world markets we are not going to <Col N="835" /> succeed.  For that reason it is vital that the Minister give a commitment that this board will have the teeth and the freedom to do the job we expect of them.</P>
    <P>The small, family owned businesses developed in this country will stick in good times and bad.  The multinationals are welcome.  They have a role to play, but when the pressure comes on internationally we see how we are treated here.  We are one of the first countries to suffer a cutback.  Numbers are pared down.  There is nothing so annoying to any community, town or county as an announcement by a Minister that multinational manufacturers are coming into a locality with a projected 300, 400 or 500 jobs and then to find that in year one it might be 80 jobs, that the figure might rise later to 120 or 200 jobs but that it then starts to slide again.  Expectations are built up and suddenly they evaporate and disppear.  The small, Irish-owned, family business will be there slowly developing and these are the people who need the help from this marketing board not only to get their produce to the home market but to show them how to hold the home market and penetrate it.  In the Single European Market of January 1993 foreign manufacturers will be looking to possibilities in this country and competition we have not previously experienced will be on our doorsteps.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in getting our goods to the marketplace, in transporting them from say Donegal, Monaghan or my own county of Cavan to London, Paris, or New York.  In the first place our roads cause a major headache and add considerable cost.  Secondly, our energy costs are higher than those of most European countries.  To get to the point of export means long travel.  Looking at the juggernauts moving up and down through this country I often wonder if they are at all times carrying a full load or if there is wastage by way of small amounts of goods being transported from the furtherest point north to perhaps, Dublin, Wexford or whatever destination.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the marketing board play a role in setting up a central depot in a <Col N="836" /> strategic location where full loads could be packed.  Unless these large lorries travel our roads carrying the maximum weight allowed under the legislation, there will be added costs to the manufacturer. There should be co-operation between manufacturers in the transport of goods.  The new board have a role to play in co-ordinating that activity.  Likewise, for the European markets we should have a central warehouse destination where goods would be offloaded, collected and taken to the market-place rather than having our people travel to the market place with a juggernaut.</P>
    <P>If this organisation are to do their job they will have to facilitate the small manufacturers in whom I have more faith than in any multinationals though they have proven themselves in some cases by providing more funding which is the key to success.  The new organisation will have an important role to play in helping those people get to the marketplace.  If that is done we can look to a brighter future.  Bord Bainne did a great job in the seventies against strong opposition but were let down by the Government who withdrew finance.  If the Government do not help the new body the announcement today will not be worth the paper it was written on.</P>
    <P>I hope we have learned lessons from the mistakes made in the past.  I am not casting any reflection on the people in those organisations.  I note from a section of the Bill that the personnel in both organisations will be merged.  They may be the best people for the job but I will be watching their activities.  If they are not up to standard there are people available with the necessary capabilities.  We should not be slow in ensuring that those people are given the opportunity.  I wish this new organisation every success.  They have a major task ahead of them.  If they succeed we can look to a brighter future and our young people will be able to look to obtaining employment here.  We should manufacture the goods the consumer is seeking on the world markets rather than watching our young people leaving for firms in Germany, England <Col N="837" /> and elsewhere.  That can only be done if we have confidence in ourselves.</P>
    <P>We had an exhibition in my County of Cavan three years ago, called CavEx. The venue was a factory outside Cavan town, which for various reasons, was not in operation at the time.  A number of people came together and invited the manufacturers in the county to put on a week-end exhibition of the goods they were manufacturing.  People were astounded.  On the first day of the exhibition 200 people passed through.  Word got out about CavEx and by the weekend people were queueing to visit it.  People could not believe we had the skill to produce the wide range of items on display, for example, household goods and light industrial requirements.  The exhibition was advertised by word of mouth: there is no better advertisement than one satisfied customer talking to another. That exhibition generated enormous activity for Caven industries.  I envisage Bord Tráchtála doing a similar job nationwide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill as a rationalisation measure and take the point the Minister made that the promotion in the areas of manufacture and sales might be better and more efficiently performed by one organisation. The distinction between import and export will become more blurred with the advent of the Single Market.</P>
      <P>At this juncture I pay tribute to the men and women in both organisations who have worked so hard with such determination over the years to promote industrial activity.  The thanks and appreciation of all of us should be extended to them.  They have done a fine job and that is generally recognised.  If there are shortcomings left in our economy the blame cannot be laid at their door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill presents a suitable opportunity to examine our status so far as economic development is concerned.  Is all going well?  Are we happy with the present position?  Some of the indicators are fine.  Imports and exports are going well but the most important indicator of <Col N="838" /> all, unemployment, is a disaster and we are fooling ourselves if we do not recognise that and face up to it.  I am sorry to say the Minister gave scant attention in his lengthy contribution to the question of employment and employment is the key factor.  Over the years the job creating policies have not been just a failure, they have been an absolute disaster.  This is an ideal opportunity to examine why this is so and what can be done to remedy that position.  There is no sense in moaning about it, one has to try to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Employment can be created in two ways, by the private sector or the public sector.  I have heard the old phrase &mdash; it is almost corny now &mdash; that the responsibility of Government is to create the right conditions in the economy, and the jobs will somehow appear.  There is no need for the Minister and I, or anybody else, to have arguments about the problem, about the political divide and so on; the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  The Government tell us <i>ad nauseam,</i> hoping we will believe it if they say it often enough, that they have created the circumstances in the economy, having dealt with inflation and so on and the jobs will appear.  Those jobs have not appeared and there is no sign of them appearing. The position is getting worse instead of better.  If we ignore that problem or try to brush it under the carpet we will be doing no service to the country or to the people who join the dole queues in ever increasing numbers.  It has proven wrong. When we look at the unemployment figures and how they are growing we see we have not done well.  There is unemployment in other EC countries and in America but our rate of unemployment is the worst in the EC and one of the worst of the OECD countries.  I do not see why that has to be the case.</P>
    <P>We may have endemic problems, we may have a small home market, we may wish we had more natural resources than we have &mdash; I accept all of those things &mdash; but we cannot justify the disgustingly high level of unemployment in Ireland.  What a waste of resources, a destruction of people's lives, and it does not have to be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> I accept that it is a complex matter to analyse but, over the last decades, we have been guilty of an over-reliance on the private sector, in particular on a foreign private sector, the so-called multi-nationals. I do not advocate excluding them, they have an important role to play, but it is a serious mistake to overrely on them.  Millions of pounds of scarce resources have been pumped into them through Córas Tráchtála and by way of other grants.  I admit that they have delivered in some cases but, in too many, it has been a complete and utter disaster. They have taken the profits, milked the industry and the country but they did not integrate and never really developed connections with other industries downstream. They left when it suited them causing disastrous situations up and down the country.  Various Ministers for Industry and Commerce, State organisations and others had great difficulty in picking up the pieces.  The concept of the rising tide, suitable conditions in the economy doing the trick and so on, has not worked. It is time we recognised that it has not done the trick and that if we keep plodding on in the same old way, we will get the same results.  If anything, it will be more difficult when the Single Market comes into operation.</P>
    <P>New ideas, plans, schemes and industries are necessary.  What are the private sector doing about this?  Are they busily tackling the problem and saying that they have a responsibility to the unemployed? I do not see any sign of it.  They will set up a capital-intensive industry if they get a grant from CTT or somewhere else to enable them to make a big profit but, with very few exceptions, they do not have the degree of commitment required to keep our level of employment at least in line with EC average standards.  We could achieve that.  I do not see why our average in relation to these figures should be less than that of the EC.  It is true that there are advantages and disadvantages in relation to business in this country but other small countries in the EC do much better and they do not have better natural resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> One is drawn to the inevitable conclusion that it just is not enough to sit in your armchair and say that inflation and the balance of payments are satisfactory, that there is no need to worry because something will turn up.  We have been waiting for years but it has not turned up. There is no point in waiting for it, we must use our natural resources and plough them into State and semi-State companies.  They take the needs of the people into consideration and are not just interested in making a profit.  I do not decry the incentive of profit, I know it is a very important factor but it is not the be-all and end-all either.  We have a national responsibility to 250,000 people walking our streets, which is an outrage. Members of this House should be seething about the crisis but that is not happening. The Taoiseach and Government Ministers should be in a frenzy about the problems but they are not.  Their solution is to refer to the balance of payments and inflation and to tell us to calm down because there is no crisis.  As long as that approach prevails we will go on the way we have been doing and top the league of the unemployment percentages in the EC and the OECD countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that the advent of the Single Market will not present an automatic bonanza.  How right he is: that is the understatement of the decade.  It presents a tremendous threat to many of our surviving industries and I am not satisfied that enough has been or is being done to meet that challenge.  If we do not get cracking on this and if we let events slip by, many of our industries which up to now have survived periods of tremendous struggle may very well go under in 1993 and 1994.  This matter should be treated as a crisis but it is not.</P>
    <P>We need the integrity of our products, particularly our base products.  The meat industry has faced some problems recently and the name of Irish meat abroad must, inevitably, have taken a very severe blow.  We must apply our minds to that because there is no point pretending it has not happened.  That is the way things are in the field of commerce: the word goes out and spreads; a <Col N="841" /> good name on a product is very difficult to build up, it takes a long time and tremendous work and dedication. However, when things go wrong, what you have built up over a number of years comes down very quickly.  It is important that Córas Tráchtála apply their minds to that issue and deal with it accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that protectionism is inward looking and that we must cast it aside.  That is a very admirable concept and it may well work if everybody follows the rules.  Are our fellow members of the EC, for example, following the rules and preserving and maintaining the open economy they are supposed to provide under the Treaty of Rome?  Far from it, and that is not just my opinion.  I should like Members of the House to look at a very detailed, exhaustive report on this question prepared by the Council of Europe which showed that throughout the member states and further afield subtle protectionism is rampant.  The Council examined the different subtle, clever methods of protectionism that are used.  They identified upwards of 100 different methods under which protectionist embargoes are set up, clever ways within the system such as nominating conditions of packaging, ports of entry and the basis on which checks are carried out.  Long delays and bureaucracy were built up within the system.  If I remember rightly, France and Italy were singled out as being among the worst offenders in this regard.  We are the good boys on this issue.  We play the game, but maybe that is not so clever when others are not playing cricket within the system. We have suffered in that regard and will continue to suffer if we do not avail of the powers and the ministerial meeting to put this matter firmly on the table. This activity is costing the country jobs. It is not taking place at a low level but is widespread.</P>
    <P>I hope the new joint venture that will be set up will work strongly, will be innovative and will do more than merely carry on the process that has been carried on before.  Good though it was it has proven to be inadequate.  I hope the company will come up with new ideas, identify <Col N="842" /> appropriate areas for import substitution and ensure that private sector, public sector or semi-State companies are set up to avail of the opportunities that exist. They should take initiatives and ensure that new products are manufactured in Ireland that heretofore have been the preserve of other countries.</P>
    <P>I wish the new board well.  I hope they will be given every support and encouragement by the Government and the Minister to enable them to fulfil their important task and role in facing the challenge of the Single Market.  I appeal to them to come up with new material.  The old principles have been acceptable up to a point but they have gone no way towards meeting employment needs. Something new is required here and I hope and believe the new company will come up with it.</P>

      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Taylor has said.  We have the opportunity in this Bill to review industrial performance generally, especially in recent years and especially in the context of the appalling levels of unemployment which currently exist. However, I take the view that perhaps that can be more appropriately done during the Estimates debate starting tomorrow morning.</P>

      <P>The wider debate on <Col N="843" /> unemployment and the state of the country's finances are probably more appropriate to the debate starting tomorrow.</P>
      <P>As regards the Bill before the House, the Minister in his introductory address referred to the fact that it is &ldquo;the latest in a series of significant developments which have taken place since 1987 in the restructuring of State agencies involved in the industrial development and promotion area&rdquo;.  I want to preface my remarks by saying that I take a different view of that.  It is another example of the <i>ad hoc</i> planning by this Government in the industrial area.  It is especially regrettable, after a consensus has been reached some considerable time ago in this House about the inadequacy of our industrial performance, the ineffectiveness of our industrial policy and the fact that we do not get value for the vast amount of money spent on industrial policy, that we have not been afforded the opportunity of an overall comprehensive debate on industrial performance, hopefully leading to certain suggestions and remedies which may indeed include institutional reform.</P>
      <P>I accept that some institutional reform and some rationalisation of State agencies may be necessary, but it is regrettable that we have found ourselves from time to time here debating whether it is wise that NATCORP should be incorporated into the IDA, whether the Irish Goods Council should be incorporated into Córas Tráchtála, whether various agencies should be taken under the umbrella of FAS, whether we should extend the special tax regime for the manufacturing sector, and a number of other measures which the Minister has said have been prompted by the latest review of industrial performance.</P>

      <P>Following a meeting of the Whips this morning it is proposed to withdraw item No. 6 on today's Order <Col N="844" /> Paper, to be replaced by a substitute motion on a supplementary Order Paper. It is proposed that this motion shall be decided without debate.  The motion on the supplementary Order Paper has been circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My party do not agree with the attempt by the Government to deal with the Estimates of expenditure <i>en bloc</i> in one debate.  I say this for constitutional and legal reasons.  A case was taken in the High Court &mdash; Michael Ahern v. Kerry County as a result of an attempt by Kerry County Council to adopt their Estimates <i>en bloc.</i> The High Court found on 26 May 1987 that in attempting to adopt Estimates of expenditure in that way Kerry County Council had acted illegally.  I contend that if the Dáil attempts to adopt its Estimates in this way, Dáil Éireann will be acting illegally under the same principle.</P>
      <P>Article 17 of the Constitution is very clear.  It states that Dáil Éireann shall be presented with the Estimates of expenditure for consideration as soon as possible after they have been published. These Estimates were published seven months ago but they are only being presented to the Dáil for consideration tomorrow.  Far from the Government abiding by the provisions of the Constitution which refers to the Estimates being presented as soon as possible, these Estimates are being presented as late as possible because under the provisions of the Central Fund Act the Government would be unable to spend money during the summer recess without the Estimates having been adopted and voted upon here.</P>
      <P>What is happening here is in direct conflict with the law of the land and the Constitution.  Is there any residents' association, county council, or football club that would allow their proposals for expenditure for the year, for instance, a proposal for a building by a football club, to be approved and put through under a guillotine debate without having the opportunity to query individual elements in the project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates, which amount to £6.6 <Col N="845" /> billion, are contained in 44 separate Votes under approximately 700 different subheadings of expenditure, all of which have to be paid for by the taxpayer.  Dáil Éireann and its Members are not to be allowed to query either the 44 individual Votes or the 700 subheadings within those Votes.  Instead, we are being asked to agree to a long, rambling and diffuse debate with a series of speeches, none of which relate directly to any individual Estimate.  There will be no opportunity afforded to Members to query individual Estimates of expenditure in any way.</P>
    <P>I contend that no parliament in Europe would allow the adoption of such a procedure. In virtually every other parliament in the world there exists a proper committee system and when estimates for expenditure are published they are considered in detail in committee.  That position applies to the Houses of Congress in the United States, to which the Taoiseach referred, and to all parliaments in Europe, including the House of Commons in Britain.  Other parliaments have a committee system under which individual estimates are examined in detail and a proper discussion takes place between ministers and members with a view to agreeing or otherwise to the expenditure.</P>
    <P>However, we are not to be allowed to consider the Estimates in detail.  We are being asked to approve the expenditure of £6.8 billion worth of the taxpayers money in a few hours next week without there being any individual inquiry.  We are being asked to approve that money, at a rate which equates to about £7 million to £8 million per minute.  Essentially, we are allowing the House to be turned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I please conclude my remarks?  I wish to make two points. First, there is nothing in Standing Orders which states that in respect of a proposal to take a motion without debate the discussion on that motion be confined to one speaker from each party.  I have searched Standing Orders and I have found no provision there to prevent the other 54 <Col N="848" /> Members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party from contributing on this subject, and I wish to indicate that they will be contributing on the subject.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I wish to state that if the Government proceed with this proposal for a debate on the Estimates that does not allow scrutiny of individual Estimates the Fine Gael Party will take no part in that debate.  That is the only course open to us to indicate our complete opposition to this procedure.  I remind Members on the Government side that since I became a Member of this House I have sought to bring about Dáil reform.  Fine Gael have made proposals to avoid the position we now face.  We have suggested the establishment of a proper committee system under which Estimates would be examined in committee.  I should hope that other Opposition parties, whose interests are being trampled upon in the same way as are the interests of Fine Gael Deputies and, indeed, the interests of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat backbench Deputies, will not allow the guillotine method to be used to prevent proper parliamentary debate.  I appeal to the Labour Party, who have an honourable record in this regard, and to The Workers' Party, who have an equally honourable record, to support Fine Gael's opposition to this attempted guillotine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked on the Order of Business this morning that the motion, item 6 on today's Order Paper, be deferred to allow time for the Whips to meet to see if we could work out an agreed programme for dealing in a rational way with the Estimates.  We met for more than an hour and, at the specific request of Fine Gael, we sought extra time to debate the Estimates.  That was a reasonable request because Fine Gael have 55 Deputies and most of them would like to contribute to that discussion.  It was my view and the view of the Labour Party that we should deal in a holistic way with the Estimates this year rather than having spokespersons confined to one narrow Government activity, because of the major problems now in terms of Revenue collection and over-run of budget targets.  That was the proposal I put and that was accepted by the Government Chief Whip.  It is a much more rational way of dealing with the Estimates to allow the implications of the over-run to be dealt with by spokespersons dealing with the Departments one at a time or across Departments if <Col N="851" /> they so desire.  We were not unanimous but we managed to increase the amount of debating time from the proposal this morning of 11 hours to 22½ hours.  I understand from the comments of the Fine Gael Party that they will not be taking up their time, but presumably the other parties in the House will then have more time to debate the Estimates this year.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the extra time agreed with the Government for the European debate which is extended by an hour and a half and the agreement to include parties not covered under Standing Orders as groups, so that Deputies from this side of the House who are not covered under Standing Orders will be entitled to make a contribution at that time.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the view that we need to deal with Estimates in a different way.  The sub-committee on Dáil reform of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have already begun to deal with that issue, on which a very useful contribution has been made by Deputy Bruton.  He suggested a question and answer-type discussion, but unfortunately that will not happen on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The further suggestion today that an Estimates Committee be established in advance of the debate here is a very worthwhile one also.  In view of the decision of the Government to more than double the allocation of time for the Estimates and the concession by the Government in accepting the proposal to discuss the Estimates in a holistic way so that we can deal with the problems in the economy now, the overshot in expenditure and the shortfall in income from the Revenue side, the Labour Party will not be opposing the order.</P>

      <P>I think the chickens are coming home to roost for many Deputies who were very prominent in catcalling across the Floor here to me in regard to the dual mandate.  It is interesting how many Deputies on all sides of this House now have a dual mandate and I am delighted it has become so popular. However, I do not think it should be allowed to interfere with the business of this House.  The arrangement now arrived at of doubling the time available for the Estimates is a welcome change in the proposal that was presented to us here this morning.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies I am not at all satisfied that we deal adequately with the Estimates in this House.  I do not think it is proper that Estimates should be dealt with on the basis of a Deputy standing up in this House for five or ten minutes and trying to express a view about what should or should not be in the Estimates or how they should be increased or decreased and so on.  I do not accept either that it is entirely proper that the Estimates in total should be passed through this House on the basis of a single vote.  At the same time I do not accept that this Dáil is constrained by the law in this matter, because the Constitution does not specify that the Estimates have to be dealt with individually.  We must find a more rational way of dealing with the business of this House.  We will not do it this week.  Calls have been made by all parties for a committee system and it is something that should be addressed, during the summer recess perhaps, with a view to producing something for this House by the time the next budget comes around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an entirely satisfactory situation but I do believe we have stretched the times sufficiently to enable Deputies <Col N="853" /> to make an adequate contribution to the debate over the next five days.  I do believe we should get on with our business. There are other important matters to be dealt with here today.  However, I would appeal to Government to produce the programme of Dáil reform which was promised here two years ago so that we can seriously deal with the very many questions and avoid the practice of rushing through legislation and Estimates at the last minute.</P>

      <P>The details of proposed reclassifications being discussed now with the EC Commission are confidential between Ireland and the Commission at present.</P>
      <P>I can disclose, however, that we are proposing the reclassification of 114,000 hectares of mountain sheep grazing land as less severely handicapped and 530,000 hectares of less severely handicapped areas as more severely handicapped. These proposals will increase the extent of the more severely handicapped areas by 15 per cent and the benefits available to farmers in the areas affected by over £10 million per year.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give me an indication of the percentage of the total that these figures represent?  Will <Col N="864" /> the reclassification of the 114,000 hectares of mountain sheep grazing lands which the Minister referred to cover all the sheep grazing land in the country?  If not, what percentage is it of the total area?  Likewise, will all the less severely handicapped areas be reclassified?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my priority is to get the maximum benefit from the extension and reclassification of areas.  I can confirm to the Deputy that all the mountain sheep grazing land which previously only qualified for certain grants for sheep headage has been proposed for reclassification as less severely handicapped and will get all the benefits that apply to less severely handicapped areas.  The Deputy will see that the proposal to reclassify less severely handicapped areas as more severely handicapped areas will have a very considerable impact and will increase the extent of the more severely handicapped areas by 15 per cent and will have the consequences I have just mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent marketing report by the National Food Centre of Teagasc where reference is made to quality aspects and supply of food products to the catering industry.</P>
      <P>The sourcing of supplies, whether within or outside the State, is of course primarily a matter for the purchaser.  My Department are in close and frequent contact with the industry in the context of my concern that adequate supplies of home-grown quality products should be available to the Irish consumer.</P>
      <P>As regards vegetables, quality standards are laid down by EC regulations and in the case of potatoes by national regulations.  Inspections are carried out by officers of my Department at all stages of the marketing chain to ensure that the statutory standards are being observed. In addition, An Bord Glas is playing a key role in improving the supply of quality vegetables for the market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply does not really answer the question I asked. This survey was a grave indictment of the potato industry and, while the findings of the survey may not be correct, I would like to hear the Minister's views on the matter.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a problem with the handling and storage of potatoes.  I am aware that some people store potatoes in the proper fashion but apparently in the latter part of the season the potatoes are of inferior quality because of incorrect handling and storage.  I have seen that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has said that the survey was not a true reflection of the situation.  I would like to believe that to be true; but it must be alarming that people in the catering trade regard the quality of our vegetables, particularly our potatoes, to be substandard late in the season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This was quite a limited survey and, while we are not questioning <Col N="866" /> the accuracy of it, it does not in my view give us a true picture of the actual position in the potato sector.  The Deputy knows that since we established An Bord Glas as an interim board in March 1987, and subsequently as a statutory board, the potato sector has been one of their prime target areas.  In the interests of making the necessary progress in that sector we have agreed with the IFA to the appointment on a joint basis of a market co-ordinator and I can tell the House that he has been doing an excellent job since his appointment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, has succeeded in getting the producer group regulation extended to cover potatoes. The announcement of the first producer group formation is imminent.  Preliminary preparatory work is going on in other parts of the country for the establishment of subsequent producer groups. In addition we have secured grant aid under the operational programme for rural development for the building of proper environmentally controlled potato stores.  I think Deputy Deasy is quite right to focus on that area, that at the end of the season the quality of our potatoes tend to deteriorate primarily because of the inadequacy of the storage facilities.  An Bord Glas identified this as one of the problem areas in their programme for development in 1988.  I can assure the Deputy that considerable progress is being made in that regard.  As a result of the introduction of the new scheme for the potato sector we have received all of 200 applications, which are presently being processed in the Department.  We are very anxious to see investment both in storage and ancillary equipment, which is so necessary to effect the structural changes within the potato industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely our objective should be to identify and expose those people who are supplying substandard potatoes to the market place?  I would have thought that the provisions of the Bill, which provide for the registration of growers, would make the identification <Col N="867" /> of these people quite simple.  Is that legislation in operation?  Why can the people who supply substandard produce not be identified and penalised for selling substandard produce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that that area is being pursued, but at the end of the day market forces will sort out the producers who are producing the substandard produce from those producing proper material.</P>
      <P>The reality of the market place is that if those in the catering industry or those who are purchasing for supermarket outlets cannot secure quality products at home they will simply turn to imports. There is a realisation among the primary producers that that will happen if they do not produce what is required.  We are making steady but slow progress in effecting the changes that we wish to effect. The measures which will effect a change over a short number of years are in place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Agreement on EC's farm prices package was reached on 24 May on the basis of a compromise proposal tabled by the Luxembourg Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the details have already been publicised, I propose to include an outline of the original Commission proposals and the outcome of the negotiations for those sectors of major interest to Ireland in a <Col N="868" /> tabular statement which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The package as finally adopted by the Council represents a significant improvement compared with that which the Commission had originally proposed.  The initial Commission proposals could have led to a fall of £160 million in aggregate farm income in a full year.  Under the revised package agreed by the Council in May the impact on incomes &mdash; even in a worst case scenario &mdash; should not exceed half that of the original proposals. However, the precise impact on producer incomes will be largely dependent on market developments and the extent to which intervention as an outlet is relied upon.  In addition, to the extent that production becomes more market-led and quality oriented, for instance through the new CBF beef quality scheme, the impact on the sectors will be reduced.</P>
    <P>In the light of present budgetary and market circumstances, and given the recent major increases in intervention stock levels for beef, butter and cereals, this year's prices agreement is the best that could realistically have been achieved from Ireland's point of view.  This is especially evident bearing in mind that certain Ministers would readily have supported measures which went even further than those proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the arrangements decided upon will effectively underpin producer incomes pending the adoption of the forthcoming CAP reform.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that his only purpose in the Commission is to engage in what he himself has described as a damage limitation exercise, that the economic future of our farmers is now totally determined by Brussels and the European Commission and that his influence has declined to such a degree that farmers have suffered a 60 per cent reduction in income since 1983?

      <P>The Deputy would like to give that over-simplistic interpretation but, happily, the people are too intelligent to be misled by it.  Were it not for my influence the Commission's original proposals would have been adopted in that form.  So much for my influence in the Council.  The world is different from the time of some of my predecessors in the mid-seventies, notably a Minister from the Deputy's party, when price increases could be obtained for the asking.  There were what were known as the Lardenois goodybags to be filled up with what people asked for.  The current problems arise because there was not a sensible policy in those days and unwarranted price increases were given.  This has resulted in surpluses. The job of Minister for Agriculture and Food these days is to minimise the level of price reduction.  I have done that very successfully.</P>

There is no point in Deputy Kavanagh giving the impression that we can produce limitlessly for intervention produce that nobody wants to eat.  That is an outrageous impression.  Under CBF market quality schemes and otherwise, we have reached premium market outlets.  This is the best guarantee for the producer. Obviously, we will ensure that we get protection under the safety net proposals in relation to beef and butter which I have put in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 2 (3) of Directive 75/268 allows up to 1½ per cent of the agricultural area of a member state to be designated by the shorter route of Commission procedure rather than the longer road of reference to the EC Council of Ministers.  Any increase in this percentage would require amendment of the basic directive and the agreement of other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to add that the benefits of Article 2 (3) are merely procedural in the sense that member states are in no way <Col N="872" /> relieved of the obligation to satisfy the Commission of the technical merits of their case for designation of additional new areas.  The Article in question does not confer an automatic right on member states to an addition to their disadvantaged areas up to a limit of 1½ per cent.  Neither does it prevent member states from seeking a greater percentage increase, where that can be justified.  In that case, however, any such increase would require the approval of the EC Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that this is the first time an appeals procedure in this area has been set up here. The extension now proposed by the Commission at my request is the biggest such extension ever to take place here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy should be familiar with the regulations.  Unlike the very small extension which took place during his period in office when there was no appeal, I have provided for an appeal for those left out, despite the fact that so many more people are included.  The increase this time is from 58 per cent to 72 per cent.  The survey conducted last time was only one in four but I am providing for a 100 per cent appeal survey of all the areas applying.  The Deputy must know that Directive 75/268 confines to 1.5 per cent the area which may be designated without consultation with the Commission.  There is no legal right to go beyond that.  If it emerges that we go beyond that figure as a result of the appeals, we will have to go back to the Council to seek a further extension on the already huge extension we have provided in County Waterford, County Offaly and many other counties which were ignored the last time.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the five members of this appeals board has been going around the country to large meetings of farmers, claiming that he and the other members of the board will add on as much as 7 or 8 per cent to the present submission, if required.  I have stated that the regulation allows for only 1.5 per cent, as the Minister has confirmed, yet a member of this appeals board has said he will be demanding as much as 7 or 8 per cent in addition and that if he does not get it he will resign from the board.  Is the Minister aware of that?  If so, what is his reaction?</P>

      <P>I am not so aware. Obviously, members of the appeals board who are independent can say what they wish and I am not responsible.  If the decision they take involves more than 1.5 per cent of the territory, then of course it is open to us to go back through the normal procedures to the Council to resubmit applications in respect of those areas over and above the 1.5 per cent.  If they determine 5 per cent or 6 per cent I will then renew through the Council, as the Deputy knows must be done, an extension application further to what we have already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 9, 13 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Commission is expected to consider proposals on the adjustment of the Common Agricultural Policy at its <Col N="875" /> meeting on 10 July.  If adopted, the proposals will be presented to the Agriculture Council at its meeting on 15-16 July.  Negotiations on the proposals are likely to continue through much of the second half of the year.  Until the detail of the proposals is available the implications for Irish agriculture and for the Irish economy cannot, of course, be accurately assessed.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of the Commission's approach has of course been known for some time.  This involves price reductions in many sectors together with some restriction on output and a significant package of structural measures.  The other element in the proposals would be a series of compensatory measures, biased in favour of small to medium sized producers.</P>
    <P>When this general orientation of the Commission's thinking on CAP reform was given at the January and February Councils, I set out the Irish position clearly and unambiguously.  In particular I stressed that any adjustments to existing market mechanisms must be limited to what is strictly warranted by market or budgetary requirements and that the revised policy must continue to respect the provisions of Article 39 of the Rome Treaty which lays down the principles on which the CAP is funded, respect Ireland's vital agricultural interests and afford the fullest safeguards for the future of all categories of family farmers.</P>
    <P>An essential point for me will be the provision of adequate Community-funded compensation for producers and regions adversely affected by support reductions flowing from the CAP reorientation. I have left nobody in any doubt about my commitment to this vital element and I can assure Deputies that I shall be vigorously promoting this stance throughout the forthcoming reform negotiations.</P>
    <P>As I explained during Question Time in this House in April, the Government will be giving the most detailed consideration to the reform proposals that emerge from the Commission.  This will include close and ongoing consultations <Col N="876" /> with the various organisations on the approach to be adopted throughout the negotiations as provided in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Such consultations will &mdash; again in line with the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; involve the presentation of an assessment of the consequences of the reform proposals for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The matter of CAP reform has already been debated in both Dáil and Seanad and a further opportunity is being provided by the Government for an exchange of views in the Dáil on 10 July, that is next week.  Against this background I do not believe that the production of a White Paper on CAP reform is warranted now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us an estimate of what the proposals will cost this country if implemented in full? The figures which came out of Brussels last week were quite specific so surely the economists in the Department of Agriculture and Food should be able to give us a figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The economists in the Department of Agriculture and Food have been assessing the impact, but I think the Deputy will appreciate that until we get clear, more detailed indications, which will be within the next week, it would be foolish to anticipate the actual cost.  We will get information next week which will put us in a better position.  I am nor sure, Sir, that when I address the House on Wednesday morning that even by then I will have that information because the Commission will be meeting on Wednesday.  They have not themselves yet confirmed these proposals. As soon as we have final confirmation from the Commission of course we will put a full assessment.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that it would be entirely premature now to speculate on <Col N="877" /> what the cost will be until we know the full details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, who have responsibility for awarding the ISO 9000 quality managements standard, that to date 247 firms have been accredited with this standard and that 118 applications are pending. During the past 18 months there has been an increasing interest in ISO 9000 by the food processing sector where 31 firms have been accredited and 20 applications are pending.  As well as that, 70 food firms have the Irish Quality Association &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark symbol.  As regards the beef sector there are already in existence strict requirements under the Abattoirs Act, 1988 and EC legislation for the inspection of all meat intended for human consumption. In addition, I am glad to say that only last week the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, launched a new comprehensive quality assurance scheme introduced by CBF for the best of Irish beef; this will involve all engaged in the industry from the farmer right through to the retail end of the food chain.  I am confident that this scheme will be of great value to the beef industry in their preparation for the EC market of 1992 and beyond.  I would hope that in addition firms in the beef industry would now also seek and obtain the ISO 9000 standard.</P>

Even at this late stage would the Minister reconsider his decision, because they are entitled to representation? He gave the impression, in his reply to Deputy Mac Giolla's first supplementary question, that he almost did not want a proliferation of farm organisations.  I would point out that there are at least three in Holland, at least seven in France and probably many more in Italy, representing all strands of the agricultural industry.

      <P>I heard the Minister state that both gentlemen on the appeals board are not necessarily representative of their organisations.  Surely the Minister is aware of the reality on the ground in relation to both those senior members of those organisations.  In various meetings which have been called in relation to the appeals they are the major spokespersons on behalf of the organisations who called the meeting.  So I think what the Minister is saying is rather deceptive.  If the Minister is talking about serious talks with the United Farmers Association the one way of retrieving the imbalance that exists is to ensure that the United Farmers Association are represented on the appeals board also.</P>

      <P>The functions of CBF under the Córas Beostoic and Feola Acts, 1979 and 1988, vest in CBF responsibility for the promotion of exports of cattle and beef, amongst other livestock products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, 1990 was a particularly difficult year for markets in the Middle and Far East because of the Gulf War and concerns regarding BSE. In recognition of the difficult market situation I secured Government approval <Col N="888" /> for the allocation of an additional £0.25 million to CBF in 1990, and my Department monitored the market situation closely with CBF.</P>
    <P>During this period, together with officials of my Department, I met with various third country delegations in an effort to improve the overall trading conditions under which the meat industry operate in these markets.  CBF and producers drew up a five year development plan in consultation with the industry for an intensive marketing effort.  As a measure of support for that plan the Exchequer grant-in-aid to CBF was increased this year to £1.5 million on condition that the meat industry provide similar levels of funding on a voluntary basis.  CBF will also receive funding under the EC Structural Funds for specific marketing projects.</P>
    <P>While increased penetration of EC markets for value added products must be the major target, I am happy that CBF are also maintaining a close watch on markets in the Middle and Far East so that Irish exporters will be in a good position to exploit export opportunities as they arise.  Adherence by the trade to the conditions of the new CBF beef quality scheme will be an important factor in improving the overall prospects for our exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am glad to say that cattle are being exported to Yemen and Turkey, markets which were closed to us because of the BSE outbreak in Britain.  The Deputy will appreciate that the very mention of this publicly in the House can cause reaction.  I am glad to say that tenders have been invited by Libya &mdash; admittedly in small quantities &mdash; for beef from Ireland.  After recent discussions with the Organisation for International Veterinary Medicine, it has become clear that any impression of there being a taint on our product because of the BSE outbreak in Britain is erroneously founded.  I hope that, very shortly, the chief veterinary surgeons in <Col N="889" /> Libya and Iran will be able to publicly and formally tell their Government that there is no reason for limiting our live cattle exports to those countries.</P>

I have attended new marketing promotions of CBF in parts of Europe which were not penetrated previously and I will be doing that again very shortly.  I am glad to tell the House that a senior statesman &mdash; if you might call him that &mdash; in the cattle industry, not unrelated to the leader of the Deputy's party, acknowledged that this promotion is the most exciting thing which has happened in the beef industry since it started.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the circumstances which inhibited our exports, namely, the BSE outbreak in Britain, the Iran-Iaq war, consumer reaction against beef and bad habits, all damaged our beef industry.  Some matters are within our own control and quality is certainly one of them.  Outbreaks of war in other parts of the world are not.  I am satisfied that CBF are undertaking a <Col N="891" /> major, dynamic promotion to ensure that only the best will come from the Irish beef sector.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the action the Government have taken at European Community level to prevent the dumping of masses of cheap poor quality farm produce from East Germany and from other East European countries which has had disastrous consequences for the Irish farming industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The consequences for the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy of the economic reform process currently under way in the countries of East Europe are kept under constant review by both the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  The Community believes that the development of agriculture and the food industry has an important part to play in supporting the political and economic developments in those countries and assisting the transition from command to market economies.</P>
      <P>Under various international agreements and conventions the Community accepts imports &mdash; including agricultural products &mdash; under strict controls of quotas, duties and levies.  In the event of any threat from such imports to a commodity market in the Community, safeguard measures are operated.  This was the case recently when imports of calves from Poland were suspended.  We have sought and obtained from the German Government assurances on the strict monitoring of imports from third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to avoid undue disruption to the markets of other member states, arising from unification, the German Government have introduced national subsidies to ensure the export of surplus <Col N="892" /> agricultural products &mdash; principally sheepmeat and beef &mdash; from the five new Lander to their traditional markets in Eastern Europe, particularly the USSR. Also, the milk quota allocated to the new Lander has been set at a level substantially below previous production levels.</P>
    <P>While I accept that agricultural imports from Eastern Europe have contributed to the difficult market conditions in a number of sectors, they are not the only cause.  Increased production and falling demand as well as animal health problems and the outfall from the Gulf crisis have all played a part in the Community's market difficulties.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue, at the Council of Ministers, to monitor the impact of concessionary imports and to ensure the safety of our markets within the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say how a land area larger than the size of this county could be allowed into the Community without the negotiations which took place when we were applying for entry?  The Minister said that additional imports from these areas did not have an effect but he should know that it had a devastating effect, not just in this country but on the Continent of Europe itself.  As that is our main market it must have knock-on effects for this country.  I am not aware of any protest by the Minister in regard to the flooding of West Germany with East German products in the period since August 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the reunification of Germany when he says that a land area bigger than Ireland was allowed into the European Community without having to go through the process of application.  It is strange that a socialist Member of the House seems to reject the fact that Germany is reunited in democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Labour Party <Col N="893" /> saying there should not have been support for that?  As the Deputy must know, the political unification of Germany was decided at political level in Germany and within the European Community, not at the Agriculture Council.  I have consistently stressed that while welcoming those political developments the producers of Europe, particularly in our own country, should not have to pay the price for them.  For that reason I am glad to tell the Deputy that I have consistently pressed for and have received assurances that the budget adjustments that are required to incorporate what was formally the German Democratic Republic into the European Community will be made.  As I have mentioned in my reply, I have made it very clear both on a recent visit to East Germany and in the course of constant discussions with the Commission and the Council that we want the strictest possible monitoring to ensure that there will not be penetration in the European Community by the back door through East Germany and the German authorities have given me that assurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what specific steps he has taken and what assurances he has been given at EC level to ensure that benefits which would normally accrue to members of the EC under the Common Agricultural Policy will not be dissipated in any way and that we will not suffer as a consequence of German unification?  What commitments has the Minister been given that benefits will not flow from Irish agriculture to East Germany under the Common Agricultural Policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly within a community benefits never flow from one part of the community to another.  The Deputy understands how a community operates.  He asked if specific commitments have been given that benefits will not flow to East Germany at our expense.  If the French or Belgians had sought that commitment when we joined it would never have been possible to expand the European Community.</P>

The monitoring and control is very strict and is subject to very specific levies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As to why something was done at a certain time, maybe that demonstrates the constant lobbying and pressure that I and some colleagues applied at the Council to ensure that those protections were put in place.  As to why the decision was not made earlier, I cannot give the Deputy a full and satisfactory answer; but I am satisfied that the case we made has been fully recognised.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the Government are reluctant to have the country classified as 100 per cent disadvantaged for cattle headage payment purposes in view of the proposals announced last week on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy by EC Commissioner MacSharry.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I considered it possible to have the entire country classified as disadvantaged, I would put such a proposal to the EC tomorrow morning.  It is not, however, possible now, nor was it possible at the time of the last application in 1985 when in fact a much smaller portion of Ireland was classified as disadvantaged than the area in respect of which I secured EC Commission agreement this year.</P>
      <P>Given that one of the criteria for classification agreed with the EC Commission in 1985 and still binding on me today is that the family farm income per farm worker in any area proposed for classification cannot exceed 80 per cent of the national average family farm income, the entire country could not be so classified &mdash; the farm income for the entire country obviously cannot be less than 80 per cent of the national average.</P>
      <P>When, as I expect, the Community Ministers adopt that Commission proposal in the fairly near future, 72 per cent of the country will be classified as disadvantaged as a result of my efforts.  I have set up a representative appeals panel to see whether other areas can be classified on foot of appeals.  I consider this is as much as can be done on the classification front at present.</P>

I was entitled to ask a final supplementary on No. 12, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to do so.  How could the Minister allow 9,000 farms of 4,000 hectares to be included in the Community irrespective of the background to the decision?  Why has the product from those farms been allowed onto the Community market without, as far as we can read &mdash; all we can do is read about the Minister's adventures in Europe &mdash; any commitment being given that the Irish farming community would not suffer from that extension in the same way as <Col N="897" /> they have been suffering from so many other blows from Europe.

The Agriculture Council and I in particular have pressed for extra funds to ensure that the costs of integrating the former GDR into the Common Agricultural Policy would be adequate, and that is under way.  We have also requested protection to ensure that uncontrolled imports do not come in from third countries.

      <P>I intended no offence to the Chair in reading out the answer to Question No. 14, slowly and deliberately as I did, and I shall answer the question again:</P>
      <P>If I considered it possible to have the entire country classified as disadvantaged, I would put such a proposal to the EC tomorrow morning.  It is not, however, possible now, nor was it possible at the time of the last application in 1985, when in fact a much smaller portion of Ireland was classified as disadvantaged than the area in respect of which I secured EC Commission agreement this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> Given that one of the critria for classification agreed with the EC Commission in 1985 and still binding on me today is that the family farm income per farm worker in any area proposed for classification cannot exceed 80 per cent of the national average family farm income, the entire country could not be so classified &mdash; the farm income for the entire country obviously cannot be less than 80 per cent of the national average.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's reply he referred to the 1985 submission.  May I point out that the Minister, as Deputy O'Kennedy in those days, did not make any request for 100 per cent disadvantaged status for the country, nor did any of his colleagues or any of the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply quoted farm incomes and the criterion necessary to have a country classified as 100 per cent disadvantaged.  Is he aware that Luxembourg, which has a higher standard of living and better quality land than Ireland, is classified 100 per cent disadvantaged? Will the Minister in view of the collapse of farm prices and farm incomes, request that Ireland be granted the same status as Luxembourg, 100 per cent disadvantage?</P>

      <P>As far as Luxembourg is concerned, the Deputy is also ignoring a certain reality in that regard. When Luxembourg was designated 100 per cent disadvantaged, as the Deputy calls it, it was done on the basis of Luxembourg being part of the Benelux countries &mdash; Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.  It was because the Luxembourg average was less than 80 per cent of the Benelux average that Luxembourg came in under that classification. The Deputy must know that.</P>

However, I wish to tell Deputies that <Col N="901" /> that would take years to achieve.

I do not think any Member would want me to delay putting that measure in place.  When that is in place I will not be reluctant about asking the Commission throughout Europe &mdash; Greece, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal and so on &mdash; to change the regulations but I do not want to fool anyone, it will take at least two years before that is even contemplated.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to consider my question in the context of disadvantaged areas. In Ireland there are 170,000 commercial farmers and under the proposals being considered at EC level by Commissioner MacSharry it is envisaged that only 40,000 of them will survive as commercial farmers.  Therefore, availability of benefits under the disadvantaged areas will become more and more essential if we are serious as a country about maintaining numbers of people on the land.  Those benefits are no longer a perk, they are essential to survival for many farmers. Will the Minister, therefore, give a categoric assurance, which he has been asked for on numerous occasions in the House, that he will pursue at EC Commission level the removal of the 80 per cent income criterion?  We accept that that will take time, but it will eventually open the door for an extension of disadvantaged area status to the whole of the country.  Will the Minister initiate that process?</P>

It is not aimed primarily at official bodies such as local authorities, but rather at local groups interested in drawing up and implementing business plans for their own areas.

The whole programme will be lost in areas unless there is somebody to take the initiative.

The deadline for the submissions of plans to my Department was originally to be 15 July.  It is now proposed to extend that to 31 July, so they will have more time to get their plans together.  We cannot extend it beyond that because we have to make our submissions to the European Commission by 20 September.</P>

      <P>This is a pilot programme.  Those groups that are not initially in should not conclude that they will never be able to get involved in such a programme.

For us to get involved in that pilot programme the deadlines I have mentioned and have extended are the deadlines which will be used.  We are about to notify a considerable number of groups to be considered here for submission to the European Commission for grant assistance for the preparation of the plans.  At the end of the day only 12 groups or regions will be accepted by the Commission and therefore we have to try to integrate a lot of applicants who have applied independently of each other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had suggested that perhaps the Estimates debate starting tomorrow morning is the more appropriate place for a major review of industrial performance and of budgetary performance over the last six months rather than focusing on this Bill.  Nonetheless, I can understand how other Deputies could use the opportunity of the debate on this Bill to comment on the worsening unemployment and on the deterioration in the public finances.</P>
      <P>Any industrial legislation brought before the House cannot be enacted without focusing attention on drastic unemployment. In a recent reply to the Leader of The Workers Party, the Minister for Labour pointed out that from 1987 to 1990 40 per cent of all school leavers had either emigrated or had not found work. If that does not constitute a crisis, I do not know what does.  I can understand Deputies asking what contribution to tackling the unemployment crisis will this Bill make.  Will it change anything significantly?</P>
      <P>Having for some considerable time sought in this House time for a major comprehensive debate on industrial performance to discuss where we have gone wrong and where we are manifestly not getting value for money and why we are spending so much money without jobs coming on stream, I am disappointed that we failed to get such a debate; but yet from time to time we are asked to consider on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis legislation which is only a dimension of the total problem. We had the Companies Bill, the Competition Bill and the rationalisation of some of the agencies.  There is not an overall plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again we are asked to look at a Bill, the purpose of which is to merge the functions of two disparate agencies.  The Workers Party acknowledge that, as part of the overdue review of industrial performance, rationalisation of some of the State agencies in the area of industrial supports is perhaps inevitable and may even be desirable in some cases.  Institutional reform offers some part of the answer to why we have performed so badly as a country since independence <Col N="946" /> and, more drastically, since the end of the fifties when the outlook on industrial strategy changed so dramatically.  I regret that this rationalisation is proceeding on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis when what is required is an overall planned comprehensive reform of industrial strategy.</P>
    <P>In the case of this Bill I am not satisfied that what is taking place is a merger of the functions of the Irish Goods Council and CTT, nor am I convinced that in any event these are the two most compatible agencies to seek to merge.  The remit of the Irish Goods Council is completely to the remit of CTT.  They have separate and distinct functions.  I am not convinced about this.  What appears to be happening here is that we are enacting legislation for the abolition of the Irish Goods Council but not necessarily to merge the functions of the Irish Goods Council with CTT.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech drew our attention to the fact that the function of CTT is to promote, assist and develop the exportation of goods and services.  The Minister in his speech gave us an interesting lesson in industrial and economic history, albeit a fairly partisan assessment.  The Minister also said that the purpose of the Irish Goods Council was primarly to assist the sale and marketing of Irish goods and services in Ireland.  It is patently obvious that they are two completely different functions. Indeed, the Minister's statement that the primary function of the Irish Goods Council is to assist in the sale and marketing of Irish goods and services in Ireland is slightly different to the Irish Goods Council's understanding of what they are about.  If my memory serves me correctly, they promote themselves as being the body responsible &ldquo;for market development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the home market&rdquo;.  That is not quite the same as the Minister's assessment.  I would argue that the Irish Goods Council have performed relatively well in carrying out a function which is very badly needed in the case of small and medium-sized indigenous Irish companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> With regard to the history of industrial development which the Minister has given us, if I had written his script I would have put it slightly differently.  Nevertheless I think we would all agree that when the traditional, largely Britishbased old-fashioned companies collapsed at the end of the period of protectionism which had started in the thirties and gradually went out of business when their Irish plants closed down here for various reasons which we all know about, the big problem was that Irish companies did not step in to fill the gap.  Indigenous Irish industry was not capable of filling the gap created when the old traditional companies pulled out and the Irish-based plants of largely British, as they were then, companies closed down.  This led to large-scale unemployment and the Government changed their approach towards enticing multi-nationals into this country to provide badly needed employment for our people.  However, they never managed to tackle adequately the question of import substitution.  That focus of import substitution was good and was correctly identified in a number of reports at the time.  It is regrettable that Irish business was not able to fill the gap.</P>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council performed a useful role in identifying that gap in our industrial strategy and the necessity for import subsitution.  While there are many examples which show how they helped in doing something about this &mdash; Fiacla toothpaste, Irish cereals, etc., domestic products which are now available on the shelves of Irish shops&mdash;generally speaking, we performed lamentably.  That need is more glaringly evident than it ever was and there is now an even greater necessity for us to develop and improve the assistance offered to small and medium-sized enterprises by the Irish Goods Council.  I am greatly concerned that that strategy will be lost in the focus of the new Irish marketing board which, correctly, will be on winning new markets abroad for Irish companies and non-Irish companies which have roots in our economy.  This <Col N="948" /> will mean that the focus of import substitution about which I have spoken will be lost.</P>
    <P>Why should our starry-eyed welcome of the brave new world of the Single Market and free market conditions in that market involve the surrender of the home market to imports?  The theme running through the speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the Competition Bill and so on was compete or die, the implication being that somewhere out there there is an ideal pure form of competition and if we all engaged in pure competition we would inevitably have economic growth and, therefore, jobs.  I do not believe there is any such thing as pure competition in that form.  I believe competition is interfered with not only in Ireland but also in the new market which constitutes the trading entity of the European Community.  Why should we lie back and enjoy it when jobs are being lost on the domestic front, when Irish markets are being eaten into by greater and greater imports, and we have proven our inability to replace those imports through import substitution. That is a major area of concern to me and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to my points.</P>
    <P>In so far as I can read the Bill &mdash; as in the case of all Bills introduced this term, one would need to have an array of civil servants to advise one in terms of reading and studying it &mdash; section 6 seems to be the section which deals with the functions of the board.  I cannot find in section 6 any reference which satisfies me that the functions of the Irish Goods Council are being retained, nurtured and developed by the new Irish trade board.  Presumably the Minister will draw my attention to subsection (7) which provides that: &ldquo;An order under section 4 (1) (a) of the Export Promotion Act, 1959, as amended, by the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1983, in force immediately before the commencement of this section shall continue in force and shall be deemed to be an order made under this section&rdquo;. This seems to relate to Córas Tráchtála and not to the Irish Goods Council.  In regard to the other subsections of section <Col N="949" /> 6, I am not clear where expressly it is provided that the functions of the Irish Goods Council will be retained and developed.  This may well be provided for in a different section of the Bill and I would appreciate if the Minister would take time out to reassure me on this point.</P>
    <P>My party are not taking up the position of opposing the Bill for the sake of opposition. As I said, some element of rationalisation of agencies is both inevitable and desirable.  While they may not have been at the sexy end of industrial promotion, the Irish Goods Council, in a modest way, have made a contribution. Their purpose was to bring to a certain level of competence small and medium-sized Irish businesses, and that necessity is as glaring now as it ever was.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how anyone can argue, as apparently the Minister for Industry and Commerce does, that in this brave new world of the Single Market anyone who cannot succeed on the domestic market should be able to do so in Germany, France or Italy.  To lie back and to accept in a missionary position the ravages of companies originating in other parts of the European Community who gradually penetrate our domestic market is not a useful way in which to move forward.  It would seem that the more logical approach to adopt in tackling this phenomenon of indigenous companies progressively losing their share of the domestic market would be to focus on import substitution.  The functions of the Irish Goods Council could be best retained and developed in an arrangement with the small enterprises sector of the Industrial Development Authority.  The argument that because the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála happen to be housed in the one building a good case can be made for integrating them is hardly good enough.  It would seem that the purposes of the small enterprises sector of the Industrial Development Authority are closely allied to the purposes and main functions of the Irish Goods Council and that we should consider this possibility in examining the question of rationalisation.</P>
    <P>There is a definite need to continue <Col N="950" /> and improve the assistance given by the Irish Goods Council to small and medium-sized indigenous enterprises.  In this respect I would like to refer briefly to an article by Clare Cronin in the <i>Evening Press</i> of 28 May 1990 in which she reported the comments of the president of the Irish institute of Purchasing and Materials Management, Mr. Ryan.  She informed us that he had assured a group of small and medium-sized enterprise representatives that &ldquo;Major contracts are flowing out of this country daily&rdquo;, that his intention was constructive and that he had stressed that these were contracts which could be filled at home and filled by small and medium-sized enterprises. He was quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>Small and medium-sized enterprises must come together to form integrated and interactive production units capable of taking major contracts from international suppliers.  I am not suggesting the abandonment of one's individuality, but the need for &ldquo;turn-key&rdquo; supply is becoming more fashionable and economical to customers who wish to buy from the &ldquo;one-stop supplier&rdquo; or group of suppliers.  Some of the world's largest supply groups are formed through the co-operation of many small independent companies who believe that strength is in numbers.</P>
    <P>He based his talk on his belief that &ldquo;nothing should be imported into this country&rdquo;, which is an interesting notion and which, perhaps, is not very practical in absolute terms but nevertheless a good starting point.  He said:</P>
    <P>Our level of industrial imports is probably one of our greatest national scandals.  For every one manufacturing plant that is established in Ireland, there are five non-manufacturing units created.  Of that five, four are set up for the principal purpose of importing goods and services into this country.  I am also amazed at the cost and volume of components that are imported into this country, especially as the resources are available to manufacture many of <Col N="951" /> them here, at a lower cost and indeed at a much higher quality.</P>
    <P>Those comments should not cause the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have any sleepless nights, given that they were not made by any hardline ideological Worker's Party economist but rather by someone who comes from the Minister's end of the political spectrum. They amount to a savage indictment of our performance in that area and they are comments with which I agree.  Given that the Irish Goods Council are very much concerned about the matter, far from being abolished they ought to be developed and nurtured.</P>
    <P>The genral criticism which is common to all the reports we have seen during the past ten years, at least since the presentation of the Telesis report, is that our industrial policy has failed.  They identified the necessity to develop a strong indigenous sector.  As I said in another debate yesterday, I can never understand the reason, if a multinational company sneezes in Tokyo or New York and one of their Irish plants in one of our major provincial towns is shut down, the entire town catches a cold.  The reason is there is no alternative manufacturing base there. There is no significant indigenous sector because it has never been built up.  The multinationals for all their faults &mdash; and they have many, repatriation of profits being the major one &mdash; provide badly needed and well paid employment for more than 80,000 people.  When a Nixdorf pull out of Bray, a Travenol out of Castlebar or a Kingdom Tubes out of Tralee an employment backspot is created. It is a sorrowful comment on our performance during the past 60 years that we have not managed to provide any alternative indigenous industry worth talking about.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that in more recent times the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Development Authority have taken on board some of the recommendations made in the Telesis report and so on.  The days when a Minister could manipulate the <Col N="952" /> Industrial Development Authority and cause them to make announcements that an outlandish number of jobs would be created, jobs which were never realised, are finished.  Only during an election campaign is there the prospect, as one trade union leader put it, of a couple of hundred civil servants being handed out around the country like smarties, but this is small fry when compared to the manipulation which took place.  Therefore it is fair to say that there has been concentration on some of the weaknesses highlighted in recent times.  However, we ought to be careful, in seeking to become good Europeans and in rushing to embrace the Single Market, that we do not abandon entirely the home market.</P>
    <P>Let me refer in conclusion, as I am aware that Deputy Lowry wishes to contribute to the debate, to the 1988 report of the Irish Goods Council in which they outline their own view which, as I said, is slightly different to the view portrayed by the Minister.  I do not know what discussions have taken place behind the scenes but I notice that jobs will be protected.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I wish the Minister would tell us how many jobs are involved in the Irish Goods Council.  I do not know what the view of the chairman and board of the Irish Goods Council is but it is somewhat different, I would suggest, to the view advanced by the Minister.  I am talking here about a difference in emphasis rather than any misrepresentation of the situation.  In commenting on the Single European Market the Irish Goods Council had this to say:</P>
    <P>The challenge of 1992 must be met initially in the Irish market.  Ireland is the one European marketplace which can provide the base for carefully planned sales strategies aimed at the rest of Europe in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>In terms of a Europe of over 320 million consumers, the Irish market is a very small one and sustained growth can only be achieved in the long term by companies with an export orientation. But, for the immediate future, Ireland cannot be regarded as small</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> when Irish industry still supplies only 43 per cent of industrial and consumer requirements.</P>
    <P>The Irish market can realistically take up over £1.10 billion per annum in additional sales by Irish enterprise in industrial components and sub-supply, in food, groceries, clothing, furniture and household goods with minimum additional capital investment.</P>
    <P>That comment is as apposite today as when it was first put together in the 1988 report.  The position remains the same. It is important that we have regard to that comment and not lose sight of it in seeking industrial recovery.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, the Government have been let off very lightly by the Opposition on the question of unemployment.  It is a crisis.  We are hastening towards the recess once again and we still have an unemployment crisis.  The Government may believe correctly that the Opposition do not have the answer, but it is patently clear that the Government do not have the answer either.  Over the past three years 40 per cent of all school leavers have either emigrated or are unemployed. That is a terrible indictment of our inability as a small population to get our economic act together and to create sustainable jobs.  Many of the social problems we face and many of the problems we, the politicians, encountered at the doors during the recent local elections come back to the evil of unemployment. There are large areas in my own constituency where the level of unemployment is well in excess of 60 per cent. I do not think it is within the capacity of either Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation, who try less hard for reasons that are not pertinent to this debate, to lift those areas and to provide hope for the people in those areas unless we can provide employment.</P>
    <P>First, we must provide employment and we are not doing that.  We have a lamentable record and the situation is as bad as back in the bad old days of the fifties.  That is why we should focus the concerted energies of this House on the <Col N="954" /> question of our industrial performance and where we can make improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this very important legislation.  In particular I compliment him on the preparatory work that has gone into the legislation before it was initiated.  I am aware that the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála have been well briefed on the implications of this legislation.  This is a hallmark of the Minister's term of office.  Before he brought the Competition Bill to this House he organised various seminars throughout the country so that the sectors that would be affected by that legislation would be briefed on it.  I compliment him sincerely on that work.</P>
      <P>The amalgamation of the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála into a single marketing board offers real potential to provide a more streamlined, efficient and effective service for expanding existing businesses and creating new jobs.  The nature of enterprise is to balance risk and opportunity.  There is scope for new business in the Irish market worth over $1.2 billion a year.  This figure does not represent imports or even competing imports but replacing a relatively small share of manufactured imports, around 20 per cent, which should and can be supplied by Irish companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the European Community we are fully committed to open, free and competitive trade in the post-1992 Single Market.  This will mean that the home market will not just be a local market and we must look for new customers, new opportunities and new markets in the wider Europe.  At the same time enterprise, like charity, begins at home.  Almost every business company needs a strong local base from which to launch into the export market.  The local base will provide the initial experience, the credentials and the resources needed to expand abroad.  One of the disadvantages faced by Irish industry in seeking to seize new business opportunities in the Single Market is Ireland's share of its own local market, around 40 per cent by comparison with other <Col N="955" /> European countries.  However, this may not be a disadvantage because the scope for increasing market share is very substantial and even a modest gain will be reflected in millions of pounds worth of new sales.  In the Ireland of the nineties there has never been a better time to start a new business or aggressively develop an old one.  The range of marketing support services available to Irish companies from the Irish Trade Board both at national and regional level will be comprehensive and affordable.</P>
    <P>A multiplicity of specific business opportunities have been identified in detail.  Purchasers in industry and in the retail trade are well disposed towards up-and-coming Irish firms.  Indeed, success in the Irish home market will lead to new opportunities, new customers and new business in the potential Single Market. In the highly competitive nineties Irish firms must concentrate on quality consumer service and good marketing strategies. Indeed, we have many companies who are committed to quality, good customer service and good marketing strategies. I can recall many such companies in my own constituency, companies like Sala ADC, Smiths, Wexford Creamery, ABS and Walsh Mushrooms and I am confident that the legislation before the House today to amalgamate these two agencies will help these companies to diversify, to expand and of course to increase the number employed.</P>
    <P>Improved marketing performance continues to be the single most important means of preparing for the future.  During 1990 it was encouraging to note the increased number of Irish manufacturers extending their commitment to marketing and participating in marketing initiatives and building in-company marketing strength under the direction of the Irish Goods Council.  Even in the short term the new business gain was substantial. The efforts must be intensified over the next few years if Irish firms are to win a realistic share of the Irish market and from there bring their export potential onstream.  In this context the decision to establish a new marketing agency will <Col N="956" /> provide a timely additional stimulus for Irish companies to intensify new business development.  The Irish Goods Council welcome this development and are well advanced in preparing for its implementation. The new agency can be expected to make a significant contribution to the development of Irish manufacturing industry in fully exploiting the enormous potential, both existing and new, for profitable growth and job creation in the marketplace of the nineties.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Trade and Marketing Promotion Bill which is being introduced here today arises out of the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> carried out by the Department of Industry and Commence and published at the end of last year. The extent to which that Department are bankrupt of ideas can be gained from the report and also from the comments of the National Economic and Social Council in their report, <i>A Strategy for the 90s</i> published in October, 1990.</P>
      <P>NESC said in a strongly-worded statement, which did little to conceal their criticism of the Department of Industry and Commerce, that &ldquo;the Council looks forward to the forthcoming three year review of industrial policy in order to assess the extent to which the intentions declared in policy statements has been translated into action&rdquo;.  The fact that the chairman of the NESC is also the Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach should not be lost on anyone.</P>
      <P>It is evident that within Government, as in the country generally, there is growing concern at the ineffectiveness of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in carrying out his primary function as Minister responsible for industrial policy and employment creation.  It seems that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, with his activities as PD Leader and his desire to be involved in all respects of Government policy, devotes too little attention to his own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC comments on the Department of Industry and Commerce <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> should be borne in mind.  While the review was <Col N="957" /> published a couple of months after the NESC report, it is clear that drafts of the review were already circulating within Government and dissatisfaction with the review was rife.</P>
    <P>The Department proposed one approach to industrial policy which the Minister rejected.  They recommended the creation of a super agency responsible for almost all aspects of industrial policy. This would be centred in the Industrial Development Authority.  Other agencies would be scaled down according to the Department's view and would carry out very narrow functions.</P>
    <P>That one big State agency approach was rightly rejected by the Minister. However, the Minister did little beyond rejecting the Department's view.  All that he proposed in the preface to the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> was: (1) The IDA to be the sole promoter overseas of industrial development; (2) NADCORP and IDA to be integrated; (3) CTT and the Irish Goods Council to be merged with the possibility of further rationalisation involving BIM for fish and CBF for meat.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of the Irish Goods Council and CTT is proposed in this Bill. It is a logical step to take but in the context of the job crisis we face it is wholly ineffective as a measure by Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has belatedly recognised that the policy approach of his Department is just not working.  Secondly, he has belatedly recognised that his Department have not the resources or the ideas to help spark structural change in the country and the development of industry and services.  That this is the case is evidenced by the establishment by the Minister of yet another group to look at industrial policy.  This new group is made up of industrialists and trade unionists. While wishing the group the best in terms of designing new approaches to industrial policy, one cannot help but think that it is purely a reaction to the high unemployment levels and an attempt to show some action on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Government seem to think that <Col N="958" /> publishing reviews, establishing review groups and task forces is the way to tackle problems.  In many ways the problem of unemployment has grown so bad that there is no longer time for further analysis. Action is what is needed and in this respect the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office two years ago the Minister has introduced the Competition Bill and this Bill.  Other Bills from his Department have largely been to comply with European Community legislation, such as the Liability for Defectice Products Bill.  It seems that the Minister has suddenly woken up to his own inactivity by the manner in which he is ramming both the Competition Bill and this Bill through the Dáil in the closing weeks of this term.</P>
    <P>One must question why the Minister is so anxious at this point to get these Bills on to the Statute Books.  When one considers that the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil meet shortly to discuss their coalition arrangement the answer is obvious.  Deputy O'Malley, up to the guillotining of the Competition Bill and the quick passage being sought for this Bill, had nothing to show for his two years in office.  The Minister knows that that is also the view of his Fianna Fáil colleagues in Government and the view of a growing number of people in the country.</P>
    <P>The image of the Progressive Democrats as some form of guardian angel preventing a Fianna Fáil Government from doing wrong is suddenly wearing thin.  The reality is that this Government have lost control of the public finances, have failed on tax reform and are presiding over growing disaster on the jobs front.  All of this rapidly deteriorating performance is taking place, not, as the Progressive Democrats would have us believe, in spite of their participation in Government but rather because of their failure in Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill is typical of a Minister who has lost his way.  If there is a problem, set up a task force, amalgamate two agencies <Col N="959" /> or set up a new agency such as the Competition Authority.  No change of direction, no change of emphasis is forthcoming.  One is suddenly confronted with the reality that all the thinking of how Government should relate to industry has fossilised in the thinking of the sixties and seventies.  The Minister cannot walk away from the failures in industrial policy.  He has been Minister for Industry and Commerce for almost seven of the past 14 years.</P>
    <P>I would like to see industrial policy being tackled in two ways.  First, the IDA should have national responsibility for establishing and expanding projects in industry and services.  Second, CTT should have responsibility for generating a market-oriented culture within our enterprises in industry and services. Thirdly, we should have a regional development approach, building on experience in Shannon Development and linked in with local government reform.</P>
    <P>I believe that a lean organisation centred on the amalgamated CTT and Irish Goods Council should have responsibility for gathering and disseminating market information, for encouraging business to invest resources in market research, marketing and promotion.  That responsibility should apply to all sectors &mdash; beef and other meat, fish, manufacturing and services.  It is time we thought of all sectors on a similar footing.  None should be treated as a cinderella, which is the problem with certain sectors to date, such as tourism.</P>
    <P>The State agencies should not be substitutes for action by enterprises themselves. CTT should not be involved directly in marketing or promotion for business.  CTT should, however, effectively co-ordinate efforts with business enterprises and encourage enterprises to devote adequate resources to market-oriented approaches.  Relying on IDAassisted investment in buildings, plant and machinery may help get a business started but it will not keep it in existence or help it to grow.</P>
    <P>Reliance on tax incentives may also be effective in creating an initial interest in <Col N="960" /> Ireland as a location for foreign business; but it can be expensive, leading to higher rates of income tax on individuals and also is vulnerable to retaliation and complaints from other countries.  The recent German pronouncements on the International Financial Services Centre and tax breaks operating there do not augur well for the future.  Similarly the relative failure of the idea of the much-vaunted special trading houses, which Deputy Brennan used to talk so much about, teaches us to be mindful of short term gimmicks and quick fix solutions.</P>
    <P>For sustained long term development we need consistent policies which foster an enterprise mentality and a willingness to take risks.  We need through Government policy to develop approaches that encourage and support that approach. The policies should not try to substitute for action that should be taken by enterprises themselves but there should be incentives which act as a stimulus and get business to realise the benefits of having a well thought-out approach to markets in Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>With the greater integration of Europe the separation of marketing advice for enterprises selling within Ireland and outside Ireland no longer makes sense.  For that reason the Bill is to be welcomed. However, it does not go far enough in terms of creating an approach that will encourage investment in market-related activities.  Fine Gael will in the coming months be setting out their views for a radical overhaul of the Government's relationship with business, for job creation and the encouragement of regional development.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it is to be hoped that the Government face up to the reality of an economic performance unravelling at their feet and that they do something positive about it rather than tinker around the edges as this Bill does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Trade and Marketing Promotion Bill and sincerely wish the new body every success in the future.  As one of the smallest countries in the EC and an island nation we are doing very well in expanding trade in <Col N="961" /> export markets and there is no reason why that cannot continue.  At present our export trade is worth £15 billion, which represents a very substantial business. This is an achievement of which we should be proud.  We cannot, however, assume that our outlets are safe.  Our business people must continue to work hard in expanding present outlets and in finding new markets.  We can take nothing for granted in the business world. The EC market can change at any time and is changing even at present.  Our business people must keep up with the time, and the Government must help those who are finding it difficult to do so.</P>
      <P>The UK market is vital to our national productivity.  At present it takes one third of our total exports.  Surely this is an area where we can increase our exports, and the reasons are simple.  It is our nearest market.  It is the least costly to reach and it has high Irish oriented population.  If we can maintain our national identity of credibility, producing quality goods at reasonable prices, we should be able to increase our UK markets.</P>
      <P>Our home market is also vital to our national prosperity.  It should be easier for us to export goods into the market of 320 million people than for any other of our European partners to export to Ireland where we have a population of five million or thereabouts on the whole island.  The competition should be less at home than abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home market depends greatly on our tourism policy.  There is no reason why we should not have a united tourist effort by North and South.  The whole island would benefit greatly if such an arrangement was agreed.  In fact, the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, of which I am a member, are about to prepare a report on this issue.  In my county of Meath great efforts are being made by way of extra investment and community interest to increase the tourism trade. The Taoiseach will be officially opening a new development at Knowth, County Meath in the near future.  We have made massive investments in the archaeological park at Newgrange, at Tara Hill <Col N="962" /> and Trim.  This should help to bring visitors to our country.  I would like a similar attitude adopted at national level because that is the way we can get investment into our country for the benefit of our national economy.</P>
    <P>The EC market is vital.  We export three quarters of our total exports to European countries, including one third to the UK.  I would like the Minister to advise the new board on this.  I welcome this opportunity to highlight the need for a tighter link and an awareness between the educational system here and the business sector.  The link is not tight enough. Many young men and women, highly qualified in marketing and languages, are fit to play their role in the national interest, given the opportunity by our State, semi-State and private business people.  Many are snatched up by foreign businesses before they are awarded degrees because they are identified as future money earners.</P>
    <P>There is no point in investing large amounts of taxpayers' money in the education system and giving the benefit of our investment to others to take business from us.  I wish to compliment Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, formerly NIHE colleges, on their excellent work in preparing young men and women for degree courses and to become top class business people.  Our regional colleges also play a major role preparing our students to become top class people in trade and commerce.  Our future export trade depends on such people.  Teachers and students alike, must be congratulated.  I ask the Minister to ensure the new board pay special attention to this.  Business people at home must be encouraged to employ such people quickly and we should consider paying a grant to enable them to do so as foreign companies are able to pay higher salaries.</P>
    <P>Our responsibility is to create productivity with profit as this is the only way to give a better standard of living to our people.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="963" /> First, I welcome the response of Deputies to this Bill.  It has been generally positive. I should like to reply to the questions raised.  I am slightly disappointed that no members of the Front Bench of any of the three parties opposite are present, which is rather unusual.  In my 14 years as a Member of this House we adhered to the tradition of keeping a presence when in Opposition.  I decided to make that comment because this Bill is of great significance.</P>
      <P>Deputies Boylan and Taylor raised the question of resources available.  The most significant development in augmenting resources for marketing support has been the inclusion of the marketing support measures operated by CTT and the Irish Goods Council in the <i>Programme for Industrial Development 1989-1993.</i> This programme is the mechanism by which the Government lay formal claim to EC Structural Funds to support industrial development activities.  Marketing measures under the programme attract the highest support rate available at 75 per cent, and this reflects a recognition by the Commission of the central importance of improved marketing to Irish industry. Our success in securing this level of support has dramatically changed the Government's capacity to get behind and support the marketing efforts of Irish industry.  It has copperfastened the existing services of CTT and the Irish Goods Council and it has allowed the agencies to develop new and exciting programmes to help progressive firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the commencement of the industrial programme, the marketing agencies, like all areas of the public sector, had to absorb their share of the cutbacks in Exchequer spending. However, starting in 1989 and continuing through 1990 to this year, the Government have been able to give substantially increased allocations to both agencies. Deputy Boylan asked about giving teeth to the board.  Section 6 gives the board a very broad remit in doing their job.  In this Bill I have deliberately not put restrictions on the board which may reduce their flexibility to perform their <Col N="964" /> function of assisting the marketing efforts of Irish firms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan also spoke about the quality of the staff on the board.  I agree that the personal skills of the board's staff is the key ingredient in the success of the board.  From my experience I can tell the Deputy we have good quality, hard working staff at home and abroad doing an excellent job.  From my experience over two years of dealing with the Irish Goods Council and CTT I have been very impressed by the expertise of the staff at all levels through the organisation, working at home and abroad.  It is a great indication of where we are as a country from the point of view of our marketing capabilities.  I have been very impressed, like organisations throughout the world who have dealt with those bodies, by the standard of our experts and our staff in both organisations.  Indeed, Deputy Taylor endorsed this view and I thank him for that.</P>
    <P>The boards of management, and staff, have acknowledged an inherent sense of what is now proposed.  They support it fully and co-operated with me, and my Department, in the merger process.  I thank them for this and acknowledge their supportive role.  The success of the new agency depends more than anything else on the commitment of their management and staff to the challenging task they face.  I thank each and every one of them for their efforts in the past and wish them every success in their future endeavours the outcome of which is of such fundamental importance to the future of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the existence of non-tariff barriers in France and Italy.  There is some truth in what he said, but I am pleased to say we have a very substantial trade surplus in those markets. Our exports to France in 1990 were worth £1.5 billion and to Italy £634 million. Both figures grew rapidly in the eighties. Furthermore, barriers are coming down in Europe generally and the long term growth prospects in France and Italy are excellent.  Córas Tráchtála, and now the new board, will be targeting the regional programmes which are part and <Col N="965" /> parcel of their programmes in most European countries but particularly in France and Italy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the issue of job creation.  The Government's main role is to get the environment right for job creation.  The Government are doing everything they can to improve this situation. Certain infrastructure measures had to be put in place and this takes time. We are getting things right in improving our education system and our research and development system and the general economic indicators &mdash; all steps required to improve the climate for innovation and business development.  We all know that much remains to be done in this country, but in my view the Government's approach is the correct one.  Other economic systems in East Europe and elsewhere, where the State attempted to provide jobs for all, have collapsed totally and brought greater misery to all their citizens than our system does, imperfect as it is.  This Government have put job creation as our top priority.  This country may not do as well as other EC economies, but this country has had a much later start.  Most, if not all, of our EC partners were independent countries in charge of their own destinies long before this century began.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hilliard mentioned the question of natural resources.  I am aware that recent studies have shown that countries create their own natural resources as much as inherit them.  This is especially the case with human resources, which must be trained and educated.  A country, for example, creates a strong base of computer literate people rather than inherit them.  Deputy Hilliard is correct in saying that our educational institutions are second to none in the world and are playing a very important role in relation to the creation of our first-class marketing and business people.  Of course, Ireland is rich in a strong base of young, talented, educated people.  I believe that the development of successful strong exporting companies, using our people resources in management, technical and back-up roles, is the way forward for this country and the new board will have a <Col N="966" /> crucial role in developing such companies.</P>
    <P>I would not want, nor did I in my speech, wish to pretend that this Bill is the answer to the unemployment problem. This Bill is about providing an important part of the support service to help generate sales, which in turn create jobs.  It is one part of the economic jigsaw.</P>
    <P>The new board are specifically supportive of small and medium sized Irish companies.  As I said in my speech, the board will focus on native industry.  They will not have a role in relation to multi-nationals and their marketing activities. We are particularly anxious that multinational companies would have their marketing base here and we would assist them in every way possible.  We are primarily concerned about indigenous Irish firms, small to medium sized companies, based here.  Most of the multinational companies are in a position to provide services for themselves and are successful in the field of marketing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte spoke about what he considers the <i>ad hoc</i> approach to rationalisation of State agencies.  I accept that in a perfect world what Deputy Rabbitte says might have merit.  However, given the nature of a rapidly changing domestic and international environment and given the new challenges and threats posed by the Single Market, it is essential to have the freedom to review and, when necessary, change policy on a continuing basis. This Bill and the decision which it implements are just such a response to the changing marketing demands in our firms.  I am delighted that the year in which the Bill has been published will also be the year in which the Bill will be passed into law, hopefully with the co-operation of Deputies from all sides of the House, and that it will be before the Seanad next week.</P>
    <P>The new board &mdash; An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; will play their part in assisting our national economic development.  I would like to take just a few moments to describe, in general terms, the kinds of services which are supplied by the agencies which will form the new board.  Córas <Col N="967" /> Tráchtála operates seven distinct marketing programmes and, indeed, with each of these there is a range of related activities.  These can, however, be summarised into three broad categories. First, Córas Tráchtála provides detailed market information.  Their network of 21 overseas offices provide essential on the ground assistance to exporters and their market information centre in Dublin hosts the largest collection of market information in Ireland.  We want to ensure that all our manufacturers are aware of the support facilities which are available from the new board which will be based at Merrion Hall in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Second, Córas Tráchtála operates a range of market development activities. These would include, for example, research activity which would identify potential markets for Irish firms or explore the best market entry strategies for particular sectors.</P>
    <P>Finally, CTT provides financial assistance to exporters through a range of schemes.  The most notable scheme is their targeted marketing consultancy programme which is a direct result of structural funds support and which makes substantial grants available for major marketing programmes.  I would like to have had more time to dwell on all these schemes but I do not have the opportunity this evening.</P>
    <P>For their part the Irish Goods Council provides general marketing advice for very small manufacturers which are totally reliant on the domestic market.  In particular they advise firms on opportunities in business to business sales and in undertaking sectoral marketing initiatives. I would like to point out that the Irish Goods Council now provide services for in the region of 800 companies.  At present Córas Tráchtála provides direct work for 1,200 companies.  Some of those companies will be combined in the new organisation.  There are 5,000 manufacturing companies in Ireland at present, only 2,500 of which are exporting. It is imperative that the balance of these companies would look to exporting because only through exporting can they <Col N="968" /> build up an additional base and create the much needed employment.  With 340 million people in the Single Market of 1992 the opportunities for exporting companies will exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte feared that the Bill was abolishing the functions of the Irish Goods Council and that services to companies on the home market would be lost. It is very important that I put it on the record that this is not the case.  I appreciate what Deputy Rabbitte has said in sincerity and I agree with the views expressed by him in complimenting the work of the Irish Goods Council and their commitment to small indigenous companies. He shared the praise with Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>In fact the service provided to indigenous industry and small business in particular will be enhanced as a result of this merger.  Firstly, all the programmes presently operated by the Irish Goods Council will continue.  The funding for these programmes is secured under the Community support framework in the Programme for Industrial Development, 1989-93.  I should like to give an example in relation to the Irish Goods Council. When they had a company ready for exporting they had to hand that company over to Córas Tráchtála; there was in a sense a change of personnel.  That is the basic kernel of this Bill.  We want to ensure that there would be continuity for the small indigenous company's right to become a major exporting company.  I want to make it clear that the position of the staff is protected.  The present acting chief executive of the Irish Goods Council will become assistant chief executive of the new organisation.  The staff of 30 will be totally integrated with the whole staff of approximately 254 people in Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we state the objectives of this merger &mdash; it is a merger of two separate organisations coming together.  It is not because they are in one building, as Deputy Rabbitte mentioned in his contribution; the fact is that they work in the one direction, serving Irish companies.  It is important that they be given a new start in 1991 by the creation <Col N="969" /> of this new board.  It is vital that we put it clearly on the record that their functions will continue and will be enhanced under the new organisation which is being established here with the support of Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contributions by Deputy Lowry, Deputy Cullimore and Deputy Hilliard.  I express my thanks for the complimentary comments made in relation to the work of the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála.  I do not think there has been any criticism of either the Irish Goods Council or Córas Tráchtála and that says much for two organisations which have been in existence for some time.  It is encouraging for the staff of both organisations to know they have the unanimous support of this House for the creation of this new board because they have a major task ahead.  I would like to think that all of us would assist them in their work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the identification of £1.2 billion worth of work in relation to import substitution.  That is a fundamental part of our policy.  Government policy is to identify and provide those jobs.  Indeed in discussions which the Taoiseach had with the social partners and the heads of State companies that area was mentioned.  We have to identify and provide the necessary jobs here at home.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and again I thank Deputies for their co-operation and assistance in allowing this Bill to have such a speedy passage.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment and passed.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Chester Beatty Library Burglary.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter of the recent sad events in the Chester Beatty Library, because out of all disasters something positive should be looked for.  I hope, as a result of inviting the Taoiseach &mdash; I understand it will be <Col N="970" /> his representative, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice &mdash; to indicate the full extent of the burglary and the very definite steps which will be taken by the Taoiseach as the Minister responsible for cultural affairs and as the ultimate guardian of this very valuable gift to the nation, that security at the library will be improved.</P>
      <P>The reason I asked for this debate is that the response to the break-in, as reported in the newspapers, from the board of trustees leaves me extremely worried. In addition, as a Member of the House who has taken a particular interest in the Chester Beatty Library since I was elected in 1987, the way in which the library has been generally run gives me cause for concern.  In particular, the views of the previous director given emphatically to the board of trustees was to the effect that the garden library in the buildings themselves was not a secure location for the housing of valuable items of the collection.</P>
      <P>The present exhibition, from which the robbery took place, was known as the &ldquo;Treasures of the Chester Beatty Library&rdquo;.  Access was gained through French doors leading from the concourse to the library building secured by an alarm and grille over glass.  The cabinet of display had single pane glass with no alarm system connected to it.  As a result, entry was made quickly and items were literally grabbed and disappeared. Consequently, it appears that the decision to house the items in this location was a bad one in the face of very definite opinions, including those of members of the Garda Siochána who previously visited the library and gave their view with regard to the suitability of this location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second cause of concern was the reaction of the acting director, reported in the media, that the break-in was &ldquo;a minor one&rdquo;.  That seems to play down the potential scale of the disaster which might have occurred if the raiders had had an opportunity to spend a longer time on the premises.  It was also an attempt to play down the intrinsic value and international <Col N="971" /> uniqueness of the collection; even one item &mdash; big or small &mdash; lost seriously damages our reputation as the custodian of this important collection.</P>
    <P>There was also an attempt to suggest that the items were not of great monetary value.  I read a suggestion that the items were of no more than academic interest. All this makes me worry as to why we have had an acting director for upwards of two years and that a director has not been appointed, why the recommendations of Mr. O'Donnell of the ESB, who made particular recommendations in terms of security have not been taken on board and, more particularly, why his recommendations in regard to the trustees themselves have not been taken on board and implemented even to this day.</P>
    <P>The Government subvent the management and running of the Chester Beatty Library to the tune of almost 80 per cent on an annual basis and it is time to have a more open management of the library and some mechanism whereby this House, on whose behalf the trustees mind the collection, can be advised periodically of how the library's affairs are being run and developed and where matters stand in relation to the safe keeping of these treasures.</P>
    <P>I hope in raising this matter &mdash; and in the response of the Minister of State &mdash; we will have a positive reaction to a very unfortunate event in relation to this internationally important collection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to express great concern at the break-in and theft at the Chester Beatty Library.  I am sure the House would join with me in expressing the hope that the trustees, with the help of the Garda Síochána, will be successful in securing the recovery of the items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chester Beatty Library is owned and managed by a private trust set up by the will of the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty.  The Government have no direct statutory responsibility in this function other than the fact that the Taoiseach can <Col N="972" /> appoint one trustee and the Office of Public Works have been empowered by statute to look after the maintenance of the premises.  The Office of Public Works spent in the region of £500,000 in the last few years in maintaining and improving facilities there.  The function of the Office of Public Works is exercised under the direction and control of the trustees.</P>
    <P>All matters arising from the management and security of the collection are for the trustees themselves.  The Government give an annual grant to the trustees for the running of the library but that does not change the fact that it is the trustees who are responsible for the care and management of the collection.</P>
    <P>The recent theft is being investigated by the Garda Síochána.  They will be advising the trustees in their review of security at the library.  The trustees will also have the service of the Office of Public Works in carrying out any necessary works at the library which such a review may suggest.</P>
    <P>As regards action by the Taoiseach, his Department have been in touch with the library from the earliest reports of the break-in and have got full particulars of the circumstances.  Information is now awaited in the Department on the action proposed by the trustees having regard to the circumstances of the break-in and whether extra precautions need to be taken.  I can assure the House that the Office of Public Works will do whatever works are necessary in the view of the trustees as a result of this incident, taking into account recommendations by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan also raised the position of the acting director.  The position has been filled in an acting capacity since March 1990 but a competition to fill the post on a permanent basis is in progress at present.  I am sure this will be a matter of satisfaction to the House.  I assure Members that the Department of the Taoiseach, under the direction of the Taoiseach, are utilising all their resources to ensure that there is maximum co-operation so that these very important arte-facts will be returned to their rightful place.</P>

    <Col N="973" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the Government introduced a new clothing allowance to be operated through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to help families in particular need in providing winter clothing for children going back to school in September.</P>
      <P>When it was first announced it was stated that payments would be made in September.  The scheme was given to the health boards to operate and they quickly came to the conclusion that September was not the ideal time to pay this allowance. They recommended that it should be paid in August so that families with children going back to school in September would have this assistance before their children went back to school.  A very sensible view was taken of the matter and all the health boards &mdash; with the exception of the Eastern Health Board &mdash; made the payments in August.  They take the form of an extra week's payment of social welfare or social assistance to families in particular difficulties identified by the health boards.</P>
      <P>As I said, it is a very sensible scheme and the House was in agreement with it when it was introduced and the health boards very quickly came to the conclusion that to be fully effective the allowance should be paid in the month of August so that parents could anticipate children going back to school.  Apparently it proves impossible to do that in the Eastern Health Board area because of a disagreement between the management of the health board and the staff. I do not intend to go into the details of that disagreement because that is not my object at this stage.  The point I want to make is that for one reason or other payment was not made until the month of September at a time when it had lost some of its value for the families concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took the matter up with the Minister in the autumn of last year.  He assured us that payment would be made this year in the month of August in the Eastern Health Board area and that arrangements would be made to ensure <Col N="974" /> that this would happen.  I have been informed by constituents of mine in the last couple of weeks that they have been told by the health board that payment will not be made this year again until the month of September.  My understanding is that all of the other health boards, as was the case last year, will make the payment in the month of August.  I would like to ask the Minister, if there is a problem, why it exists in the Eastern Health Board area when it does not exist in any other health board area.  Could the Minister now take whatever action is required to make sure that this very sensible payment, with which we all agree, is made at a time when it is of maximum benefit to the families concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to last year we were quite clear and the directions sent out were that ideally the payments should be made from mid-August to late-August. As the scheme only started up last year it was possible that payments would not be made until early September.  What the Deputy has said is true &mdash; there were industrial relations problems in the Eastern Health Board which protracted the payments last year.  However I do not envisage the difficulties that the Deputy has mentioned in relation to this year.</P>
      <P>Last year I introduced a new back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance to assist families on social welfare and health board payments in meeting the cost of school uniforms and footwear. This new scheme was very well received throughout the country.  It represented a major improvement on the previous arrangements and substantially eased the annual burden faced by families dependent on social welfare and health board payments at start of the new school year. It was administered by health boards as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We normally expect teething problems in the initial stages of all new schemes. In this instance however the scheme operated very efficiently.  This was due in no small measure to the special efforts <Col N="975" /> made by health board staff and particularly the community welfare officers. Despite the usual staff pressures associated with the holiday period, they ensured that the bulk of payments were made well in advance of the new school year.  Some of the payments that were not made in advance related to the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Some 185,000 children benefited under the scheme last year.  This year's scheme has already begun in July.  The health board have also taken action in relation to this year's scheme which will operate until the end of September.  This means that families will receive their payments well in advance of the start of the school year.  The amount of the allowance will be £25 for each child in primary school and £40 for each child in secondary school.  Five and a half million pounds has been provided to meet the cost.</P>
    <P>Following last year's successful scheme I arranged for a comprehensive review of the scheme within my Department in consultation with health boards.  Arising from this review I have made a number of major improvements which are included in this year's scheme.  Recipients of family income supplement can now for the first time, qualify for the allowance. For example, a family with four children, two at primary school and two at secondary school, with an income of £160 per week, will now receive a clothing and footwear allowance of £130 in addition to their FIS payment of £24 per week.  In addition, families on the social employment schemes can now qualify.  The extension of the allowance to families on FIS together with the major improvements in the FIS scheme and the child related tax exemptions announced earlier this year ensure that families at work and on low pay are substantially better off than if they were dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Another improvement in this year's scheme is that in the case of families dependent on long term social welfare payments, including FIS, the allowance <Col N="976" /> will now be paid in respect of children up to age 21 where the child continues in full time education.  This is in keeping with the progressive improvements which I have made in recent years in raising the age limit up to which child dependant increases are payable in the case of recipients of long term social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I have also introduced standard income limits so as to ensure greater consistency in the operation of the scheme throughout the country.  These income limits will ensure that families who were just outside the eligibility range last year will now qualify for the allowance.  It will also make it much easier for people to understand their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Information leaflets have recently been distributed by my Department and every effort is being made to maximise take up under the scheme.  In the Eastern Health Board area, for example, claim forms have already been posted out to 25,000 families who qualified under last year's scheme.</P>
    <P>The new back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance which I introduced last year is in keeping with the Government's policy of targeting special increases to those most in need.  The improvements which I have recently made will mean that more families will qualify for the allowance this year.  These improvements, together with the substantial increases in weekly social welfare payments which come into effect this month, will significantly improve the position of families dependant on social welfare.  I do not visualise a problem in the Eastern Health Board this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to convey to the office of the Ceann Comhairle my sincere thanks for allowing me the opportunity this afternoon to raise this matter.  The Regional Hospital in Tralee was recently constructed to cater for 425 beds, following a careful and intensive <Col N="977" /> assessment of the hospital needs of the County Kerry region of the Southern Health Board.  As of now there are 70 beds still vacant.  The current cutback, which resulted in the total closure of a ward, will impact very seriously over a number of weeks until its reopening on the medical and surgical treatment of patients in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>Recently consultants took the unusual step of inviting all the public representatives in Kerry to meet them to give expression to their serious concerns about the proposed cutbacks.  These people have no political axe to grind. Their sole responsibility lies in their professional expertise in treating patients. Their concern was very solidly expressed and that concern was conveyed to the Minister for Health who was arranging a visit to Kerry ten days later.  A request was made for the Minister to meet the consultants, but it is regrettable that he did not do so because he would have got a realistic picture of their thinking on the matter following the closure of the wards.</P>
      <P>In addition to the impact of the closure on patients in Kerry it should not be overlooked that County Kerry is the hub of the Irish tourist industry.  It is estimated that during the tourist season not less than 800,000 people pass through the county.  In normal circumstances a percentage of these people would require hospitalisation and it would be regrettable if adequate facilities were not available to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole position as expressed by the consultants to the public representatives is, to say the least, unsatisfactory.  Their feeling was that decisions had been taken in Cork without full discussion on the impact of those decisions.  That is something they would like to be fully involved in, and that should be the Minister's view also.  It is difficult to understand how a hospital catering for the medical and surgical needs of a community can decide to impose very substantial cutbacks in the absence of full consultation with the consultancy, medical, nursing and ancillary <Col N="978" /> staff.  It is necessary at this stage that the Minister comes to grips with the Southern Health Board in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand, as do many people seeking treatment and waiting for admission, why the board are proceeding with the appointment of three or four top-level staff, involving major changes in structure, costs, space, and so on.  That may be a very necessary and desirable development in health board administration, but at a time when there are such severe cutbacks, the ordinary citizen is entitled to expect the resources available to be channelled into providing a service.  I ask the Minister to take account of that issue.</P>
    <P>At this time the board have serious problems in keeping intact their supplies and in making payments to contractors perhaps, three, four or five months out of line.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State that either he or the Minister go to Tralee and instead of meeting the politicians meet the consultants, the doctors and the nursing staff.  They will give a true picture of the present position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to clarify the position with regard to Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made it clear in the past, and it is important to emphasise the point again, that apart from normal seasonal closures the level of bed availability approved for 1990 will be maintained fully in 1991. The organisation of services at Tralee General Hospital is, of course, a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  The board made a decision to close 15 five-day beds at the hospital for two weeks at the beginning of July and for two weeks in August.  I point out that seasonal closures are part and parcel of the provision and organisation of acute hospital services throughout the country and have been so for many years.  The seasonal closures at Tralee this summer <Col N="979" /> are planned to coincide with periods when staff are on annual holiday and when the level of activity at the hospital has traditionally decreased.</P>
    <P>Waiting times for most specialised services at Tralee are not excessive and the seasonal summer closures were planned on a two-week basis to minimise delays for patients.  It should also be noted that the closures were planned some time ago to enable consultants to take them into account when managing and organising their caseloads.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that there was no communication or consultation on the matter of the summer closures.  They were discussed with the consultants in Tralee.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board are satisfied that there are sufficient beds available to meet the demands placed on the hospital.  All emergency and urgent services will, of course, continue to be provided and are not in any way affected.</P>

      <P>My grievance concerns the decision to rob Stonetown national school, County Louth, of a teacher because the school is short one child in pupil numbers.  I can only describe that decision as yet another Fianna Fáil attack on rural life.  It underlines the need of <Col N="980" /> adult education for Department officials and the public who vote for that party.</P>
      <P>The Minister's refusal to meet the parents of the school was an insult to a most hardworking, committed and responsible group.  It is a reflection on the two Fianna Fáil Deputies in County Louth, who either did not or could not arrange a meeting with their Minister, the very minimum that a Dáil Deputy can expect from a Minister.</P>
      <P>At Stonetown national school one teacher will attempt to teach four classes while in the other class babies, high infants and first and second classes will compete for the attention of a hapless teacher trying to cope with newcomers and introduce them to education.  It is unreasonable and wrong to ask any teacher to try to cope with that task. What about the slow learners?  Will the Minister hold back the bright kids to keep pace with the slow pupils or go ahead with the bright ones and forgot about the slow learners?</P>
      <P>It seems that larger schools with their &ldquo;walking&rdquo; principals, secretaries, gardeners and single-subject classes are light years ahead of the country national schools.</P>
      <P>The Stonetown community are willing to pay the third teacher's salary in the coming year.  If that magnanimous gesture were to be ignored that would be an outrage and an expression of hostility to every parent in the Stonetown area.</P>
      <P>In the case of Louth national school, serving an area of high unemployment, social deprivation and increasing vandalism, the pupil shortfall is three.  Again, the removal of a teacher will cause significant social problems and further distress to slow learners.  As both areas I have referred to are disadvantaged socially and in every other way I call on the Minister to retain those teachers and provide a shared remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Minister to what happened in Jobstown.  Under strong political pressure from the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, <Col N="981" /> the Minister made yet another U-turn and retained teachers.  I am asking that the same consideration be given to the children of County Louth, who will not accept being graded as second class citizens and want the same standards and criteria as those applying in County Dublin.  I ask the Minister to accept my case and reinstate the two teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of pupils enrolled has been declining in recent years, hence the fact that Ms. Marie Rice, the second assistant teacher, has been placed on the Armagh diocesan panel for redeployment.  Ms. Rice has now accepted a post in another school as from 1 September 1991.  If the school have more than 70 pupils enrolled in September the board of management may apply for an additional teacher then under the maximum class size guidelines. Officials from my Department met a joint deputation of parents from Stonetown national school and Louth national school yesterday and the position was outlined to the parents.</P>
      <P>The number of pupils at Louth national school has also been declining, hence the fact that Ms. Mary Larney, the third assistant teacher, has been placed on the Armagh diocesan panel for redeployment.</P>
      <P>I accept the very reasonable point put forward by Deputy McGahon, but the fact is that it is not possible to breach the guidelines, even though in one case the school needs only one more pupil to be over the guideline limit.  Were the Government to make an exception in that case we would have to breach the guidelines all over the country.  The Deputy will understand that that is not possible.  In relation to Stonetown national school, having one teacher to 31 pupils is not a terribly bad ratio, even though we would all like it to be better.</P>

      <P>Creevylea national school, Drumkeeran, is now only a one <Col N="982" /> teacher school.  This has been the position since June 1989 when it lost its second teacher.  Sufficient time, therefore, has elapsed to evaluate the effect in practice of the one teacher position.</P>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of the one teacher in Creevylea there are inevitably serious difficulties.  That one teacher has to contend with the requirements of 27 pupils, in eight different classes from junior infants to sixth; and, of the 27, five or six are in need of constant and special remedial attention.</P>
      <P>Also we must face the fact that for many who attend Creevylea national school this is the end of their formal education. That is the way it is in this and many other areas in my constituency.  So it is essential that the primary education available is as wide and comprehensive as possible.</P>
      <P>Where there is just one teacher there is inevitably a temptation for parents to send their sons and daughters to alternative schools in the area with bigger staffs.  Four have already been lost to Creevylea.  So now the community must face the fact that unless the second teacher is restored they could lose their school altogether down along the line. This would be devastating coming on top of the many other closures in that area.</P>
      <P>The people of the area naturally want the best in education for their children. In the past with two teachers they got the best &mdash; the record of Creevylea pupils when they moved on the second level very clearly proved that.  As the Minister knows only too well, this is a disadvantaged area.  I have explained the special needs of five or six of the pupils in the school, that the education received in the primary school will be the only formal education for some and that this is an area with many difficulties to combat.  I know the Minister would like to restore the second teacher.  In light of all these factors, I am sure a way will be found.</P>

      <P>The enrolment at the school on 30 September 1990 was 26.  The post of the first assistant was suppressed on 31 August 1989 due to the falling enrolments.  The assistant teacher was redeployed to an alternative school. Circular 14/91, which recently issued to the boards of management of national schools, outlined arrangements for a new maximum class size of 28 for one teacher schools with more than four standards. If Creevylea national school has a valid enrolment of more than 28 pupils in September 1991 the question of allocating an additional post to the school can be considered under this new arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter I wish to raise is the question of Clogh national school in Kilkenny.  The Minister will be aware that there are 96 pupils in this school and four teachers.  The provision of a new national school at Clogh was signalled by the Department of Education in about 1985 in the first instance. There has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between the Department of Education and the board of management over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions there at the moment can only be described as abysmal.  The Minister herself visited the area in October 1990 at a very appropriate time in order to meet the board of management of Clogh national school and indicated that there would be no difficulty in bringing forward the necessary stages to implement the decision to build a new school at Clogh.  Nothing has happened in the meantime.  I am asking the Minister <Col N="984" /> this evening if the finance is on the way to commence this project immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining my intentions in relation to Clogh national school.  The Minister visited the school and it is appreciated that it is in bad condition and in need of development.</P>
      <P>Sketch plans were sent to the local authority on 24 June 1991 so that planning permission could be obtained.  When satisfactory planning permission has been received the preparation of tender documentation will be put in hands.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to expedite the planning of this scheme once planning permission has been granted.  However, I would caution on the difficulties that lie ahead in view of statements from the Minister for Finance in recent days as to the availability of capital resources.</P>

      <P>The second matter I wish to raise is in regard to the conditions of education at primary level for the pupils attending schools in St. John's parish in Kilkenny city.  I particularly refer to St. John's girls school where there are two shocking prefabs which have been there for over 25 years.  I can assure the Minister that these are in an appalling condition.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of discussions between the board of management of these schools and the Department of Education about whether to build a new school, amalgamate both schools or extend the St. John's boys school and the St. John's girls school on a co-educational basis.  There is a delay in getting an answer from the Department of Education about their intentions. This is delaying the decision about whether there should be a new school or an amalgamation of facilities that are already there.  I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify the present situation and tell us what the intentions of the Department are.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that the Deputy wants me to clarify the situation. I think he knows well what it is.  The matter has been the subject of discussion and correspondence with the school authorities over the past few years.  As a consequence suitable arrangements for the school both from an educational and accommodation point of view have been agreed.</P>
      <P>The proposal is to amalgamate the existing three junior schools into two and to establish them on the basis of junior and senior co-educational schools.  It is proposed that the senior co-educational school will be accommodated in the existing boys school and this will necessitate an extension of two permanent classrooms and some ancillary accommodation. It is intended that the junior co-educational school will be accommodated in the existing girls and infant school, which will need upgrading and general improvements.  As regards the boys school, a site extension is needed. My Department's architect visited the school last month and discussed the whole question with the chairperson and the necessary survey and mapping work will be undertaken next week by the design team.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of wishing the new Minister for Defence well across the Floor of the House.</P>
      <P>A directive has gone from the Government to the military authorities to cut back by 25 per cent the strength of the cadres of regular Army personnel attached full time to the FCA.  This is a political decision and one which, of course, the military authorities have to put into effect.  The cadres of Army personnel are attached to the various FCA camps and are a vital component in the whole FCA structure and operation.  Presumably the cutback in numbers is done to cut back on costs to save allowances and expenses and, along the line, cut back on regular Army recruitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> As the Minister knows, proceeding with this will have serious impact on FCA operations.  The representative association of the FCA has described it as a downgrading of the service and likely to do dreadful damage to operational ability. Needless to say, it will effect morale. It also comes at a time when the FCA have not even got sufficient station wagons to get them to proper training exercises.</P>
    <P>The cut-back would also have very serious social consequences for the regular Army personnel transferred back to their barracks.  They have their houses to pay for, with mortages taken on the strength of special allowances they are paid.  They have children at school who will have to be uprooted.  It will be a total and extensive disruption of their lifestyles, for some of which the Army will have to pay.</P>
    <P>We must question just how this directive is to be implmented.  If there is one storeman in a cadre he obviously cannot be taken away; otherwise who looks after the guns?  There are other categories who equally must be kept on.  How then is the 25 per cent cut to be achieved without effectively ruining the contribution of the regular Army cadres to the FCA operations.</P>
    <P>Finally, will there be a cost saving?  I doubt it.  The 60 or 70 regular Army personnel returned to their barracks will obviously get compensation for the social upheaval and disturbance.  I presume that on the social aspect the military authorities will have to deal with the new Army organisations.</P>
    <P>I believe that this was a bureaucratic decision, the consequences of which were never thought out fully.  I expect that the Minister, new in his position, will resist this cutback because of the implications I have outlined.</P>

      <P>Let me first thank Deputy Nealon for his good wishes which I appreciate very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> The cost of the pay and allowances of the Permanent Defence Force personnel attached to units of the FCA on a full-time basis for administration and training purposes amounted to £14 million in 1990.  Those personnel are dispersed among 124 sub-units &mdash; companies, batteries and squadrons &mdash; throughout the State.</P>
    <P>The report of the Gleeson Commission clearly underlined the desirability of examining the whole question of the present deployment of the Defence Forces and it is in this context that the <Col N="988" /> question of rationalisation of FCA units is being addressed.  Proposals have not yet been formulated in this regard. Examination of the matter is proceeding and there will be no decision in relation to the number of staff to be retained at any particular location until this examination has been completed.</P>
    <P>The review I have referred to has been ongoing for some time and is not connected with the current assessment of the public finances.</P>
    <P>The Dail adjourned at 5.45 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Friday, 5 July 1991.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 16, 19, 23, 25, 33, 34, 36, 41, 42, 43 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for safety net intervention in the beef sector were amended in the recent EC prices agreement.  The Commission's original proposals had envisaged abolition of this safeguard.  The package as finally agreed by Council, however, provided for the continuation of a safety net system.  The revised arrangements include a new and exceptional provision whereby beef intervention can also be opened where particularly difficult price situations arise in a single member state.  Such a situation would be deemed to obtain where the market price falls under 72 per cent of the intervention price in one member state and where the average Community market price is below 78 per cent of the intervention level.  The old safety net arrangements did not contain any single member state trigger but relied on one which required the particular price situation to prevail in at least three member states or regions.  The new safety net regime also provides for the Council to take urgent intervention measures in <Col N="911" /> exceptional cases such as a serious market crisis.</P>
    <P>The reduction in normal intervention triggers will now be limited to 4 percentage points rather than the 8 points originally sought by the Commission. This, together with the preservation of safety net intervention, represents a very considerable achievement in my view and is, in the circumstances obtaining at present, the best outcome that might realistically have been hoped for.</P>
    <P>The move away from the standard payment system for safety net intervention to a system based on market prices has given rise to a need to fix processing margins for beef factories.  Originally the Commission had proposed 3 ECU/100 kg and eventually they fixed the amount at 6 ECU/100 kg.</P>
    <P>We regard this as inadequate in Irish conditions but practically all other members states consider it over generous so there is little prospect of having it increased.  At present my Department, the farm organisations and the meat factories are involved in discussions aimed at achieving a means of ensuring that price stability is maintained under the new system.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 17 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the testing regime in place at meat factories and the powers available to veterinary inspectors to detain and sample suspect animals and carcases are adequate to detect illegal usage of growth promoting substances and to ensure that meat containing such residues does not enter the food chain.</P>
      <P>Summonses in regard to the use of clenbuterol have issued in two instances to date and a further 15 cases are at an advanced stage of preparation for prosecution. These matters are now <i>sub judice</i> and I do not think it appropriate to comment further.  I should add that since 1986, 32 prosecutions have been taken for the use of growth enhancers generally.</P>
      <P>I have already announced my intention to introduce legislation to give members of the Garda Síochána greater powers for enforcement of the existing legislation and to introduce new regulations providing for a licensing system for all distribution outlets for veterinary medicines.  It will be fundamental to this licensing system that only authorised veterinary medicinal products may be placed on the market.  My Department's work on these measures is now at an advanced stage and the necessary contacts with the other State agencies concerned are in progress.  I would expect this work will be completed in a matter of months.</P>
      <P>Finally, I intend introducing a Bill to amend the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, to provide for indictable offences and greater penalties for serious breaches of the veterinary medicines legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important, however, that the recent publicity should not create an erroneous impression.  The fact remains that the vast majority of producers adopt a responsible attitude to the use of all veterinary medicines.  It is regrettable that an unrepresentative and irresponsible minority threaten the good <Col N="913" /> reputation of our beef industry and the livelihoods of their fellow farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Because of a combination of a number of external factors, in particular the impact on Community consumption and third country markets of BSE and of the Gulf crisis, the Irish beef sector has been undergoing a particularly difficult period and has had to rely heavily on intervention support in preventing a major collapse in market prices.  A crucial factor in supporting prices has been the availability of safety net intervention which I negotiated during the last review of the beef regime in 1989.</P>
      <P>Community intervention stocks of beef as at June 1991 are estimated at 760,000 tonnes of which Ireland accounted for 235,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>Using the months of October 1990 and May 1991 for comparison purposes, the percentage of Irish beef going into intervention was 33.2 per cent in October 1990 and 21.7 per cent in May of 1991.</P>
      <P>In so far as disposals of intervention stocks are concerned, the Commission has been actively seeking purchasers for intervention beef and a number of export sales have been effected.  The definitive solution is, however, for the industry to become more market led and I regard the new CBF quality scheme as an important move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious downturn has occurred on the world dairy market since late 1989 with commodity products affected in particular. Intervention stocks of butter and <Col N="914" /> skimmed milk powder in the Community now stand at 398,000 tonnes and 478,000 tonnes respectively, of which 133,000 tonnes of butter and 159,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder are of Irish origin.</P>
    <P>In 1990, intervention intake accounted for about 56 per cent and 47 per cent of Irish production of butter and skimmed milk powder respectively.  At present intervention purchases are slightly higher than last year but account for less than 30 per cent of total Irish milk production even in the current difficult market circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Irish dairy industry has no other short term option but to avail of the support mechanisms at a time of depressed markets.  In the long term the moves towards rationalisation and restructuring will enable the industry to diversify its product portfolio to reduce its reliance on commodity products.</P>
    <P>The total Community stocks of cereals as of 13 June 1991 amounted to 18.6 million tonnes of which 90,000 tonnes of barley are presently stored in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have constantly urged producers and the industry generally in both the beef and dairy sectors to avail fully of the advantage of Ireland's image as a producer of wholesome product from a natural and clean environment.</P>

      <P>The annual report of the EC Court of Auditors for 1989 has been examined in various EC fora in accordance with long standing procedures which culminated in the European Parliament adopting the ECOFIN recommendations granting a discharge to the EC Commission in respect of the implementation of the Community budget in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is usual the Court visited all member states on a variety of schemes and made recommendations in regard to these schemes.  In so far as the specific <Col N="916" /> references to Ireland and to the work of my Department are concerned, Ireland was visited by the Court on two occasions in 1989 in respect of the co-responsibility system in the common market organisation for cereals and the system of aid for investment in agricultural holdings. The Court's comments on those two systems are contained in chapters 4 and 6 of the annual report.</P>
    <P>Seven other member states were visited in respect of the co-responsibility scheme, while five other member states were visited in respect of agricultural investment aids.</P>
    <P>The Court of Auditors issues sectoral letters to member states following their visits.  The Department have replied fully to the sectoral letter received in respect of the 1989 visit which covered largely technical issues and demonstrated that the manner in which they were dealt with in Ireland was satisfactory.  The extent to which the member states responses are taken account of is not known as it is not the practice of the Court to send draft copies of that report to the member states concerned in advance of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the Court have been and are being satisfactorily dealt with by my Department and do not call for any special action on my part.</P>

      <P>Two measures recently announced by the Government should help to increase land mobility.  One is the decision to increase up to £4,000 the income tax liability exemption in respect of land leased by farmers aged 55 years <Col N="917" /> or over.  The other is the decision to introduce greater flexibility in the installation scheme for young farmers which will enable a greater number of small farmers to qualify for the benefits of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government are committed, in the light of changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and other developments, to review all national policies relating to agriculture.  In that context particular account will be taken of the need to promote structural change in farming, including the promotion of lifetime transfers of land and the early establishment of young trained farmers.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 28 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Traditionally Irish trade with Libya has been in live cattle with contracts being filled in the main from Irish cattle supplies, although part of contracts have been filled from time to time with cattle from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1990 live cattle and beef imports to Libya were suspended due to Libyan concerns over BSE.  Since then, I and officials of my Department have had extensive consultations with the Libyan authorities.  In September 1990 I visited Libya with my officials following which a Libyan delegation visited Ireland in late November 1990.  They indicated that they would make a favourable report to their <Col N="918" /> authorities regarding the health status of Irish cattle and beef.</P>
    <P>Developments have moved slowly since partly because of local Libyan difficulties in the animal health area. However, contacts between the Irish and Libyan authorities are continuing and I am hopeful that as a result the live cattle trade will resume.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of unforeseen circumstances combined to make 1990 a difficult year for the sale of Irish beef in export markets.  This included in particular</P>
      <P>&mdash;a fall in consumer demand in important markets in the UK and the Continent due mainly to the BSE scare in the UK</P>
      <P>&mdash;the effect of the BSE scare in the UK on many of our valuable third country markets, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the closure of the Iraqi market (to which 8 per cent of our total beef exports was sold in 1989) to Irish beef due to the Gulf crisis. </P>
      <P>These events occurred in a year in which cattle slaughterings at Irish export plants increased by 19 per cent over the preceding year. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House will be aware that a major collapse in cattle prices in this country was averted in 1990 due to the operation of the safety net intervention arrangements. A total of 235,000 tonnes of beef were taken into intervention in 1990, and this once again demonstrates the importance of having effective intervention <Col N="920" /> arrangements available to counteract market problems.</P>
    <P>Since the onset of the market difficulties last year I have taken a number of steps to rebut disinformation about the health status of Irish beef.  In order to assure buyers of the quality and wholesomeness of our beef I have visited a number of our traditional third country markets and my Department have maintained constant contact with the authorities in our export markets as well as keeping Irish embassies fully briefed on the situation.  Representatives from a number of countries have visited this country and were reassured by the measures we have in place to deal with BSE. This approach has proved to be successful and a number of our markets have been reopened to our exports.  I expect that in the coming months more of our traditional customers will be persuaded to recommence purchasing our beef.</P>
    <P>Last year I secured a substantial increase of £250,000 in the grant-in-aid to CBF.  I have asked CBF to carry out an aggressive beef promotion campaign in 1991 and I have secured a doubling of the CBF grant-in-aid in 1991 to £1.5 million.  I am pleased to say that the meat processors have also agreed to increase their contribution to CBF to match the increased commitment from the Government. This brings the total CBF budget to £7.2 million for 1991 compared to £5.05 million in 1990.  CBF have recently introduced a quality assurance scheme for Irish beef and this together with the major promotion campaign should project a very positive image of our beef to consumers.</P>
    <P>CBF's promotion campaign in Europe is targeted at the premium end of the market and includes promotion of Irish beef in key retail outlets and at international food fairs.  I have been pleased to visit Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom to support CBF's efforts and to see for myself the encouraging consumer response to the campaign.</P>
    <P>A combination of adequate EC support arrangements, an improved market <Col N="921" /> situation and a greatly enhanced promotion effort should lead to a more satisfactory position all round for our beef producers.</P>

      <P>These are EC rules relating to schemes fully-financed by the EC and I have no authority to alter them.  The retention clause under the EC suckler cow premium scheme does not cause all that much difficulty, however, as the suckler cows listed on the applications can be replaced during the six-months retention period by in-calf heifers or other suckler cows.  As for the retention period under the EC special beef premium scheme, I have eased the situation for farmers this year by allowing them to dispose of their fat cattle after the minimum two-months retention period has elapsed provided they submit the cattle identity cards of the cattle being sold to their local offices of the Department for scrutiny, punching and stamping before sending those cattle for sale.  I believe the difficulties which arose under this scheme in previous years should not arise in 1991, therefore.</P>

      <P>It can be expected that the objective of improved market balance will be given particular emphasis in the CAP reform proposals which are due to be presented to the EC Council within the next week. This should ultimately influence the quantities of product which will be taken into intervention in the future as Community support for agriculture is orientated more towards direct aid to producers.  In addition most State assistance to the industry is geared towards encouraging the development of nonintervention market led products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intervention stocks are already being utilised as part of the Community's food aid regime.  In addition, substantial quantities of food are also provided by the EC in emergency situations such as that <Col N="926" /> which arose recently in Iraqi Kurdistan. At home, welfare recipients are assisted through such initiatives as the social butter scheme and the EC free beef scheme each winter.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the importance of making maximum use of Community food stocks to help the needy both within the Community and outside and indeed I brought this point to the attention of my fellow Ministers and the Commissioner at the Agriculture Council on 22-23 April.</P>

      <P>I must point out also that all member states in the EC and most of our third country trading partners, apart from a few important Middle Eastern countries, accept that our cattle and beef are of the highest quality.  I will ensure that our efforts continue so as to convince a few remaining third countries that Irish cattle and beef are sound and wholesome.  Such efforts have already led to trade being maintained or renewed in many cases.</P>

      <P>Past experience with schemes of the kind referred to by the Deputy has been that in addition to their high cost it is particularly difficult to focus them on those in need, especially in view <Col N="927" /> of the requirement that borrowers must meet the normal criteria of credit-worthiness. Moreover, the benefit of a Eurocurrency scheme depends on the existence of a substantial difference between domestic interest rates and those of the foreign currency borrowed. The current difference is quite small, at between 1 per cent and 2 per cent.  There are no funds available to me to use for the purpose of subsidising such loans, even if it were possible to frame such action to be in conformity with Community rules of competition.</P>

      <P>I am aware that at a meeting of the European Parliament Committee on Development and Co-operation held in Dublin in May 1990 some concern was expressed by an Irish non-governmental organisation (NGO) about a condition <Col N="928" /> applying to an EC co-financing scheme to the effect that only viable projects, capable of developing to a point at which they can operate without further outside assistance, should receive EC funding.  It was argued that this condition made it difficult to secure co-financing of aid for the poorest populations.</P>
      <P>This condition applies to projects cofinanced under the EC Budget Heading 9410 which aims to help disadvantaged people in developing countries who normally do not benefit from official intergovernmental co-operation.  It has applied since this form of co-operation was initiated in 1976.  Moreover, it is one upon which NGOs themselves are generally agreed.  There are very many projects which do come within the requirements of the scheme.  These have been very successful and the EC Commission does not wish to divert their funds to other purposes.  Other budget headings are available to provide assistance to groups which do not meet the requirements of Budget Heading 9410.  These include provisions for food aid and humanitarian aid.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I do not feel that any initiative is required by the Government.</P>

      <P>Up to the time the recent concession was given by the EC Commission any 1990 special beef scheme applicants who had disposed of some of the male cattle listed on their applications before the expiry of the minimum two months retention period were refused all 1990 special beef premium.  The EC Commission has now agreed, however, to allow payment in such cases on the cattle that were not disposed of by those farmers provided the applicants met all other requirements of the 1990 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Commission have made it clear that this concession applied only for 1990 because it was a transitional year from full on-farm inspections under this scheme to a reduced level of inspections. <Col N="931" /> The concession does not apply to the 1991 special beef premium scheme and all applicants under that scheme must comply with the retention requirements of the scheme or face loss of all 1991 premium.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 166 of 15 November 1988 for details of rate support grant payments for the years 1980 to 1987, to Question No. 57 of 20 June 1991 for the amounts paid in 1990 and to Question No. 198 of 27 November 1990 for the 1991 allocations. The information requested in respect of 1979, 1988 and 1989 is set out in the following table.  The rate support grant varies from local authority to local authority because of differences in valuation levels and in rate poundages applied by authorities over the years.  These variations together with variations arising from other changes in local finances in recent years are reflected in differences in the rate support grant payments to individual local authorities.</P>

      <P>The completion of the Internal Market in regard to the rights of establishment for the self-employed, in so far as the matter falls within the area of responsibility of my Department, is being addressed in the context of General Directives on the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications.  The first General Directive (89/48/EEC) was <Col N="942" /> adopted by the Council on 21 December 1988 and provides for a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years duration.  This Directive was implemented by me on 2 January 1991 by a statutory instrument, S. I. No. 1 of 1991.  Directive 89/48/EEC applies to any national of an EC member state wishing to pursue a regulated profession in another member state in a self-employed capacity or as an employed person.</P>
      <P>A proposal for a complementary directive on a general system of mutual recognition of professional qualifications below the level of three years higher education is at present being negotiated in Council and the present indications are that a common position on this proposed directive will be reached before the end of 1991.  The complementary directive will apply to the self employed as well as to employed persons.</P>
