      <P>It is proposed to take Item No. 18. It is also proposed that in the debate on the financial motions by the Minister for Finance the following arrangements shall apply: (1) the speech of the main spokesperson nominated by each of the groups, as defined in Standing Order 89 (1) (a), shall not exceed 40 minutes and (2) the speech of each other Member called shall not exceed 20 minutes.</P>

      <P>It is now three months since the Taoiseach dismissed his colleague, the Minister for Defence. Despite efforts on our part to find out when he will appoint a new Minister for Defence, the Taoiseach has not been forthcoming with such information.  Does the Taoiseach consider the post to be of such insignificance he is not going to make a reappointment or will he inform the House whether he is going to reappoint a Minister for Defence?</P>

      <P>The question of who the Taoiseach appoints as Minister for Defence is obviously a matter of choice for himself but, in order to appoint a Minister for Defence, he needs to appoint an extra member of the Government. Under the Constitution the Government are now short one member. That is a matter for a decision of this House.  Therefore, can we have an indication from the Taoiseach when he proposes to make such appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to Deputy De Rossa that it is not possible to appoint an extra member of the Government.  The Constitution limits the numbers of members of the Government but the portfolio of the Minister for Defence will be filled very shortly. Deputies need have no anxiety about it; a perfectly suitable appointment will be made.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach, while it is indicated on list B that it is intended at some stage to bring forward a Bill to deal with the regularisation of certain foreign adoptions, in view of the urgency of this matter and its inherent anxiety for very many families who adopted children in unusual circumstances in the past year or so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am thinking, for example of the report dealing with part-time workers.  It would appear sensible to have the reports discussed around the same time as we discuss related legislation, for instance the legislation on part-time workers.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget shows that the priority of the Government is survival, not reform.  It is designed to enable the coalition partners to hang together for a period.  Decision-making, of any serious nature, is no longer a matter of interest to them.  This is bad for the country because we have huge problems which need to be solved by Government decision.</P>
      <P>The NESC drew attention to the fact that even with real economic growth of 3.75 per cent, much higher than the Government are projecting for this year on current policies, we will still have the same level of unemployment in 1994 as we have today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget offers no indication that the Government have any intention of changing any of the policies that the <Col N="1229" /> NESC predict will lead to that dismal result.  In fact they are quite complacent about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is indeed quite proud of the fact that he is only adding £462 million to the national debt this year.  That £462 million means that he is adding £7,660 to the national debt for each child that will be born in Ireland during 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These children will eventually have to repay that debt.  That is our bequest to them along with the burdens already loaded on them in 20 years of political cowardice in the management of the finances of this nation. The budget is built on very shakey foundations.</P>
      <P>It assumes that the Government will collect about £8.3 billion, or £400 million extra, in taxes in 1991 because the economy will grow by 2.25 per cent.  It also assumes, even more incredibly, that people will increase their spending on consumer goods by about 3.25 per cent. Yet a number of independent economists say the economy will only grow not by 2.25 per cent but a mere 1 per cent in 1991.  If that happens, the Government will not get in the taxes they are counting on, and the budget and its arithmetic will collapse.</P>
      <P>The budget also assumes that we will have an average level of unemployment next year of 228,000.  On that basis we will need to spend £3 billion on social welfare in 1991 &mdash; that is over a quarter of all Government spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well, if the economists are right, and the economy only grows at 1 per cent there will be more than 228,000 people unemployed in 1991.  Furthermore, if the British economy slumps, and more people return home from the building industry in Britain as many predict or as some say is already happening, the level of unemployment will grow even further. The really big unknown in this budget is emigration.  The Minister is banking on emigration continuing.  That hope underlies his entire budgetary arithmetic.  He <Col N="1230" /> hopes that emigration will relieve him of finding unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  If emigration stops or if unemployed emigrants return, the figure will go completely astray.  It is a budget founded on the continuance of emigration.</P>
    <P>The Government estimate that they will have to spend £2 billion on interest payments next year &mdash; almost two-thirds as much as they are spending on social welfare.  What happens if interest rates go up?  The Government's £2 billion bill will go up accordingly.  This week we saw the most unusual spectacle of the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, being told by the European Community that he is borrowing too much and that if he continues to do so he runs the risk that he will push up DM interest rates and thereby push everybody else's interest rates as well.  What happens if the German Finance Minister does not take the advice being proferred to him by President Jacques Delors and the European Commission?  Then our interest rates will go up too and the Minister will have to revise upwards the £2 billion figure which he has set aside to meet interest payments.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this year the Minister estimates that, on the one hand, he will collect about £8.5 billion in taxes. Against that he will spend £9 billion, but the £8.5 billion could be a serious overestimate because of slower growth and higher unemployment.  Likewise, the £9 billion on spending could be an underestimate: £2 billion of it &mdash; interest payments &mdash; could go up because of higher interest rates; £3 billion of it &mdash; social welfare &mdash; could go up because of higher unemployment and less emigration.  The gap could start widening quite quickly on both sides of the equation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of phoney elements even in the budget figures presented to us.  One-off savings on tax collections of £15 million are included as if they were recurrent revenue.  We are asked to believe that six different Departments in the past three weeks made so called &ldquo;estimating&rdquo; mistakes in their original 1991 Estimates published a few <Col N="1231" /> months ago, and that now they can suddenly &ldquo;save&rdquo; an extra £23 million through correcting estimating mistakes.  At the very best, all this is just a deferral of expenditure.</P>
    <P>The concessions announced in the budget will also cost a lot more in a full year than appears in the Minister's arithmetic. I estimate that the tax and social welfare concessions will cost almost £80 million more in a full year than is shown in the Minister's 1991 arithmetic.  These sorts of miscalculations do not matter very much if the wind is at your back and the international economy is buoyant, but they can be seriously aggravated if things begin to go wrong.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Gulf War on the international economy is incalculable. The Minister warned us earlier this month of the prospective costs of EC tax harmonisation.  He told us that the amount we are collecting from deposit interest retention tax, which currently brings in £300 million, would have to change drastically.  They were the Minister's words.  That was not reflected in any provision in the budget.  He admitted that our VAT and excise duties would have to move much closer to those in Britain.  In a Europe without frontier posts, wide divergencies in purchase taxes are literally impossible and unenforceable. The NESC calculate that the maximum divergence we could afford between our rates of excise duty and VAT and those applying in Britain is 3 per cent.  It could cost us £300 million to reduce our purchase taxes to levels that would be sustainable in a barrier-free Europe.  The budget ignores this problem.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that in a barrier-free Europe, neither taxes on income, taxes on spending nor taxes on capital can be kept at a higher level than taxes in other competing areas within the barrier-free European union.  This is particularly the case for poorer peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>Even without penal taxes, the Irish Central Bank, in a 1988 study, estimated that money and resources will naturally tend to flow, in a monetary union, from <Col N="1232" /> the poorer peripheral regions like Ireland towards richer central areas like Germany and Southern Britain.  So, if there is an added handicap of higher taxes in the peripheral region, the outflow of resources from Ireland to the central parts of the Community will be all the greater.  The budget makes no real provision to deal with that.</P>
    <P>There is another threat on the horizon &mdash; the dismantlement of the CAP and the introduction of what I would describe as an &ldquo;Indian reservation&rdquo; style of agricultural policy advocated by Commissioner MacSharry.  The farmers are to be paid to stay down on the farm so long as they produce nothing.  That is quite literally creating an Indian reservation where people will live in enforced idleness in rural Ireland.  I have the gravest fears about what that will do to the spirit of our people, yet that is being proposed by Commissioner Ray MacSharry in the name of reform of the CAP.</P>
    <P>The budget takes no account of the effect of Commissioner MacSharry's policies on the budget arithmetic or the Government's tax revenue.  Commissioner MacSharry's policies are specifically designed to destroy intensive commercial, grass-based livestock production in Ireland, yet this is the core of Ireland's agricultural economy.  The commissioner would meanwhile shift the advantage in agricultural competition in Europe away from grass-based production to grain-based livestock production systems of the type which are particularly competitive in continental Europe and uncompetitive here because of our climatic conditions.  He is shifting the advantage towards the Continent and away from Ireland.  Irish farmers are to be bought off with acreage-based payments designed to discourage intensive production. Commissioner MacSharry's proposals may be beneficial for some farmers but they will be disastrous for the Irish economy and disastrous for all those who make their living by selling things to commercial farmers who are in serious production or buying things from those farmers.  The entire economy which has <Col N="1233" /> been built around commerical agriculture, mostly employing people in the PAYE sector, will be destroyed by Commissioner MacSharry's proposals.  It will damage the tax base and reduce PAYE revenue but the Government have taken no account of the need to provide replacement revenue.</P>
    <P>These policy changes in the CAP will have a disproportionate effect on the Irish economy.  The IMF did a study some time ago to find out which European Community countries would suffer a net loss from the lower agricultural and food prices that would be caused by the dismantlement of the CAP.  This study showed that Ireland and Denmark would be the losers.  We are alone with the Danes at the negotiating table in Brussels defending the CAP.  The threat is very great of a loss in income to this country through the dismantlement of the CAP. That threat is entirely ignored in this budget.  All the other countries, including Ireland and Denmark would be unaffected once the consumer benefits of lower food prices were set against the agricultural losses of lower farm incomes, but there would be major revenue losses to the Irish Exchequer and to employment in the Irish food industry if the Common Agricultural Policy is undermined either by internal reforms or by concessions to the United States on export refunds for Irish products going to third countries.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that Commissioner Leon Brittan and the European Community Ambassador in the United States recently said, in the United States where presumably they have a favourable audience, that the European Commission is prepared to put a ceiling on export refunds.  That is a major climb down on the European Community's negotiating position and is the first indication of a collapse in the Community's negotiating position in defence of the Common Agriculutral Policy in these world trade talks. There has been no protest from the Irish Government against that statement by Commissioner Britten, no protest at all <Col N="1234" /> from either Commissioner MacSharry or Minister O'Kennedy about that matter. So we must assume that Commissioner Brittan and the EC ambassador were speaking with the approval of the Irish Government and the approval of the European Commission in making that very serious statement so far as Irish agriculture is concerned.  This budget ignores that danger entirely.</P>
    <P>To sum up the Minister's budgetary targets may be said to be vulnerable on five fronts.  First, there is the likelihood that there will be slower economic growth at home &mdash; that is in fact stated in the budget arithmetic.  Second, there is the strong possibility that there will be higher unemployment at home because of reduced emigration and lower economic growth.  Third, there is the possibility of higher internationl interest rates.  Fourth, there are the costs, for which the Minister has not made any provision, of EC tax harmonisation.  Fifth, there are substantial revenue losses on the horizon because of the dismantling of Ireland's major industry because of the Common Agricultural Policy being dismantled.</P>
    <P>The Government have made no attempt whatever to quantify, let alone prepare for, these five potential threats. They have committed themselves to substantial increases in public expenditure under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  They have stated that &ldquo;resources will have to be reallocated&rdquo; to meet the cost of these commitments. They give no clue at all, however, where this money might be found to pay for this extra expenditure.  The Government have actually committed themselves to increases in public spending covering three-quarters of the entire area of Government spending.  The Government have admitted in clear language that there will be cuts, so presumably such cuts will have to be made in the remaining one-quarter of public spending that the Government are not committed to increasing.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to know where the Government intend to make these cuts.  They have said they will make cuts. They have asked the social partners and <Col N="1235" /> this House to approve this budget on the basis of the proposed expenditure increases over the next few years, but they have told us nothing about the cuts. They are asking this House and the social partners essentially to buy a pig in a poke, to agree to something when they are only being told about the good features of the vehicle but not that there are many defects in the engine, that the vehicle is unlikely to start when the attempt is made to do so.  I do not think it is particularly good to ask the Irish people to buy the used car that is presented by this Government with its lack of commitment to consumer information.</P>
    <P>The Government have no clear fiscal target.  All they have stated is that &ldquo;the aim of fiscal policy will continue to be to reduce the national debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993&rdquo;.  Think about that for a minute.  What does it mean?  Does it mean anything at all, a Cheann Comhairle?</P>
    <P>All the Government are saying is that they must reduce the ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993.  They do not say when they will actually reach 100 per cent, if ever.  The word &ldquo;towards&rdquo; is put in there so that they will have an escape route at any time.  Nor does the Minister say, anywhere in yesterday's budget, what he expects the ratio to be at the end of 1991, or by the end of 1992.  We will not know whether he is progressing according to plan at any time between now and 1993.</P>
    <P>In any event, the debt/GNP ratio is like a mirage.  It is the relationship between the two figures either of which can vary up or down at any time.  One never knows how close one is to one's target until one has actually passed it.  A more unsuitable target for coherent planning would be hard to imagine.</P>
    <P>In any human endeavour there is no point in setting oneself a target unless one can tell, at any given time, how far one is away from it.  The target of debt/GNP ratio does not meet the test of being a useful target for management because we do not know, and the Government do not know, how far away we are from it at any given time, nor do <Col N="1236" /> the Government propose to indicate any milestones along the way to the target towards which they are moving.</P>
    <P>As far as the public finances are concerned, therefore, it can truthfully be said that the Government have no definite or clear target at all.  I wonder if the social partners, for whom the soundness of the national finances is obviously a matter of vital interest, have ever really studied the shaky financial foundations on which their concordat with the Government is based.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the content of the budget itself.  It is clear that tax reform has been abandoned; indeed, reform of any kind has been abandoned.  The Fianna Fáil minority Government, without the Progressive Democrats, actually had more of a commitment to tax reform than the present Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Coalition.  This shows that the Progressive Democrats are burned out as a force for reform.  Indeed, their presence in the Government this time is entirely negative.  They continue to hang around to haunt Fianna Fáil with memories of past feuds that should be long forgotten, thereby frightening their Fianna Fáil colleagues at the Cabinet table so much that Fianna Fáil are afraid to make any decision that could prove even slightly unpopular, but the Progressive Democrats are unable, themselves, to do anything about their own much vaunted reform programme.  This Government, consisting of two parts, is a classic case of mutual paralysis.  The Progressive Democrats have paralysed Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil have paralysed the Progressive Democrats, and nobody is doing anything about the problems of the country.  Quite literally, the Government is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats cannot keep their promises even in the areas in which they had ministerial office.  After a year and a half, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not yet produced a competition Bill which his own party was able to draft and present to this Dáil three years ago.  He has now been in office as Minister for Industry and Commerce for a year and a half and has not <Col N="1237" /> been able to produce a Bill with all the assistance of the officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce that his own party in Opposition were able to produce three years ago.  He is clearly not up to his job.  As a result of this failure the Minister for Finance had to say this year in regard to the reduction in VAT and the lack of competition in our economy that last year &ldquo;some businesses were shown not to have reduced prices following the VAT cut in the 1990 budget&rdquo;. Between the two of them, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have had a whole year to come up with an answer to the problem. Now all they say is that they &ldquo;will be working closely together to ensure that the customer gets full benefit this time&rdquo;. Is there anyone in this House who believes that, or believes them?  Frankly, I do not believe them.</P>
    <P>Without a competition Act, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, has negligently failed to produce, the Government simply do not have the legal means to ensure that the benefits of any VAT reduction are actually passed on to the consumer.  The VAT reductions will not be passed on to the consumer, but the VAT increases will most certainly be passed on because there is no competition in this economy and there is a Minister who has failed and failed again to produce the necessary legislation to create competition in this economy.</P>
    <P>It is significant also that the only area in which real, as distinct from &ldquo;estimating&rdquo;, cuts were made in spending in the past three weeks was in the job-creating bodies, which are the specific responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In SFADCo there was a cut of £1 million; the IDA had a cut of £1.3 million; science and technology had a cut of £1.65 million; and NADCORP had a cut of £1.5 million.  These are all job creating agencies which are the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I wonder was he away on the day the Estimates were discussed at Cabinet?  In my view if the Progressive Democrats devoted as much energy to <Col N="1238" /> job creation, to tax reform and to minding their own ministries as they did to so enthusiastically removing Deputy Lenihan from the Government, they might have more to show for the past year and a half.</P>
    <P>For a country that needs to develop employment, our present tax policy for foreign investment is perverse.  We should have a tax policy that would encourage foreign companies to locate labour or brain-intensive parts of their worldwide business here in Ireland.  In fact we have a tax policy that is quite the reverse of that.  Fine Gael question the wisdom of the Fianna Fáil promise to continue with a maximum of a 10 per cent corporate tax rate up to the year 2010.  If we want foreign firms to create really permanent jobs here in Ireland, we must get them to set up their research and marketing operations here.  It is only if that part of their business is in Ireland that any of the jobs here will be really secure.  But a 10 per cent tax, a low corporate tax policy, which Fianna Fáil want to continue up to the year 2010, actually encourages multi-national companies to keep research and development and marketing operations out of Ireland at all costs.  This is because marketing and research cost money, and things that cost money are expenses which may be set off against tax.  In order to minimise tax you locate operations that cost money where you can get the maximum set off against the maximum rate of corporate tax.  So the lower the tax rate, and our industrial policy is based on having a low tax rate and virtually nothing else of interest to industrialists, the less value you get from a tax deduction.  As a result companies will not locate their R &amp; D or marketing operations or things that cost money in this country but will locate them somewhere else in their worldwide network of locations.  They will locate in Ireland high profit, low cost and low skill elements of their operation &mdash; in other words precisely the type of operation that we do not want is being attracted here and the type of operations that we want is being dissuaded from coming here.  That is the essence of our industrial policy at <Col N="1239" /> present, presided over by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance in an economy in which 228,000 people are unemployed.  It is a perverse and bad industrial policy, which should be changed.</P>
    <P>There has been some quite ill-informed criticism of the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as far as public service pay is concerned.  The Government postponed certain pay increases due in 1987, 1988 and 1989 until 1991 and 1992.  At the time they made these postponements the Government were congratulated by most of the academic economists for having done so.  Now these same economists and critics are complaining that the money has to be found in 1991.  I do not make that criticism.  The money is due and should be paid.</P>
    <P>However, there is one thing I do question. I question why the Government failed, in the course of the recent negotiations to get agreement that public service conciliation and arbitration schemes be amended for the future so as to require arbitrators to formally take account of the state of the national finances in deciding pay awards.  Arbitrators at present, and this is why we have a problem with special pay increases, are required to ignore the state of the nation's finances in making their awards.  That is why the awards are so generous.  They are required by the terms of their conciliation and arbitration scheme to ignore &mdash; and being good lawyers they always follow their terms of reference &mdash; the state of the nation's finances and concentrate solely on pay relativities.  That is why we constantly have not only basic increases in pay but also an ever-enlarging pile of special pay increases on top of them.</P>
    <P>Having a conciliation and arbitration scheme that formally ignores the state of the nation's finances at any given time is ridiculous.  It should be changed.  Fianna Fáil had an opportunity during the negotiations on the recent programme to attempt by agreement &mdash; I emphasise &mdash; to have this changed.  Fianna Fáil failed to raise this matter in the past few months <Col N="1240" /> and they failed to negotiate a change in this unrealistic aspect of public service pay determination in Ireland: a classic action of a Government that can look no further ahead than six months.  It might have cost them some money this year and they were not interested in it as they have no sense of the long term interest of this country.</P>
    <P>The tax provisions of the budget are deceptive.  Rates of tax have, of course, been reduced but tax bands and tax allowances remain virtually unchanged.  Some people will find that as a result of pay increases the top slice of their income will be moving into the 48p band from the 30p band and they will thus lose more by this than they will gain from the slight reduction in the 30p band.  This will not happen to everybody but the people who will suffer in this context are those whose incomes are at or just below the average industrial wage &mdash; the classic case of the people in the PAYE sector.  A person at or below the industrial wage will find that his income from work is too high to benefit from the increases that the budget offers in exemption limits while being too low to benefit from the cuts in the top tax rate, that the Minister has also made in this budget.  A workers on the average industrial wage or just below it gains nothing at all from this budget, in fact he will suffer quite considerably from it.  He is further adversely affected by the fact that the Government failed to adjust the PRSI and PAYE allowances in line with inflation.  The worker in the middle to lower income groups and in the PAYE sector is suffering under this budget in order that those at higher levels and elsewhere in the economy can gain.</P>
    <P>Much has been made by Government spokesmen of the increases that have been granted in the family income supplement and in the exemption limits for those on lower incomes.  It has been suggested that these measures are designed to ease the burden on low income families with children.  I believe the use of exemption limits and the use of the family income supplement is not the best way to help those people.  In fact, the use of exemption limits and the family income <Col N="1241" /> supplement actually creates new poverty traps in the tax and social welfare code for people at or below the average industrial wage.  These people find that if they do some overtime and go over the income tax exemption limit they suddenly lose their family income supplement.  When they go above the income tax exemption limit they face a very steep increase in the rate of tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be able to finish my speech at that rate.  For such families the prospect of a little bit of overtime work must be especially unwelcome. The overtime may also cost them their medical card and push up their differential rent.</P>
      <P>I believe that these families should be helped by the reintroduction of a child tax allowance and by the introduction of a single universal taxable child benefit, payable to all whether on social welfare or at work.  This would remove all poverty traps and would give low income families a genuine chance to cease to be low income families and to become, through their own efforts, middle income families instead.  Fine Gael want changes like this, because we believe that Ireland's problems can be solved if we unleash the energies of our people.  The Minister made a big deal yesterday of the fact that he was not changing mortgage interest tax relief.  He seems to have forgotten that many mortgages nowadays are in the form of endowment mortgages which have a strong life assurance element.  His decision to cut the life assurance tax relief will hit these families and these mortgage holders very hard indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the business expansion scheme to eliminate asset-backed investments are a direct reversal of a Fianna Fáil initiative taken in 1987.  I believe the 1987 decision was wrong and I am glad it has been reversed but I fail to understand why there is any need to limit companies to £500,000 under the BES.  If genuine <Col N="1242" /> jobs are being created, why limit growth in this way?</P>
    <P>The personal limit of £50,000 relief makes no sense either, other than as an expression of begrudgery.  If the tax relief is creating jobs, and that is its purpose, what is the need to limit the extent to which any one taxpayer can avail of it?</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister is still negotiating on a 24-hour rule, to replace the 48-hour rule on cross-Border purchases which was declared illegal by the European Court.  I want to ask a question.  Is the 48-hour rule still in operation, pending the introduction of the 24-hour rule? If so, are goods being confiscated under it?  If they are, then the Revenue Commissioners are engaging in flagrant law breaking, in defiance of constitutional rights.  If this is happening &mdash; and I believe I am right &mdash; it is a scandal.</P>
    <P>I believe that the health aspects of the budget are particularly deceitful.  The Minister is giving health boards an extra £8 million but they have already accumulated deficits of £20 million.  Meanwhile, they are being asked to cater for extra patients from the higher income groups who are now eligible for free hospitalisation. In effect, the Government so far as hospital beds are concerned have reduced the resources available and increased demand.  That is a recipe for longer waiting lists in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I see that the bank levy is being retained for another year.  This is an arbitrary tax, justifiable only as a temporary expedient.  It would make more sense if the Government were to investigate the high margins being charged by banks on interest rates to their borrowers over the interest paid to their depositors and if they were to look at the excessive charges to small businesses.  The budget does nothing about that.</P>
    <P>This budget has failed to do anything about the problem of our transport policy.  We have a chaotic transport policy, with three different Departments being responsible, with nobody really in charge and with transport costs here twice what they are in other countries.</P>
    <P>There are some improvements in <Col N="1243" /> education which are welcome but no targets have been set for Irish education. We should have an external audit of Irish education to see how our standards actually compare with those being achieved in other countries.  We should get away from the tyranny of the written exam which is stultifying the brains of our young people and move towards a system of continuous assessment involving teachers under an externally moderated scheme.</P>
    <P>The agricultural aspects of the budget are particularly disappointing.  There is no clear programme for the future, just a series of minor adjustments.  Indeed one of the cuts in the budget, which was hidden away in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> is a reduction of £5 million in the amount available for rural development.</P>
    <P>This budget shows that the Government have run out of steam.  They are living from day to day.  They do not, any longer, have the ideas needed to overcome the challenges of the next decade. It is Fine Gael's job to let the Irish people see that this Government have run out of ideas and to show the people of Ireland, in the next five months that this party, the Fine Gael Party, have the ideas necessary to unleash the energies of the Irish people, to take the decisions that must be taken in respect of the urgent and difficult challenges we are facing as a nation.  We are able and willing to do the job and the sooner we have the opportunity to do it the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some items in the budget presented yesterday by the Minister for Finance which I want to talk about: unemployment, housing, agriculture and especially the health area for which I have responsibility as Labour Party spokesman.  The Minister for Finance is a racing man.  He is a man who likes to have a bet, like many a punter in this country.  When he attends the race courses he sees the man with the three card trick because that is the first greeting when you attend most race courses in Ireland: you see the table, you see the <Col N="1244" /> man with the three cards; now you see the trump, now it is gone from you and then you see it again.  Rarely does the person playing the cards with these tricksters get any benefit for themselves.  One could summarise yesterday's budget as being in that same league.</P>
      <P>This morning nobody, whether commentators, economists, working people, taxpayers, unemployed or sick people, can see any hope of an improvement for themselves.  Yesterday's budget was an instrument which the Government could have used to improve job opportunities, to improve the health services to make an impact on the daily lives of the people of this country and for those emigrants who will return because of the collapse of the British and American economies. Nobody who is unemployed, depending on levels of unemployment assistance, can hope to see an improvement in their overall situation at the end of 1991 as compared with the end of 1990.  The first problem they will face under the provisions of this budget will be the difficulty in obtaining gainful employment in their own country a matter that should be the concern of all Governments and particularly the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>There is no idea in any of the Minister's speech yesterday which would indicate there is a commitment by this Government to tackle the scourge of unemployment or to improve people's standards of living.  Certainly, there are basic minimum increases in social welfare for the unemployed in or about the inflation rate of 4 per cent but there are no programmes to create jobs which we all want.  People who are condemned to the dole queues would love to have an opportunity to work in their own country. Because of the number of emigrants returning, the dole queues will grow longer.  It is obvious from the figures published by this Government that they expect the dole queues to get longer because this budget has had to take account of these figures before they were published in the knowledge that it was inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of housing for our people has been almost neglected in this budget.  It <Col N="1245" /> certainly has been neglected by the Government over the past number of years in the number of new housing starts in any of the county council areas.  New house starts are almost negligible.  Now this Government are referring back to a procedure to give an incentive to people to leave local authority houses and go into private housing and in that way to try to address the crisis in the housing waiting lists.  This system was in place previously but this Government and the previous Fianna Fáil minority Government abolished it because, according to the Minister, the best people were being taken out of the local authority housing areas.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made already this morning to agriculture.  Public meetings are taking place throughout the country on the problems in the sector and on the revision of the Common Agricultural Policy.  People in rural Ireland know that one of the ways they can survive is by getting assistance from the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The lists for the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme are almost a public scandal.  At public meetings which I, and my colleagues in the Labour Party, attended secret lists of disadvantaged areas were exposed by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Some of their colleagues do not have these lists and nobody is sure which areas are included or excluded.  No procedure has been put in place whereby appeals can be made for the inclusion of areas which are not included.  There is certainly no evidence to suggest that the Government have made any effort to reclassify existing disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme which is almost 70 per cent funded by the European Community gives poor people in rural areas an income to enable them to remain in their own hinterland.  These people do not want to be shepherded into villages and towns where they will be unhappy and will not have adequate housing or jobs.  The Government have failed to avail of the opportunity to reclassify the disadvantaged areas and include as many areas as possible in the scheme.  If they had done that it would <Col N="1246" /> have given some hope of survival to the people who live in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It is an accepted economic fact that as 70 per cent of the funds needed for this scheme is provided by the European Community, taking into account the additionality required by the Government, this scheme can be self-financing if it is operated to the maximum extent possible by including the maximum number of areas and beneficiaries and easing the regulations which the Government put in place as part of the programme.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the health services which are of concern to Deputies on all sides of the House.  Some time ago the Taoiseach admitted he was not aware of the extent of the problems in the health services.  In his budget speech yesterday the Minister for Finance said that £8 million will be provided for community care, £4 million of which he will borrow, beg or remove from the national lottery. We support the channelling of additional funds into the health services from whatever source they come.  The needs in this area have been identified by the professionals involved.  Who does the Minister think he is kidding by providing £8 million to deal with the crisis in community care?  One million pounds has been identified as the appropriate sum for the handicapped.  However, last year the Government gave an additional £2 million to the handicapped which, to use the Minister's words, provided 140 extra places.  I should like the Minister to say if these 140 extra places were provided and, if so, where they were provided.  If 140 extra places were provided with £2 million last year, how many places will be provided this year for the handicapped? Going on last year's figures, only 70 extra places will be provided for them.</P>
    <P>What have the professionals suggested is necessary for the handicapped, both adult and non-adult?  They say that at least 2,000 places are needed.  What are the Government doing for the handicapped or their loved ones who have to look after them?  What are they doing for this category of people to whom we all have a commitment?  The Government <Col N="1247" /> say they have a commitment to these people but what have they done for them in monetary terms?  They have insulted them by providing a miserly £1 million, half of which will come from lottery funds, for additional places.  I do not think any Deputy would disagree if the Government invested £10 million for the next seven years in these services.  We would be willing to allow them invest £70 million in services for the handicapped even if &mdash; I am being honest about this &mdash; it meant we had to forfeit money from other areas.  That is the commitment the Government should make to the handicapped; it is a commitment we have made to these people.</P>
    <P>Today is a crisis day for many health boards.  Some of the figures are on record and I want to refer to some of them.  As I speak, the Southern Health Board in my region are holding a crisis meeting. This board have a deficit of £1.8 million and the Government have refused to help them.  After the budget, and the Estimates which were published last December, this board will have a deficit of £1.8 million.  The members of that board, the majority of whom are members of the Fianna Fáil Party, are now faced with the dilemma of having to curtail their services further and close wards.  Today medical card holders are entitled to the transport service but tomorrow that service may not be available for them.  Tomorrow medical card holders in south Tipperary who live 40 miles from an acute hospital will have to hire a taxi to take them to hospital if the health board decide today to cut back on transport.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the beds the Government, and the previous minority Fianna Fáil, Government closed in 1987 are still closed and that staff who were made redundant have still not been reemployed. These problems still exist in the health board areas.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Minister said he will extend eligibility to these services to all people. How can he extend eligibility for beds in hospitals if the beds are not available and wards have been closed?  Recently on <Col N="1248" />&ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; the Minister said he will not open any extra beds and will not employ any additional nurses.  Who is being fooled in this debate about what the Government will or will not do in regard to health services?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the waiting lists in the region with which I am most familiar, the south-east region.  On 31 December 1990, one month ago, 2,453 patients were waiting for operations while 5,014 outpatients were waiting for beds.  In January the Government agreed to a programme which will make everybody eligible for a hospital bed at a time when there are no beds available for the people who are eligible.  I would ask the Minister if we are really serious about what we are doing.</P>
    <P>We made a big play of not changing the tax relief on VHI premiums.  We now tell people who have VHI cover that they cannot get a bed in a public hospital because the number of private beds in public hospitals is negligible.  One would say: &ldquo;let them go to the Blackrock Clinic&rdquo;, but the Blackrock Clinic has its limitations too.  If people want cover for that clinic their premiums will be exorbitant. I am particularly concerned about people with medical cards and those who pay PRSI contributions towards health services.  A 25 per cent increase in hospitals charges for the first ten days in hospital was announced by the Minister in Christmas week and was opposed in this House by us.  We will be putting down a motion to rescind this draconian measure.</P>
    <P>We are now extending eligibility to all those people but there are not enough beds to cater for them.  We should be honest with the people we represent and tell them that this Minister in particular has presided over the destruction of the health services.  I admit it was by no means a perfect service when the Minister came to office but at least it had been protected from the worst effects of the cutbacks in previous years.  One indication of the way in which it had been protected was that throughout the four years during which Barry Desmond was Minister, spending on health services was <Col N="1249" /> kept constant as a proportion of national wealth.  Mr. Desmond was criticised on so many occasions in this House that it was nauseating to listen to.  The present Minister occasionally when he is under pressure reverts to criticisms of Barry Desmond, one of which is that he allowed health boards to over-spend.  The health boards consist of a majority of Fianna Fáil people who vote for spending. The health boards who have been careful about spending are still overspending because they are not getting enough money from the Government to carry out the minimum service required by the Minister.  The budget is so tight that they are unable to carry out their work properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not too far away.  It is nice to be able to quote him in the context of some of the figures he made available and the changes he made in health boards, whom this Government have totally neglected ever since.  It is an indication of what this Government seem to be comfortable with when they talk about borrowing, the Exchequer borrowing requirement or the current budget deficit.  They always say: &ldquo;Look how much we are reducing these things by as a proportion of our national wealth or GNP&rdquo;, but if you apply that to the health service the crisis becomes clear immediately.</P>
      <P>As Barry Desmond said when in office, we were spending £7 out of every £100 of national wealth on our health service. After three years of this Government that figure has been reduced to £5.90 out of every £100.  That is an indication of the crisis in the health service.  This Government have not maintained the level of spending on health as did Barry Desmond and the Government in which we were a partner, and, as we know, that was not a perfect system.  In real terms every percentage point of national wealth is equal to £190 million.  That means that in real terms we are spending £210 million less on our health services this year than we did in 1987 when Barry Desmond was the Minister. If we keep the spending constant for the next four years as a proportion of national wealth we will have invested £1 billion less in the health services than when Barry Desmond was Minister.  The Minister can put that in his pipe and smoke it.  This is supposed to be a period of economic and social progress. Those are the relevant figures and they indicate why there is a crisis in the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1991 Estimates the Minister allocated an extra £100 million to the Department of Health, but he failed to enlighten us that he was bringing in a Supplementary Estimate of £37.5 million. Why did he have to do that?  Because the 1991 Estimates were already seen to be <Col N="1251" /> deficient, requiring a Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister based his projections for this year on the 1990 figures before he readjusted them.  Therefore the real increase for the health services is not £100 million but just over £60 million when you take into account the shortfall, which we had to vote for separately before Christmas.  I questioned then how the budgeting of health boards could have reached such a point, with a £20 million deficit, and I will put on the record the figures for the various health boards as I proceed.</P>
    <P>Here we have £60 million plus the £8 million provided for in yesterday's budget, but if we taken into account the increase of 4 per cent proposed in the programme for national recovery for the nursing and hospital staff, community care workers, public health nurses and hospital consultants, together with a cost of living increase, it is a very paltry sum. Increased demands will be made on health boards for supplementary welfare allowances and disabled person's maintenance allowances, all of which have been increased in the budget.  It is in that context that we should consider the additional funding for the health boards.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister was interviewed on Pat Kenny's radio show one morning and I spent three-quarters of an hour trying to get through on the telephone but so many people were trying to talk to him that I was unable to get through.  It is appropriate that the public would have an opportunity to give their views to the Minister, and today I have the opportunity to put forward my view. On that programme in reply to a question from a listener the Minister admitted that he was not going to hire one additional nurse or indeed to provide or reopen one single hospital bed.  This admission by the Minister for Health immediately implied that there would be no reduction whatsoever in the waiting lists which I have identified in the south-east &mdash; the position is the same throughout the country. There will still be long queues of people waiting for hospital beds.  This is not <Col N="1252" /> taking into account the Minister's proposal in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to give equal access to the health services to everybody in the community.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have always been committed to a comprehensive health service.  They want it free at the point of access, funded by general taxation, and we have been to the forefront in campaigning for this basic right.  Unfortunately, the Minister, because of his proposals in the programme, appears to have aspirations only instead of something realistic.  When you take his promises into account and compare them with what has been allocated in the budget and the Estimates, it is obvious that extra resources are needed if we are to live up to the challenge of the programme and the promises made. Under the provisions of the programme the Minister stated that people with incomes of over £16,000 will now be eligible for free consultants' treatment in a free public bed.  That is untrue because it is not possible to do this, especially since Fianna Fáil came back to Government. Their minority Government introduced hospital charges excluding medical card holders.  People paying pay related social insurance, including a fraction for the health services, were asked to pay an additional cost for the bed for the first ten days in a hospital.  Before Christmas the Minister increased that charge by 25 per cent, to £12.50 per day.  We have tabled a Private Members' Motion to nullify that order although we will not get the support of the House in that regard. However, it is appropriate that the public should know what is going on in regard to this three card trick which can be applied to any section of the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister also failed to comprehend that the abolition of the income limit for eligibility for free hospital consultant care would cause overloading in the public system.  One does not have to be an economist or a genius to work out that if you give everybody eligibility without the beds being available one cannot deliver the goods.  It can be compared to a car with four seats and the owner promising <Col N="1253" /> to drive ten people.  How can you drive ten people in a four seater car?  You cannot so the other six are left on the waiting list.  The Minister is now telling everyone that they are entitled to a drive in this four seater car instead of providing seats in a bus.  How can you tell people that hospital beds are available if they do not exist?</P>
    <P>Extra money is needed to open hospital beds.  The sum of £8 million provided yesterday is in the community care area and it is welcome as there has been a scarcity of community care workers for many years.  We never really addressed the problem, even when the Taoiseach was Minister for Health, and wanted to increase the number of workers in the health service.  I welcome the extension of the community care assistance scheme. I hope it will increase the number of public health nurses and ensure that they have transport to get to people.  There should also be an extension of eligibility for home help because there are old people in all constituencies who will not be kept in acute hospitals and who cannot go into sub-acute hospitals because the Minister has closed them.  The hospital beds which the Minister closed at the non-acute level would have been the cheapest form of looking after people who needed to recuperate after an operation. Sometimes the only alternative for these people is to go home and often there is only a pensioner there who is unable to look after the patient who has been discharged.  Of course the public health nurse does her best, she assists in putting the patient into a wheelchair and promises to be back in two hours to help in getting him out but, very often, she is unable to fulfil her promise.</P>
    <P>There are fewer beds available in geriatric hospitals and we must wait for people to die before others can be admitted. At the geriatric level the need for beds is becoming greater because people are living longer &mdash; which is good and an indication of good care &mdash; but we must take account of their needs in the community because that is where we want to keep them.  We need more community care and public health workers and home <Col N="1254" /> helps.  There should also be a revamping of the carer's allowance which the Minister for Social Welfare introduced.  The odium of the means test must be removed.  This need exists in Tipperary and in every other constituency.  I could give examples forever but I do not want to embarrass the families concerned.</P>
    <P>Unfortunate general practitioners are being subjected to pressure from families and they, in turn, tell the families to contact their local Deputy who might be able to help.  The doctor cannot convince the hospital that a patient should be admitted although at times hospitals are forced to succumb to pressure because the need is there.  It is embarrassing to have to beg for a legitimate entitlement under the Health Act, 1970.  Perhaps the Minister, instead of saying that all workers are entitled to a public hospital bed, should say that everybody is entitled to a free general practitioner service, which might solve the problem.  Perhaps we should review the guidelines in relation to medical cards, maybe we should make it possible for more people to be able to afford to go to their local GP and perhaps if he treated them from the very beginning people might not finish in hospital beds, the most expensive medical care there is.  We should extend medical care at the point of delivery, that is the GP, but it cannot be done if there are rigid guidelines in relation to medical cards which are based on gross pay and which bear no relation to the take-home pay of unfortunate people who are paying large taxes, rent and/or mortgages.  Their take home pay is slightly above the medical card limit and they neglect their health because they are unable to afford £10 or £12 to their local doctor two or three times a week, which they often have to do, to stay as healthy as possible so that they can work to pay their mortgage.  If the Minister wants to revolutionise the health service perhaps he should deal with the question of community care. However, the sum of £8 million will not address the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs additional funds to be able to cope with the crisis of bed numbers.  How does he propose to service <Col N="1255" /> or deal with the extra workload if this proposal is to be funded?  Has the Minister even discussed this with the people operating the system?  Has he talked to the consultants in hospitals to tell them how he would like their work practices to change?  Has he discussed with them the obvious loss of income they will suffer as a result of this new system?  Have the consultants a common contract with the Minister?  How will the Minister convince doctors that they should make changes when their livelihood is affected?  Other Ministers, from time to time, tried to do this, but, without proper consultation with people in influential and important positions, the outcome was not successful. If you disregard the people at the coal-face delivering the service you will immediately be subjected to aggravation and disagreement.  The Minister's pious aspirations, outlined in the programme, will be set at nought.  The ink used to write the programme in regard to health will not even be dry when we find that we will not be able to deliver it.  I suggest therefore that he immediately enter into consultations with the consultants to ensure that this grandiose scheme can be put in place, but not at the expense of medical card holders who are at present entitled to a service and who are on waiting lists.  If he is serious about this I suggest that he enter into negotiations. Indeed, it would appear that he is in breach of the contract which the Minister present agreed with the consultants.  He was careless almost to the point of being irresponsible in announcing a radical proposal without accompanying it with a detailed outline of the necessary allocation of resources, of which no mention was made in the budget, and without the agreement of those who will be expected to operate it.  Regard must be had to people's rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is already well aware of this.  After all, it was he who tried to extend the dental scheme, which was welcome, to the spouses of insured workers but without the agreement of those who operate the <Col N="1256" /> scheme.  As a result only a very small number of spouses have benefited.  I supported the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>The Deputy will be glad to hear that the number now stands at 265 dentists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is improving slowly but how many dentists would the Minister like to see taking part?  If he had got their agreement, they would be taking part.</P>
      <P>The effect of the health cuts is visible all around us.  As we debate the budget, health boards are preparing to debate the services which will have to be cut, the number of beds which will have to be closed, even though the Minister said he does not want to see any beds closed and what staff they will have to let go in order to live within the allocations made by the Minister &mdash; no provision has been made for these areas in the budget either.  Is it nonsense then for the Minister to attempt to tell us that the number of beds will be maintained at last year's level?  Is it legitimate for us to ask how this will be done?  I hope the Minister will answer those questions.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister propose, for instance, to deal with the crisis at the hospital in Kilkenny where there is overcrowding and people have to be treated in the corridors?  Both the Minister and the Taoiseach have seen the position at first hand.  Indeed, this matter was raised in the House by Deputy Pattison and me yesterday by way of question.  A sum of £140,000 is needed and the people in Kilkenny and I, as spokesperson for the Labour Party, want to know if this hospital will receive the extra funds which are urgently required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the Tallaght hospital project? Can the Minister deny or confirm that this project has been deferred for another year, despite all the promises made by himself and the Government that a new hospital would be built?  The figure for the Western Health Board stands at £3.2 million, £4 million for the Southern Health Board and £1.8 million <Col N="1257" /> for the South-Eastern Health Board where a crisis meeting has just begun &mdash; and no attempt was made in the budget to deal with that crisis &mdash; the NorthEastern Health Board £2 million, and the list goes on.</P>
    <P>If we take into account the proposed cutbacks for this year, the crisis in the health service will become a major political talking point.  We do not want this to happen but we have a responsibility to ensure that the Minister is aware of this. Indeed, we hope the Taoiseach is listening, unlike two years ago when he had to admit that he did not realise there was a crisis.  The health boards of which Fianna Fáil councillors and Senators, including the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, are members will confirm that there is a crisis.</P>
    <P>Whatever else they may claim, the one thing that the Government cannot claim is that the people have given them a mandate on health.  The electorate gave them a very clear message but it has been totally ignored by them. I would remind them at the beginning of a new decade that they have a major responsibility to the poor, the underprivileged, the sick, the lonely and the handicapped.  I also wish to emphasise that the handicapped, despite all the promises, still find themselves in a crisis, and I ask the Minister to address their plight in his reply to this debate as the public are entitled to know what the Government intend doing in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways this is a &ldquo;stay as you are&rdquo; budget which is all very well if one is happy where they are, but approximately one-third of our people are not allowed to participate in the economy in any manner consistent with a decent standard of living.  If they had any expectations of some improvements in this budget they would have been very severely disappointed indeed.  Anybody in the two-thirds one-third society we now have, and which this budget reinforces, who expected the Minister to use the opportunity of the annual budget to improve their position and give some of them the opportunity to go back to <Col N="1258" /> work, has been gravely disappointed.  It is a totally standstill budget; it leaves us as we were.  Those of us who are fortunate enough to be in employment and on a reasonable income way be able to tolerate that in the context of the current international climate, but for those people at the bottom of the heap it is a gross disappointment.</P>
      <P>The budget actually predicts, forecasts and plans for an increase in the number of people out of work.  That projection &mdash; just under 4,000 people being added to the live register &mdash; is a gross underestimate. I will return to this later. However, it seems that, as the Taoiseach can manage to usurp the functions of the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Defence, he would have very little difficulty taking over the role of the Department of Finance if the budget is to be the measure of the ingenuity and imagination the Minister put into it.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of unimaginative and penny-half-penny budget which could have been produced on auto pilot.  At best, it is a conjurer's budget rather than a budget of a Finance Minister who has a fiscal strategy for the country.  It confuses tax reform with tax reductions which are more imaginary than real and it continues the policy of social welfare relief rather than social welfare reform.  As I said, it actually makes provision for an increase in the live register from 224,700 people to 228,000 people.  It is a budget which accepts the divisions in our society today and proposes to sell off one of our most successful State companies at a time when market conditions could not be more gloomy.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech contains as much disinformation and hype as the average press release from the Pentagon or Baghdad.  On closer scrutiny it would appear that the Minister has made tax concessions to consumers and taxpayers of the order of £170 million while imposing new taxes on the same consumers and taxpayers to the extent of about £135 million on a hit and miss basis. There is no strategy, direction, plan or overview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> It may be claimed by the Government that there is an objective to reduce the standard rate of tax to 25 per cent by 1993.  I dispute vehemently that such a move constitutes real tax reform or a strategy on personal taxation.  In the area of indirect taxation there is nothing but confusion and making it up as you go.  If the cost of harmonisation is agreed by all sides of the House to be of the order of £600 million, it is impossible to detect where the Government are headed on indirect taxes.  The reduction in the 23 per cent rate was virtually obligatory as a result of imminent harmonisation, so the Minister concedes £98 million with one hand and takes back £61 million with the other hand by increasing the 10 per cent rate to 12.5 per cent.  The latter measure is especially regrettable since it will aggravate the marginal position of low income groups and cause further hardship to the old and poor who will now pay more for their heating fuel.</P>
    <P>The Minister's words yesterday must be measured against the evidence from the ESRI survey on income distribution <i>Poverty and Usage of State Services</i> which shows the alarming figure that just under one in every five households under the poverty line are paying income tax or PRSI.  This highlights the absurdity of the prevailing obsession that if only we had a standard rate of tax of 25 per cent we would have achieved tax equity. Nothing could be further from the truth. The equity issue concerns how quickly a family on low income becomes liable to income tax.  How quickly do they come into the tax net?  That is the equity issue.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to make the ritual claim that his new tax exemption limits will take 18,000 people out of the tax net is no more than meaningless rhetoric. The ink was scarcely dry on his script before that statement was invalidated, and I will explain that to the Minister because it cannot be challenged.  The new tax exemption limits are equivalent to an increase of 4.6 per cent, but the workers targeted here will have received a pay increase of 4 per cent when and if the trade unions accept the terms of the <Col N="1260" /><i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> However, since the category of workers we are talking about are obviously in the low income bracket, a floor of £5 is provided in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> In other words, if your pay increase of 4 per cent comes to less than £5 you must get a floor of £5.  The obvious impact of that for somebody, for example, paying tax at £70 a week is that we will get a £5 increase, which is equivalent to 7 per cent, and that brings him back into the tax net.  For somebody earning £100 a week the £5 minimum pay requirement under the programme is equivalent to 5 per cent; so for that unfortunate category of workers earning in the region of £100 or less, as soon as the pay agreement becomes operable &mdash; and, of course, it will become operable retrospectively in some cases if it is accepted by the trade unions depending on the expiry dates of particular company-union agreements across industry &mdash; they will be back in the tax net. So much for the claim that we have taken people out of the tax net and for some of the facile coverage one had time to glance at or listen to this morning which suggested this did something for the lower paid and that somehow disproportionately they benefited.  They did nothing of the kind and the argument I have advanced in the taxation area is repeated despite protestations to the contrary in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Social Welfare in the House because he very expertly communicates the contents of the budget to give the impression that somehow there has been major progress on this occasion.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  You can do anything with statistics.  I thought the highlight was the commentator this morning who said the general increase of 4 per cent is quite generous because it is 25 per cent ahead of the expected inflation rate, in other words, inflation was predicted at about 3 per cent, and the general social welfare increase is 4 per cent, the implication being that the 1 per cent increase was equivalent to an increase of 25 per cent. Did you ever hear a greater abuse of <Col N="1261" /> language?  The recipients of the 4 per cent general increase will be very fortunate indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is actually 33? per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes it even more fantastic.  It proves you can do anything with figures.  What does it give the social welfare recipient?  For a start, I do not accept that the Minister can predict with any certainty that the inflation rate will be about 3 per cent.  It is extremely difficult in present international conditions to make that claim.</P>
      <P>I recall the remarks the Minister made yesterday on the question of interest rates and how favourably we have been doing, which we have compared to our major partners in the EC and especially our link to the German economy.  However, it is very interesting to note that the policy of the present Conservative Government in Germany seems to be to bear the brunt of the unification of Germany through monetary policy rather than through fiscal measures.  If that continues and if the German Government refuse to impose taxes to pay for the cost of unification, that will have a serious impact on our interest rates before this year is out.  That kind of expectation, leaving out any impact a worsening in the Gulf might have, poses very serious question marks over the projection here.  In any event, to pretend that for general social welfare recipients a 4 per cent basic increase is something to write home about is ridiculous; it would scarcely do more than pay for the stamp.  Much more was needed for those in receipt of the basic social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child dependant welfare allowance is another area where the Minister made the most of statistics.  The Workers' Party pre-budget submission argued that child dependant allowances ought to be on the basis of a fixed percentage of the adult rate.  Anybody who has children will understand why that should be the case. The cost of clothing, rearing children and so on, can very easily be related to a <Col N="1262" /> reasonable percentage of the adult rate. What the Minister did was increase the lowest rate of £11 by £1, a 9 per cent increase, bringing the allowance to the princely sum of £12.  Our proposition of 40 per cent of the basic adult rate would be 40 per cent of £55, or £22, which, incidentally, I understand is the same proposal put in a different way by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors who suggested it should be doubled.</P>

      <P>Forty per cent of the basic rate at present would be about £22; the new rate is £12.  If we want to revert to what the commission suggested let me take up the Minister on that point.  In 1985 the commission recommended that the minimum subsistence rate for the various categories should be a range of between £50 and £60 per week.  No Government have ever undertaken to even target its implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be patient &mdash; I am coming to that &mdash; because I know very well what is contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I had not sufficient time to read yesterday's document and one finds all is not as it may seem.  Initially I was delighted when I heard that what was in the programme was that the Government would now seek to implement the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare by the end of 1993 which I understood &mdash; and which most trade unionists currently balloting on this understood &mdash; to be the updated rates.  In fact, that is not what has happened. The Combat Poverty Agency were the original authors of taking the medium figure of £50 to £60 in 1985, <Col N="1263" /> updating it on current values which, at current money values, is worth £62 as the minimum rate.  Is there anybody on either side of this House who would argue that it is possible to live with any kind of decency at a level of income below £62 per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The priority rate is £54.60 in current terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point, the actual commitment in the programme talks about aiming to introduce what are called priority levels by 1993.  If one reverts to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare one finds that the priority levels are an entirely different matter because what is referred to is the minimum of that scale, £50, not the medium point.  Therefore, people who might have expected to receive £62 will now receive something of the order of £55 &mdash; I think that was the figure we agreed on television yesterday but when I came back in here and examined the <i>Principal Features of the Budget,</i> I notice there are still categories on a basic rate of £50 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why they were given 11 per cent in the budget.  The Deputy will understand it all in due course.  The extra money was given to the lowest categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it still not the case that there are certain categories of social welfare recipients now in receipt of an income of £50 per week?</P>

      <P>The Chair does not suffer from jealously. However, I would suggest that Deputy Rabbitte should address the Chair.  This is not a Committee Stage debate but rather Deputy Rabbitte making his contribution, not a question and answer session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for having ignored the Chair and promise not to do so for the remainder of my contribution. But we have now established that, for short term single recipients, the rate is still £50 only, which was the point I was trying to make.  For many people the target set in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> falls far short of their expectations.  If one's income is around £50 or £55 a week I should suggest, there is a hell of a difference between being in receipt of £50 and £62. There is hell of a difference in the target figure being £68 at the end of 1993, as a great many people anticipated, and being in receipt of £58, which is what will now turn out to be the case, give or take, depending on the rate of inflation obtaining.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in the case of an adult dependant, the Minister has ignored the recommendation that it should be a fixed percentage of the adult rate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and much too low, as any dependent spouse will tell the Minister and has no regard to the longstanding recommendation that it should be paid directly, where possible, to that dependent spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember last year when the carer's allowance was introduced the Minister gave us the impression, at the early stages, that that allowance would be extended to people who had the onerous responsibility of looking after a handicapped relative, child or whoever.  Now the Minister has extended it to the DPMA.  Of course that does not include very many handicapped persons being looked after at home.  I am greatly surprised at this having regard to the current controversy about the crisis in the mental handicap services.  It is very difficult to appreciate how the Minister cannot recognise the invaluable contribution, for example, of parents who have the responsibility, every single day of the week, of <Col N="1265" /> caring for a mentally handicapped child. Surely there is an irrefutable case that in all cases the carer's allowance ought to be available to them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowance is paid up to the time they get their DPMA.  Therefore, the Deputy will see that there is actually a payment for children.  The Deputy may argue about its adequacy but there is a domiciliary care allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do argue its adequacy. I repeat the arguments advanced in the Mansion House a few nights ago by the Parents Against Mental Handicap who very clearly made the point that the DPMA applied to a fraction of their members only.  I find it very difficult to understand why the carer's allowance is not extended to them.</P>
      <P>I would welcome an intervention by the Minister on the question of child benefit if he wants to challenge my figures. As I read the derisory increase in child benefit, it means that a family with more than three children will receive an increase of £7.10 per month which &mdash; if one had civil servants to do the calculations &mdash; probably works out at 24p a day; that is the level of increase in child benefit. How, in God's name, can that be made out to be a budget taking into account the interests of people in the lower income categories?  Child poverty is endemic in our society and, as we know from recent surveys, is growing.  The Minister had an opportunity to tackle child benefit and instead we have a derisory increase of £7.10 per month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the FIS but I am very disappointed that there has been such a low take-up rate of this benefit. The Department of Social Welfare must see what measures can be taken to improve the level of take-up of this benefit.  To my certain knowledge a great many families do not understand the scheme and the conditions they must comply with in order to get this benefit. The Minister has accepted that there is an argument to be made for the very low paid but all this does for me is to make <Col N="1266" /> a more compelling argument for a national minimum wage.  That is the only way we will tackle the question of low pay.  The myth has long been shattered that poverty is the preserve of the unemployed. A great many people on low pay are in the poverty trap, and I cannot understand the resistance of the Government to the concept of a national minimum wage.</P>
    <P>The commitment given in the national programme under this heading is virtually worthless.  The programme records that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions proposed that there should be a statutory minimum wage and that the employers stated their opposition to this proposal. The programme went on to say that during the currency of the agreement a committee of some kind would be set up to report on and examine the proposal. That is a great pity as this is the only way we can tackle this question.  There is not any commitment by or enthusiasm on the part of the Government to implement a statutory minimum wage despite the exploitation, of which the Department of Labour are aware, of workers in many sectors, the services sector in particular. I do not take any joy from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that that is likely to be met.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision on mixed insurance.  My union has been concerned about this for a long time.  Some workers in State companies are at a disadvantage because of this mix of PRSI and State company schemes.  This proposal is certain to be welcome.  The Minister in his response should address the question of whether the Department regard this as a matter of urgency because, without being too crude about this, if the change is not implemented soon many of the beneficiaries will no longer be around.  I also welcome the extension of PRSI cover to part-time workers.  I do not know whether the extension of this benefit will be as outlined in the Bill published before Christmas in terms of the hours defined and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different matter.  It <Col N="1267" /> will come in the Social Welfare Bill and in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill on part-time workers published before Christmas stipulates an hours threshold above which one would qualify for certain benefits. That threshold is eight hours and I sincerely hope that the extension of PRSI will have a reasonable yardstick in terms of the definition of a part-time worker.</P>
      <P>I will refer now to a scheme that raised quite a brouhaha last night in the financial resolutions, the business expansion scheme and the Government's measures to close some of the loopholes in it.  I have not seen Fine Gael as excited in a long time as they were last night.  They really got worked up about this.  I had little sympathy with them last night but, having reflected on it overnight, my sympathy such as it was then, and it was not very great, has diminished.  There is a compelling argument for the total abolition of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult, within our complex fiscal system, to target a particular area of the economy for development because one is competing with a whole industry of tax specialists, accountancy firms and former officials of the Revenue who have been poached for the specific purpose of teaching industry how to get around new measures, and how to find loopholes.  On radio this morning a tax specialist advised that she did not think the Taoiseach could do this, that it was illegal and open to challenge.  She was anticipated last night by Deputy McCreevy who described himself as an ordinary man.  If the Trade Descriptions Act applied to such a description he would have been arrested leaving the House last night.  Deputy McCreevy who seems to know a great deal about this, as I would expect, also challenged whether the Taoiseach could legally tighten up this scheme.  That is evidence of the power of the organised lobbies when the Government tighten up a loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the view last night, and am more confirmed in it today, that one cannot bleat about closing off loopholes in the <Col N="1268" /> tax code and then complain when the Government bring in a measure to shut off a loophole.  I am prepared to accept that abolition may not be prudent and that if the scheme can be focused on small manufacturing industry and to where it genuinely attracts capital for risk purposes, that would be all very well.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the loss to the Exchequer has been enormous.  The loss was £40 million and not, as Deputy Barry said, an imaginary loss to the Exchequer. It was real income tax lost to the Exchequer because it was generated within this economy.  A similar figure would be lost this year if corrective measures were not taken.  Corrective measures have to be taken.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has been one of the greatest areas of abuse.  It is important to point out that, contrary to what Deputy Sean Barrett said, it is perfectly legal.  Nothing illegal is being done.  These people are availing of this scheme as a tax shelter and are entitled to do so.  The question about it raising badly needed capital for the refurbishing of hotels on the west coast, for example, seems not to hold a great deal of water.  What it does is displace other hotels that do not benefit. The net addition is minimal and if there is an argument for discriminating in favour of the west coast &mdash; and remember most of these BES take-ups have been in Dublin &mdash; that should be done by some kind of grant subsidy to suitable tourism projects rather than by financing the kind of tax shelter that has been abused so disgracefully.  I am aware of a study which is to be published very soon on 24 such projects.  I emphasise that none of these include the infamous Shannon rip-off.  In the case of these 24 projects, the majority of them in tourism, very few jobs were created.  I am aware that the BES was availed of in the shipping area and I predict that when the jobs become available it will be a bigger scandal than Shannon. This study will show that the cost per job is in the region of £20,000, compared to an IDA average of £15,000.  We cannot allow that to go on.  Those who have benefited are financial institutions and taxpayers with disposable income.  The <Col N="1269" /> financial intermediaries have made a fortune at both ends of the transaction.  I have heard some fantastic stories, for instance that a person went into a bank and raised £20,000 which he put into a project like this, then got his £20,000 back and put it in the bank.  That kind of abuse is incapable of being supervised by the Revenue Commissioners and it is high time that we eliminated this system of double relief.</P>
    <P>I stand over The Workers' Party decision of last night.  I am prepared to look at the limitations now imposed on genuine manufacturing enterprises.  The £500,000 ceiling was the subject of considerable argument yesterday.  On reflection, I am not so sure that it is a major issue.  When that limit is reached, the businessmen concerned set up a new company.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the cowardly stance of the Minister on the question of corporation tax.  It is deplorable in the context of the profits which have been made in recent years and during the currency of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that he has decided to make no changes in corporation tax.  That is a scandal in an economy which has sprung a leak.  A total of £2.5 billion has been repatriated in profits, yet there is no change in corporate tax because the Government have bought the CII lobby. That lobby points to the yield, which has increased.  There are two reasons for the increase, namely, the base was minimal and the enormous profits generated under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> give the appearance of corporation tax being increased.  It is a copout in terms of tax reform that we should approach it in the context of personal taxation and any question of broadening the tax base into the corporate sector, capital taxes, property taxes and so on does not seem to feature.  We must get a minimum tax from these companies.  It is almost meaningless to have a 40 per cent tax rate because almost nobody is paying 40 per cent.  Anybody who has a tax adviser knows how to circumvent it.  It is not too much to ask and would not deter <Col N="1270" /> any industry if there were a minimum rate of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is a standstill budget that does not reckon with the fact that international demand for our exports and products is already falling and is likely to fall further. I predict that the borrowing requirement will not be held at £462 million.  It is the height of folly to float the shares of one of our most successful State companies in present market conditions with a view to making a contribution to achieving that EBR figure.  It is highly regrettable and I ask the Minister to keep it on hold until the market conditions are more certain. Now that we have made the tragic decision to privatise that company, we should allow its shares to realise something commensurate with its real value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures outlined by my colleague the Minister for Finance yesterday build on the real progress we have made over the past four years.</P>
      <P>Our economic strategy set out in the highly successful <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been highly successful. This budget will improve the position of workers generally, provide more jobs and protect and improve living standards for those who depend on social welfare.  The exceptional performance of the Irish economy under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be enhanced by the measures agreed with the social partners under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> This budget is the Government's first step in implementing the programme.</P>
      <P>While continuing our strategy of sound economic management, we are also making substantial progress, despite international uncertainties, in key areas like the reduction of taxes, the creation of employment, greater social equity and welfare improvements.  This strategy will also keep public finances under control, keep inflation down, and provide growth, a favourable balance of payments and a stable exchange rate.  The scene is set for business to invest and flourish in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always been a caring and compassionate people.  The public want our <Col N="1271" /> services to reflect this deeply humanitarian outlook.  Our welfare services already have a number of unique and enlightened features.  We have special regard for those on low incomes, the elderly, their carers, and the handicapped. We want to continue this approach and at the same time make the system more efficient, sensitive and responsive to the needs of people.</P>
    <P>The package of improvements for those on social welfare or at work on low pay in this year's budget costs £164 million in a full year and £71 million this year.  This brings the gross expenditure on social welfare schemes and services to over £3 billion for the first time.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the increases.  It is now official that we have the lowest inflation rate in the EC (2.7 per cent) and this budget is designed to keep inflation down to about 3 per cent.  Against this background, the general increase of 4 per cent provided for those who depend on social welfare will clearly keep them ahead of inflation.  This increase alone more than meets the Government's commitment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It costs £104 million in a full year and some £45 million this year.</P>
    <P>We are doing more than this.  This is the fourth year in a row in which extra resources have been found to give special increases to the lowest paid.  The personal rates of supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance are being increased by over 11 per cent this year.  Families on these payments will receive increases of over 9 per cent when one takes in the total amount to the family.  Some 100,000 people will benefit from these special increases.  Families of those on unemployment benefit and disability benefit are also getting special increases ranging up to 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Following this budget, all long term rates of social welfare payments now reach or exceed the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rate of £54.60 for 1991.  Those who are on old age pension, lone parent's allowance, long term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and disabled person's <Col N="1272" /> maintenance allowance will have a personal weekly rate of £55 and a married rate of £88.  Those who are on contributory pensions will have higher rates of up to £64 per week for retirement and old age pensions and £110 per week for a couple who are both over 66.</P>
    <P>Short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance are being increased to a new personal weekly rate of £50.  This represents increases of between 4.2 per cent and 11.1 per cent and is a major step towards achieving the commission's priority rate by 1993 for these short term payments, and anyone who is objective about the rates will accept that.</P>
    <P>The payment of £31 for an adult dependant is now being increased to £33, an increase of 6.5 per cent.  The new rate of £33 per week from next July will ensure that the relationship which the Commission on Social Welfare recommended should exist between the personal rate and the adult dependant allowance (60 per cent) will continue to be maintained. The Widowers' Association brought to my attention the need for some continuation of adult dependants payments following the death of a spouse.  I am therefore making provision for a 6 weeks payment of the adult dependant allowance to widowed persons which will apply to short term payments.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress was made last year when I introduced a minimum weekly rate of £11 per child and reduced the number of child dependant rates to 6.  This year the minimum rate is being increased by over 9 per cent to £12.  The new rates are £12, £14 and £15.60.  Only four years ago, we had an extremely complex system involving 36 different rates of child dependant allowance.  Now we have only three.</P>
    <P>In addition, the higher rate of child benefit will from October next be payable for the fourth and subsequent children. This will mean an increase of £7.10 per month or £85.20 per year for all families with four or more children.</P>
    <P>I am also bringing up to 21 years the <Col N="1273" /> age to which child dependant allowances are paid for the long term unemployed, old age pensioners and invalidity pensioners where the child is in full-time education.</P>
    <P>The continuation of child dependant allowances during the summer for those children over 18 and in full-time education will be welcomed.  The present practice of discontinuing payment for the summer holidays and paying arrears due if the child re-enters full-time education in the autumn is cumbersome for both the client and the Department.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the burden which parents have to endure following the sad loss of a child, I am continuing payment of child dependant allowances for 6 weeks after the death of a child.</P>
    <P>The tax exemption limits for married couples will be increased by £300 to £6,800.  In addition, child exemption limits will be increased from £300 to £500 for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme is a useful means of directing resources to lower paid workers with children.  It also helps to preserve the incentive to work.</P>
    <P>In line with commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I am pleased to announce substantial improvements in the scheme as follows: income limits are being increased to £140 per week for a family with one child and £276 for a family with eight children, the restriction on the amount of the weekly payment is being abolished, and the scheme is being extended to cover children from 18 to 21 years of age who are in full-time education.</P>
    <P>As a result of the combined family income supplement and child tax exemption changes aimed at the low paid, a married person with 2 children earning £135 a week will get an extra £10 per week.  Similarly, a married person with 4 children earning £162 a week will get an extra £13.80 a week due to the combined family income supplement, child tax exemption, and child benefit improvements.</P>
    <P>Full social insurance cover will be <Col N="1274" /> extended to part-time workers with effect from 6 April of this year.  This is a further important step in the process of widening the social insurance base, which I initiated in 1988 with the extension of cover to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Part-time employment is becoming more widespread.  There are now over 70,000 regular part-time workers in the country, representing 6.4 per cent of all regular workers.  This amounts to a doubling in the proportion of part-time workers in the labour force in the last decade.  The majority of these workers already enjoy full insurance cover by virtue of being employed for 18 hours or more a week.  However, a sizeable minority who are employed for less than 18 hours per week are covered only for occupational injuries.  Married women and young single people comprise the bulk of part-time workers, many of whom either cannot obtain or are not in a position to take up full-time employment. They have no entitlement to unemployment benefit, when out of work, or disability benefit, when ill, and they are not covered for pensions.  It is essential that these workers do not lose out on social security protection, through no fault of their own.  As a result of the changes which I will put in place, up to 21,000 additional part-time workers will have access to the full range of social insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>The Class A PRSI contribution rate, which is applicable to most employees, will be extended to part-time employees. At present, entry to Class A insurance is dependent on the employee having worked for 18 hours or more in the week in question.  It is proposed to change this condition so that all private sector employees whose weekly income is above a minimum threshold will be subject to Class A insurance, irrespective of the number of hours worked.  Regulations outlining the new conditions will be made shortly and employers will be notified of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>As a result of these changes many part-time workers on low incomes will have access to benefits for the first time.  For the bulk of part-time workers entitlement <Col N="1275" /> to short term benefits generally will commence in January 1993.  As far as pensions are concerned this would, needless to say, take longer and we will be asking the pensions board, in their final report, to give some further advice in relation to that area.  The provisions generally for benefit entitlement for part-time workers will be laid out in the Social Welfare Bill which will be available soon.</P>
    <P>The new carer's allowance scheme was a historic development.  Traditionally, payments have been made to compensate a household because of unemployment, illness or the death of a breadwinner.  The new allowance formally recognised the need of carers for a direct form of income support in their own right.</P>
    <P>From next October, the scheme will be extended to cover carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance and those persons getting a pension from another member state of the EC or from a country with whom Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.  The increase in the maximum personal rate from £45 to £50 weekly dates from July next.</P>
    <P>Many recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance live in residential care and are not able to benefit from the free travel arrangements.  Last year I introduced the &ldquo;companion&rdquo; travel pass which covers 12,000 handicapped persons. In future DPMA recipients will be able to retain their entitlement to free travel when they enter residential care. This will enable them also to avail of the &ldquo;companion&rdquo; pass and I am sure that is welcomed by Members here in the House.</P>
    <P>Persons who enter insurance at the class A rate early in their career and subsequently become insured for periods at the public service modified rate, the people who are known as the mixed insurance people, may not qualify for any retirement or old age pension under the social insurance system because they will not have a sufficient average over the relevant period.  We are taking action now to tackle this problem and from November next <i>pro-rata</i> pensions will be paid to the persons concerned which will <Col N="1276" /> be in a proportion to the periods of insurance thay have completed at the class A rate.  The new arrangments will be similar to those that apply under EC regulations to persons with a mixture of insurance in a number of EC member states.  This will ensure that all persons with mixed insurance will be treated in the same way.  My Department estimate that up to 2,500 persons will qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> pension and the cost in the full year will be £3 million.</P>
    <P>I am making a number of improvements in the means test this year.  Income derived from casual employment as a home help will be disregarded.  This will ensure that those who give of their time to help the elderly and disabled will not be penalised by having the value of their small income eroded by a corresponding reduction in the means tested payments.  This is something which Deputies had pointed out in the House during our various discussions.</P>
    <P>I am introducing a minimum weekly payment of £5 for those whose current entitlement is less than £5 and whose only means is the yearly value of the benefit and privilege derived from board and lodgings at home.  If they only qualify for 50p, £1 or £1.50 they will still receive a basic payment of £5.</P>
    <P>I have also arranged that in future income derived from the Haemophilia HIV Trust Fund will be disregarded for means test purposes.</P>
    <P>Last year I introduced a new pre-retirement allowance for those on long term unemployment assistance and over the age of 60 years.  This scheme gives them the option of transferring to a pension book system which they cash at their local post office.  I am glad to be able to annouce that the age limit for this scheme is being reduced from 60 to 58 years.</P>
    <P>The next item refers mainly to farmers and persons who follow a subsidiary occupation who are not regarded as unemployed from their main occupation unless they satisfy a special condition of having at least 78 contributions paid in the three years preceding the date of claim, or that <Col N="1277" /> the profit from their subsidiary occupation does not exceed £4 a day.  This mainly affects landholders who may obtain regular seasonal employment.  The income limit is now being increased from £4 to £10 a day.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to be able to continue the grants to locally based women's groups, and this has been very much welcomed. There will be a grant of £500,000 to women's groups, which is a rise from the £350,000 allocated last year.  A number of projects received core funding of £10,000 each last year &mdash; the North Wall Women's Centre in Dublin's inner city, Ronanstown Self-Development Group in Clondalkin and the Little Bray Family Resource and Development Centre, and this year they will each be receiving £11,000.  Grants will also be made to organisations who provide refuge for women who are the victims of domestic violence: these will include Women's Aid in Rathmines, the Aoibhneas Centre in Ballymun and the Meath Women's Aid Association.  An evaluation of the scheme has shown that it has been particularly effective and very widely welcomed by women and has been very valuable in terms of local community development.  I am also extending the benefits of a nationwide community development programme which I introduced last year to include new projects in areas like Darndale in north Dublin, Waterford, west Cork, Kilkenny and north Wicklow and some others which have yet to be determined.</P>
    <P>The Government are also providing special once-off grants.  I am providing £75,000 to the Catholic Social Services Conference towards the refurbishment of a hostel for the homeless in Eccles Street and a further residential hostel for homeless boys in Lennox Street.  A sum of £50,000 is also being provided to the Simon Community towards their work with the homeless.  A sum of £100,000 will be provided for co-operative housing projects for single parents and the disabled. This will be seed money to assist in what is being done by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association, who <Col N="1278" /> provide many services for people dependent on welfare, are getting a special grant of £75,000 to help them with the costs they have accumulated in this area. I am also providing a once-off grant of £25,000 to the National Association for the Deaf for the installation of telecommunication devices for the deaf.  A grant of £25,000 will be provided to the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and a further £25,000 for marriage counselling services generally.</P>
    <P>One of the major commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is the integrated area based strategy for the long term unemployed. We will be putting a great deal of time and effort into the scheme and we will also ensure that we have very close links with FÁS in providing all the options we can for those who work with us.  I intend to designate officers in our local offices who will assist individual unemployed persons in their quest for work.  This initiative will be implemented in close liasion with the area based strategy for the long term unemployed agreed by the social partners.</P>
    <P>We will implement a £20 million crackdown on PRSI related fraud.  We will be overhauling the PRSI registration system, ensuring that employers comply with their PRSI obligations for their employees and we will be recruiting additional staff at a cost of £1 million.  We intend to be in a position to increase the number of investigations of firms to £10,000 by late summer this year and to 15,000 investigations a year when the staff are in place.  Unscrupulous employers who cheat the taxpayer, their competitors and their employees will face stiff penalties.  The new arrangements will be widely publicised and employers will be well informed about their obligations. My Department will shortly take over from the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for allocating RSI numbers. This will lead to a more co-ordinated approach to the issuing of RSI numbers and the provision of benefits.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the package I have outlined will have a major impact on those people who depend on us for support. <Col N="1279" /> The fruits of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> coupled with the co-operation of the social partners in the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have made these improvements possible.  We depend on that stability and growth to be able to provide improvements in social welfare.  We can all look forward to the nineties with confidence. I know that these measures which the Government have introduced will be widely welcomed, not only by those in industry for whom they provide investment and stability but also by those who are at work on low pay or those dependent on social welfare.  It is a good package for those who depend on social welfare and it is a further major step in reaching the levels we want to achieve. Indeed, some of our rates have come very close to them already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Minister opposite for introducing quite a number, although not all that one would have liked, of improvements in the social welfare code and which Members on all sides have been calling for over the past couple of years.  One thing that makes it worthwhile being a Member of this House is that sometimes somebody is listening to us and that somebody takes cognisance of what is said and does something about it, even though it may not go as far as we would like.  We should congratulate the Minister for quite a number of improvements in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I am afraid I have to end my compliments and talk in general terms as best I can on the budget.  First I will refer to what is in it and then to what is not in it.  May I comment on the reaction from the two parties in Government when the sides were reversed a few years ago?  At the end of the budget speech there was a general outcry that the budget was Thatcherite, unfeeling, heartless &ldquo;economistic&rdquo; and cold and showed no feeling of having regard for the real needs of the people.  This was trotted out regularly through the media and by the various press officers. However, all of a sudden, budgets seem <Col N="1280" /> to have taken on a new meaning when one listens to what comes from that side of the House.</P>
    <P>One thing that amuses me is the manner in which Governments can emphasise what they see as the positive elements thereby hoping to deflect attention from the less positive elements.  For example, note how many times the rate of inflation will be quoted in the context of the budget and how many times we will be reminded that we now have the lowest inflation rate in Europe.  However, there is no reference to how that came about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Or no reference to interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point I am coming to.  Nobody from that side of the House has mentioned a word about interest rates.  There is no emphasis on interest rates now and they have been conveniently ignored because they are among the highest in Europe and that leaves us in a most vulnerable and very awkward position.  Nobody from that sides of the House has mentioned &mdash; I am still hoping that some speaker will do so &mdash; the extraordinary interest rates. This budget is unimaginative, colourless, tasteless and odourless and gives me the impression that somebody somewhere had decided &mdash; as Deputy Rabbitte said earlier &mdash; to put the whole economy on auto-pilot and to assume that everything will work all right.  That is a very peculiar and a very dangerous thing to do especially at a time when there is so much trauma in the world outside.  There are so many factors that can have a bearing on this economy that it is extremely dangerous to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the area of personal taxation and again I refer to the good vibes which are emanating from that side of the House.  From listening to the Budget Statement yesterday and reading it carefully today one would automatically assume that there is something great in it for everybody but on closer examination &mdash; particularly for the low paid workers &mdash; the amount of benefit and relief is minimal.  Where the whole relief system <Col N="1281" /> starts off at the lower end of the scale there are so few people on that level of income as to make it useless in terms of benefit to the large masses of the people. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is present and I am fully aware of the commitment of the Progressive Democrats to a reduction in the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent and I note the moves in that direction.  I would point out to the House that with each passing year modifications, and the implementation of a standard rate of 25 per cent, are less and less meaningful simply because the people who are hardest hit are the people who are carrying the burden of responsibility in the State in terms of taxation, those at the middle rate of 48 per cent.  We all have ample opportunity to speak with people every weekend who are in that tax band, in that income group: they are the people who are disappointed and who are receiving little or no relief.  As a matter of fact following a little juggling with figures they end up with £1.50 or £2 per week extra on the one hand, and by the end of the year, by some mysterious means, if they receive a pay increase they are worse off. The move towards two tax bands is fine, but the big issue must now be the number of people in the middle band who will shortly move into the next one.</P>
    <P>Another area which has been brought to my attention very forcibly this morning by my constituents is that we are now, as we had anticipated, getting the negative aspects of tax harmonisation.  We are getting the increases but we are not getting the benefits in the other areas.  In order to be like Europe we are getting the increases now and at some stage later when the auto-pilot has been set aside we will get the benefits &mdash; at least we hope we will &mdash; provided, of course, international factors do not intervene in the meantime, in which case we may have to wait a great deal longer.  Even though in some cases the increase will only be 2½ per cent and in other cases ther is an imposition of VAT for the first time, in certain areas in this country the effect of this will be huge for the simple reason that the benefits of the so-called tax harmonisation <Col N="1282" /> are not being brought into effect by a consequent and <i>pro rata</i> reduction in personal taxation.  If that were happening at least the people would recognise it for what it was and would say: &ldquo;We understand, we are in Europe, it is 1992 and we know we have to meet certain deadlines&rdquo;. That would be quite plausible and acceptable but that is not what is happening. We are getting the increases and the impositions of new rates of VAT and so on and we are paying that now on our telephone bills, our ESB bills, our shopping and grocery bills and, wait for it, clothing and footwear.  That brings back personal memories in this House because I recall losing my seat in a general election which was fought on a budget proposal which was greatly maligned and was parodied around the country for at least six months after the election.  In that budget was a proposal to impose VAT on clothing and footwear.  That was not the point which received most attention but rather that it would apply to children's footwear and clothing.</P>
    <P>A peculiar thing has happened.  It goes to show that with the passage of time strange conversions can take place.  Now this conversion has visited itself on the Government sitting opposite and they now see great merit where they could see no merit a few years ago, even though the budgetary situation at that time was much more critical than today.  They can now see great merit in determining the difference between an adult and a child and being able to decide which rate of VAT applies or whether it applies.  They have now discovered a secret formula and they will go ahead and apply it.  I have often said previously in this House that the years and the changes from Government to Opposition bring about strange things.  I can only hope and conclude that all the difficulties which the parties opposite saw at that time have now been resolved.  I have a funny feeling that they have to go into the shops and the marketplaces with the measuring tape to determine the difference in the sizes and whether they apply to children or to adults.  I think that will take some time <Col N="1283" /> and it sounds like an administrator's nightmare.</P>
    <P>There is another area to which I should like to refer briefly.  I am not being politically critical but it is necessary to say that a great deal of talk has centred recently around the health services.  As a member of a health board I am brought into daily contact with the harsh realities so far as the health services are concerned. I am aware of recent indications emanating from discussions with the national and the social partners and so on and the proposals relating to consultancy treatment, free for all and sundry, and I see nothing wrong with that.  The only question I would ask, as the previous speaker has done, is how to gain access to such treatment.  Attempting to provide a service and in theory providing a service is fine but at the same time there is no framework within which the service can operate.  The one problem that exists &mdash; and it is a serious problem &mdash; is that despite the best intentions there are no hospital beds.  One can have all the consultant treatments one wants but they will be on the roadside because there are no beds and we should be fully aware of that.</P>
    <P>There is another disgraceful situation which I must mention and I have raised it on countless occasions at health board meetings.  It is this: nothing makes me sadder than to see what happens to the elderly in this country.  Take, for example, a person of 59 or 60 years of age and examine their prospects in relation to hospital services and what they are likely to get out of the system.  Having given their lifetime to working in the State the prospects that await them are this: if they are in the VHI and have credits built up over a number of years they will benefit to some extent but those credits soon run out if they have a prolonged hospitalisation. People in the age bracket from 62 to about 66 or 67 years of age who become immobile, confined to bed or confined to a wheelchair experience absolutely horrific problems.  It is disgraceful that people in that age group <Col N="1284" /> should have been humiliated in that way over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>If a person in this age group has to be hospitalised for a long period inquiries are quickly made to find out whether he owns a house.  If a person's spouse is living in the home they have a possibility of holding on to their property but if a person lives alone his house will be sold. It is very difficult for an elderly person who knows he is dependent on the system to be told &ldquo;I am sorry, but we must sell your house because we need the money to provide you with hospital services for the next few years&rdquo;.  That is disgraceful. I have heard people at meetings of the Eastern Health Board trying to justify that action on the basis of financial necessity but I do not accept that.  A person who has worked all their life and given their all to the system is entitled to be treated at least with a little respect at the end of their days.  The most cruel cut of all is when the spouse of a person who has used up all his VHI credits is asked to pay for any emergency care he receives. Those people have to pay for services to which they should be entitled as of right. It is not at all unusual for a husband or wife to receive a bill of up to £25,000 after the death of their spouse.  It is disgraceful that this should happen in a so-called Christian and caring society where so much emphasis is placed on our charity, Christianity and willingness to care for others.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to housing.  I was amused to hear for the first time since I became a Member of this House the reference yesterday to social housing. That is new Euro-speak if ever there was one.  There will be an increase of £10 million in the expenditure on social housing this year which will provide approximately 40 houses.  Yet, there are about 15,000 families who are urgently in need of housing at present but who have no chance of being housed.  The term &ldquo;social housing&rdquo; seems to indicate a certain concern for those unfortunate people who need housing but the simple fact of the matter is that the Government of the day are not dealing with the problems in the area of social housing, local authority <Col N="1285" /> housing, Department of the Environmental housing &mdash; you can call it what you like.  People are being forced to live in intolerable housing conditions to the detriment of their health, harmonious marital relations and their general quality of life.  The Government should cut out the waffle and try to do something about this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the provision of extra money for roads. No doubt the Minister for the Environment will also refer to this point.  If one looks at the figures for the past five years one can see that in tandem with the so-called extra money spent on roads there was an equal reduction in the amount spent on local authority housing.  One could automatically assume that there is no need for local authority housing and that these people find their own housing. I wonder if the Government are aware of the serious crisis in this area at present and whether they intend doing anything about it?  Little reference was made to this problem in yesterday's budget speech and I do not expect any reference to be made to it from here on.</P>
    <P>It is sad that we now seem to be moving towards the concept of social agriculture. Support systems and small benefits, a kind of social welfare, will be provided to keep farmers living on the land without having to produce anything.  If that is not the greatest lunacy anyone could ever have thought up then nothing is.  I cannot understand why a little more imagination cannot be used in this area.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is an advocate of the need for extra competition.  I agree that competition is useful up to a point but I would point out &mdash; I do not think the Government are aware of this &mdash;that this is a food producing and food exporting country.  I would ask the Government to remember that point in the context of GATT negotiations.  I wonder if the competition we regard as so beneficial in the food area at present will be equally applied to the importation of raw materials, cars, machinery, etc. into this country.</P>

      <P>Before I start my speech <Col N="1286" /> proper I should like to refer to some of the statements made in the House this morning by Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael.  It seems he devoted most of his criticism to me and my party. I am quite prepared to take criticism when it is warranted from a quarter which is warranted but I find it very difficult indeed to accept criticism in regard to budgetary matters from the only Minister for Finance in the history of this State who failed to get a budget through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In particular, I find it difficult to accept his criticisms of my party's alleged lack of concern for tax reform and reform of the public finances.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity in the few minutes available to me to look back at some comparable figures.  In 1985, which was about the middle of the period of office of the then Government &mdash; and, therefore, I presume is reasonably representative &mdash; in which Deputy Bruton played a prominent part both as Minister for Finance and Minister for Industry and Commerce, the EBR was 12.9 per cent.  I contrast that with the 1.9 per cent for this year.  The current budget deficit was 8.4 per cent compared to 1 per cent this year.  The income tax rates during that year were 35 per cent, 48 per cent and 60 per cent.  I contrast those with the 25 per cent and the 48 per cent which are due to be implemented at the beginning of 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During that period our national debt increased from £12 billion to £24 billion. Yet, I am expected to take lectures.  In particular, I am told I am acting against job creation by having certain reductions in the Estimate of my Department. Deputy Bruton identified, for example, Shannon Development.  I have looked at the revised estimate for industry grants for Shannon Development and I almost have to apologise to the House and the <Col N="1287" /> country for the fact that the industry grants for Shannon Development increased from £3.73 million last year to £10 million this year, an increase of 168 per cent at a time when the Government are getting the Exchequer borrowing requirement down from what it was last year.  I am criticised for cutting back, for example, in regard to NADCORP when there is, in fact, an increase this year on the amount which NADCORP succeeded in spending last year.  I am criticised for cutting back on the science and technology programme when in fact there is an increase from £13.6 million to £25.2 million, an increase of 85 per cent, under that heading.  There is an increase for Córas Tráchtála for marketing from £24.6 million to £31.2 million, an increase of 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>In so far as I have any comment to make on these final figures it is almost one of apology that the increases are so dramatically high, but they are in areas where there are shortcomings in the Irish industrial infrastructure, where they are needed and where, in terms of jobs creation and industrial development, they can be very well spent.  It shows therefore how ill-founded are the ridiculous and hypocritical criticisms that were launched this morning by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not do that in the Book of Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The rest of them can be treated in the same light as the figures which Deputy Bruton so erroneously quoted and which he so badly misinterprets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 budget is the second budget of the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Coalition Government.  It represents a further step in the implementation of the Programme for Government agreed with our Coalition partners in July 1989. In considering the budget it is important to bear in mind four factors which were crucial in framing it: the Gulf War and the great uncertainty which exists at present surrounding international economic <Col N="1288" /> developments over the coming year and beyond; the Programme for Government agreed between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in July 1989 and, in particular, the provisions which relate to public expenditure control taxation reform, employment creation, the health services, social welfare and the adoption of special measures for the unemployed in disadvantaged areas; the proposed <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has recently been negotiated and awaits final ratification; and the need to further improve the position of the disadvantaged in our society to the extent that this can be accomplished within the budgetary process.</P>
    <P>The Gulf War is, of course, tragic by any standards.  The suffering and loss of life involved are the issue of greatest concern and the most immediate reason why the Government, and the people of this country, would wish to see the was ended as quickly as possible.  The economic consequences extend widely beyond the theatre of war itself to countries throughout the world.  Ireland will bear its share of these consequences.</P>
    <P>The percentage increase in oil prices that has taken place since August last and the currently projected increases from a number of expert sources are far less than the average rate of increase of over 300 per cent that occured during the previous oil price shocks of 1973-74 and 1978-81.  This, together with Ireland's reduced dependency on oil compared with the seventies means that the direct economic impact of energy problems on this occassion is likely to be significantly less than during the previous oil shocks. The wage increases that have been negotiated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> while higher than the expected rate of inflation and those negotiated under the previous programme, are still modest by reference to those anticipated in our main trading partners and should help to dampen the inflationary impact of oil price developments and maintain and improve the competitiveness of the traded goods sector.</P>
    <P>Apart from the direct oil price effect <Col N="1289" /> the Gulf conflict is also having a negative impact on new investment and expansion plans by the international business community. Even before the Gulf crisis the slowdown in economic activity across OECD countries over the past 18 months, and the projections of a further downturn in economic growth in 1991 had been forcing a slowdown in investment by many firms.  This trend has been exacerbated by recent events in the Gulf.</P>
    <P>Growth prospects in both the United Kingdom and the United States, which account for over 40 per cent of Irish exports, are particularly problematical over the next year or two and projections for these two economies are among the lowest across all OECD countries.  On the other hand present indications are that the reunited German economy, which now accounts for some 12 per cent of Irish exports, will continue to show strong if reduced growth in 1991 and beyond.</P>
    <P>In the case of internationally mobile investment the Gulf conflict means that the interest which many companies, especially those from the US and Japan, have had in the European market, including Ireland, in recent years will, at least temporarily, be reduced.  In recent weeks a number of visits to Ireland from prospective investors have been postponed because of prevailing conditions including the perceived danger of terrorist attacks on air travellers.</P>
    <P>This should be seen in the context of a level of site visits which had been running exceptionally well in recent months so that the overall position over the past 12 months has been quite buoyant.  The IDA have been keeping in close contact with these firms and expect the site visits postponed to be resumed in due course.</P>
    <P>The present uncertainty surrounding international economic prospects underlines how important it has been in Ireland's case to achieve a turn-around in the development of the economy in recent years under the joint programme for Government agreed in 1989 between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.  A benign international economic environment of relatively low oil prices <Col N="1290" /> and strong growth in the world economy and in our major trading partners has also been a crucial factor.  We are now in a much better position to withstand the shocks to international economic development which are at present more prevalent than at any time over the past ten years.  The public finances have been brought under control.  The upward spiral of national debt as a percentage of GNP, which had shown a continuous increase from the mid-seventies to an unsustainable peak of 131 per cent in 1987, has been reversed and in 1990 was brought down to less than 112 per cent.  Inflation has been reduced to the second lowest level in the EC and is now running at the sort of low, single-digit levels that have not been seen on a sustained basis in Ireland since the sixties.  Under the impact of moderate wage increases and the further expansion of the industrial sector the cost competitiveness of Irish industry increased significantly over the past three years.  The improved competitiveness of Irish economy has been reflected in record balance of trade surpluses and in the significant addition to manufacturing capacity achieved in recent years from new investment projects.</P>
    <P>We are now entering unknown territory in many ways with the major uncertainties surrounding the world economic order to which I have referred.  This is one of the main reasons that the proposed <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to be welcomed and supported. The programme provides a structure and a framework for the development of economic and social policies over the next three years and beyond which can provide an important source of stability over that period.  The programme is comprehensive in the range of economic and social policies which it covers and the budget has been set within the framework of the programme.</P>
    <P>The overriding principle of the new programme remains the firm control of public finances so that there is a steady reduction in the ratio of national debt to GNP.  This principle reflects the commitments made in the programme for <Col N="1291" /> Government agreed between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in 1989.  It has been made clear that the continued reduction in national debt as a proportion of GNP is now a fundamental tenet of Government policy which cannot be infringed in the implementation of the programme.  The aim now is to reduce the national debt to GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993 and to achieve a broad balance on the current budget by that time.</P>
    <P>The budget represents a further step in achieving these aims taking into account the particular difficulties and uncertainties surrounding economic growth prospects at present.  Current projections, taking the budget provisions into account, are that the Exchequer borrowing requirement this year will be further reduced to 1.9 per cent of GNP, including a current budget deficit of 1 per cent.  Current propects are for a further worthwhile reduction in the debt-GNP ratio.</P>
    <P>These objectives are better than many commentators had anticipated and underline the Government's commitment to the control of public expenditure. My party would have liked to have seen greater progress made this year in the control of public expenditure but given the constraints involved we consider the objectives set out in the budget as reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>These improvements, together with the Government's firm commitment to maintaining exchange rate stability within the EMS &mdash; a commitment successfully delivered on in recent years &mdash; the dismanting of exchange controls in preparation for the Single Market, our further commitment to the process of economic and monetary union within the European Community and the range of opportunities and incentives available will help to maintain the significant attractions of Ireland as a location for internationally mobile investment from both internal and external sources.  The outcome should, therefore, lead to further significant increases in employment <Col N="1292" /> in 1991 but at a reduced rate compared with 1990.</P>
    <P>The pay increases negotiated under the new programme will allow for a further increase in the living standards of workers and a share in the improvements in the profitability of the business sector generally and in the public finances achieved with the aid of the modest wage increases agreed under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The increases, which are likely to average little more than 4 per cent over the next three years, are subject to the condition of due regard being had to the economic and commercial circumstances of the particular firm, employment or industry.  The proposed increases are still modest by comparison with those projected for our main trading partners and will allow for a further improvement in the wage competitiveness of our internationally trading firms.  This is a major benefit at a time when the demand conditions in our main export markets are becoming significantly less favourable than has been the case over the past three to four years.</P>
    <P>It will be essential to maintain tight control over the overall size of the public sector pay bill to ensure that unacceptable pressure on the overall level of public expenditure does not occur.  For that reason I welcome the ceiling on the special increases in public sector pay set out in the new programme and that will apply over the period to end-1993.  I also welcome the commitment to considering changes in structures and working practices as part of the discussions on pay increases above the basic levels set out in the programme and on the approach that will apply to the payment of such increases which involve additional costs beyond 1993.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of both the trade unions representing public sector workers and the Government to develop an agreed approach to the difficulties of an overall public sector pay bill increasing at a faster pace than public expenditure generally.  Such an approach must encompass further public service reform which improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the public service, <Col N="1293" /> adequately recognises merit and provides greater job satisfaction and motivation for public servants.</P>
    <P>The fundamental reform of our taxation system has been a central objective of the economic and social policies of the Progressive Democrat Party since their foundation.  The aim is to remove the inefficiency and inequity that has been allowed to grow into the system over the years and to better encourage productive enterprise and effort.  We made a commitment to achieving taxation reform, an essential part of the Coalition Programme for Government.  In doing so we have recognised that the pace and structure of reform cannot ignore the changes necessary to achieve the harmonisation of indirect taxes that form an essential part of the Single Market programme.</P>
    <P>The 1990 budget &mdash; the first of the coalition Government &mdash; took a decisive step in taxation reform covering: reductions in both the lower and higher rates of income tax; a reduction in the rate of corporation tax; phasing out of accelerated capital allowances; the restrictions on section 84 financing and relating the availability of such financing to the developing needs of industrial projects; increasing the tax and PRSI exemption for the lower paid; and reducing the standard rate of VAT to 23 per cent.  The 1991 budget has continued the process of reform.</P>
    <P>In the case of income tax the objective as set in the agreed Programme for Government is to achieve a lower rate of 25 per cent and a single higher rate by 1993 in order to improve the incentive to work and to enterprise which has been undermined by the burden of personal taxation imposed over the past 20 years. Following the reductions introduced in last year's budget the standard and top rates of tax are each being further reduced by one percentage point this year.  In addition, the Government's formal objective is to reduce both rates of income tax by 2 per cent in each of the next two years.</P>
    <P>In the case of corporation tax the major reforms introduced in recent years, <Col N="1294" /> together with the enhanced profitability of the corporate sector, has meant that receipts in 1990 amounted to £474 million and are expected to increase to over £520 million in 1991 &mdash; more than twice the level of receipts in 1987.  The ending of export sales relief and growing restrictions on tax avoidance schemes will provide a further boost to the taxation yield from the corporate sector in future years, provided that we maintain the conditions within which the profitability of the sector is maintained and enhanced.  Accordingly, no further significant changes are proposed in the corporation tax code for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The restrictions imposed on section 84 finance in recent years has greatly reduced the scope for tax avoidance measures in this area.  These were extremely costly to the Exchequer and derived from loopholes in the taxation code rather than from deliberately introduced instruments of industrial development. To counteract the abuses arising the use of section 84 financing was focused to a far greater extent on the needs of new industrial projects under the 1990 Finance Act.  Further changes are announced in this year's budget to reduce the more costly elements of the scheme to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There is a continuous need to crack down on unproductive tax avoidance schemes in order to reduce the tax burden on productive sectors of the economy. The business expansion scheme was established with the best of intentions to provide essential seed capital for small business enterprises which have difficulty in raising required equity.  The scheme, however, was unceremoniously &ldquo;hijacked&rdquo; in recent years by imaginative tax consultants to finance projects far beyond the scope of what was intended. The Government, while extending the scheme for a further two years have, therefore, announced new restrictions with the aim of confining the scheme to the type of project for which it was originally intended &mdash; small productive <Col N="1295" /> projects in manufacturing amd international services.  In a full year, three-quarters of the loss to the Exchequer will be saved.</P>
    <P>Capital taxes have in the past contributed only a relatively small share of tax revenue.  There is considerable scope for increasing the yield from capital taxes as part of the necessary process of widening the tax base which I and my party have advocated for many years.  In 1990 the yield from capital taxes amounted to £71 million &mdash; more than twice the 1986 yield.  There is considerable scope for further increases in yield while at the same time ensuring a more equitable system. Accordingly, a significant package of reform is announced in this area in the budget which should increase yield by an estimated £14 million and at the same time makes these taxes more equitable.</P>
    <P>The budget makes provision for a further harmonisation of VAT rates with that required as part of the Single Market programme.  A further significant reduction in the standard rate of VAT to 21 per cent from 1 March next is being offset to some extent by an increase in the low rate of VAT to 12½ per cent.  The net result will be a reduction in yield of about £37 million which should quickly be reflected in reduced prices for most consumer and household goods.  I will be asking the Director of Consumer Affairs to take special measures to ensure that the reductions are immediately passed on to consumers.</P>
    <P>Accelerated capital allowances are being phased out over the period to 1 April 1992 as an important element in the reform of our taxation system.  In this context we will need to look at the wear and tear allowances for plant and machinery to ensure that they are equitable and reflect their real rate of depreciation. This is a matter under discussion with the Minister for Finance at present and I expect that the Government's conclusions will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Allied to comprehensive tax reform, a major priority of the Progressive Democrat Party has been the need to totally overhaul our PRSI system, particularly <Col N="1296" /> since it is such a penal imposition on lower paid workers.  This priority led to the establishment after last year's budget of a major inter-Departmental study group to totally review the PRSI system. Their comprehensive report was received by the Government shortly before Christmas last.</P>
    <P>I regret that it has not been possible to implement a significant reform of PRSI in the 1991 budget.  The Government will, in the coming months, be examining the conclusions of the inter-departmental PRSI Study with a view to undertaking a major reform of the system.  I am confident that a comprehensive reform of the PRSI system that would make it more progressive, and less of an imposition on lower paid workers in particular, can be put in place for implementation in the 1992 budget.</P>
    <P>While our emphasis on comprehensive tax reform, with a view to stimulating enterprise and job creation, is undoubtedly a vital cornerstone in the battle to eliminate poverty from Irish society, it must be recognised that the likely rate of job creation in the foreseeable future will not to be adequate to meet the requirements of unemployed, particularly the 100,000 plus who have been out of work for over a year.  Parallel and radical measures to tackle the poverty facing many families on social welfare, therefore, is absolutely essential.  The 1991 budget, accordingly, introduces new measures to help larger families on social welfare and to alleviate the poverty trap which faces many lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the very lowest rates of social assistance is a particular priority of the Progressive Democrats and has been reflected in both the 1990 and 1991 budgets.  The improvement in the lowest child dependent allowance rates to £12 &mdash; an increase of 9 per cent &mdash; will also help social welfare families. The overall 4 per cent increase in social welfare payments will ensure further improvements.  Those on the lowest payments, especially those with larger families, will receive more favourable increases of up to 11 per cent.</P>

      <P>The significant improvements in the family income supplement mean that the perennial complaint that it is not worth people's while to take on a job and that they would be better off on social welfare is now being effectively addressed through the allocation of additional resources to this scheme.</P>
      <P>I believe that the introduction of the carers' allowance in last year's budget was a significant achievement by the Government.  It is a major element not only of our policy in relation to social welfare but also is a key aspect in the development of a progressive community-based health programme.  I am sure all of us in this House will welcome the inclusion of the carers of those on disabled person's maintenance allowance, DPMA, into the scheme and the 11 per cent increase in the basic rates of payment announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>Reforms in company and competition and consumer protection law &mdash; areas for which I have particular responsibility &mdash; will make a major contribution to achieving the structural reforms needed to support a more efficient and competitive business sector in Ireland. Recently enacted company legislation, which had been many years in the stocks, will give companies experiencing trading difficulties the opportunity to reorganise and survive and maintain employment.  It will also curb the abuse of limited liability; strengthen the position of creditors both in relation to preserving the assets of companies and giving them greater redress in cases of malpractice; give Irish companies the same flexibility in organising their equity as their foreign competitors enjoy; provide more effective means for dealing with insider trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of consumer protection new measures are planned for this year which will, in the case of product liability, impose responsibility on the producers of products and their components, for injury or loss caused to persons because <Col N="1298" /> of a defect in the product without the consumer having to prove negligence. Measures will also be introduced to curb abuses in moneylending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is not very significant in that it does not make many radical changes and contains no surprises. We can say that it will lead to higher inflation which currently stands at 2.7 per cent, higher interest rates and higher costs in the economy.  This erosion of our competitiveness could not have occurred at a worse time given the move towards the single European market and it will lead to a further increase in unemployment, if emigration does not take up the slack.  Therefore, this budget will not contribute significantly to economic growth.  Neither does it make any attempt at substantially restructuring our economy. As a consequence, it is very modest and will not achieve anything meaningful.</P>
      <P>It will achieve a modest political objective and that is securing the support of the social partners in the forthcoming votes on the agreement which is to run for the next three years.  It will also probably ensure that the Government do not lose support in the run-up to the local elections later this year.  By any economic criteria the budget cannot be judged a success.  Undoubtedly, the biggest problem this country faces is that of unemployment. It is true to say the State cannot increase employment by way of an increase in public service numbers. The only way to do so is to ensure that the right climate is created which will result in increased business activity and, as a consequence, more jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that the first objective of management in any line of business today is to rationalise, reduce costs and reduce the workforce.  For example, in recent years CIE reduced their staff from 22,000 to 11,000.  I do not know of one company who has not got as a key objective, in terms of cost restraint, a reduction in labour.  Why is this so?  Is it because Irish pay rates are out of line with those of our European competitors? The answer is no.  Is it because we are paying ourselves too much?  Again, the <Col N="1299" /> answer is no.  The reason is that in order to put an extra pound in basic pay in an employee's pocket an employer will have to pay out £2.10 and for every £1 in overtime he will have to pay out in excess of £3.  Therefore, in simple arithmetic, if managers and employers want to increase efficiency and cut costs they must reduce the workforce.  As long as we continue to have such high rates of tax on payrolls unemployment will continue to increase and job shedding will continue.</P>
    <P>The most significant paragraph in the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the one in which he acknowledges the total failure to reform in any way the PRSI system which falls very harshly on those firms which are labour-intensive and those on the lower rates of pay.  It is both iniquitous and unfair.  There is in excess of a 20 per cent surcharge for the pleasure and privilege of employing someone under the PRSI system.  This is the main reason unemployment will remain high.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is present in the House and I am sure he is aware that there is a great deal of fear an anxiety among the farming community, in particular among small farmers who fear they do not have a future and will not be able to make a reasonable living out of their 40,50, or 60 acres of land, because of the margins following the reform of the CAP, without some external source of income. Commercial farmers also face the prospect that all of the reductions will have to be met out of their profits as their costs will remain the same.</P>
    <P>What attempt has been made in the budget to meet those fears?  There is no tangible improvement or indication that a substantial extension of the disadvantaged areas will be sought.  Neither is there any indication that there will be a new status for the disadvantaged farm or any other measure to ensure that there will be direct income aid.  If farmers are to move to a position where instead of having a Common Agricultural Policy we will have a national agricultural policy with each member state financing their <Col N="1300" /> own farmers by way of VAT refunds or other direct income aids, this country will be heading for disaster.  Agri-business will have no future if production levels drop and the Exchequer will not be able to support family farms in the way other European Governments will be able to support their farmers.  The Government do not seem to realise there is such a crisis or aware of the position in relation to income and what needs to be done to resolve it.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant factors is the timing of the budget <i>vis-à-vis</i> tax harmonisation and the single market.  Later I will speak on matters in my specific area of responsibility &mdash; transport &mdash; but I have to say that time is running out in regard to tax harmonisation.  The Minister has acknowledged that only 700 days remain before we have to face some huge issues.  We will have to consider what impact the free movement of goods, capital and labour will have on us.  First, in relation to the free movement of capital, France and other European countries do not have an interest retention tax.  This will mean that Irish people will be able to move their savings to other countries where this charge on dividend or interest income is not levied.  We must ask the question of how the shortfall of £230 million is going to be made up.  No provision has been made for this and a huge hole will be left in the finances of the Exchequer.  Similarly, I understand that VAT is not charged on imports at the point of entry in other member states. What is going to be done in an effort to fill in that hole of over £160 million?</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget, not even an argued case for a derogation or exemption, which would give cause for comfort.  All we have instead is the view that if VAT rates are harmonised we will meet our obligations.  First, that will not prove to be the case and, second, if we proceed in the way suggested by the Government we will hurt our competitiveness. For instance, if we look at the items being increased, for example, telecommunications, electricity and fuel charges, we will see that each is vital in <Col N="1301" /> terms of our competitiveness, and the cost will have to be met by the services sector and others.  If the intention is to meet the 21 per cent rate coming down and the 12.5 per cent rate coming up at 17 per cent to have a convergence, this will have a serious year on year effect on our competitiveness and is the wrong way to go about it.</P>
    <P>The final area in relation to harmonisation is the stipulation by the Community that border to border the variation in relation to indirect taxation would be a margin of 3 per cent.  There is no doubt that we will not be able to reach this objective in our customs and excise duties in a number of areas.  Not that I am opposed to it in any way, but I quote the increase in taxation on cigarettes. I think it is a good thing, but that is one area where we will simply have to refocus our minds.  My understanding is that there can be only a 3 per cent variation in the price of cigarettes North and South of Ireland.  That has not been addressed seriously in this budget.</P>
    <P>Assumptions have been made in relation to growth in the economy of 2.25 per cent.  I believe growth this year will be around 1 per cent.  However, I can say in my direct area of responsibility that within the last fortnight in the air transport sector there has been a 30-50 per cent cancellation of flight bookings. We are facing collapse and a disaster in the transport sector unprecedented in 20 years.  This is extremely serious and will have direct implications for growth in the economy.  This is not necessarily the Government's fault but planning will have to take account of the changes that are taking place weekly.  I understand all the US multinational firms who trade worldwide and have increasing interests in Europe have given direct instructions to all their personnel departments not to travel.  I understand that this will not only bring about a potential collapse in commercial trade and a deferral of investment decisions, but will be of disastrous proportions for tourism.  Aer Lingus this year may lose £40 million, a staggering loss on air transport services.  I fear many <Col N="1302" /> airlines throughout the world will be obliterated by what is happening.</P>
    <P>We export 80 per cent of what we produce.  We are an island economy on the periphery of Europe and we are dependent on access transport.  We will catch pneumonia if the rest of Europe catches a cold because of the Gulf War and transport recessionary factors. Therefore, I say the 2.25 per cent growth is mythical at this stage and the figure should be immediately recalculated. However, as I said, I fear there is a political element in this budget, that there will be no changes prior to the local elections and the agreement with the trade union movement, and that we will have a supplementary budget at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to two social areas of concern.  In every county and urban area there is a major problem with housing. Housing lists are growing, house construction is down to 10 per cent of the mid-eighties level.  This is unacceptable. People cannot afford accommodation of their own.  If the Government are not prepared to have a major capital housing propramme they will have to adopt a new policy to ensure that the private sector build houses and giving rent subsidy to eligible applicants.  I believe it is possible to do a deal with the Construction Industry Federation to build high quality accommodation units for families on local authority housing lists.  We would solve the problem by putting people into this accommodation and giving them a subsidy of £50 a week instead of the present differential rent subsidy of £90 a week.</P>
    <P>The second social area of concern is mental handicap.  This is an area of growing need because people are living longer and their quality of life has to be improved.  This means an improvement in residential care, day care services and community care services and this costs money.  There is no other way round it. We need a five year plan to deal with it. The neglect of the mentally handicapped in this budget is quite shameful.  Last year an extra £2 million as provided, but this year there is no mention of that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> I would like to say a few words about transport.  I have held this brief for only a fortnight but certain things strike me as being very significant.  First, I understand that the internal transport costs to get goods to our ports is 9 per cent of the added value of what is in the container. That is twice what it costs other Europeans to transport their goods to their ports.  Two thirds of that cost differential is due to an inadequate road infrastructure. It takes longer and is more costly to move around Ireland.  I find the delay in establishing a national roads authority to deal with 6 per cent of our national primary routes, port to port key route development, quite inexplicable since that legislation has been ready since 1988.  We need to spend £3 billion to develop our road infrastructure to European standards.  What do we get from the Government?  In the five years 1989-93, there is a net reduction of 19 per cent in Exchequer support for road building over that provided in 1984-88.  We have used this once off extra Europen money to substitute for Exchequer money.  This is shameful given our transport problems.</P>
    <P>We have structural problems, and we have a road authority and county engineers acting on their own at present in individual local authorities.  We have problems because of a lack of power and a lack of legislation by the Department of the Environment.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  On top of that internal transport problem we have the access transport penalty of £400 million because we are an island and growth in underpinning the social and economic programme. Growth has to pay for the debt reduction, improved social services and tax cuts.  Growth is vital, but how are we to have this growth unless we have a competitive infrastructure in place?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer in passing to a number of topical issues.  I cannot understand why the Government have still not brought forward any proposals to liberalise competition in the internal road passenger services. We are confined by the 1932 Road Transport Act which gives a monopoly to CIE.  We could have <Col N="1304" /> greater variety, greater choice, reduced fares, increased options and increased frequency of transport facilities if we liberalised and brought competition into the area of road transport for bus services &mdash; inter-city, provincial and within Dublin. I believe CIE and Dublin Bus will still have a very strong role to play, but I cannot understand why this legislation continues to be delayed and the losses continue to pile up in CIE and their subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport has signally failed to develop a two airline policy between Ireland and the UK.  We have seen the number of carriers on the Irish Sea reduce from six to three.  We know the difficulties of Ryanair and of their losses.  Ryanair developed new routes, for example into Farranfore.  What did Aer Lingus do?  They put on an identical route 20 minutes before the flight, reduced the prices and the result was two loss making routes.  Once there was no air fare and no route out of Farranfore, now there are two, both losing a fortune, and in the couple of years there will be none.  What does that do for regional airports?  Absolutely nothing.  We do not have a coherent two airline policy.  We need sensible rationalisation.  Of course there should be competition on the key Dublin-London route and I will come back to that, but we need to develop regional airports in a rational, orderly way based on a break down on what can be serviced by Ryanair and what can be serviced by Aer Lingus.  Morover, the deregulation of air fares was introduced in 1986, fares came crashing down and there was plenty of competition.  Now companies are going bust and foreign carriers are withdrawing.  When the fares came down; the Minister said he would not allow them to increase the fares even though fuel costs had increased by 100 per cent yet he has capped the increases on fares which has led to sustained losses and potential disaster where we would move back to an Aer Lingus monopoly.</P>
    <P>My firm view is there should be no price control where there is adequate competition.  If one wants a free market <Col N="1305" /> and deregulation then one cannot interfere with the market by capping fares. The Minister's short-sighted policy to temporarily fiddle the numbers in tourism had led to circumstances which, in the long term, mean we are heading back to a monopoly on the part of Aer Lingus and the extinguishing of Ryanair.  That would be a disaster for this country, something for which the Government only can take full responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are told that the B &amp; I Line are facing liquidation or other prospects.  I should like to make it clear that, as far as I am concerned, I am prepared to support the B &amp; I Line going out of State hands provided their employees share options and that the Government would have a buy-back option if this body were ever to get into the hands of a foreign-owned firm; provided that, at all costs, there would be an avoidance of liquidation, the strategic retention of routes on the Irish Sea and the avoidance of a monopoly by Sealink on the Irish Sea. Provided the Government pursue that clear agenda in relation to the B &amp; I Line they will have my support.  Otherwise we will be faced with major difficulties in the way that is handled.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words now about our ports because, in terms of volume, 99.2 per cent of all our exports go by sea through our ports.  The Harbours Act, 1946, regulates our ports. There are 23 or 24 people on the Dublin Port and Docks Board, with respect, who do not know the first thing about how to develop a port.  There is no commercial approach which means that 60 per cent of our traffic goes through Northern Ireland, which is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>In the short time available it is not possible to me to set out an integrated transport policy but, as far as I am concerned, one of the key elements of our competitiveness is to ensure that we have an integrated transport policy.  The Government have worsened the position by increases in VAT and road tax in this budget.  The failure of the Government to devise an integrated transport policy can only result in more job losses and additional emigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall Estimates with regard to the Agriculture and Food have been increased to £401 million, representing an increase of 31.5 per cent of the £305 million provided by the Government last year, a clear indication of the firm commitment of this Government to the farm sector and farming families.</P>
      <P>Obvioulsy the economic background impinges more on the farming community than on many others.  The provision of low inflation and lowest possible interest rates is of particular importance to the welfare of the farming sector.  On the inflation front major progress has been made, with the most recent figures showing that Ireland currently has the lowest rate of inflation within the EC. Unfortunately, interest rates remain high because of factors beyond our control, particularly the upward movement in German interest rates during the past year.  Nonetheless I hope that, with the commitment given in this budget to healthy public finances and our membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system, some easing in interest rates can be expected in the year ahead.  We do not want to see a repetition of the circumstances that prevailed in the mid-eighties when farm incomes were decimated because of lack of control of public expenditure here and inordinately high interest rates.</P>
      <P>The year 1990 was a difficult one for farmers.  Clearly, major challenges facing the industry in 1991.  Among these challenges are the negotiations to be faced on the proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, those on the GATT discussions which will resume shortly and the annual price negotiations which will be more difficult this year, more constrained than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the vital importance of this sector to our economy &mdash; not merely because of the vital interests of farmers and farming families but for those of the nation overall &mdash; as part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, I have given a commitment to maintain the closest possible contact with all the relevant farm organisations in <Col N="1307" /> relation to the negotiations to which I have referred.  Indeed, as soon as I have concluded my contribution to this debate I will be in consultation with all the farm organisations to discuss the agenda for the Council meeting in Brussels to be held on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  In all of these negotiations I will be stressing the fundamental importance to this country of the agriculture and food sector.  The need to maintain a vibrant, commercial farming sector must be accepted by the Community as part of a commitment to the long term competitiveness of the industry and our overall economy.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes which may come about in the process of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; for instance, aimed at discouraging very intensive, non-family farm type agriculture should be supported.  I am also very supportive of the continued commitment by the Community to rural development.  In this regard I expect that the operational programme for rural development &mdash; which I announced in December last &mdash; should make an important contribution to generating additional income and employment opportunities in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>What I would like to emphasise here today is that, in today's world, more than one kind of farming is needed.  We must have the fully efficient commercial sector &mdash; to which I have referred already &mdash; as the basis of an increasingly efficient food industry.  We must also ensure that a range of choices is available to other farmers because, without such choices, we cannot properly safeguard the viability of our rural areas.  These will be the two basic factors.</P>
    <P>Understandably, farmers are concerned about the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the GATT negotiations. I want to assure the House that I will continue to defend Irish interests, as I have done in recent years and in particular in the course of the most recent GATT negotiations when we did not concede to American demands.  I also want to repudiate the suggestion, particularly <Col N="1308" /> on the part of Deputy John Bruton this morning, that because Commissioner Leon Brittan made a statement to which I did not respond it meant that I automatically agreed with what he said.  I must assert, of course, that that is arrant nonsense.  If every statement made by every Commissioner of the EC &mdash; wherever or in whatever circumstances he may have made it &mdash; was to become part of this Government's policy unless we formally repudiated them, we would find ourselves lumbered with numerous policies we do not accept.  I do not think Deputy Bruton should make such specious arguments as he did this morning in that instance.</P>
    <P>With regard to farm taxation the Government are particularly concerned to encourage land mobility and its productive use on the part of young farmers especially.  For that reason the Government have decided to introduce a number of measures, including the improvement of installation aid &mdash; to which I will refer again in a couple of minutes &mdash; in particular the following:</P>
    <P>In order to encourage land mobility and its productive use, the exemption of leasehold income qualifying for income tax exemption is being raised to a figure of £3,000 from the existing £2,000.  Where such leases are given for seven or more years an exemption of £4,000 will apply.  A concern to facilitate structural change in agriculture also underlines some of the changes in the provisions for capital acquisitions tax.  Among the changes in the general provisions for this tax which should benefit farmers are: the abolition of the top two rates of this tax so that, in the future the top rate will be 40 per cent and the introduction of an amnesty allowing taxpayers to settle all outstanding capital acquisitions tax liabilities without penalties and certain interest payments.</P>
    <P>Of specific interest to agriculture is the change in the rate of agricultural relief from 50 per cent to 55 per cent.  At the same time the qualifying conditions will be amended in order to facilitate farm transfers, which is vitally important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> The present system of stock relief for farmers is being renewed for a further two years.  This is an important decision in the context of maintaining livestock numbers within the agricultural sector &mdash; which are at their highest ever level.  The cost of this measure is estimated at £0.9 million in 1991 and £3.0 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided also, as an exceptional measure, that the 50 per cent of accelerated capital allowances will be continued for two years to deal with farmyard pollution.  This is an important decision in the context of the need to make further progress in eliminating farmyard pollution and in the light of the pressure on farm incomes.  The expenditure is going to qualify for the allowances on a net-of-grant basis where incurred before 1 April 1993.  The estimated cost of this measure is £3.0 million in 1991 and £9.0 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I have made a strong case to the EC Commission for an extension of the area of the country at present classified as less-favoured by some two million acres, and for a re-classification of a further 1.5 million acres from less-severely handicapped, to more-severely handicapped status.  That case is being pursued vigorously both at ministerial and official level and I am confident that the necessary proposals will be made by the Commission very shortly and approved in time to enable benefiting farmers to be catered for under this year's disadvantaged areas scheme.  The effect of the changes, in so far as headage payments are concerned, will be that about 16,000 additional farmers will qualify for such payments for the first time and some 11,000 existing beneficiaries will qualify for increased payments because of re-classification. Thousands of farmers over and above that 27,000 will benefit from the increased headage payments we will put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In parallel with the <Col N="1310" /> extension and re-classification of the disadvantaged areas, the intention is to increase and restructure headage payments to make them more effective and to modulate them to take account of the degree of handicap suffered.  Deputies will appreciate that in advance of discussions with the EC Commission on the subject it would be entirely inappropriate for me to give details of the changes proposed.  I can say, however, that among the proposals is a substantial increase in the basic amount payable for beef cow in the more-severely handicapped areas and an increase in the number of animals on which that basic payment would be made; and increase in the basic amount payable on other cattle and also an increase in the maximum amount payable per beneficiary. Increases are also proposed in the less-severely handicapped areas.  These will be somewhat smaller to take account of the different degree of handicap.  They will cost approximately £3 million this year and in a full year cost in the order of £12 million.  The answer to Deputy Browne is that it will come into full effect this year.  Deputies on all sides will agree that that is a matter of major importance at this point.</P>
      <P>The Government have provided an additional £900,000 for the improvement of installation aid in line with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The installation scheme is providing an effective instrument in getting land into the hands of younger farmers.  To date, nearly 1,600 young farmers have qualified for a premium of £5,600 each when they take over a farm for the first time.  The total amount paid since the inception of that scheme is nearly £9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience of the operation of the scheme has shown that certain conditions have been too restrictive.  Up to now an applicant to qualify for the scheme, had to be a full-time farmer; he has had to have an enterprise of at least one man work unit and he had to own all the land he was taking over.  They were too restrictive.  I am now proposing that an applicant will be given two years within <Col N="1311" /> which to become a full-time farmer.  He will also be given two years to reach the required level of enterprise.  In addition account may be taken of leased land in assessing eligibility.  These changes will extend the scope of the scheme considerably and so enable more of our smaller farmers to avail of the benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that we are now increasing the standard costing on grant payments.  I have been conscious for some time that it is essential to adjust these in line with inflation, although they had not been adjusted for many years. I made the necessary arrangements to increase the costings by 15 per cent last August.</P>
    <P>It is now considered that a more satisfactory method of revising the costings would be to link them to an official index. The Government have now decided in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> that as and from August this year the costings will be automatically revised annually in accordance with a CSO index.  The full year cost has been estimated at £2 million.</P>
    <P>We are making £1 million available for aids to agricultural income.  This is a positive response to the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to address the problems of low income farming families.  It is my intention, in consultation with the Minister for Social Welfare, to draw up a suitable scheme which will assist those low income families who are dependent on farming activities for their income. The EC dimension will have to be respected and our intention is that the scheme now envisaged could be fitted into an improved EC scheme in the event of such a scheme being adopted.</P>

      <P>Teagasc were established more than two years ago to amalgamate the agricultural research, training and advisory services thereby enabling those services to be delivered in a more cost effective and efficient manner.  The <Col N="1312" /> reorganisation and streamlining of activities which Teagasc have undertaken since their establishment will enable them to fulfil their role in the development of the agriculture and food sector. The competition for markets both within the EC and elsewhere is becoming more intense.  It is essential therefore if we are to remain competitive, that our producers and food processors be capable of competing with their international counterparts.</P>
      <P>Teagasc, through their agricultural programmes, provide essential services for the agriculture and food sectors.  The Government, in recognition of the important role Teagasc have in these vital sectors of the economy, have decided to provide an additional £1.2 million to that body.  I am further exploring the possibility of drawing down further funds from European funds providing for the development of natural resources.  I will be able to indicate that an extra allocation over and above what I am providing today will be forthcoming for Teagasc in the relatively near future.</P>
      <P>As already announced the Government have decided to increase the grant-in-aid for CBF to £1.5 million in 1991, which compares to an original provision of £500,000 in 1990.  In addition an amount of £750,000 will be provided for CBF from the Structural Funds this year. This means that the combined provision for the organisation from public funds in 1991 is £2.25 million which is £1.75 million up on the original provision last year and £1.5 million up on the 1990 outturn.</P>
      <P>The programme which I expect CBF to put in place will also involve additional funding from the industry itself, structured in such a way that it is not an extra charge on farmers.  The State contribution is conditional on those additional industry funds being available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made special provisions in the budget relating to the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  I announced a national programme for the development and servicing of the industry in November 1988 and the response so far has been excellent. While that programme contained <Col N="1313" /> many specific proposals, a very important element of it was my commitment to establish a horse breeding advisory committee representative of the various sectors to advise me on relevant matters. Over the past 12 months great progress has been made and I am now providing £75,000 for this organisation to ensure that we can specifically represent the interests of the breeders in this very dynamic sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>We are also making provision for a support grant of over £10,000 for the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society, a society that is know worldwide and has done dramatic work for agri-tourism. This is money that will be well repaid due to their considerable efforts.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the budget to cater for the ongoing situation in relation to BSE.  The BSE problem should be seen in proper context.  Out of a total cattle population of 7 million we had 15 cases in 1989, of which five were animals imported from the UK; 14 cases in 1990, of which one was imported, and two cases to date in 1991.  This trickle of cases, were it in respect of any other non-viral animal disease, would not be a matter of major concern.  Yet, because of the unprecedented publicity which it has attracted and the unwarranted linkage with health concerns, the meat export trade has suffered.  Our third country trading partners have been seeking certain guarantees and it is imperative that we do everything possible, within reason, to satisfy their requirements.  The efforts I have made to convince our trading partners of the absolute safety of Irish meat will be successful.</P>
    <P>In the light of the situation that has arisen, there is a general consensus among farming organisations, the meat trade and others that a voluntary depopulation by the herdowners of the herds that had cases of BSE would facilitate the certification requirements of third countries.  Accordingly, I am providing for a Supplementary Estimate of £2 million this year, as was done last year, to fund the depopulation programme. That is a measure of the Government's commitment to maintain the status and <Col N="1314" /> image of the Irish beef herd and of Irish food abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that this BSE problem is not indigenous to Ireland and has no base in Ireland.  What we have has been imported but because of the importance of beef and of beef exports to this economy we have taken steps that no other country has taken.  It is an indigenous problem in Britain but they have not decided to depopulate every herd where it is found.  We have decided to do that, at very considerable cost if necessary.  Last year £2 million was provided and an extra £2 million is being provided this year in respect of a total of only 31 animals.  The animals, of course, affect the herd in terms of compensation, even though they do not have any disease problem.  That extra £2 million, which is a measure of our commitment to this sector, will guarantee that our reputation abroad will be protected and enhanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 8 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The value of the benefit derived from free board and lodgings enjoyed by an unemployment assistance claimant is assessed by reference to the net income of the person or persons providing the board and lodgings divided by the number of dependants in the household. In arriving at the assessment, disregards and allowances are made in respect of certain outgoings.</P>
      <P>In all cases the benefit is calculated by reference to the income of the persons providing the benefit, in most cases this would be the parents of the claimant. Where there are other members of the household who have an independent income, such as working brothers or sisters, their income is usually excluded from the calculation.</P>
      <P>The requirement to take account of board and lodgings has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants in different family circumstances; between applicants whose parents are well-to-do and those whose parents are in poorer circumstances.  Otherwise, people living in affluent circumstances would become entitled to the same level of assistance as those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> I am satisfied that the underlying principle of relating the value of board and lodgings in any case to the income level of the household in which he or she resides is essentially a good one and that it should remain a feature of the social welfare system.  If such people are unemployed their costs would normally be lower in the family home than somewhere else where they would have to pay for food and accommodation.  I am concerned that improvements in the system should be made where possible.  For this reason, I have decided to introduce from July next a minimum payment of unemployment assistance of £5 a week.  This will apply to those persons who are entitled to some payment but of an amount less than £5 because of a high means assessment from board and lodgings.  I hope to make further improvements in the future. Improvements will of course have to be gradual because of the financial implications. In 1981 a study estimated that it would cost over £21 million to abolish the board and lodgings provision and the cost now would be considerably higher.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not maintained in a form which would provide the detailed information sought in Question No. 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the system of calculation of the value of board and lodgings is archaic, totally outdated and unrelated to reality?  I have a copy here of the regulations given to me by the Minister's Department.  Would the Minister further agree that the taking into account of the family income in assessing another person's means has had the effect in many cases of breaking up families where such families will no longer tolerate what they see as a parasite in their midst and the attitude is &ldquo;pay up or get out&rdquo;?  Very many young people are forced into emigration or otherwise out of the family home.  Would he agree that it is time to review this provision?  The payment of £5 will not be effective.  It is a baby step where a gaint step is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately in this area every step has very serious financial implications.  I agree with the Deputy in <Col N="1318" /> so far as I should like to have those means tests eased, but it is of course a budgetary matter because the costs are so substantial. If we take the cost produced by the 1981 study and update it to the current levels based on the consumer price index, it would be £35 million.  A substantial change in numbers would have to be added.  The Commission on Social Welfare examined this matter in some detail and recommended that the benefit and privilege assessment should be maintained. One of their proposals was that a basic allowance of £10 should be achieved in order to get over some of the anomalies. That recommendation was based on 1985-86 levels.  In principle and in equity they found that it was right but notwithstanding that I would be anxious to improve the basic position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the income of brothers and sisters is sometimes disregarded and sometimes taken into account.  Would he agree that the reality is that brothers and sisters pay their keep only and that the amount they pay has no relationship whatever to the wellbeing of the person who cannot pay and that to take this into account in assessing needs is unfair and inequitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is taken into account only in some circumstances.  However, as the Deputy has raised this question, I will look at the matter.  I am doing a number of things which relate to this area and they will be dealt with in further questions. I am anxious to make any improvements I can.  It is largely a question of the amount of money available and where it can most equitably be spent.  That is what has prevented previous Ministers from taking any action in that area.  I have taken some action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 2, 7, 29, 57 and 60 together. The new carers' scheme, which I introduced last November, provides that a carers' allowance is payable, subject to a means test, to persons providing full-time care and attention to incapacitated persons who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments.  This new scheme represented a major improvement on the older prescribed relative's allowance scheme.  The allowance was increased from £28 to £45.  It is payable direct to the carer.  Furthermore for the first time a married person dependent on his or her spouse can qualify as a carer.  The spouse of a pensioner may also qualify and a carer who is not a relative of the pensioner is also eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very happy to be in a position to extend the scheme later this year to persons caring for recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance and I <Col N="1320" /> believe that this is a major development in the provision of support for the people involved.  In addition I will be increasing the rate of the allowance from £45 to £50.</P>
    <P>The allowance is payable subject to a means test which is on similar lines to the means tests of other social assistance schemes operated by my Department.  It is directed to those who are in greatest need.</P>
    <P>The total number of claims in payment is approximately 3,500.  This comprises some 1,650 new awards in addition to some 1,850 people who were previously in receipt of prescribed relatives allowance and who have retained that entitlement. Claims for the allowance are being received at the rate of some 320 per week. As at 28 January 1991 a total of 3,992 applications for the careers' allowance had been received in my Department.  Of these, 1,650 have been awarded while 1,210 were refused.  The number of applicants in receipt of the maximum carers' allowance rate of £45 per week is 1,142. This represents almost 70 per cent of the total number of new awards made.  The outstanding cases are awaiting decision. Statistics are not maintained in my Department regarding the number of applicants who transferred to the carers' allowance having previously been in receipt of another payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that because of the publicity hype he engaged in when he introduced the carers' allowance the first time that he created an atmosphere of false expectations which were cruelly dashed when people who believed they were entitled to benefit were refused?  Is it not true that in the last month, despite the figure the Minister has given there, two out of every three applications were refused or the recipients got very meagre amounts?  Is it not true that ever since the budget yesterday most of those people will not be able to qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget will of course increase all the means limits because of the increases in child dependant allowances, the increases in adult dependant <Col N="1321" /> allowances and the increases in the basic rates.  The limits will also be increased because of the increase in the basic allowance and a table of this will be made available shortly.  The Deputy is saying, and I have heard some of his colleagues saying so publicly, that I hyped up the expectations.  That is nonsense.

We made it very clear that this was a social welfare carer's allowance and, in all the broadcasting and in all the publicity, that was emphasised.  We emphasised it very specially because I knew that there were many people caring for elderly or disabled people who would have higher incomes.  I expressed here in the House and outside appreciation of the work those people did.</P>

      <P>One of the major disappointments in relation to it was for people on disabled persons' maintenance allowance.  When we brought this Bill through last year I said I wanted to bring them in but that I had not got the money to do it at that time.  I have got authority to set up a new scheme.  We did that and I said that as soon as I could I would bring <Col N="1322" /> those on DPMA into the scheme.  They are not under the control of my Department but of the Department of Health. In the Act last year we took the power to do this without having to come back to the House and that was discussed here in the House when we discussed the Bill. We are now in a position to extend it to those on DPMA as well as increasing it at this time.  Leaving out the people whose names exceeded the limit the majority of the people who are failing to get the carer's allowance at this time would be failing because of the DPMA but those people will now be catered for.</P>

      <P>The consequences for Irish agriculture of the outcome of the GATT negotiations is one of issues specifically addressed under the heading of agricultural development in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The programme recognises the importance of negotiating compensatory arrangements in the form of increased EC-funded income supports directed towards the family farm, as well as the need to promote structural reforms. Our objective is to maintain as many farm families in the countryside as possible with acceptable income levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Programme the Government are committed to consider in consultation with farming organisations, arrangements to address the problem of low-income farming families, taking account of relevant developments at EC level.  The smallholders unemployment assistance is a major form of income support for low-income farmers.  Many improvements have been made in the scheme in recent years both in the rates of payment and in the assessment of income.  The future development of social welfare provisions for farmers <Col N="1324" /> including the smallholders scheme will be considered in the context of the examination of income support for farmers under the programme.</P>

Is it the case that, as all the economists predict, there will be another 25,000 Irish farmers living below the poverty line this year because of the GATT negotiations?  Has the Minister scope, and the financial capacity within the Department of Social Welfare, to pay them the farmers' dole when they apply for it?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>when community welfare officers currently employed by the health boards will become directly responsible to his Department; the reasons for the proposed change; and if he has satisfied himself that such a change will enhance the provision of services already being provided by community welfare officers.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My objective is to ensure that all income maintenance services will be delivered in a co-ordinated and cost effective manner.  In so far as possible, clients should have only one point of contact when claiming their entitlements.  It was for this reason that I introduced the one-stop-shop approach.</P>
      <P>This is reflected in the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to further streamline social assistance provisions and to provide for the greater integration into the social welfare system of the supplementary welfare allowance provision and related schemes currently administered by the health boards.</P>
      <P>Many of the services provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are provided to clients who are already in receipt of some other service from my Department.  I am currently having the range of services provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme examined to identify those aspects which could most readily be integrated with the services provided directly by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All aspects of these matters and there implications for other services currently provided by community welfare officers will be fully discussed with the Department of Health and the health boards before detailed arrangements are finalised. I recognise that changes along these <Col N="1326" /> lines will have certain implications for community welfare officers and these are among the issues which will be addressed in the context of changes to the existing arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will take the Minister up on the last sentence in his reply.  Whatever problems the community welfare officers may have about the subsequent changes they are nothing compared with the problems the changes might create for people who depend on the community welfare officers for an instant decision or reaction to their problem. May I ask the Minister to say what will happen when the work of community welfare officers is subsumed into the Department of Social Welfare?  Will the bureaucratic system get tied up again? The community welfare officers are very important to the underprivileged and the low paid, as the Minister well knows. They may not be able to act in that capacity in future so I would ask the Minister to give great thought to this before any changes are made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is obviously true, a great deal of thought has to be given to this question and is currently being given to it, otherwise it would have been a fairly simple matter.  It was recommended in the commission's report and in various other reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one-stop-shop approach integrates the various provisions and makes information available instantly.  At this stage we are providing links to the health boards to ensure that information is available because it is usually the information that causes the delays.  Ultimately the community welfare officers have a function which is essential as the person of last resort when all the routine schemes are not meeting a particular set of circumstances. We have streamlined and standardised a number of the schemes. For example, the fuel scheme has been standardised and a footwear and clothing scheme has been introduced.  This has made payments more automatic.  Notwithstanding that there will still be an <Col N="1327" /> element of decision in relation to exceptional payments.  In any arrangements that will be made it is vital that speed in decision making will continue and the discretional element will still have to be involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the fact that community welfare officers are based locally, are known in the locality and are accessible within minutes to the people who depend on them.  I cannot see the Minister bringing in a scheme that will dovetail into the local scene; that will provide the kind of benefits that people need for one reason or another because the ordinary services do not meet their needs.  The community welfare officer makes help available within hours, not days or weeks.  Our experience is that the social welfare officers and Department of Social Welfare, for very good reason, have a longer process and obviously it takes weeks if not months sometimes to reach a decision, and they are in no position to provide the type of instant reaction which I speak about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare officers are providing for pensions and longer-term payments generally and that is a different matter.  The community welfare officers are providing interim payments, special needs payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and discretionary payments. They are local.  We are developing a local social welfare service.  Obviously if you can provide these services in a one-stop-shop in a local area, you have the best of both worlds.  However that is being discussed.  What we have done, for instance, is to put the bulk of the fuel payments into a standardised system and that leaves the community welfare officers to deal with the 8,000 or 9,000 cases where discretion is needed and <Col N="1328" /> where a scheme would not pick up certain types of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the idea of a one-stop-shop for social welfare and supplementary welfare allowance payments, could the Minister assure us that there will be more uniform testing and more uniform payments arising out of the one-stop-shop than we have under the present system for supplementary welfare where there is a wide difference in payments in various places within the one health board area and even within counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there can be variations within health boards.  With the provision of modern equipment it is possible to make the whole system much more uniform in the treatment of people. However once you have a discretionary element &mdash; and the community welfare officers have to operate that discretionary element &mdash; there will be individual decisions that will be different.  These should be looked at from time to time to ensure that a similar standard is being applied throughout.  That is the kind of thing we have had to do.  We have tried to standardise schemes and at the end of the year we look at how it worked out and we find variations.  You then have to decide what was right and what is possible.  However I agree with the Deputy that there should be a high degree of uniformity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the fact that there is no uniformity and the need for such uniformity, would the Minister not agree that part of the reason for the tremendous confusion particularly in the administration of the supplementary welfare scheme is that there are unpublished regulations and directives to community welfare officers which are at variance <Col N="1329" /> with the legislation?  While we would all collectively agree that we need a one-stop-shop approach to these payments, the first step would be to allow the present social welfare appeals officers in D'Olier House to act as listening agents for appeals by people who have been turned down for supplementary welfare benefit. There is absolute confusion.  It is a fog. The Minister is probably aware that FLAC published a document the other day to educate people in the caring communities as to how this scheme operates. Because of the variations in approaches from health board to health board and district to district&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the exact problem Deputy Stagg says on the one hand he wants uniformity and on the other hand he wants discretion.  The system, as Deputy Connaughton said, requires discretion. All you can do in terms of uniformity is provide some guidelines but the discretion still rests with the local people within broad guidelines.  That element will continue because of the nature of the work done by the community welfare officers.  They are the last people facing the difficulties when other systems are not providing support.</P>

      <P>At present social welfare officers spend an inordinate amount of time &mdash; six weeks at least &mdash; investigating pensions.  At <Col N="1330" /> community level there is on-the-spot reaction.  Is there a danger that instead of bringing the six weeks investigation back to on-the-spot decisions, we will have it the other way round and people who are really in need will be delayed because, of further regulations, if this goes through?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The current signing arrangements for unemployed people are governed by statutory regulations which require claimants for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to sign the unemployed register to prove that they are available for, and genuinely seeking, work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the majority of cases, claimants who live within six miles of a local office are only required to attend there once weekly when they make a declaration of their unemployment and collect their payment in cash.  Claimants who reside over six miles from the local office are required to attend at their local Garda station or approved signing centre each week to have their unemployment declarations certified by a member of the Garda Síochána. These claimants are paid at their <Col N="1331" /> local Post Office.  The signing arrangements, therefore, are specifically designated to indicate the days on which the claimants were unemployed each week so that their payments can be computed correctly.</P>
    <P>The Department have a responsibility to ensure that claimants are genuinely unemployed and seeking work.  I have been examining ways to modify the signing arrangements for suitable categories of claimants.  In considering what changes can be made, I have to take account of the fact that payment to people who attend at the local office is made there and then in cash.  The current signing arrangements are geared to meet this system and can only be changed as and when alternative methods of payment are introduced.</P>
    <P>In March 1990 I introduced a pre-retirement allowance scheme for those over 60 years of age on long term unemployment assistance.  Under this scheme claimants are paid by pension orders which they cash at their local Post Office and make a declaration on unemployment once a year.  These claimants no longer have to sign on on a weekly basis.  Accordingly, I am very glad to be able to announce this year that the minimum age for this pre-retirement allowance is being reduced to 58 years.</P>
    <P>I am now examining the possibility of other categories of long term claimants being paid by order book which would also enable less frequent signing arrangements to be introduced for them.  These and other alternative payment methods are currently in the course of development. When introduced they will create the possibility of greater flexibility in the arrangements for signing-on.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the statutory regulations to which he refers can be changed by the Minister and by this House at any time and that the system he has described to the House is degrading and demeaning for the people concerned and unnecessary from the point of view of demonstrating that they are unemployed, available and seeking <Col N="1332" /> work, because it does not do any of these things?  Would the Minister not agree that payment methods using modern technology, given that there are computers in every shop in the country operating the Lotto, is no longer a problem?  Payment can be made by giro, by cheque and by post without the necessity to queue, often in very bad conditions and sometimes out under the elements, to obtain these payments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of things in relation to that issue.  In the way we are developing our social welfare services I would hope that information would be available at our local offices for unemployed people about opportunites of various kinds and options which would be available.  It is important that that approach be taken and that people come, as far as possible, to get something or to get information.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that under an agreement made with An Post a system is being developed whereby the Department of Social Welfare will supply An Post with information on the UA and UB payments each week.  From this An Post would produce a postal warrant to be called a pay draft which they will send to local post offices for collection and encashment there by unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit claimants.  A pilot scheme embracing 1,000 claimants at two employment exchanges is to be launched later in the year.  If this is successful it can be extended.  We are doing a number of things to try to improve that situation. The other is that the alternative payment methods will require computerisation of the local office procedures.  We hope to have all our local offices computerised by the end of this year.  We are beginning to concentrate on the branch exchange offices now.  That would make many of these other methods of payment possible. We will keep the Deputy's views in mind.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all permanent residents of the State aged 66 years and over, including widows, and to certain categories of disabled people under 66 years of age.  The scheme also covers their spouses when they travel with them.</P>
      <P>The major benefit of the free travel scheme is that it enables elderly and disabled people who otherwise might not be in a position to get around to remain active and involved in social and other related activities.  Any further extension of the scheme to cover additional people would be expensive.  Where the resources for improvements in social welfare provisions are limited and while there are pressing needs to be met in many other areas, the scope for any extension is similarly limited.</P>
      <P>However, the possibility of extending the free travel arrangements is kept under review.  It would, of course, have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>My Department are responsible for administering a number of supports for voluntary and community groups working for the benefit of the disadvantaged in our society.  In 1990, the total value of grants provided to such organisations was almost £2 million.</P>
      <P>My Department are responsible for administering a scheme of once-off grants to voluntary bodies operating in the social services area.  A total of 125 projects working with deprived people were assisted under this scheme in 1990 and the overall value of grants made amounted to £750,000.</P>
      <P>I also introduced in 1990 a new scheme of grants for locally based women's groups under which 199 groups throughout the country received grants totalling £350,000.  In allocating grants, priority was given to groups in disadvantaged areas and the range of activities funded included home management programmes, counselling and advice services, self-development programmes, community education, women's health programmes, young parent's groups, projects for women affected by family violence and traveller's projects.  This programme was very successful and provided very worthwhile assistance for the groups concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Last year also the Government allocated a sum of £525,000 for a three-year programme of community development. Under this programme, grants are being made towards the cost of equipping and staffing resource centres which provide a focal point for community development in local urban and rural disadvantaged areas.  The activities being undertaken include local enterprise initiatives and projects for the elderly, young families, single parents, the unemployed and other groups in need of help, support, advice and information.  Fifteen projects were assisted under this scheme in 1990.  I have arranged to have issued to the Deputy a list of projects supported under the schemes of grants for women's groups and voluntary and community development organisations.</P>
    <P>In addition to these three major support mechanisms for voluntary and community organisations several special once-off grants were also made in 1990. Grants totalling £150,000 were made to support the work of the six rape crisis centres around the country.</P>
    <P>In December last, I provided a grant of £100,000 to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to enable the society continue its very successful nationwide programme of personal development and home management courses for women in the home.</P>
    <P>I also provided a grant of £50,000 to the Simon Community to support work projects for homeless people in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk and Galway.  This grant was also used to upgrade the accommodation provided by the Simon Community, to develop an effective referral system for homeless people and to devise a resettlement strategy for some of Simon's long term residents.</P>
    <P>A further £25,000 was provided towards the costs of a pilot scheme on child abuse prevention in the Eastern Health Board area.  In addition, my Department are also responsible for funding the Combat Poverty Agency. The 1990 allocation to the agency was £1.1 million and of this amount, almost £650,000 was used to support community-based projects throughout the country.  These include the three Irish <Col N="1337" /> projects participating in the third EC poverty programme which received over £400,000 through the agency in 1990.</P>

Arising from the Minister's reply, I want to ask him a question about the uncertainty of funding for these pilot schemes.  Would the Minister agree that it is impossible for these voluntary groups to plan properly when there is no certainty about the funding they will receive &mdash; it is always a once off type of payment?  Is it necessary for the funding to be a once-off nature so that the Minister can come into the House every year and tell us about all the great things he has done?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Waterford who is in receipt of unemployment benefit is not allowed an allowance in respect of his son who is over 18 and in full-time education in Dungarvan VEC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When the child dependant allowance for 18-21 year olds in full-time education was introduced it applied only to persons in receipt of widows' pension and analogous payments.  Over the last three years I have extended this to other persons on long term social welfare payments, including the long term unemployed. The last step of this process will be completed this year with the raising from 20 to 21 of the age limit for allowances in those cases.  I believe this is a <Col N="1338" /> major achievement at a time when resources are limited.</P>
      <P>Improvements costing £150 million in a full year have been made in this year's budget.  These include a number of improvements in provision for families on social welfare.  In addition to the raising of the age limit from 20 to 21 there is an increase in the minimum child dependant payment to £12 and a reduction from six to three in the number of different rates of child dependant allowances.  The budget also provides for a six week after death payment of child dependant allowance where a child dependant of a long term social welfare recipient dies. Another innovation is the continuation throughout the summer of child dependant allowances in payment for children over 18 in full time education whether they continue in full time education or not.</P>
      <P>The payment of child dependant allowances over age 18 to the long term unemployed is in recognition of the extra financial pressures caused by long term unemployment.  Persons on short term payments such as unemployment benefit do not qualify for the payment of child dependant allowances in respect of children over age 18.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government are committed to implementing a major programme of measures directed at child and family support.  The measures to be taken will be drawn up with a view to directing assistance at those in greatest need and the future development of child dependant allowances will be considered in that context.  The person in question does not qualify because he is on unemployment benefit which is, of course, a short term payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally find the Minister to be fair minded and receptive to change where inequities are concerned. Would the Minister not agree that there is inequity in a system where a person on unemployment benefit cannot receive an allowance in respect of their child while a person on long term unemployment assistance can receive a benefit in respect of his son or daughter?  I do not think this inequity can be justified.  Does the Minister hold out the hope that this matter will be resolved satisfactorily in the review he has just spoken about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of the difference is that a person on unemployment benefit can receive pay-related benefit in addition to unemployment benefit, as the person in question in this case does. There are two factors involved in this issue.  One is that a person can receive pay-related benefit in addition to unemployment benefit and the other is that a person might only be on unemployment benefit for six, eight or nine months and his resources are not as depleted.  That is the theory of the scheme.  Three years ago I got agreement at Government to extend this to the long term unemployed, spreading the cost over three years.  The third phase is now coming in for the long term unemployed and analogous groups. Other benefits, such as educational opportunities and so on, are also related to the long term unemployed only.  I will be looking at that question to see what I can do, even in the medium-term.  It is certainly one of the questions that will be considered in the review to take place within the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which provides for the allocation of extra resources for children.</P>

      <P>In framing my proposals for the budget I take account of all the views which are expressed to me by organisations and individuals either orally or in writing.  These views are extremely important in helping me to formulate proposals which respond most effectively to the needs of people who rely on the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>In 1988 for the first time I held a pre-budget forum for voluntary organisations. This forum gave an opportunity for a number of organisations, many of them broadly representative of different categories of social welfare recipients, to express to me and discuss with each other, their particular concerns with regard to the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>Social welfare provisions for families constitute a very fundamental aspect of family policy.  A number of social welfare schemes are specifically directed by families and I have had a specific focus on families in the various improvements which I have introduced.  Recent studies have shown the central importance of support for families on low incomes in the context of developments in the social welfare system.  I consider that the perspective of an organisation like Family Solidarity is useful to me in developing policies in this area and I valued their constructive contribution to the discussions.</P>

Bodies such as the Coolock Law Centre, the National Campaign for Welfare Reform, FLAC and the Dublin Welfare Rights Centre were not invited.  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed got two days notice which was not adequate.  Can the Minister explain why a misnamed organisation like Family Solidarity, the same people who opposed the abolition of illegitimacy and the Child Care Bill which protects children from physical and mental abuse, were invited?

I know that this year they complained that for some reason they did not get their notification, but I will not go into that now.  The staff in the Department contacted everybody at the same time.  It happened that some members of the INOU were away at the time of the meeting and it would have suited them better to have those representatives present.  As far as we are concerned we invited everybody in the same way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who were invited had been involved in publicly debating these issues at the time, people who represented groups which had produced views about social welfare and what was required in social welfare.  We certainly were not short of experts.  We invited groups representing the various categories such as the Catholic Social Service Conference, the Federation of Pensioners Associations, the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped, the National Association of Widowers in Ireland &mdash; this is the first time they were recognised and involved &mdash; the National Association of Widows in Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents &amp; Their Children and the Tallaght Welfare Society.  There are many of other welfare societies but that society made submissions to me independently. They represented a community group who are very deeply involved in practical work and, therefore, we invited them.  One could say that a lot of other welfare societies should have been invited also but it is not possible to have everybody present.  The Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed were also invited.  Women in the <Col N="1342" /> home expressed views about their situation. The Conference of Major Religious Superiors were invited in each of the years but they did not attend because they, apparently, preferred to have a separate meeting.  All these groups are free to meet me separately.  I am not aware that we have ever refused anybody a meeting.</P>
      <P>What we were trying to do was get a cross section of views and find new solutions.  That has proved to be very valuable, effective and useful, particularly where we are targeting resources. There are other fora to which other groups are invited.  We will consider the matter again in the context of the next budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>After I introduced the lone parents allowance scheme in November 1990, I had the investigative procedures reviewed and revised where appropriate. While the new procedures have not yet been fully implemented, the target being set is three weeks for the issue of a supplementary payment in respect of an additional child.  This target includes the time taken to have an allowance book ordered, printed and distributed to the relevant post office.  The new procedures have been fully tested and are being extended to all claimants.</P>
      <P>Under the new procedures, investigations into general compliance by the claimant with the conditions regarding cohabitation and the other relevant conditions now take place independently of the issue of the allowance book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it takes substantially longer than <Col N="1343" /> three weeks, as mentioned by him, to process the claim for supplementary payment? When a lone parent gives birth to an additional child and makes a claim for the allowance, the Department go to extreme lengths to investigate the matter. There is a tendency to invade the privacy of the lone parent to a degree that is unacceptable.  Will the Minister agree that it has taken on occasions six months for a lone parent to clear herself in order to receive the extra benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that under the legislation the arrival of an additional child raised the question of whether the person is cohabiting.  Normally an investigation takes place to determine whether the status of the claimant has changed.  What I said in the reply is that since the introduction of the lone parents allowance scheme in November last, the Department have operated a pilot scheme, making some preliminary urgent inquiries into the case and then issuing the allowance book, letting the investigations take their course.  The position has changed completely with the introduction of the scheme in November. New legislation as brought before the House which provides that following the award cases are referred to the social welfare officer for investigation.  That has reduced the delay in deciding claims to an average of one to two weeks.  The issuing of the book could take another week and that is why I mentioned three weeks.  That is the position under the new legislation, following the pilot study which was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that he will in future accept a birth certificate as proof of the arrival of another child?  There is no need for his Department's officials to be snooping establishing that another child has appeared.  It is disturbing and unacceptable because, presumably, the Department of Social Welfare feel that lone parents should not have any more children.  This is a dangerous assumption <Col N="1344" /> but it is the way it is interpreted by many recipients of the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, we do not pay a lone parent's allowance to married couples; it is only paid to single parents living alone.  One of the conditions is that the person is not cohabiting.  If a person has an additional child it at least raised the question whether her status has changed and if she is cohabiting.  If the Deputy looks at the record of investigations he will find that there are many reasons for claims being discontinued.  One is because of cohabitation and that is a normal element in our scheme and of schemes in other countries, there is nothing unusual in it.  We did a pilot study and the new administrative system involves establishing that the child is there and then issuing the book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to the assessment, under the Social Welfare Acts, of income from self-employment for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
      <P>For unemployment assistance purposes, income from self-employment is assessed in accordance with section 146 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which provides that certain income that a person may expect to receive during the succeeding year in cash shall constitute his or her means.  The main items assessable as means are earnings from self-employment and the value of assets such as capital and properties.  This section also provides that in the absence of other methods of assessing it, such income shall be taken to be the income actually received during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no fixed dates of assessment <Col N="1345" /> of means for people who engage in self-employment. Following the initial assessment, reviews of means are carried out as circumstances dictate.  It is open to all claimants to seek a review of their means if at any time they feel that the assessment of income in their case does not accurately reflect their situation.</P>
    <P>Because earnings from self-employment are assessable as means, people with casual, part-time or occasional self-employment are permitted to sign the live register each day.  This arrangement avoids any inequity or difficulties arising from seasonal fluctuations in earnings from self-employment.</P>
    <P>I have introduced a number of measures to facilitate unemployed people who want to get back into the workforce.  I am concerned to ensure that the social welfare system is able to respond to changing trends in employment and I will be examining the present arrangements to see what further opportunities can be made available to unemployed people in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Shakespeare seems to rule in the Department of Social Welfare.  He once said that there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.  It is wrong to penalise a person who signed off at the employment exchange because he wanted work painting a house and for the official to automatically decide the following January that the person has that income every week.  After all, if the person was sure of getting work he would not sign on in the first place.  If the Minister lost his job in the morning &mdash; which is very unlikely &mdash; and he was told next January that because he had £150 per week all last year it was assumed he had the same this year, it would be most unfair. Because a person earns £300 per week during the summer it is automatically assumed that it is the person's income the following year.  Will the Minister look at this question because it is grossly unjust to genuinely unemployed people who may get casual labour and, who, because they are honest, sign off?</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that it was not Shakespeare who introduced the legislation governing this, but some of our predecessors.  I said in my reply that I am sympathetic to the point of view expressed by the Deputy, but he must recognise that people may have other earnings yielding an income. It may be from capital or land and could be substantial.  However, in the context of encouraging people to take up casual labour, it should be resolved and I will certainly look into the matter.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I thank the Minister for taking a positive line in relation to this matter because, among other things, it discourages honesty.  If people who report the fact that they are working are punished for doing so, they will obviously have second thoughts in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister is sympathetic in this regard. Why is there a general air of suspicion in relation to people who had been self-employed and who for one reason or another, fell on hard times?  Surely this could be resolved by the Revenue Commissioners who could account for the incomes?  If a person in such circumstances runs into difficulties they are entitled to benefit from the social welfare system, like everybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If they run into difficulties they are entitled to help but they would have to look for a review in those circumstances. The suspicion regarding wealth is because the schemes are assistance schemes and the question of wealth must arise as, otherwise, the money would be spread too thinly.  The Revenue Commissioners are now more efficient because of computerisation and there is a greater opportunity of using the system to overcome some of these problems. Deputy Browne was concerned about people wanting to work on a casual basis and who are penalised.  This problem must be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am engaged in a building programme to provide new offices and to improve existing ones to ensure that all the <Col N="1348" /> Department's local offices will measure up to a high standard in the quality of facilities available for the public and staff alike.  There is no set timetable for completing this programme but it is being advanced as quickly as financial and technical resources will allow.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years with a total of 15 new social welfare services offices provided and extensive refurbishment carried out to ten others. At present work on a further two new offices, at Ennis and Limerick, is nearing completion.  In addition, two major decentralised offices have been opened, at Sligo and Letterkenny, and a new social welfare appeals office has been provided in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the progress already made in improving the standard of my Department's offices will be maintained. I am examining proposals for a number of new offices to replace existing accommodation and extend services to new areas.  My immediate priorities include new offices at Tallaght, Navan Road and Finglas in Dublin and in Kilkenny.  New offices will be constructed in Wexford and Longford as part of the proposed decentralisation projects planned for these towns.  Work on the Dublin offices mentioned and the new Kilkenny office is scheduled to commence this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new offices, it is planned to commence extensive refurbishment work this year to the Department's offices in Athlone, Carlow, Cavan, Mullingar and Werburgh Street, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Accommodation needs are not static. They are influenced by a variety of factors, including the demand on services in particular areas and developing trends in service provision.  I have asked my Department to keep the position under constant review so that we can respond to emerging needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear, given that this very clause has been inserted in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> that the social partners feel that the conditions prevailing at employment <Col N="1349" /> exchanges are not good.  Having regard to the fact that there are 53 employment exchanges and 79 branch offices would the Minister not agree that we still have a long way to go?  Improvements are being made, as the Minister indicated at between 20 and 25 of these offices but this is insignificant given the overall numbers. Furthermore, many unemployed people feel both humiliated and degraded and are of the view that the offices are filthy and more often than not there is no privacy in dealing with officials.  In conclusion, would the Minister confirm that it is his intention to upgrade all the exchanges as quickly as possible so that they will be far more than just employment exchanges?  At present one does not go there to look for information on jobs but rather in respect of unemployment benefits.  They should be both an employment exchange where information on jobs is available and also an information office where recipients of the dole can have their entitlements and benefits outlined. They should be more than just places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am particularly happy that the social partners have taken an interest in the development and improvement of our offices throughout the country and that a reference to this matter is included in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> As the House can see, a great deal of progress has been made in this area recently. Indeed, many people now come from abroad to look at some of our major offices, such as the pensions office, which is an interesting development.  I disagree with the Deputy who said that what we have been doing is insignificant, rather it is very significant.  During the past three to four years I have been very conscious <Col N="1350" /> of the need to refurbish and rebuild offices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would he also not agree that because there is often only room for, say, two people, many have to queue outside in the elements where the Department's inspector may <Col N="1351" /> arrive to examine people's hands to see if they have been working?  We need to look at that aspect as well as at the offices owned by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on this issue.  I regard the budget presented by the Minister for Finance yesterday as a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;, tired and unimaginative budget.  I am amazed that it took one and a half hours of empty rhetoric and waffle to tell this House that nothing was being done about anything. In the area that I am particularly interested in the reality is that 30 per cent of the population of this State are living below the poverty line and arising out of the budget at the end of 1991, next Christmas 30 per cent of the population will still be living below the poverty line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is also going to increase.  The Minister told us that there will be an extra 4,000 people unemployed. I would be extremely worried that the figure should turn out to be much higher.  We were told also that there will be an average increase of 4 per cent for social welfare recipients.  Indeed, some will get less than 4 per cent while others will get more.  The living alone allowance is to be increased by 20p.  That would not buy a bar of chocolate.  The child allowance will be increased by £1 per week and that is the glorious 9 per cent increase we have heard about.  I would say 9 per cent or 4 per cent of damn all <Col N="1388" /> is still damn all and the people who receive it will have that amount at the end of that period.</P>
    <P>I want to take the opportunity to nail the type of misinformation we heard yesterday and again this morning.  Somehow or other the national newspapers were convinced and gave headlines showing there were very real increases in social welfare benefits.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning said there was a one third real increase and a Fianna Fáil backbencher on the same programme said there was a 25 per cent real increase.  There are lies, damned lies and statistics.  If what the Minister said on radio was not damn lies it was deliberately misleading.  He juggled figures to such an extent that it became farcical to prove there was a 0.33 per cent increase. There was no real increase at all and most people at the end of the year will be worse off than they were at the beginning of the year; 30 per cent of the population will still be below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves what &ldquo;below the poverty line&rdquo; means.  It means families have not enough money to buy clothes for themselves and their children, to buy an adequate amount of food, to heat their homes or pay for adequate shelter.  In this wonderful Christian country of ours that seems to be acceptable, but it is not acceptable to me.  The Government say they are giving priority to the creation of employment and tackling poverty.  The budget proves this to be empty rhetoric, fine words and no actions.  It seems the Government have thrown in the towel on the creation of employment and the tackling of poverty, and there is an acceptance that the present state of affairs is all right.  We are told, of course, that the economy cannot afford more than is being given to the poor, but if we insist on the form of society where a large section of the population are poor we will find they are very expensive to keep.  The poor and low paid, and those on social welfare, bore the brunt of the cuts for the last two or three years and they are told now, when the economy is supposed to be on the up <Col N="1389" /> and up and an economic miracle has been performed before our eyes, that they must wait.</P>
    <P>What were the results of this economic miracle people are all talking about if the poor have to wait?  Certainly it has not been an economic miracle for the 30 per cent of our society who are marginalised but it has been very good for others.  A story in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 4 March 1990 stated:</P>
    <P>GNP boss Tony Ryan to get bumper bonus pay-out.</P>
    <P>GNP Group chairman, Tony Ryan, is set to receive an £86m &ldquo;pat on the back&rdquo; at tomorrow's shareholders' meeting.  The bonus would be on top of the £20m Mr. Ryan already receives in annual share dividends from Ireland's most valuable company......</P>
    <P>The new shares will add £8m to Mr. Ryan's dividend payments annually. The board which recommended the payment includes former Taoiseach Dr. Garret FitzGerald, former EC Commissioner Peter Sutherland and former British Chancellor Nigel Lawson.</P>
    <P>To give any man £86 million as a &ldquo;pat on the back&rdquo; is obscene in a society where 30 per cent of the people of that society are below the poverty line.  To give him an annual increase of £8 million on top of his £20 million is equally obscene.  The stark contrast between that happening in our society and what I am talking about in our society is social dynamite.  The amount of money the Minister is proposing to spend additionally on social welfare this year for half a million people is less than this one individual took out of our society in one year.  That is obscene.</P>
    <P>As the Labour Party social welfare spokesperson I want to deal with the issues of poverty and unemployment. The Government have failed to confront these two issues.  As I have said, they have produced fine words but very little action.  There seems to be an acceptance of tired, failed and now proven failed, Thatcherite economics and the economic gurus parrot the old lines to us, &ldquo;we must cut public expenditure; we must create <Col N="1390" /> the right business environment&rdquo;.  There is no doubt about it, it is very good for Tony Ryan.  He would not want the environment changed at all.  It is fine for him and others like him.  They tell us we must reduce the corporate tax and the tax on the wealthy in the hope that companies and individuals will invest in the economy and create jobs.  They signally failed to do so and there is no Government action in the budget to encourage or force them to do so.  The low paid and unemployed are products of this lack of policy but we are advised by the gurus that the Government must not interfere, the poor must wait, jobs must wait, at the whim of the private sector.</P>
    <P>What has been the result of this hands off, non-policy of the Government?  We have the highest levels of unemployment and poverty in the EC.  We have the lowest investment rates <i>per capita,</i> minuscule research and design investment, low levels of management and marketing skills and one of the highest levels of real interest rates in the EC.  Of course, not all things are going wrong in the economy.  That is a very one-sided picture.  There has been an explosion in company profits.  Job creation has been minimal arising from those profits but repartriation of profits has doubled and the figure for last year is calulated at £3 billion.  To indicate clearly what £3 billion is like, if somebody were to hire a cart, car or lorry every day since Christ was born nearly 2,000 years ago to bring £3,000 into this Chamber they would not have reached £3 billion.  That is the amount of money we let the multinationals send back home out of our country every year.  The ESRI stated specifically that this export of capital is one of the main reasons for the lack of creation of jobs.  These companies are reaping enormous profits in Ireland.  I am not saying that is a bad thing.  I am not knocking the creation of wealth, but these profits are not being sent to Dublin, the midlands, the west or Cork, they are going to the US and Japan and the Government are pursuing a policy that says that is OK.</P>
    <P>I believe unemployment is the main <Col N="1391" /> cause of poverty.  Over 40 per cent of social welfare recipients live in households where others are unemployed. Unless there is a substantial increase in job creation, poverty and unemployment will remain high.  However, the Government have thrown in the towel in the fight against unemployment.  The Government have agreed job creation targets in the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that will ensure unemployment remains at a high level over the next three years.  Already the decline in unemployment has ended with the Government announcement that unemployment is expectd to increase by 4,000 in 1991.  That is part of a general trend. In 1990 unemployment declined by less than 2,000 and in 1989 it declined by 12,000.  If the present trend continues unemployment will increase beyond the projections laid down by the ESRI and the NESC.  This levelling-off of unemployment combined with an increase to a number of social welfare recipients such as old age pensioners, lone parents, widows and widowers, will result in more people making greater demands on the social welfare system.  There are no proposals to stop or reverse this trend in this budget.  In fact, there is an acceptance that this problem will worsen.</P>
    <P>The major element in combating poverty must be an industrial and service strategy committed to a major redirection of policy. It is impossible to believe that the same individuals, companies, institutions and policies can create the jobs we need when those same individuals, companies, institutions and policies have failed in the past.  Any such strategy should contain the following principles: profits that are reinvested in the economy to create employment should be taxed at a lesser rate than profits disbursed to shareholders or exported; the phasing out of all tax reliefs and the moneys saved to be used for direct grant funding of private and public sector companies for the purpose of expanding employment.  In addition, all <Col N="1392" /> grant funding should be based on employment creation.  Industrial reform should be brought about to allow public sector companies access to grant funding on the same basis as private sector companies, granting them complete and uninhibited commercial freedom to expand into any area in which they can create growth and wealth.  Such a programme would not cost the state £1.  Rather it would redirect State subsidies to the generation of employment and growth enterprises and reward companies which contribute to our economy rather than lining the pockets of a few wealthy people.</P>
    <P>The Government have opted to do nothing in this budget to stimulate job creation.  They have used neither the carrot nor the stick to get private and public sector companies to invest in employment-generating activities.  They have not used taxation, direct grant-aiding, fiscal or other instruments as a means of increasing employment.  It is as though they either do not care or are completely perplexed as to how to go about devising an employment strategy. Either way, unemployment will certainly increase as a direct result of this Government's inactivity.</P>
    <P>Job creation alone will not eliminate poverty; that should be clearly recognised. Tens of thousands of people will continue to be unable to work or will not have an opportunity to do so.  In the long term they will have to rely on payments from the State in the form of social welfare. Again, there would not appear to be any clear policy or direction in the area of developing social welfare, which was evident from the hotch-potch or bits and pieces of schemes that become apparent from the Minister's replies just before this debate resumed.  In fact, Exchequer spending, in real terms, on social welfare is down 14.5 per cent since 1987, the take from other areas having risen.  There has been no White Paper produced on the long term development of the system, no detailed response to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare now six years old.  In fact, only seven of their 65 recommendations have been implemented.  There has been an <i>ad</i><Col N="1393" /><i>hoc</i> approach to Government spending which, while increasing the lowest levels of payment, has left the majority of social welfare categories with only marginal real increases in payments since 1987. Indeed, Government tax and social welfare policy has been to target the highest income groups with the greatest benefit while minimising benefit to the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>I noticed the Minister for Social Welfare was absent during the Minister for Finance's presentation of his budget.  I am sure he was absent on urgent Government business.  But listening to the Minister's statement it struck me that the Minister for Social Welfare must have been absent from the Cabinet table when discussions were taking place on the content of the budget.  He might as well have been at home for all he got in this budget for the people in whom he has a special interest and to whom he has a special responsibility.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Social Welfare stated that the minimum adequate income &mdash; here I am talking about an income sufficient to buy clothes and food, to provide heat and shelter at the very minimal level &mdash; for a single person in 1985 was £50 and for a married couple £80.  In 1991 this would mean a minimum adequate income of £62 for a single person or £99.20 for a married couple with a 10 per cent higher payment for social insurance.  This budget leaves all social welfare recipients below that poverty line.</P>
    <P>The following percentage increases would be necessary to reach minimum adequate incomes as defined by the Commission on Social Welfare after implementation of the 1991 budgetary proposals: unemployment and disability benefit 36 per cent; supplementary welfare allowances 24 per cent; carer's allowance 24 per cent; invalidity pension 20 per cent; widows contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit 17 per cent, old age pension 12 per cent.  Following the 1991 budgetary proposals all social welfare categories will receive below the minimum adequate income as defined by the Commission on Social Welfare with <Col N="1394" /> some groups up to one-third below the recognised poverty line.</P>
    <P>It is not only social welfare recipients who live below the poverty line.  Nearly 30 per cent of the workforce have a gross weekly income of less than £130.  Low pay is endemic in our society.  The Government have failed utterly to confront this problem and have categorically rejected the notion of a national minimum wage which would ensure that slave wages would be abolished, that young people, and women especially, would not be exploited.  A national minimum wage is the only way to defeat poverty among the workforce and it is a disgrace that this Government refuse to countenance its introduction.  Instead, they stand over gombeen employers and nasty, exploitative practices in our economy.</P>
    <P>Our so-called Christian society has frightening features, such as 40 per cent of children living in poverty-line households according to the Combat Poverty Agency.  Recent reports of the ESRI and NESC have criticised the Government for lack of a child income support policy but to no avail.  A major contributor to the poverty trap is the present child income support, the mix of child dependent allowance, child benefit, family income supplement and tax relief, creating inequities and inefficiencies.  In a study undertaken two years ago the Conference of Major Religious Superiors demonstrated that the operation of the family income supplement produced marginal tax rates of over 100 per cent; in other words if one were in receipt of the family income supplement and had a £2 per week rise in wages one would lose £2.40 and would have been better off not receiving the increase.</P>
    <P>The long term goal of the programme of the Labour Party is to introduce a basic or guaranteed annual income for every man, woman and child regardless of income, employment or marital status. That has been the historic goal of socialists since the last century and would mean the eventual abolition of the status of dependency and of means-testing.</P>
    <P>In the medium-term the Labour Party <Col N="1395" /> seek the introduction of the basic payment rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, the payment of social welfare adult dependant payments to be made directly to those dependants &mdash; mostly women spouses; an increase in child income support by way of a substantial upgrading of child benefit; the introduction of a national minimum wage of £140 per week or £3.50 per hour for part-time workers; reform of the PRSI levy system to levy all incomes, remove contribution ceilings and the introduction of allowances to ensure that levies are progressive in their tax effect; the rationalisation of means-testing and the abolition of the benefit and privilege rule so that young people living in their parents' home would be entitled to full social welfare payments, a major expansion of community development programmes, especially women's community groups and the establishment of a national community development fund.</P>
    <P>I am appalled at the uncaring attitude demonstrated in this budget.  I am amazed at the type of &ldquo;you never had it so good&rdquo; speeches on the part of Government Ministers, one after the other.  The people for whom I am primarily concerned, 30 per cent of our population below the poverty line, will not welcome the lack of action on the part of this Government.  It is a conservative budget introduced to conserve things as they now are, as if they were good.  Of course it has been introduced by a conservative Government whose interests are in keeping things the way they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This 1991 budget is particularly significant. It comes at the end of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which was so vitally important in underpinning the economic recovery which has taken place over the last three years or so.  It comes at the start of a new programme set firmly in a ten-year strategy for economic and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is without precedent in <Col N="1396" /> terms of consensus and co-operation in any country in Western Europe.  It is unique in two ways: first, in its inclusion of all the important interest groups in our society, and secondly, in its depth and coverage range from macroeconomic policy to taxation, social reform, employment and training, agriculture, and in pay and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>Maybe without realising it, what we have effectively been doing over the past four years is turning Ireland into a social democracy in line with the best European models.  We are creating a society which balances the need to create a climate for investment and wealth creation with a determination to protect the weaker sections. In the budget, as in the draft programme, we have struck the right balance between sound economic policies and social advancement.  We need both dimensions to our strategy; otherwise we would drift right back to the situation we used to face&mdash;conflict over goals, conflict between the different interest groups, and conflict in industrial relations with millions of days lost.  As a small open economy in a very unstable external environment, we cannot afford conflict or instability at home.</P>
    <P>Just to give a brief example of the real benefit of the last programme, last year saw a continuation of the overall positive trend in the number of strikes.  There were 51 strikes in the year, about half the number in 1986, and only ten of these lasted for more than five days.</P>
    <P>Although the number of days lost was 203,723, above the historic low of 41,400 in 1989 and above the level of 130,000 in 1988, three strikes &mdash; Waterford Glass, Barlo and Gateaux &mdash; accounted for 84 per cent of those days lost.  I was glad that in the last quarter of the year there were only some 9,000 days lost bringing us back well within the 1989 and 1988 ranges.  We can be confident that with a further programme &mdash; and of course with our new industrial relations structure with the labour relations commission &mdash; industrial harmony will continue.</P>
    <P>Turning back to overall strategy, we do not face easy tasks.  We live on the periphery of Europe.  We have high levels <Col N="1397" /> of unemployment and emigration.  We still have a crippling level of national debt.  All of these severely inhibit our room for manoeuvre.  Over the next ten years we will act to remove these constraints, solve these problems and bring the standard of living of all of us closer to the European average.  This objective is the starting point of the budget.  It maintains the prerequisite of fiscal rectitude. Its provisions will stimulate growth in employment.  It gives specific assistance to the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The budget clearly indicates the Government's commitment to the targets outlined in the draft programme.  Many of the specific initiatives promised are already being delivered through the budget &mdash; indeed in some cases the Government are already ahead of target. We are confident that, despite the real and growing international difficulties, the strategy will enable us to build on these gains and lead to further transformation of our economic and social environment.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable research to show that families with children are particularly at risk of being caught in the trap of poverty.  For the third year in a row, the budget gives them very real improvements in their living standards. For those in low paid jobs, particularly those with three or more children, the combination of higher income tax exemption limits and marginal tax relief with the substantial improvements in the family income supplement will make a dramatic difference.  Under the FIS, income limits will go up for all families; there will not be a ceiling on the top-up payments; and children up to 21 years old in full time education will be eligible.  For instance, the family income supplement alone will have increased since 1988 by some 50 per cent for married couples with four children.  This will of course benefit not just PAYE workers but also farmers and the self-employed on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers have often been at a considerable disadvantage in the labour market.  Those who work fewer than 18 hours a week have been excluded from the protection of the social insurance scheme and from the protection of labour <Col N="1398" /> legislation.  Last month I introduced legislation to bring them under the safety net of labour legislation and I hope to bring this through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  I know part-time workers will now welcome their inclusion within the next three months in the safety net of social welfare.  This recognises the reality of change in the patterns of work and will further encourage this diversification.</P>
    <P>For the unemployed, allowances will increase generally by 4 per cent, well above the inflation rate of 2.7 per cent and above the commitment in the draft programme which was merely to match inflation.  Those on supplementary welfare will get a 9 per cent increase, and child dependant allowances go up by a further 9 per cent.  This is the third year that people on long term unemployment assistance will get substantial increases. Long term unemployment assistance will go up by almost 6 per cent &mdash; double the rate of inflation.  We have now reached the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Recent figures have been encouraging on real employment growth.  They show that 30,000 more people had jobs in mid-April 1990 than were working in mid-April 1989.  It is estimated that over 20,000 more people were at work at the end of the year compared with the beginning.  This year we expect 11,000 more jobs in non-agricultural sectors.  Last year redundancy figures were marginally lower than 1989, which was 42 per cent below the 1988 figure.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to see how people rush into the debate to say how the figures will always be wrong.  Last year, the figures achieved were far higher than those projected in the three year programme, where we had higher employment than we set out to achieve and we had higher real employment because redundancies fell from the high levels of 1980 of over 30,000 down to 12,000 and 13,000 in the last few years. This level of net job growth is in line with the targets of the <i>Programme for</i><Col N="1399" /><i>Economic and Social Progress.</i> The programme targeted job growth in manufacturing and international services of 20,000 new jobs each year.  Small business has made a particularly valuable contribution in the past, and we expect this to continue, with 15,000 new jobs on stream in this sector over the next three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism sector has also done particularly well recently, creating 15,000 new jobs under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We expect this to continue at the same rate, despite the possible drop in US custom because of the Gulf War and the US recession.  Indeed growth from the European market and indeed our own domestic market has been so encouraging that the tourist industry is still looking forward with cautious optimism.</P>
      <P>In my own area, CERT will continue to play a vital role in helping the industry to reach the necessary standards of quality and service.  Management is particularly targeted this year for CERT's attention.</P>
      <P>Further jobs are projected in the fisheries, horticulture and forestry sectors, in ship building, and from the new emphasis on environmental projects.  The major investment projected from the Exchequer, and from the Structural Funds, will also lead to job growth in education, transport, construction, agriculture and the commercial state companies.</P>
      <P>But the live register still remains stubbornly high.  We are almost unique in the European Community in that our labour force is still growing.  Every year we have more young entrants leaving school and college.  We expect many emigrants to return home this year as opportunities elsewhere disappear.  Fewer people are emigrating in the first place.  All of these mean a return to the disappointing prospect of the live register average growing &mdash; for the first time in four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need all hands on deck to tackle <Col N="1400" /> this problem of long term unemployment. To that extent we are introducing a new approach.  We will concentrate everyone's priority attention on solutions rather than on analysis or despair as we have had today from opposition spokespersons.  In particular, we have to concentrate on the plight of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has set out in detail an exciting new approach to solve the problem of long term unemployment.  People who have been on the dole a long time often need a wide range of supports to get them back to work.  They may have needs in education, in training, in actual experience of work.  They certainly need support from their local community and from local employers.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow I will be launching the first three in a pilot series of integrated initiatives. They are based firmly in the local community with all its strengths and supports. They involve all the relevant organisations, such as FÁS, CERT, the vocational schools and local community bodies.  And I am glad to say that we are getting over £2 million support from the European Community for this pilot project.</P>
    <P>The three projects to be launched tomorrow will be in three of the most severely disadvantaged areas in the State. In Tallaght, Dublin's inner city and Cork City north, unemployment rates are stuck at about 50 per cent and other social problems are common.  We have chosen these for the first pilot projects.  About 100 people will be selected for special assistance by all the agencies involved.</P>
    <P>We plan to launch a further six projects later this year.  The most successful models will go nationwide over the next three years.  This programme will offer real help to the relatively few people who spend more than 12 months on the dole without either finding a job or getting a place on an employment or training course.  As Members know, at least half of those joining the live register find jobs within four weeks of signing on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people have been <Col N="1401" /> on the register for six years without getting a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment is also some of the main causes of emigration. While emigration fell by 15,000 in the year to mid-April 1990 and has fallen even further since then, the Government's real concern for emigrants in difficulties is shown by our keeping the DÍON grant at £500,000.  Last year 29 organisations shared this amount, benefiting a wider range of projects and helping a more extensive range of problems than ever before.  I am glad that the value of this money is being maximised by the great deal of support received from local authorities in Britain and by the increased co-operation between the agencies themselves.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, we must not forget that we are approaching full mobility of labour within the European Community.  Irish workers have the right to use the opportunities presented by the Single Market.  Indeed, around 2,000 people used FÁS services last year to get jobs abroad.  Our function is to ensure that if they go, they go prepared, but that, if they are not prepared, they are dissuaded from going.  In this FÁS have a front-line responsibility.</P>
      <P>In the fight against long term unemployment, the manpower agencies have a vital role.  The availability of skilled labour to be recruited is a major part of the strategy to create jobs.</P>
      <P>We are already renowned for the highly educated, highly qualified young people we have.  This has been a major factor in encouraging investment to locate here, despite heavy competition from other member states of the EC.  This will be further enhanced by the major programme of educational development heralded in the new programme.  The budget yesterday took significant steps in this direction.  The quality of our educational system will be topped up by the maintenance of FÁS training programmes at their existing level, despite the difficult public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the doubling of the capital allocation to FÁS.  Again this <Col N="1402" /> reflects the pace of technological change in manufacturing industry over the past two decades.  In the nineties, it is no use providing skills in obsolete technology.</P>
    <P>The main intervention for the long term unemployed continues to be the social employment scheme.  The scheme will cost the Exchequer about £60 million this year, with some EC support.  This means that about 10,500 people a week can take part in the scheme.  I am particularly pleased that, by changing the allowance structure over the past two years, I have made the schemes more attractive to participants with family responsibilities.  They often find it more difficult to escape the poverty trap and harder to find real help.  There are now a majority of people with families on the scheme.  Going on this worthwhile scheme means a real improvement in their job prospects.  And of course the scheme also is of great benefit to local communities.</P>
    <P>Apprenticeship is another manpower area highlighted in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> We look forward this year to the introduction of a new system based on a &ldquo;standard reached&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;time served&rdquo; basis. I am glad that the social partners support the proposals.  The funding arrangements are still being discussed and will be considered further by the social partners and Government agencies.</P>
    <P>I must stress again the Government's view that primary responsibility for training rests firmly on employers, whether for apprentices or for other employees. Nevertheless, as Minister for Labour I have a responsibility to promote and encourage employers to train.  In this area two initiatives will play a particularly important role.  First, the quality of Irish management is vital for the success of our overall strategy and, of course, for keeping and creating jobs.  Companies that are poorly managed do not grow. They contract and indeed they fail.  It has been estimated that 80 per cent of company failures were the result of poor management.</P>
    <P>I decided this year, in consultation with the Irish Management Institute, to set up <Col N="1403" /> a special programme, &ldquo;The Year of the Manager&rdquo;, to encourage companies to tackle their management development needs.  And the report of the Advisory Committee on Management Training revealed just how badly neglected those needs are.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the budget provides for a new programme in FÁS, targeted at those small and medium sized companies which face competitive difficulties in the Single Market.  This will cost £4 million a year.</P>
    <P>In the work of my Department, the programme has clear priorities.  We hope to get legislation through the Oireachtas which will be helpful.  Already we have the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill and, taken with social welfare legislation, this will give great assistance to people on low pay.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies have shared my concern at the growing number of part-time workers who were cut off from major employment rights, but I felt it vital to have intensive discussions with both sides of industry to ensure a fair balance between the needs of part-time workers themselves and the legitimate needs of employers for flexibility in operating their businesses.</P>
    <P>I also plan to introduce amending legislation on payment of wages in this Dáil session, and later this year I will be introducing my proposals on employment equality.  I am confident that these Bills will represent a constructive contribution to improving and updating legislation, while at the same time retaining what is best of the spirit and intent of the existing enactments.  All this legislation will help people to understand their responsibilities. It will not interfere with the competitiveness of industry but it will allow the social partners to consider the constructive consensus in the programme and thereby facilitate investment and employment.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many other initiatives apart from legislation which can be taken in the area of equality and these are highlighted in the programme.  In the fight to achieve real equality at work one <Col N="1404" /> of the basic tasks is to get enough information about where women are and what is being done in each organisation and company and to acknowledge and use women's potential.  Earlier this week we published a report on the implementation of Government policy on equality in semi-State bodies and we will be following up closely the contents of that report this year and extending the process to health boards and local authorities. We will encourage companies to set up positive action programmes in their workplace, giving more women an opportunity to participate actively in the labour market.  FÁS have a major role to play in giving women the necessary training to overcome any skills disadvantage and they will continue to set targets and assess further needs.  The budget contains provision for additional courses nationwide. These courses were used extensively in 1989 and 1990 and we welcome the further provision this year.</P>
    <P>I have left mention of the Structural Funds almost to the end.  Funding through the Structural Funds underpins almost everything we are trying to do in the economy.  It is particularly important now as an engine of growth in uncertain times.  Already the results of the surge of investment through these funds are beginning to be felt and they will be very obvious by 1993.</P>
    <P>By that time over £1 billion will have been provided for vocational training and employment measures alone.  This year, over 130,000 will be assisted by the European Social Fund in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some questions were raised earlier in this debate about what was being done for the unemployed.  A great deal is being done through direct training, which involves approximately 30,000 people, and indirect training in the educational system, in training centres and under social employment schemes.  For those who cannot get into that cycle and do not benefit directly through education, training or short term work experience, we are aiming to set up a pilot scheme, involving the private sector and State agencies to give people from unemployment black spots an opportunity to <Col N="1405" /> get back into the labour market.  This will not be brought about by talking or by quoting despairing statistics showing how bad things are in a particular area.  It requires commitment, effort and State resources to help the people.  We have sufficient money in the budget to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, both the budget and the draft <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are set firmly in the context of a ten-year strategy, with the over-riding objective of transforming our society. They set our feet firmly on the path to achievement.  In this time of uncertainty, I know that this sensible, soundly based strategy will maintain the investment and confidence which are the basis of success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget will go down in history as the 1p budget.  It missed an opportunity to lift a flagging economy to a perceivable height which would restore buoyancy in our economy and make it attractive to foreign investors.  It is apparent from the text of the Minister's budget speech that many of the large number of investment projects which would create a high level of employment will now be shelved owing to the Minister's action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major sector to be affected will be the construction industry.  Tourism was dealt a severe blow by the actions of the Minister in removing hotels and self-catering accommodation from the business expansion scheme.  Nobody needs to tell me what the tourist industry means to an area as deprived as south-west Cork and all along the western seaboard from Mizen Head to Malin Head. Everybody knows that the only sizeable income for the small farmers apart from agriculture comes from tourism and fishing. The Minister for Finance has, however, dealt a body blow to agri-tourism and the tourist industry in general. Does he expect small farmers along the western seaboard to live on fresh air and cold water?  The serious effects of this budget will be felt for many a day by the people engaged in tourism, the people who are trying to bring the industry to <Col N="1406" /> the level it should have been at many years ago.  All their hopes have now been dashed with a stroke of the pen of an uncaring Minister for Finance.  At a time when promotion and help for this sector is much needed to build up a thriving tourist industry the Minister pulls the mat and plunges the industry into a state of stagnation.</P>
    <P>The building industry will also be seriously affected with massive lay-offs envisaged.  The reduction in income and the increase in PRSI offset each other, broadly speaking.  At present it costs an employer £2.85 to produce £1 take home pay for an employee.  Surely this is a shocking state of affairs that that sort of impediment is put in the way of employers taking on employees.  In the United Kingdom employers can put £1 in an employee's pocket for £1.70.  This enormous difference has resulted in making Irish industry uncompetitive and the Minister has failed to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also failed to rectify the situation where farmers and other self-employed people who are over 65 years of age and are compelled to pay PRSI contributions for the first time will not qualify for contributory pensions because they have not paid ten years contributions.  Why does the Minister not facilitate such farmers by allowing them to pay the ten years' PRSI contributions by way of a lump sum as was done in the UK when the scheme was introduced there?  Why make small farmers and self-employed people pay PRSI and PAYE contributions to the Department of Finance when they are told, on attaining 65 years of age, that they do not qualify for a contributory pension because they were past the age of 55 when they entered the scheme?  Why do the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare not give them the opportunity to pay up for the back years that would make them eligible for this contributory pension at the age of 65?  Surely it would not be too much even <Col N="1407" /> at this late stage to ask the Minister to include a provision in the Finance Bill which will be discussed for the next few weeks to give those people an opportunity to qualify for the contributory pension at the age of 65?</P>
    <P>In regard to agriculture, there is very little in this budget for the farmers.  I would describe it as a Doctor Dolittle budget.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the tax amnesty up to September relating to inheritance tax payments applies to the exhorbitant interest on that inheritance tax.  The farming bodies were promised a number of concessions in income tax, PAYE and PRSI.  They were also promised a simpler method of determining their income without the aid of tax consultants.  God knows some of them do not even have an income that would pay the fee of a tax consultant.  Does the Minister realise that?  Has he any notion of relieving that situation?  I see no evidence of his keeping any of those promises in his speech.  I would be amazed if the farming bodies accepted this kind of approach from the Minister who, a week before the budget, promised all those concessions and then did not deliver.  He refers to it in a vague way.  I want the Minister to explain here in the House what his intentions are.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Agriculture when he mentioned the £1.2 million for Teagasc.  Does he now intend to supply clerical staff to farm development offices throughout the country and allow the agricultural instructors out on the field to instruct our farmers?  It is a sad state of affairs, that, for the past 18 months, I have been asking the Minister for Agriculture to replace one clerical assistant in the farm organisation office in Clonakilty and he has failed to accede to my request.  We hear a lot about the £1.2 million for Teagasc today.  Where is this £1.2 million to be gobbled up?  I envisage that the present situation will continue under an uncaring Minister for Agriculture and an uncaring Minister for <Col N="1408" /> Finance.  The farmers deserve better treatment than that.  Farmers who are only getting grants of between £200 and £400 are compelled to pay £60 for each visit that the agricultural instructor makes before that grant is paid.  In other words almost 50 per cent of the grant is paid back to the Department six or nine months before the Department pay the grant to the farmer.  These are anomalies that must be corrected if there is to be a future for our beleagured farmers throughout Ireland.  The budget gave no hint as to when Ireland's application for an extension of the disadvantaged areas will be announced from Brussels.  The Minister for Agriculture and our EC farm Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, are equally to blame for this fiasco.</P>
    <P>Never before in the history of this State were our farmers subjected to such humiliating treatment.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food told us 12 months ago that he would definitely see that fair play emanated from his Department as far as farmers' applications were concerned. In response to questions from Deputy Connaughton and myself he promised in this House that he would give a fair examination to each individual farmer who applied to be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  About nine months ago the Minister stated that a decision on our application was imminent. On 26 November our EC Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry in a personal interview with our MEP Mr. John Cushnahan and myself in Brussels promised he would have a decision made on Ireland's application within three weeks.  He said a decision would be made the week before Christmas.  Since the Commissioner gave us that promise three months have elapsed and no announcement has been made.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the inspections of the areas concerned were carried out was pathetic.  No detailed examination of any consequence took place.  The yardstick was quite easy for the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, and his Department <Col N="1409" /> to operate: simply every area that met the criteria laid down under EC regulations for the extension of a disadvantaged area should have been ascertained by the Department.  What has been the result?  Everybody knows that the inspectors who came from the Department sat inside their motor cars and drove through the townlands without even letting down the window of their cars or opening the door to get out to inspect the land in case they dirtied their shoes.</P>
    <P>In the submission to Europe for an extension of the disadvantaged area scheme, areas of the country were included which have very good land while other areas in my constituency of south-west Cork, places where you could not even raise a snipe, were omitted.  How does the Minister stand over that policy?</P>
    <P>Last night we heard great talk from the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, about the budget and how he was bringing the 1992 rate of headage payments forward to 1991.  However, some of the 1989 headage payments have not yet been paid by the Department.  That is a fact I can stand over.  Thousands of farmers throughout the disadvantaged areas and other parts of the country are waiting for payment of cattle headage grants, sheep headage grants, and grants under the beef premium and suckler cow schemes.  All the payments are held up.  I had to make 42 inquiries to the local departmental office in Cork city the other day.</P>

      <P>I had to make 42 inquiries one weekend.  Had I put down parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food it would have cost £4,200 to get answers.  I took the responsibility of calling into the local offices and I was told that some of the files had gone to Dublin for payment at the end of October and 1 November 1990, but still no payments have been <Col N="1410" /> made to the farmers.  God help those poor farmers who are depending on this uncaring Government and the uncaring attitude of the Department.</P>
      <P>Do the Government want to completely wipe out the small farmer along the western and south-western seaboard? Do the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food want to turn the area into an Indian reservation? What have they in mind to preserve the area in the future?  There will not be an income &mdash; and I can guarantee that &mdash; from the famous scheme the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced the other day where grants of £4 million to £5 million would be given for the breeding of horses, goats and rabbits.  Is that not a very good combination to save the small farmers of the west?</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil faill agam failtiú roimh an óráid a thug mo chara, an tAire Airgeadais, inné agus roimh an cháinaisnéis a chuir sé os comhair an Tí seo agus roimh an pobal i gcoitinne.</P>
      <P>I am pleased at the reception the budget got from the decision makers and the thinkers in our community.  It is the substance of the budget that matters.  The substance is paramount, not the &ldquo;sound bites&rdquo;, the instant analysis, the ephemeral comment which admittedly our adversarial system imposes on people who have to make instance replies.  The Gulf war imagery was a little out of place in a serious economic debate, a debate which occurs only once per annum. Whatever about its appropriateness for healthy satirical entertainment I do not think it is appropriate for a serious economic debate on the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the words used in connection with the Minister's speech and the budget was &ldquo;prudence&rdquo; and it was used by way of a criticism of the budget.  Prudence is a cornerstone virtue and one that is to be commended rather than used as a term of obloquy.  The budget fits precisely into the process we initiated in 1987.  It is another blood transfusion in the process of restoring what was then a very sick economy indeed, restoring the economy to full health.  Then, if the House remembers, the Exchequer borrowing requirement was 13 per cent of gross national product, it is now 1.9 per cent.  Those figures speak for themselves.  The confidence was gone then.  Naturally there was low investment because high interest <Col N="1413" /> rates obtained and employment and emigration were at their peak.  The consensus that has been developed for social and economic development is the most important thing that has happened in this country for some time.  When the economic history of this period is being written the consensus which has been reached between the social partners should figure very highly.</P>
    <P>We have sophisticated trade union leaders, we have sophisticated employer, farmer and Government leaders and consequently we got underway, as the House is aware, from 1987-90 a <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the results were very pleasing.  We have achieved in the years since 1987 sustained economic growth and low inflation &mdash; the figure is down to 2.7 per cent.  In fact, Jacques Delors praised this country for its achievement <i>vis-á-vis</i> our low inflation. Depending on which criteria are used it can be either the second lowest or the lowest inflation rate in the Community. Denmark is mentioned as one that is better but I think different criteria are applied in different countries.  We have increased employment and we have industrial peace, the fruit of the consensus between the trade unions, the farmers, the employers and the Government. Admittedly, all that has taken place in a world economic climate which was favourable to development. All we have to do is look at the results of our exports, our current account has been in surplus for the past four years and this was a very substantial achievement.</P>
    <P>The Government were committed and will remain committed to the maintenance of the value of the punt in the EMS.  It is consoling to look at the figures published regularly in <i>The Financial Times</i> or in <i>The Economist</i> and to see there that the Irish punt is maintaining its position.  It means that people who want to invest are not worried about exchange risk.  An investor need not be concerned about an exchange risk if he wants to invest in Ireland at present.  The <Col N="1414" /> result is obvious to all.  There has been a continuous inflow of funds into Irish Government bonds from abroad, the best test one could possibly apply.  A strict exchange rate policy is a <i>sine qua non</i> of any social or economic development. That is the business we are in, that is what this budget is about and it is the Government's first instalment in the new plan for economic and social progress.  It goes without saying that low inflation and national debt reduction is important. That equals a reduction on interest rate pressure and consequently, of course, encouragement for investment.</P>
    <P>No one is being complacent about the economic situation.  The Minister for Finance is not complacent and indicated that to the House.  He will not allow anybody else to become complacent and has said that whatever steps he has to take he will always take to maintain the progress we have been making.  This strong well integrated budget is an indication of that.  I will give a brief conspectus of what has happened.  The National Economic and Social Council produced a strategy for development 1986-90 on which our first programme was based.  Now we have another study from NESC which, <i>fide et fiducia,</i> is in line with section 1 of the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> strategy for the nineties.  There is an emphasis in that section on consistent budgetary monetary exchange rate policies which are essential.  There is also an insistence on the importance of the consensus in Irish economic life.  It is set, as has been mentioned by my colleague the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, in a ten year framework.</P>
    <P>It is important that the pay element should be seen to ensure our competitiveness and, more importantly, to ensure that the people who are working in our community get a fair share of what profits are made.</P>
    <P>Taxation is the next very important factor in this programme.  We are committed to bringing the standard rate down to 25 per cent by 1993.  As in earnest of <Col N="1415" /> what can be done I remind the House that we have reduced from 35 per cent to 29 per cent the standard rate since we took office in 1987, that we have reduced the higher rate from 56 per cent to 52 per cent and that we are committed to a single higher rate in our programme.</P>
    <P>In the NESC programme and incorporated into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there are provisions for the development of health, education, social welfare, housing, roads, environment, forestry and the marine in which I have a special interest. The whole purpose is to create an environment for growth in our economy.  Why do we want growth?  It is not an abstract. We want growth so that numbers in employment will increase.</P>
    <P>I call the attention of the House to the fact that since 1987 there has been an increase of 70,000 in non-farming private sector employment.  It is important to put that on the record.  It is important also that the programme has incorporated in it an integrated locally-based response to long term employment plus, of course, provisions for apprenticeships and training.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Visit by EC Director General of Fisheries.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise on the Adjournment this <Col N="1416" /> very important matter in relation to the fishing industry off the south-west coast.</P>
      <P>I have been led to believe that the EC Director General of Fisheries, José Amelia Serra, will visit this country on Monday and Tuesday, 4 and 5 February. I understand he will visit Killybegs and Dunmore East on Monday and Kilmore Quay and Howth on Tuesday and that he will travel by helicopter.</P>
      <P>The EC Director General of Fisheries will visit this country on a fact-finding mission.  I should like to ask the Minister for the Marine why Castletownbere fishery harbour has not been included in the Director General's itinerary.  I consider this a slur on the hard-working fishermen in Castletownbere and on those along the south Kerry and south-west Cork coastline.</P>
      <P>Numerous problems in the fishing industry in Castletownbere and along the south and west coast needed to be solved. I do not know who planned the Director General's itinerary but it is clearly evident that the person who planned it has no interest whatsoever in the plight of the fishermen along the south-west coast of Ireland.  The rich fishing grounds off the south-west coast have been used for years by fishing pirates from other EC countries.  Yet, no significant steps have been taken by the Irish Government to preserve those fishing grounds for Irish fishermen.</P>
      <P>Many fishermen along the south and western coastline have applied for licences to purchase larger boats to enable them to follow the catch to deeper waters on the Continental Shelf and the Porcupine Basin.  However, they have been told by the Minister for the Marine and his Department that no licences can be issued, not even for a ten ton boat, unless they also have another boat.  I should like to ask the Minister for the Marine if the same condition applies to trawlers in Spain, France, Denmark, Germany and England.  I do not believe it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, large sums of money are <Col N="1417" /> needed to build a decent road between Castletownbere and Glengariff so that the fishing industry there can prosper and thrive.  The drivers of the huge articulated lorries from the Continent that collect the raw material in Castletownbere and take it to the fish markets on the Continent find it very difficult to negotiate the narrow bridges on the road between Glengariff and Castletownbere.</P>
    <P>These problems need to be spelled out to the Director General of Fisheries in the EC.  He should be brought to Castletownbere so that he can see at first hand the difficulties being experienced by those involved in the fishing industry there.  Instead of bringing the Director General on the autobahn from Dublin to Killybegs and from Kilmore Quay to Howth, I urge the Minister to bring him to Castletownbere, even by helicopter, in order that he can see at first hand the difficult conditions under which our fishermen labour.  I urge the Minister for the Marine to include Castletownbere in the Director General's itinerary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): May I first of all say how glad I am that the Director General has been able to make time in his busy schedule to come to Ireland with the express purpose of seeing the Irish fishing industry, both its success and its problems, on the ground.  This type of fact-finding visit by the Director General can only be seen as a positive move in regard to the Irish fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the visit and hope it is successful both from the Director General's point of view and from the point of view of the fishing industry here.  I hope, in particular, that it will contribute to a greater understanding in Brussels of the problems and difficulties confronting our industry.  This can only be to our benefit in the formulation of future EC policies for the fisheries sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy has stated, the Director General will be in Ireland for only a very <Col N="1418" /> short period of time.  He has requested that, in the time available he be given the opportunity to see at first hand as many aspects as possible of the Irish fishing industry, including the fleet, harbours and their facilities, ice plants, fish processing, aquaculture and research.</P>
    <P>The Director General has asked that he be given the opportunity to meet with the representative organisations involved in the industry.  Accordingly, he will be meeting with Bord Iascaigh Mhara; fishermen's and producer's organisations, including the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation and the Irish Fish Producers Organisation; fish processing interests, including the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association; representatives of fisheries co-operatives, including the Irish Federation of Fishing Co-operatives; and representatives of the aquaculture industry, including the Irish Aquaculture Association, the Irish Salmon Growers Association and the Irish Shellfish Association.  The programme selected by the Director General will enable him to achieve these objectives within the time constraints involved.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it will not be possible for the Director General to visit all of the places which he would have liked to see, and indeed which I would have been anxious that he see at first hand.  A much wider programme could only have been possible had the time involved been longer.  The Deputy will appreciate that, apart from Castletownbere, there are a large number of other locations which the Director General would like to visit if time allowed but this simply will not be possible in the two days at his disposal.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Director General will be made fully aware of the importance of Castletownbere and similar fishing ports in the context of the Irish industry and that he will be briefed on achievements made to date and future development plans.</P>
    <P>Finally, I urge everybody involved in <Col N="1419" /> one way or another with the fishing industry to do everything necessary to ensure that the visit is a success for the Irish industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures obtained by me from an established funeral director show that the cost of a funeral in Dublin &mdash; it is the cost of a funeral in Dublin that I am raising here today because I have not had an opportunity to look at the position outside of Dublin &mdash; can range from £1,710 if the cheapest coffin is used to £3,260 if the most expensive coffin is used.  This includes the cost for a hearse and one mourning car.  If two mourning cars are used the cost would be an extra £170 or so.</P>
      <P>The breakdown given to me for a hearse and one car is as follows: a new grave and opening, £450; church costs, £50; newspaper notices, £210; dressing the corpse, £30; wreaths, £100; hearse, £250 and one mourning car, £170, giving a total of £1,260.  The cheapest coffin is £450 which would bring the total to £1,710; the dearest coffin is £2,000, giving a total of £3,260.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without wishing to be insensitive, this money is spent mostly on a wooden box and the use of a taxi for a few hours work. What gives the proceedings dignity is the corpse.  I do not want to take in any way from the dignity of a funeral.  I am purely talking about what is charged and what people, at a very vulnerable time, are asked to pay by way of services.  It is what <Col N="1420" /> is paid for that I query.  At a time when the bereaved are often most vulnerable and want to give only the best for their dearly departed, independent counselling should be available to ensure that moneys are wisely spent.  Poorer families sometimes go without for considerable periods in order to pay for a funeral.  It can often happen with old people who have been paying penny insurance policies for a number of years that when the family claim the insurance they find that what they receive does not even cover the cost of the funeral.  Those who suffer the terrible tragedy of the death of an infant find that infants are not covered by most insurance policies.  This puts a terrible burden on people, particularly those in lower socio-economic groups. Thankfully the community often come to their aid by fund raising and so on.  At this time people should have independent counselling available to them.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce should consider.  In Dublin there seems to be a closed shop in operation and it is very difficult for new people to start up in the undertaking business.  I am asking that the Department of Industry and Commerce call in the undertaking profession and have these matters examined and reported on, and that this be done sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the over-reaction of the undertaking profession in Dublin to my raising this question.  The statement they made in response is, to say the least, outrageous.  The figures I quote have been supplied to me by a prominent undertaker in Dublin.  I am very grateful to those undertakers who have offered to provide me with the service at half price provided I go soon.  I say to the House that this is not just a serious matter but is one which affects all people when they are at their most vulnerable.  It is time that it was addressed and I would ask the Minister to undertake such an examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of Deputy Mitchell's call on the Department of Industry and Commerce for discussions with the undertaking profession to substantially reduce the cost of funerals.  In the course of the newspaper reports on his call for an investigation he quotes the cost of city burials at approximately £2,500.  In the Dublin area there are on average over 7,000 funerals per annum. Consequently it is important that the families of the deceased receive value for money in this most sensitive of areas.</P>
      <P>In May-June 1985 the National Prices Commission dealt at length with the subject of funeral undertakers and costs. Previously the commission had stated that undertakers should display the prices of their entire range of services and provide all clients with an itemised estimate before arrangements are confirmed.  It noted that the adoption of a &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; would meet these requirements.</P>
      <P>I know that the Irish Association of Funeral Directors, which in the Dublin area encompasses the majority of undertakers, have adopted such a code of practice. That code of conduct provides that members should assist families in planning a funeral with particular emphasis on the budgetary aspect of the funeral.</P>
      <P>Undertakers should have available a complete price list showing their charges for merchandise, services and facilities and also a complete list of payments they may be required to make on clients' behalf.  The code continues that an estimate of funeral costs should be offered to each client at the time of making funeral arrangements or at the earliest possible opportunity.  Subsequently undertakers should provide an itemised account showing charges and payments made on the clients' behalf, together with settlement terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal services offered by undertakers and contributing to the overall cost of a funeral are as follows: (a) <Col N="1422" /> supplying the coffin; (b) provision of hearse and limousine; (c) supplying burial robes; (d) the funeral home overnight; and (e) embalming.</P>
    <P>Undertakers also offer to purchase the graves, insert press notices, supply wreaths and arrange church notices.</P>
    <P>In their May 1983 survey, the National Prices Commission indicated that the cost of the coffin could account for approximately 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the cost of the funeral.  The type of materials used is the determining factor in the cost of coffins.  This is a feature that was also mentioned in the recent Irish Countrywomen's Association survey on the cost of funerals.  The cost of a coffin can be the single most expensive item in the make-up of the ultimate bill.  Among the factors involved are expensive timbers and excessive ornamentation which raises the price of coffins considerably.</P>
    <P>The second significant factor, in the Dublin area particularly, in the cost of a funeral is the provision of the grave.  I understand that the cost of a grave purchase in the Dublin area ranges from £350 to £800 for a single grave, and the charge for opening a new or existing grave ranges from something over £100 to nearly £300 in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I have considered the need for an investigation into the cost of funerals in Dublin.  In doing so I must say that neither I nor the Director of Consumer Affairs has received complaints on the costs of funerals in the Dublin area, apart from what Deputy Gay Mitchell may have put forward to the Department. Such an investigation is not called for as there is a significant degree of competition in the provision of such services in the Dublin area.  Indeed I gather that there are over 25 undertakers servicing the city and county.</P>
    <P>However, relatives at the time of the bereavement should consider the range and nature of the services they require. It is not unusual now to obtain estimates from various undertaking firms in the Dublin area.  Indeed, this follows the <Col N="1423" /> code of conduct of the Irish Association of Funeral Directors.  In considering the various costs, great consideration should be given by consumers to the type of coffin they wish provided.  Cost here can vary from £200 to £800, and indeed I am aware that certain coffins can go up to over £2,000.  There is very little that can be done in the case of the plot in the graveyard.</P>
    <P>Other areas of discretionary expenditure should be seriously considered. There is no need to have a death announcement in each of the national dailies and the evening papers.  Advertisements in daily papers for a 17 line announcement come to something over £80.  Four or five such insertions amount to a considerable amount of money.  The provision of wreaths and cars is an area that should also be addressed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while appreciating the Deputy's concern on this sensitive subject at a particularly emotional time for a bereaved family, I would also stress the necessity by the relatives to shop around among the various undertaking establishments to obtain the best value for money.  This is a very sensitive issue and comments could be misinterpreted. Prices in rural areas are different from those in the city but they are accounted for by the demands of families who require a certain type of service at funerals.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gregory has given me notice of his intention to raise the loss of a teacher at St. Laurence O'Toole senior boys' national school, Dublin 1.  The matter is in order, Deputy Gregory has five minutes to present his case and the Minister of State has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  We were <Col N="1424" /> told yesterday in the budget speech that the Government believe that the full educational potential of many children is not, and cannot be, realised because of their disadvantaged background.  We were also told that the Government have a strong commitment to the poor and disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Prior to the budget, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> stated in the section dealing with social reform that particular attention must be paid to children suffering educational or social disadvantage through early identification of those children allied to positive intervention to support them during the provision of remedial teaching, guidance and counselling and the development of home-school links.  The programme went on to give a commitment that resources would be targeted to assist the disadvantaged in availing of the various educational or training services.  It specifically committed itself at primary level, that this would be achieved by retaining all existing posts in 1991 and 1992 and by creating 250 new posts in September 1991.  It stated that this process was aimed at reducing over-large classes and meeting the needs of the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>In that context I want to refer to St. Laurence O'Toole senior boys' national school, Seville Place, in the very heart of the inner city of Dublin.  This school serves a most disadvantaged area in the north inner city and includes many children from the Sheriff Street flats. Here there is no need for early identification of those children suffering educational or social disadvantage.  Why? Because all the children in this school, as in many other inner city schools, come from a background of acute social and economic disadvantage and deprivation. I am sure that the Minister will at least accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be difficult to paint a more bleak picture; there is over 70 per cent <Col N="1425" /> unemployment among the adult population, there are appalling living conditions in Sheriff Street and even their future as a community is unclear.  Against this background it is very difficult to understand the threat which still hangs over one of the teaching posts in this school from 31 August this year.  The school has been informed by the Department of Education that it will lose a teaching post which it had received under the 1985 special scheme for schools serving disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the Minister will tell the House that that threat has been, or will be, withdrawn.  As things are at present the Christian Brothers must pay a substitute teacher to ensure that there is one teacher per class and the principal takes charge of special classes, in itself evidence of their commitment to the educational needs of the children.  Already the school is experiencing great difficulty in coping with the limited resources available to them.  The school authorities state that the loss of staff later this year will create an impossible and hopeless situation. The excuse for taking away a teacher is that there is a decline in enrolments. However, if the school had adequate resources there would be no such decline.  If existing resources are taken from them it is hardly likely that the school will survive.</P>
    <P>At the same time that the Department informed the school of the loss of a teacher they expect the school to take on additional functions, including a new home-school liaison scheme, school trips and the drawing up of a new code of discipline.  The staff are, of course, more than willing to do this but, clearly, that depends on adequate staffing being available. They rightly point out that it is pointless and meaningless to introduce new schemes during 1991 only to have them abandoned the following summer. If the cutbacks are implemented, inevitably that will happen.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the only chance a child has, if he or she is to break out of <Col N="1426" /> the cycle of poverty and deprivation, is through education.</P>
    <P>This school and many others around the city of Dublin and in other disadvantaged communities are struggling selflessly against inequality.  I appeal to the Minister, in this specific instance, to respond positively, to withdraw the directive already issued and to allow the school to survive.  At least leave the school the existing staff.</P>

      <P>The enrolment on 30 September 1987 in St. Laurence O'Toole senior boys' school was 92 pupils.  It had fallen on 30 September 1990 to 72 pupils and the position in regard to the school is that, due to the movement of people from the Sheriff Street-Sackville Place area, there will be a significant decline in numbers in the school over the next 12 months due to a reduction in the number of pupils joining the school next year in comparison to those who will leave.</P>
      <P>In 1985 sanction was obtained for the appointment of a number of additional teachers in areas of disadvantage.  As a result of the criteria which were agreed, one concessionary post was warranted in St. Laurence O'Toole senior school.  In 1985-86 the school had an authorised staff of one principal and four assistants. However, it was decided to allocate two concessionary posts to the school as an exceptional measure, subject to review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the continued allocation of the second concessionary post was considered by my Department at the commencement of the current school year.  We requested a report from the inspector on that and he reported that, due to significant population movement as a result of the development of the Custom House Dock site, a number of families were leaving the area and that, consequently, the numbers would be reduced even further.  I might add that this is the only school in the country where a second concessionary post was <Col N="1427" /> granted following the 1985 scheme.  In view of the continuing decline in the current year the Department informed the board of management of their decision to discontinue the second concessionary post from 1 September 1991.  The Departmen are quite satisfied that the existing complement of teachers in the school, given the declining numbers, is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In conclusion the school, along with St. Laurence O'Toole junior boys', junior <Col N="1428" /> girls' and senior girls' schools, was selected for inclusion in the three year home school community liaison pilot project and a teacher was appointed from November 1990 as part of this project.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the school is adequately served by its existing staff and that the serious difficulties, as described by Deputy Gregory, will not arise out of the reduction of one teacher.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 February 1991.</P>

      <P>The 1990 Social Welfare Act provided for the setting up of a separate independent social welfare appeals office.  The Act provides that appeals will in future be made directly to the director and chief appeals officer.  In practice, this will mean that the appellant will be in touch with the appeals office from the point at which the appeal is made up to the time the decision issues.  In establishing the social welfare appeals office it was my intention to retain and build on the strengths of the former system and to <Col N="1352" /> increase client confidence in the appeals process.</P>
      <P>With the opening of their new headquarters on 21 September 1990 the appeals office began to put new measures into effect.  The administration of appeals relating to disability benefits, occupational injuries benefits and those relating to unemployment claims in the Dublin area were initially brought under their direct control and appeals relating to other social welfare services were made the subject of the new procedure over the following weeks.  This enabled me to bring the new statutory provisions into effect from 1 January 1991.</P>
      <P>The procedures for dealing with all appeals are now being examined with a view to reducing the interval between the lodgement of an appeal and the oral hearing.  Information is not maintained at present in a way that would enable an average figure of the time taken to process appeals to be determined.  The chief appeals officer is obliged by law to submit an annual report to me on the activities of the office and I understand that the question of possible delays is to be examined and reported on in that context.</P>
      <P>I am confident that within a short space of time the new appeals office will improve the service and show it to be independent, consistent and efficient.</P>

      <P>In June 1990, I hosted a major conference in conjunction with the European Commission on the role of voluntary organisations in the delivery of social services and in tackling poverty and disadvantage.  The conference was attended by some 150 representatives of voluntary and statutory organisations from the various member states as well as representatives of the European Commission, the Council of Europe and several organisations representing voluntary and state agencies.</P>
      <P>In the context of the conference, I announced plans to draw up a charter for voluntary social service activity in Ireland.  This charter will set out a clear framework for partnership between Government and voluntary organisations and identify how, in future, the State can encourage voluntary activity and foster and support voluntary organisations in the social services area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of developing a framework for partnership between the State and voluntary activity has now been progressed in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The programme contains a Government commitment to prepare a White Paper outlining their proposals in this area.  Closer links will also be developed by my <Col N="1354" /> Department with voluntary organisations providing services of advice and assistance to social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Issues discussed at the June conference included: the conditions needed for successful partnership between the voluntary non-governmental organisations and the public sector; how voluntary organisations can best encourage self-help, participation and the personal development of their clients; how voluntary organisations can contribute most effectively to the formulation of policy at local, national and European Community level and how the public sector including the European Community can most effectively support and foster voluntary activity.</P>
    <P>The conference was regarded by participants as highly successful and a valuable exchange of contacts and information. It was seen as the important start of an on-going process of exchange on these issues between EC countries and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The proceedings of the conference will be published and widely disseminated in coming months.</P>
    <P>The overall cost to the Exchequer, excluding salary costs of departmental officials which it is not possible to quantify, was in the region of £140,000.</P>

      <P>The rights of social welfare claimants are enshrined in and protected by legislation.  In 1981 I introduced the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which consolidated in one Act all of the legislation relating to the social welfare schemes.  I am currently engaged in a programme to update and consolidate the various regulations made under the Acts.  This will assist people in establishing their entitlements under the various social welfare schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> I am also taking steps to improve the decision-making process for social welfare claims.  The level of information provided to clients at the initial decision stage is being improved.  The Deputy will also be aware of the recent far-reaching changes which I made in the area of social welfare appeals by setting up a new fully independent and integrated social welfare appeals office.  In the final instance social welfare legislation provides specifically for recourse to the High Court where a point of law emerges in relation to any appeal.  I am satisfied that this structure provides an adequate protection to claimants and that it ensures that their claims are dealt with fairly, equitably and in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>I have also undertaken a major programme to improve the delivery of the social welfare services with special emphasis on the provision of a more localised and effective service with easier access for clients.  I am committed to a programme of modernising and improving accommodation and facilities for social welfare clients around the country with a view to providing an accessible and dignified service to them.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am strengthening the Department's links with voluntary organisations and community based groups in the development of social policy and the provision of services.  A charter to set out a framework for partnership between the State and voluntary activity will be drawn up by the Government and a White Paper outlining the Government's proposals in this important area will be prepared.</P>
    <P>My Department's information service provides wide ranging and comprehensive information to clients on all aspects of the social welfare system.  The information service has been substantially improved in recent years and the development of a localised and self-sufficient information service forms part of my plans for improved delivery of the schemes.  I want to ensure that in addition to having their rights protected by law, social welfare claimants have the best possible information service to inform them of their rights.</P>
    <P>

      <P>The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which represents the outcome of prolonged discussions between the Government and the social partners including trade unions, business and farming organisations, recognises that this form of partnership represents the best approach for formulating a comprehensive strategy for tackling poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to maintaining the real value of social welfare payments, the Government are committed under the <Col N="1357" /> programme to raising all social welfare payments of the priority rates set down by the Commission on Social Welfare. Thereafter, payments will be increased in accordance with the recommendations of the commission as the resources of the economy grow.  In addition, resources on the scale needed to implement the measures recommended by the commission, which amount of £69 million in 1990 terms, will be devoted to child income support.</P>
    <P>I consider that the commitments in the new programme represent a very effective programme to tackle poverty in Irish society.</P>
    <P>I have always been very conscious of the important role of voluntary organisations and the churches in tackling poverty.  Many innovative schemes have been initiated by these organisations and I want to develop their role in the future. Last November, for the third successive year, I hosted a pre-budget forum with voluntary organisations to discuss priorities for improvements in the social welfare code.  Similar consultations are held with other organisations representing the churches and other interests to discuss issues of relevance to them.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the important contribution which voluntary organisations make in delivering services and combating poverty, the Government are committed, in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> to drawing up a charter for voluntary social service.  This will set out a clear framework for partnership between the State and voluntary activity.  A White Paper on the role of Government in supporting voluntary activity will be prepared by my Department. In this context the issue of how the voluntary sector can best contribute to policy formulation in the social welfare area will be examined.</P>

      <P>It was discovered in January 1991, in the course of a survey of her employer by the Department's investigation branch, that the person's spouse had been in employment since 1986.

Three hundred and fifty staff are located in the pensions services office in Sligo and 80 are located at the child and treatment benefits office in Letterkenny.  A further 90 staff will be located in Letterkenny from early March.</P>
      <P>The Government announced early in 1990 their decision to expand the decentralisation programme to include five further towns and cities, namely, Cork city, Longford, Tullamore, Kilkenny and Wexford.</P>
      <P>The time-scale envisaged for completion of this extended programme, together with details concerning the departments, the offices, and the numbers of staff to be transferred to each of the locations are, at present, under consideration.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there are many Irish people who worked in England in the 1940s and 1950s and who had insurance contributions deducted from their pay may now be entitled to retirement or contributory pensions without them having any knowledge of this fact; and if he will consider a short publicity campaign to advise such people of their entitlements.</Quest>

      <P>People who may be entitled to benefit or a pension from another State of the European Community are usually identified through the details which they give about their working careers when they apply for an old age or retirement pension from my Department.  Specific questions about working in any other member state are asked on application forms for these pensions and the importance of the information is explained in the information leaflets for the schemes.</P>
      <P>I will arrange for my Department to take up the matter with the United Kingdom authorities who have responsibility for the payment of pensions to Irish people who worked in the United Kingdom to see if the present arrangements for seeking out potential beneficiaries can be improved.</P>
      <P>A publicity campaign as suggested by the Deputy may very well be useful in identifying further cases where a person is entitled to benefit, particularly in cases where there is no entitlement to a pension from my Department.</P>
      <P>A review of the publicity arrangements in relation to benefits for Irish people arising out of European Community membership and/or bilateral agreements is due to start shortly in my Department. The Deputy's suggestion will be examined further in that context.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that no rebate of tax is due in this case.  A review of the taxpayer's liability to tax for the years <Col N="1362" /> 1988-89 and 1989-90 has been carried out by the inspector of taxes.  This resulted in an underpayment of £620.98 for the year 1988-89 and an overpayment of £101.79 for the year 1989-90.  Thus, the taxpayer has a liability of £519.19 and the inspector of taxes has written to him in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department, in common with others, have had to adapt to the Government's continuing requirement to control public service numbers and pay costs. The Director's office has fared, in terms of resources, better than any other part of my Department; during the course of 1990 the staff complement in his office was increased from 23 to 30, an increase of some 30 per cent over the level referred to in his 1989 report.</P>

      <P>These increases in staff numbers and financial resources reflect the importance which I attach to the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>

Quite obviously, the former director personally could have no function in such recruitment and as already stated has fared substantially better, in terms of staffing resources, than any other area of my Department.  I should also point out that the Director has access, as required, to the expertise of the professional accountants serving in my Department.</P>

      <P>Of the approximately 1.3 million insured persons some 70 per cent pay at the Class A rate which provides cover for all social insurance benefits and pensions. A further 12 per cent pay at Class B, C, D, or H rates which apply to persons in different areas of the public service.  The remaining classes apply to other situations which are covered for a restricted range of social insurance benefits as considered appropriate to those concerned. They include self-employed persons, persons in employment of inconsiderable extent, and pensioners.</P>
      <P>The extension of full social insurance cover to all classes of contributor, would have major policy and financial implications. As far as public service employments are concerned the Government have already stated their objective of extending full PRSI cover to public sector employees on a basis acceptable to all parties involved.</P>
      <P>In the case of other classes of contributor, I am examining ways of streamlining the present arrangements and reducing the number of different classes. There is no question at this stage, however, of abolishing all of the different classes as the application of full social insurance coverage would not be appropriate in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated additional revenue which would accrue to the social insurance fund if all employee PRSI <Col N="1370" /> classes were raised to the Class A rate is £508 million annually, of which £359 million is employers' PRSI and £149 million is employees' PRSI.  This would be offset by the additional costs of providing social insurance benefits to those concerned.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance scheme came into effect last November and provides an allowance direct to carers who are providing full-time care and attention to elderly or invalided social welfare pensioners and who satisfy a means test.  The maximum allowance is £45 with increases for each child dependant of the carer.</P>
      <P>There has been an awareness for some time that persons receiving payments under the Health Acts, including some persons receiving disabled persons maintenance allowances, also require full-time care and attention and that the individuals providing such care might reasonably be expected to qualify for the carer's allowance.  I made provision in the Social Welfare Act, 1990, to enable the carer's allowance scheme to be extended by regulation when circumstances permitted.</P>
      <P>It is intended that from next October, the scheme will be extended to cover recipients of disabled persons maintenance allowance and those persons getting a pension from another member state of the EC or from a country with whom Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.  There will be a budgetary increase in the maximum personal rate from £45 to £50 weekly from next July.</P>
      <P>The carer of the person concerned should qualify for the carer's allowance under the extension from October provided they satisfy the means test.</P>

      <P>Following investigations, it was decided on 3 January 1991 that the person concerned was not entitled to this allowance as her means, derived from a holding, exceeded the statutory limit for entitlement to this allowance.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, appeal forms were issued to the person concerned on 21 January 1991.  She has been requested to outline her grounds of appeal and to include any relevant documentation in support of it.</P>

    <P>Belmont Park Hospital, which is owned by the Brothers of Charity, is funded as part of my Department's <Col N="1381" /> annual revenue allocations to the Brothers of Charity in respect of their total service.  The apportionment of this allocation to the individual services is a matter for the order.</P>
    <P>The brothers have indicated that the annual apportionment of the allocation to their services in the South-Eastern Health Board area in years 1986-1991 was as follows: 1986, £1.85 million; 1987, £1.97 million; 1988, £1.93 million; 1989, £1.99 million; 1990, £2.23 million; 1991, £2.41 million.</P>
    <P>The Brothers of Charity are considering with the South-Eastern Health Board how their respective services can best be organised for the provision of an improved alcoholism and mental handicap service in the Waterford area.  Discussions are on-going at present between the brothers and the board.  The brothers have no intention of closing Belmont Park although its current range of services may be changed in the context of the service review.</P>

      <P>(a) The grant to each vocational education committee under subhead F of Vote No. 28 for 1991 is at present being calculated.  The grant allocations will be based on the following criteria: (i) provision in the Department's Estimates; (ii) VECs' estimates; (iii) 1990 VECs' outturn; (iv) pupil numbers; (v) approved staff numbers; (vi) speical circumstances, etc.</P>
      <P>(b)  The grants paid under this subhead are based on pupil enrolments.</P>
      <P>(c)  The grant paid under this subhead is calculated according to the same criteria as for (a) above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  The grant paid to VECs under this <Col N="1384" /> subhead are in respect of: (1) VEC Third-Level Scholarships; (2) ESF Training Grants.  Funds are provided to each VEC on the basis of the number of eligible applicants and the rate of grant or scholarship entitlement.</P>
    <P>(e)  The estimate for the VEC third-level capital building programme is prepared having regard to existing commitments, and programmes of building planned over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The grants allocated under (a) and (c) above indicate the funds available in respect of (1) teachers' salaries and (2) administration, pay, etc.  However, a separate provision is not directly made for teaching materials and equipment.  Provision is made for these under a general Non-Pay heading.  The 1991 grants for vocational education committees are being calculated at present and will be notified to the vocational education committees at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present carrying out a study to determine the unit costs in primary and in the different sectors of post-primary education.  In addition, discussions are shortly to be held with chief executive officers of vocational education committees in regard to their providing financial data to the Department by reference to the costs associated with individual programmes.</P>
    <P>These initiatives are designed to ensure that grants to committees will be based on equitable norms and criteria and will fully reflect the variety of educational provision being made by individual vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>The teacher in question is in fact employed in a part-time capacity. He has no entitlement to holiday pay in respect of his employment in St. Joseph's school.</P>
      <P>My Department have already introduced a scheme which provides for the employment of certain part-time teachers on a full-year basis involving payment on an annual <i>pro rata</i> salary.  The question of extending the scheme to other schools such as St. Joseph's is at present being considered.</P>
