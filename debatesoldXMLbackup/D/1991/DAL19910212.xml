      <asker>Mr. J. Bruton</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the Ministers who will be responsible for the area based response to long term unemployment, outlined in section VII of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress; if any particular Minister has overall responsibility for this at present; if not, if he will designate a particular Minister for this role; the areas which are intended to operate pilot schemes for this area based response during 1991; and when details will be given of the specific budget for the relevant public authorities covering the areas in question.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Section VII of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> sets down how the new area-based response to long term unemployment will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the ratification of the new programme, the Central Review Committee supplemented by representatives from the Combat Poverty Agency, the Irish Resource Development Trust and the Trust for Community Initiatives will meet and make recommendations to Government on the appropriate arrangements for the establishment of local companies <Col N="2222" /> responsible for the scheme in each selected area.</P>
    <P>The Programme makes it clear that the implementation of the new area-based response will be based on a specific budget prepared by the relevant public agencies in consultation with the local community for each participating local area.  In addition provision of £0.5 million was made in this year's budget to cover the managerial costs of the local companies to be established.  The public agencies will work through the local companies to implement the integrated response modules.  The agencies will be responsible for the delivery of their relevant module element within the local budgets and will, therefore, be responsible to the relevant Ministers for their part in the new scheme.  The Minister for Labour will have general responsibility for the schemes which will be monitored and co-ordinated by the Central Review Committee.</P>
    <P>The Central Review Committee will meet before the end of this month if the new programme is ratified.  The pilot areas have not been identified but they will be determined in due course in consultations between the Central Review Committee and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately what proportion of the total number of unemployed will be covered by one of the areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know yet because we have not selected the pilot areas.  We intend to get typical unemployment black spot areas in the different regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately how many areas does the Taoiseach expect will be selected?  Will it be one, two, or ten?  Who will have the final say in deciding whether an area should be selected? Will it be the Government, the Minister for Labour or the social partners? Are any arrangements being put in place to monitor the success of this in view of the fact that the National Economic and Social Council have said an area-based <Col N="2223" /> approach is in their view the only way of dealing with the problem of long term unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would visualise about five areas or thereabouts so that we can get a good mix of different parts of the country and long term unemployment areas.  The final selection will be made by the Government on the recommendation of the Central Review Committee as expanded for this purpose.  The Central Review Committee will also, in consultation with the Minister for Labour, have the sort of monitoring the Deputy mentioned.  I agree that would be a vitally important aspect of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that the Central Review Committee, who are comprised of essentially part-time people who are full-time and busy elsewhere, have not the time, the application or the expertise to take on this £0.5 million additional budget provision of the Department of the Taoiseach? Will the Taoiseach agree that, properly speaking, the task he has described and set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> should be assigned in its entirety to FÁS who could identify for him this afternoon the five regions because they have done the surveys already?  On the basis of what he has just said, will the Taoiseach not further agree that this is an unnecessary aggrandisement of the Department of the Taoiseach when the task should be, with all due respect, given to the Minister for Labour who has the expertise and the resources to do it?</P>

      <P>Let us not engage in over-long questioning please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a slight misapprehension about the budget. The £0.5 million in the budget is to provide the companies that will be set up in local areas with managerial resources. Basically, those companies will be doing the work in the selected areas, not the Central Review Committee.  The Central <Col N="2224" /> Review Committee will have a monitoring, co-ordinating and advisory role but the basic responsibility will be with the Minister for Labour.  This is what everybody has agreed as the best approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not agreed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Touché.  I hope, though, Deputies will agree when they have listened to my persuasive arguments. I should have said this is what everybody in the preliminary stages of the evolution of this approach has agreed. As Deputies know, it began with the NESC report, developed from there and is now included in the programme.  It is a good approach, it is a combination.  It is mainly focused on the ground.  All the national agencies involved, Departments, bodies, local trade unions, local employers and representatives of the local community will be the people on the ground who will do the work.  A special company will be set up in each area with the managerial resources to direct and implement the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a managerial nightmare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come to deal with another question.  Deputy Bruton, a final question please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that the areas will be selected on the basis of objective statistics concerning the level of long term unemployment and not on the basis of political considerations in view of the bad experience we have had with Government allocations on a geographic basis in matters such as the allocation of funds from the national lottery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most unworthy suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>But true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Partly in answer to <Col N="2225" /> Deputy Quinn, the main guidance, monitoring and co-ordination will come from the Central Review Committee.  Let me point out, also in response to Deputy Quinn and I mean to say it in reply to his supplementary question, that the Department of Labour are already running a separate type of pilot scheme not unrelated to this.  Deputy Bruton will accept that the areas selected for that scheme are selected entirely on objective statistical criteria as those others will be too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make sure that will be so here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach information available to him to indicate whether this new scheme will have a job placement role, whether that job placement role would be a direct function of FÁS or whether it is intended that FÁS would devolve at least some of that function in black spots with regard to organisations or groups, such as the Ballymun Job Centre which has now been running for three years quite successfully and may even have been the original version of this idea now being promoted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having an injection of extraneous matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Job placement will be a very important part of the work and, to that extent, FÁS will undertake that aspect just as all the other participating agencies will work with the company in the area in carrying out their different functions whether it be educational, placement, training or simply the provision of jobs.  They will all work together under the umbrella of the company to do the job.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Nealon</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if it is intended that the Bronze Age gold collection recently purchased by the State from the Duke of Northumberland and now on exhibition in the National Museum will be retained at the National Museum on a permanent basis.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Items in the collection in question will, in the first instance, be considered for inclusion as part of the permanent, definitive gold exhibition which it is planned to display at the National Museum from August next. Such items can, however, be withdrawn for display at regional and/or county museums or exhibitions abroad subject to their appropriateness for inclusion in the particular exhibition in question.  The suitability of proposed venues, as regards such matters as security, temperature and humidity controls must also be assured. Such operational matters are essentially matters for the professional judgment of the Museum's Director and his staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I congratulate all those concerned in the purchase and return of this collection which I understand was achieved for a very reasonable price.  Is the Taoiseach aware that many of the most important items in this collection were discovered originally in the north west, in Carraroe in County Sligo, along the banks of the Shannon in Leitrim and in County Donegal?  In view of that fact and also the fact that the National Museum has probably one of the finest collections of gold of this period in Europe, would the Taoiseach consider giving this collection to Sligo for permanent exhibition there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy is reasonably accurate in his description of where the artefacts were found but, of course, we cannot operate a National Museum on that basis.  What I was saying in my reply was that we will now settle the definitive gold component of the National Museum &mdash; the gold collection &mdash; and, thereafter, the remaining golden objects we have can be considered as being available for other purposes.  Of course, the Director of the National Museum will consider all reasonable applications made to him but he would have to be satisfied also about the conditions I mentioned. Unfortunately, I do not think Sligo is very <Col N="2227" /> well advanced in that regard at present. Perhaps the Deputy would use his influence locally, or perhaps I should leave it to Fianna Fáil Deputies in the area to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last point made by the Taoiseach, would he agree that he could advance this enormously, as could his Minister for Education, by acceding to the request of Sligo County Council to give the school in The Mall to them for museum purposes.</P>

      <P>D'iarr an Coiste seo cruinniú leis an Taoiseach roinnt míonna ó shin.  Ós rud é nach raibh ar chumas an Taoisigh, de bharr brú oibre agus coinnithe eile, bualadh leo, dúirt sé leis an gcoiste go mbeinn féin ar fáil chun glacadh le tóscaireacht uathu ach teagmháil a dhéanamh liom.</P>
      <P>Tamall ina dhiadh sin, rinne an coiste teagmháil le m'oifig tráthnóna amháin féachaint an bhféadfainn bualadh leo an lá dar gcionn nuair a bheadh siad i mBaile Átha Cliath ach ní raibh mé saor ar an lá áirithe sin.  Ar ndóigh, tá a ndeacrachtaí pléite agam leo ar an nguthán cúpla uair agus tá mé sásta i gcónaí bualadh leo ach dáta a bheidh feiliúnach dúinn araon a shocrú.</P>

Cinnte, is ceist an tábhachtach í seo agus tá an-taithí agamsa ar an méid atá déanta ag coiste Ghlór na nGael i mBéal Feirste os rud é gur thug mé cuairt ar an gceantar sin ag tús na bliana 1990 nuair a bhuaigh siad comórtas ag an am sin.  Chomh mhaith leis sin, phléigh mé an cheist leis an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus pléadh é ina dhiaidh sin ag cruinniú den Chomhdháil Angla-Éireannach.  Is dócha go bhfuil muinín ag an Taoiseach asam nuair a d'iarr sé orm casadh orthu.</P>

Nuair a bhí an tAire Stáit ansin nuair a osclaíodh ceannáras Ghlór na nGael, bhí siad ag fáil íocaíocht mhorgáiste ó Oifig Thuaisceart Éireann agus níl sé sin ag dul dóibh ach oiread.

Sin an rud is tábhachtaí agus tá sé sin déanta.  Chomh maith leis sin tá ardú 70 faoin gcéad is é sin, ó £13.8 milliún go dtí £19.1 mhilliún, curtha ar fáil i bhfoirm deontas d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reply I would like to give the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education, Deputy Jim Higgins, all my best wishes.  I know that if I wish him many happy years in that position he will accuse me of being provocative so I will just wish us happy times together.</P>
      <P>The statistics quoted by the Deputy are projections based on the expectation that there will be a decline of 93,400 pupils in the enrolments in national schools between the 1992-93 and 1999-2000 school year and on the assumption that there would be no improvement in the current schedule for primary schools. That report came out at the beginning of December.  Since then we have had the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Agreement has been reached between the Government and the social partners for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 25:1 by September 1992. This will be achieved by retaining all existing posts in 1991 and 1992 and by creating 250 new posts in September 1991, and the balance to achieve the 25:1 ratio in September 1922.  The position is to be reviewed at end 1993.</P>
      <P>The implementation of these improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio will mean that the estimates referred to in the appendix at the back of the primary review and in the question are no longer relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her good wishes.  Why was the review document which came out in December first circulated to Fianna Fáil Deputies whereas Opposition Deputies simply got <Col N="2233" /> the Minister's speech yesterday and only this morning got the review proper? Apart from entitlement, there is a matter of courtesy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mistaken. Official spokespersons on Education at that time, and the Deputy was not such then, received the document with an accompanying letter from me stating that it was for dissemination among the parties.  The official spokespersons received the initial document the day after it was released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While not wishing to prolong this argument, I checked the matter with Deputy Bruton who assures me that he got neither the letter nor the document.  In view of the fact that the report contains such frightening statistical evidence in relation to the stripping of our most vital national asset and in view of the fact that the Minister's <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> allocation of 250 additional jobs in primary schools from September 1991 and an additional 250 next year is only putting a minor hole in the 1,000 jobs she removed from the primary school sector as a result of Circular 87/20, does the Minister not acknowledge that there is an obligation on her to allow the existing number of teachers in the system in order to compensate for the huge number of people who simply cannot cope with existing primary school&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference with regard to Deputy Bruton is incorrect.  In relation to additional posts the Deputy has omitted an important factor which is that the number of school children is reducing.  Therefore, under the current ratio there would fall due 250 posts and there will be 250 extra posts: that makes 500 posts.  The same number of teachers were reallocated and allocated last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2234" /> Therefore the Deputy's figure of 1,000 is not relevant in the light of declining enrolements which have occurred since that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask one brief supplementary?  Regarding the Minister's very noble intention of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio to 25:1, will she give a clear commitment that we are talking about a class maximum size of 25:1 in every class hall here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that is not correct.  He is a teacher and knows that what he has put forward is quite fallacious.  Since the Department of Education began many years ago the pupil-teacher ratio has been obtained by dividing the number of teachers into the number of pupils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour the use of school facilities for such activities to the greatest extent possible.  I would encourage school management authorities to make their premises available for the purposes referred to by the Deputy and I believe that, to an increasing extent, they do so.</P>
      <P>In the context of new initiatives under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> related to adult and community programmes, my Department are currently examining the question of what arrangements should be made to ensure availability to the community of school premises where the State has made a significant capital investment in the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of what exhortation the Minister has given to the <Col N="2235" /> school authorities, I am afraid she is ill-informed. I ask the Minister to acknowledge that we have 250 vocational schools, 65 community-comprehensive schools and 495 secondary schools, many of which have woodwork rooms, metalwork rooms, kitchens, computer facilities, science rooms and so on most of which lie dormant and unused from 4 o'clock each evening and for four and a half months each year.  We have a huge multi-billion pound resource which could be used for numerous courses to enhance the general standard of education of people who never had a chance of such education in the first place and could be provided with second chance education now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more.  In the past two or three years we have made great strides in opening up such facilities.  Whenever I go to a school for an official opening or some other reason I always say that the school should be a community resource available to the people.  There are questions of insurance, one of the major issues which besets groups who wish to use schools for some purpose.  Naturally school authorities, management and those in charge, are often rightly dubious about the cost to them were there not proper insurance in the event of an incident of some kind. We have made it clear &mdash; and boards of management are taking it on board &mdash; that it would be up to the groups using the school as a resource to come to some arrangement with the school authorities. I fully agree with the Deputy.  Huge amounts of public money have gone into these resources, which have many valuable aspects such as the practical rooms of which the Deputy spoke and other rooms which could simply be used for meetings.  They should be available as community resources, not regarded as places where the key is turned in the lock at 4 o'clock in the evening.  I will endeavour to give more explicit instructions to school authorities in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to giving explicit instructions, will the Minister <Col N="2236" /> also advise school authorities that they might usefully liaise with agencies such as FÁS to provide crash courses for people who have to emigrate to give them basic skills in metalwork, woodwork and so on in view of the fact that the facilities are there?  Will the Minister restructure the management of schools to enable, for example, second vice principals to be appointed with responsibility for the proper management and supervision of evening and night classes?  That system operated in vocational schools at one stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly of the opinion that the type of course which the Deputy envisages should be in educational institutions which have full professional standards.  I seek on all occasions to try to achieve this.  Regarding the appointment of a second vice principal, that is another question altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase price was negotiated by UCD using expertise available to them.  This follows normal practice in any such acquisitions by university authorities and the involvement of the Valuation Office did not arise.</P>
      <P>The total expenditures involved were £11.7 million, of which the purchase price was £8 million.  The additional funds provided were for equipment, upgrading and other costs not related to the purchase price.  Towards this figure UCD provided £2 million from private sources and a further £1.75 million was available by way of refund of grant from the Mercy Order.</P>
      <P>The question of making the facilities at Carysfort available to UCD has been in question since 1987 when a committee chaired by the then chairman of the Higher Education Authority recommended accordingly.  This committee was set up in 1986 following the debacle of the closure.</P>
      <P>Protracted discussions took place with the Mercy Order regarding the purchase of the premises and adjoining land.  The negotiations eventually broke down because the asking price, and the timescale for consideration were unacceptable. I might add that price was considerably above the price negotiated by UCD.</P>
      <P>Any decision to purchase Carysfort and the allocation of funds for that purpose are matters solely for Government. Naturally I kept the Government fully informed of developments regarding Carysfort at all stages, leading eventually to the decision to provide funds to UCD towards the purchase of the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2238" /> I am satisfied that the purchase represents very good value for money.  In addition to the teaching facilities, it provides UCD with further residential accommodation, dining facilities, a major sports hall and extensive acreage, all of which will contribute in time to major initiatives in the development of the UCD Business School.</P>
    <P>Since I entered office there have been three separate Dáil adjournment debates &mdash; February 1989, July 1989 and May 1990 &mdash; on this issue.  I spoke in all three debates.  There was a common thread through the three debates &mdash; from the Opposition benches a sustained and clear request to keep Carysfort in educational use and from myself, on behalf of the Government, a recognition of the college as a valuable educational resource and reiteration of our wish to find the best formula for doing so.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the number of males entering the colleges of education for primary teachers has, for many years, been significantly lower than the number of females; and also that after rising during <Col N="2240" /> the mid-1980s, the proportion of male entrants has fallen again to its 1981 level.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to predict the future trend of the percentage of female-male students in the colleges of education given that from 1981 to 1990 the figures go full circle, rising from 13 per cent males to 20 per cent (1984) and back to 13 per cent again.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the college authorities, keep the output and quality of primary teachers under ongoing review.  The Deputy will appreciate that any action taken in relation to the male-female balance, however, cannot involve discriminating between male and female candidates.</P>
    <P>Let me add that whilst Deputy Higgins' question is interesting, of much more relevance is why, with such a great number of female primary teachers in the teaching cohort there are not more female principals in the schools.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a basic underlying question here, that it is fundamentally, educationally and socially unsound that there should be an imbalance; that there should be a mix within schools, and that basically the school should be a reflection of the home where there should be role models?  There are 93 females as against seven males in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, first year; 93 females and seven males in Limerick; and 14 out of 14 in the Church of Ireland School. Would the Minister not agree that this in itself is an indication of a general malaise within the profession, the demoralisation, frustration and tension at the fact that we have the largest classes in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 26, 36 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the findings of the report <Col N="2242" /> referred to which was funded by the Research Committee of Cospóir.  The report clearly shows that in many instances Irish children were found to be above the international norm.  However, I am concerned to ensure that all possible measures are taken to improve the overall fitness levels of the Irish pupils.</P>
    <P>On completion of the comprehensive consultation process which I have arranged through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on the Report of the Review Body on the Primary Curriculum, the syllabus on physical education will be examined to determine what follow-up action should be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister finds the findings of this study alarming.  Would he not accept that in view of the correlation between physical well being and academic achievement that our dominant position in Europe as a prime producer of highly educated students and graduates is in danger of being eroded if something is not done to tackle the poor state of physical health of many of the students in our country?  Would he not undertake an immediate investigation of the practical steps that can be taken in school and intervene by way of additional resources be they human or practical at teachers' disposal in order to alleviate the problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that a major problem exists in our primary schools.  In many instances Irish school children were above the international norm.  The Deputy's question seems to indicate that we have a major problem. In fact, there is very significant progress being made with regard to physical education in primary schools and that progress is being added to continuously through the provision of further in-service training for teachers.  For the first time this year there are equipment grants for small items of sports equipment for one, two and three teacher schools.  I accept that there is a necessity to make further progress with regard to the development of physical education in the <Col N="2243" /> primary school curriculum and this matter is now being examined with a view to having this progress undertaken.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister's reply one would think that all was well with physical education in our primary schools.  Is the Minister for Education aware of a survey which I carried out myself in primary schools last year where I got a response from 1,500 schools which showed quite clearly that 80 per cent of the schools showed a total lack of funding for physical education, has very little equipment and, in general, were of the opinion that the Department of Education had no interest whatsoever in physical education?  Has the Minister any intention of trying to provide a pilot survey in certain areas where he provides specialist physical education training, and what schedules has he in mind for in-service courses in physical education at the moment?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the survey that the Deputy carried out.  Everybody accepts that there is a shortage of money for many aspects of primary school education.  I certainly would like to see more money being made available, and the Minister and I are striving at all times to make more money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> However, within the constraints that have been placed upon us in the last number of years, we have progressed significantly the development of physical culture within the primary school system. We are quite satisfied that, mainly due to the very good response of primary teachers, significant progress is being made, not just with the development of physical education in primary schools but also in the development of sport in primary schools.  I accept that the availability of equipment has not always been as we would have hoped and it is for that reason that we provided an additional £80,000 this year for grants for every primary school in the country with one, two or three primary school teachers so that they could avail of the equipment that is necessary for both physical education and sports.</P>
    <P>Finally, we are progressing even further the development of in-service training courses, and the Minister is addressing this whole question in the policy paper which she is at present preparing. Certainly we want to see a much greater role for physical education in the primary school curriculum and the objective is to progress in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to recognise the extent of the problem.  Does the Minister accept that one of the findings of the survey was that there is a greater problem in disadvantaged areas and that the level of physical fitness of pupils in these schools was far below the national average?  Will the Minister consider allocating additional resources immediately to those areas?  In conjunction with the Department of Health will she consider putting together a pilot programme to encourage a healthier lifestyle and greater physical activities among pupils in order to ensure that there will not be as great a demand on the health services in the future as a result of the preventive measures taken now?</P>

Is the Minister aware that the requirement in France, for example is five hours; in West Germany it is three hours; in Luxembourg it is two hours; in England it is three hours and in most other countries it is more than two hours?  Will the Minister consider extending the time available for physical education.

It is often quoted that children in other European countries are proficient in two languages, in fact we have two languages in our primary schools.  We cannot say we are all for Tír agus Teanga and on the other hand dismiss the use of Irish.  We have two languages.  The curriculum review body said there was much to be done within the primary school system and much use to which our resources should and must be put.

      <P>The Minister's reply is rather derisory.  It is unfortunate the way the Minister tried to throw red herrings across the intent of the original question. Would the Minister not agree that it is essential nowadays that our young people have at least one European language? Would the Minister ensure even if the curriculum review body do not do so &mdash; in the latest report which runs to 147 pages there is not one mention of continental languages &mdash; that the syllabus for teacher training courses include at least one continental language and that at least one continental language be included in the syllabus for primary school children?</P>

      <P>I share the Minister's disappointment that the curriculum review body did not recommend a continental language.  Several continental countries make provision for the teaching of two languages other than the home language in primary schools.  The French national plan, following a recommendation by its international advisory committee &mdash; which I put forward as a member of that committee &mdash; has recently incorporated provision for two foreign languages in the primary curriculum. The movement is towards two foreign languages.  I do not think anybody would suggest in a country like Ireland which already has English and Irish that we would aim at two but we could reasonably aim at one, bringing us into line with the teaching of three languages which is becoming the norm in continental Europe.  I encourage the Minister to follow on the lines which I am glad she is contemplating despite the very disappointing report of the curriculum review body.</P>

There are two countries in Europe who teach three languages in their schools.  There is a move, as the Deputy rightly stated, towards the provision of a third language in various countries.  The debate here has been useful.  I particularly welcome Deputy Deasy's suggestion with regard to the syllabus in teacher training colleges and that will be looked at.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that some primary schools allow for the teaching of a foreign language, particularly French?  In accepting that the demands of trying to cope with two languages is a lot for our pupils and teachers where can a modern language be fitted into the time table?  I am very pleased that the Minister is keeping an open mind on this question. Does the Minister see the need to tackle the problem of conformity where some primary schools, of which I am aware, are teaching modern languages, particularly French, on an informal basis?</P>

I can imagine the many debates that will be held here about the 3,500 primary schools and who gave French and who did not.  One could then be into the realm of inequity.

      <P>I am astonished at the Minister's reply because he gave a completely different reply to the parents and teachers which was to the effect that the building would go to tender in December.  Is the Minister aware that there are at present 86 pupils, who are moderately handicapped between the ages of six years and 18 years from all over the city and county being catered for in pre-fabricated buildings which were leaking during the recent inclement weather? Is he aware that it is impossible for teachers and pupils to continue on in those circumstances?  Are mentally handicapped pupils being treated as second class citizens?  It is all right to postpone this project and say, &ldquo;We are looking at something else&rdquo;, but why was he not looking at something else when he gave the promise that this school was going to tender last December?

      <P>As the Deputy is aware I established a primary schools psychological service pilot project last September.  This pilot project is operating in two areas, one urban in Tallaght/ Clondalkin, and one mainly rural, in South Tipperary.  It is intended that these projects will operate for three years and will be evaluated by an external evaluator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the terms under which all agreed to the setting up of the psychological service.

What I am clear about are the terms under which we set up the pilot projects which were to run for three years and which would have a monitoring and an advisory committee composed of the professionals involved. A full study will then be made.  This is the correct procedure for development work.  It is run for a specified period, monitored and then evaluated.  On that basis our decisions will be taken as to dissemination and, hopefully, further provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that an education system which addresses in a positive way the needs of the disadvantaged can contribute significantly to alleviating the problems of those who are socio-economically deprived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My policy, as outlined throughout the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to target available resources to assist the disadvantaged.  The programme contains proposals for the allocation of additional teaching posts to schools in disadvantaged areas, for the establishment of a fund of an additional £1 million in 1991, £2 million in 1992 and £3 million in 1993 to assist in various areas of disadvantage and for the targeting of <Col N="2256" /> places at third level for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>In addition, for those who have left the education system without deriving full potential benefit from it, the programme proposes enhanced measures aimed at providing second-chance education through an expansion of the vocational training opportunities scheme, the Youthreach scheme and adult, literacy and community development programmes. Our aim in many of the agreements reached under the programme will be, as it has always been, to target those in all levels of education who are deemed to be disadvantaged and in need of help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Combat Poverty Agency and other agencies involved in the area of disadvantage and poverty have indicated that 31 per cent of the population live below the poverty line, does the Minister not accept that the amounts she has mentioned, laudable and all as her intentions are, are derisory in the context of the scale of the problem?  Does the Minister not realise that she has one of the most significant social instruments in her hands to do something positive in regard to poverty and disadvantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I do and this is why all Governments have been particularly conscious of the central role education plays in everybody's life.  This is why extreme care has been taken in the programme to ensure that the additional resources which have been agreed to by the social partners with the Government will be mainly targeted at those who are disadvantaged in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the Deputy and to the House that this admirable work which is being expanded is not carried out only at primary level; it is carried out also at second level.  Programmes are being set up whereby students who drop out of school for one reason or another will be able to come back into school, for example, through the vocational training opportunities scheme or the Youthreach scheme.  Following on from that young people who have potential but whose <Col N="2257" /> expectations are not raised for one reason or another will be encouraged to go on to third level education.  We are going to tell the universities and the VEC third level colleges that they have a duty &mdash; they want to do this &mdash; to reach out to those people who may not fulfil their potential and bring them into the system.</P>
    <P>In the context of third level education, another look will be taken at the entitlement of mature students to higher level education.  The criteria and various other measure governing this entitlement seem to be outmoded.  The Minister for Social Welfare and I have worked very closely on many new initiatives in this area.  The Minister for Social Welfare has dealt with the entitlement of adults to third level education and the waiving of certain criteria to enable people to go back into education without losing their entitlements while I have looked at the question of making provision for such people.  The Government are totally committed to measures such as these.</P>

      <P>Let me reply, please. I have just explained in great detail the <Col N="2258" /> provisions already in place and the further enhanced expansion of those provisions to which we are committed.  Our system of education is not a two-tier one.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the provision of pre-school education.  We already operate a very extensive system of pre-school education for the children of travelling people.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that such children are disadvantaged and need particular care. Provision is also made for other children who are deemed to need such help.  It would be wonderful if pre-school education could be provided for children throughout the country.  I would remind the Deputy that we have the earliest primary school starting age and longest primary school cycle in Europe.  Our children benefit greatly from this.  Furthermore, under a special fund set up last year a number of teachers were allocated to help with home-school liaison between parents and the schools.  This scheme which also focused on disadvantaged pupils was a source of encouragement to them and their parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a basic flaw in the approach adopted in dealing with pupils who are educationally disadvantaged? Schools can only do so much in rectifying the problems which exist &mdash; most problems emanate in the home.  As I have said previously in the House, school welfare officers who would co-ordinate the work done by the voluntary and statutory organisations in regard to problem children referred to them by schools should be appointed in each area.  The problems at home could also be dealt with in this context.  This would ensure that resources would be aimed at young children.  If these problems are not dealt with while children are young they will not be dealt with effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly said, the time to tackle problems is in early childhood.  As I have said, to that <Col N="2259" /> end we have established pilot psychological schemes in two areas.  The results of these schemes will form the basis of further developments in this field.  In addition, teachers with a special disposition towards dealing with problem children and problems within the home will be appointed.  I have great hopes that this scheme will yield fruitful results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a <Col N="2260" /> Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the three Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>To lay the blame for the closure of a bakery exclusively at the door of temporary reductions in the price of bread is to ignore reality.  The industry itself recognises that there is serious overcapacity and a need for rationalisation.  I note that this has been acknowledged by the company involved in the most recent closure.  New and more efficient bakeries have opened and have provided competition for the older established and less efficient operations.</P>
      <P>A study of the industry was commissioned by the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Industry Commerce.  This study which was carried out by the Sectoral Development Committee and published last year recognised the need for rationalisation.  I see no need to have further studies undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government provide a framework within which competition in the grocery trade can take place.  The Restrictive Practices Groceries Order, 1987, bans below-cost selling for items such as bread.  It does not and should not fix the price of commodities.  In a previous round of competitíon in the grocery trade that centred on cutting items of high visibility such as bread, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade investigated the matter, and the investigation led to two main conclusions.  First, there was no evidence of below-cost selling as defined in the order, that is, sales by retailers were not below the net invoice price. Clearly there was no breach of the law. Secondly, it was clear that by using the most efficient methods bread could be produced economically and sold, at least in the short term, at the prices then being charged.  It was clear there was neither below-cost selling in breach of the Restrictive Practices Order nor was the retail price of the standard 800 gramme pan loaf below its economic cost of production. I have no grounds for believing that if the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade was to investigate the matter again the results would be different from previously.  The director has responsibility for enforcing <Col N="2261" /> the order and will deal with any complaints which now arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Twice in the course of the Minister's reply he referred to the short term.  Does he accept that while in the short term there may be a benefit to the consumer, in the long term if the present trend is allowed to continue unchecked and it will ultimately lead to the elimination of everybody in the production area of the baking industry, with the possible exception of three operators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that at all.  If the Deputy studies the Sectoral Development Committee report he will see there is a future for quite a number of operators but not necessarily in the production of bread in the way that it has been traditionally produced in this country.  The Deputy will also bear in mind, I am sure, that when many other industries were forced by market conditions and otherwise to rationalise themselves over the past ten or 15 years, the bakery industry, for better or for worse, was largely exempt from that rationalisation process, at least in part due to substantial subsidies paid by successive Governments over a long number of years.  That period of rationalisation which hit many other industries as long as ten or even 20 years ago has been hitting the bakery industry in recent years and I hope it will reach an end soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the bakery which is about to close, to which Deputy Durkan referred, has the Minister any indication that other bakeries might be affected by the present war and may also have to close?  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has received a complaint from RGDATA, the small grocers' association.  Does the Minister propose to act on that at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The director is, of course, independent of me.  He deals with complaints as he gets them and I am sure he will give that complaint full cognisance. I would remind the House that the <Col N="2262" /> director has inquired into this point twice in the past 18 months &mdash; first in the autumn of 1989 and again in December 1990, only two months ago&mdash;and on each occasion he found after full investigation that there was not below-cost selling. Therefore, he was not in a position to bring any prosecution.</P>

      <P>Obviously I cannot give a guarantee but as some of the larger old-fashioned, traditional type bakeries close down new bakeries are opening up where the proprietors see the opportunity of diversification and new niches in the market.  Overall the demand for the traditional type of bread that has been eaten in this country, usually the 800 gramme pan, is probably in decline whereas there is a growth in demand for more specialised breads and confectionery, and I think that is where the future lies in that industry.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that rather than rationalisation of the industry what we are seeing here is the use of bread as a commercial weapon in this price war in order to give a larger share of the market to the supermarket chains?  Only yesterday a statement from the parent company of Kelly's in Kilcock very clearly commented on the absence of any control of the structure of bread pricing as contributing to the present position, and probably to more job losses in the future.  The Minister referred to the report of the sectoral committee on the Irish bakery industry.  Is he not ignoring the recommendations made by that committee in order to invoke European rules to protect free competition to save the Irish bakery industry from coming under the control of the supermarkets, which at the end of the day will lead to higher bread prices anyway for the consumer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to introduce, for example, the concept of a minimum price or to fix a minimum price, and I have no powers under the Prices Acts or any other legislation to do so.  I do not think it would be anyone's interest to do that.  I accept, at least in part, what the Deputy has said about bread and certain other high visibility items being used in the competitive struggle between different supermarket chains.  It is a pity that they pick on bread all the time.  I would invite them, for example, to begin to compete with one another for the first time ever on milk, on which there appears to be a fixed price.  Even though the larger multiple supermarkets are able to buy milk at a much greater discount than small traders, the retail price is the same in every retail outlet in the country.  That is entirely wrong and is an indication of unnecessary profiteering by multiple supermarkets.  If they were interested in giving value to the consumer they would begin to compete on items such as milk and other products where there is not the same strenuous competition as bread.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to apply the theory on which his answer seems to be based to the following facts: first, the firm we are talking about which is about to close has been through a very substantial rationalisation and modernisation programme in recent years and, secondly, that firm can bake, freeze and export bread to France at a profit but still cannot sell bread on the Irish market at a profit because of the price structure. Could the Minister also apply his theory of market fixing and price fixing to variations in price of up to 25 per cent on an individual item over a short period, to the position where the price, having gone down by 25 per cent, from 49p to 39p per loaf, gradually goes back up over a period?  Does the Minister believe that that is a normal part of what we should expect to see in the market for a mass commodity?</P>

      <P>I am well aware that prices go up and down quite a lot and I do not think it makes a great deal of sense.  This practice is carried on by supermarkets in order to gain publicity. Whenever the price comes down we immediately see headlines to the effect that there is a price war, and that gets people very excited.  If we had genuine competition across the whole range of grocery and household items, it would be much healthier.</P>
      <P>I cannot comment on the individual company concerned because I have no details on their financial performance, and even if I had, I do not think it would be appropriate to comment on it.</P>

      <P>In the peculiar circumstances of this case where the major supermarket chain is also the owner of a bakery, will the Minister state whether the Director of Consumer Affairs is satisfied in that case that costs are not being transferred from one to the other to bring about a false price floor which has the effect of destroying jobs in other bakeries?  Nobody objects to competition &mdash; it is a very good thing &mdash; but there is a danger that that may be happening.</P>

I will certainly again draw his attention to that fact.  At the moment he is in the process of making a report to the Fair Trade Commission on how the 1987 Groceries Order has operated and I will invite him to look at that aspect of it in the course of making his report.

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that almost 2,000 jobs have already been lost in the baking industry during the course of the so-called rationalisation and that they have not been replaced?  The Minister indicated to the House his intention of introducing a Bill in regard to competition.  Will the bread industry be encompassed within the controls he envisages in that Bill?  Will the Minister tell the House whether he expects bread prices to remain consistently low or does he foresee a rise when the competition has been eliminated from the production area?</P>

      <P>I very much regret that jobs have been lost in this industry. However, I would have to point out to the Deputy that, over the past 20 years, tens of thousands of jobs in many traditional industries have been lost.  Perhaps the bakery industry were fortunate in that they were able to delay the day of reckoning much longer than others and we are now seeing in that industry what happened in quite a number of other industries ten, 15 or 20 years ago.</P>

This House calls on the Government to withdraw these facilities immediately and to compel Monsieur Le Pen to secure some private venue, if he wishes, for the airing of his racist and fascist views.

      <P>I, too, tabled a Private Notice Question to the Ceann Comhairle relating to the decision of the Supreme Court this morning with regard to the verdict of guilty but insane and I was advised that it was ruled out of order on the basis that it lacked urgency.  I accept the ruling but it does not avoid the urgency of the matter.  May I ask the Minister for Justice if he intends to bring before the House legislation promised on this matter in response to previous parliamentary questions when he stated he would await the Supreme Court judgment?  Legislation is urgently required.  At least an undertaking should be given that no one will be released from the custody of the State until such time as this House has considered the legislation, in particular a person who is regarded as being responsible for the perpetration of two killings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to approve the terms of the agreement establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to enable this country to honour the financial and other obligations associated with membership of that bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement to set up the new bank had its origins in a French initiative at the end of 1989 which called for a Community response to the dramatic developments then taking place in Central and Eastern Europe.  The initiative was endorsed by the Heads of State and Government of the European Community in December 1989 and the agreement was signed on 29 May last.  This was a very short timescale for the negotiation <Col N="2397" /> of such an agreement and it is evidence of the degree of co-operation which has been forthcoming in response to the remarkable developments in Eastern Europe.  While membership of the bank will cover a much broader international spectrum, it will have a special European character because of the scale of European involvement in it.</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of East-West relations has been transformed as a result of the far-reaching reforms taking place in Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.  The changes in Central and Eastern Europe mean that it is no longer appropriate to think in bloc-to-bloc terms.  The newly emerged democracies &mdash; and particularly Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary &mdash; carry out independent foreign policies which are based on similar premises to those of Western European countries &mdash; respect for human rights and for international law &mdash; and which reflect their particular national concerns.  They are anxious to increase their links to Western Europe in general and in particular to the Community, which they see as a powerful support for democracy and for economic reform.</P>
    <P>However, it must be acknowledged that the degree of progress in introducing reforms is uneven.  For example, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are most advanced while the situation in Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia requires careful monitoring.</P>
    <P>The position in the Soviet Union is much more complicated.  This is partly because of its size but recent uncertainties surrounding the extent and the pace of the reform process are also a factor.</P>
    <P>The Community has been in the vanguard in providing and co-ordinating economic assistance in support of reform in Central and Eastern Europe.  A wide range of measures to assist the transition from command to market-oriented economic structures has been agreed.  Priority areas in fields such as agriculture, trade, investment, environment, energy and training have been identified in line with the real needs of these countries and projects are already under way in most of <Col N="2398" /> these sectors.  In addition, various instruments at EC level have been put in place, for example, EIB and ECSC loans.  In all, G24 assistance to the region, including grants, loans and credits, committed since June 1989 amounts to the impressive figure of $38 billion.  That amount includes approximately $13 billion of capital for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</P>
    <P>The economies of Eastern Europe must go through a fundamental process of restructuring from inefficient production and distribution systems, based on central planning, to the market system which we take for granted.  It is difficult for us to grasp fully the scale of change that is required when whole nations have been conditioned for the past 50 years to a rigid system of planning that stifled initiative and individual enterprise.</P>
    <P>One of the perverse consequences of the economic reforms that are now taking place is that output in these countries will stagnate or decline in the short term due to the impact of the adjustments that are required.  New structures and new institutions must be put in place.  The changeover to world prices and payment in convertible currencies will put an extra strain on financial resources.  The elimination of widespread subsidies, with only partial compensation for consumers, and the threat of unemployment add further to the difficulties that arise.  There is also a distinct risk of mounting inflation.  For the longer term, however, the outlook is much more optimistic and economic performance should improve significantly, provided these countries adhere to sound economic policies during the process of integration into the free market economy.  The early indications are that the authorities in these countries generally understand the importance of this but they will have to withstand pressures as people's expectations are not being realised quickly.</P>
    <P>Help is needed from the West during the difficult period of transition and is being provided in a number of ways. International and European Community institutions are organising assistance and a number of countries have bilateral <Col N="2399" /> arrangements for special aid.  Much has been achieved already in a very short period.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development can have a powerful influence on the transition process. There are many projects waiting for assistance.  It is most important that no time be lost in providing the necessary resources for the new institution to enable it fulfil its mandate.</P>
    <P>The objective of the bank is to promote private and entrepreneurial activity in those Central and Eastern European countries which are committed to multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics and to foster their transition towards open market-oriented economies. The bank will have a broad range of functions: it will provide loans, guarantees and technical assistance, make equity capital investments and underwrite the issue of securities.  It may also accept special funds and deploy them in accordance with whatever agreement is reached with the donors of such funds. The bank's financial assistance will be directed towards specific projects.  It will not lend to Governments to support programmes of economic adjustment or to finance balance of payments deficits. These will remain areas for the continuing attention of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Community itself.  The main emphasis in the bank's operations will be on the private sector and on State-owned enterprises which are being privatised.</P>
    <P>However, the bank will be able to assist the State sector for certain purposes, such as infrastructure, subject to a limit of 40 per cent of its operations both in the individual countries and overall.</P>
    <P>Central and Eastern European countries meeting the conditions set out in the agreement are eligible for assistance.  The sheer size and potential demand for resources of the USSR raised the question, at an early stage of the negotiations, of the extent of this member's access to the bank's funds.  The difficulty was finally resolved by the USSR limiting voluntarily their access to funds over the first three years.  The relevant request from <Col N="2400" /> the Soviet authorities is reproduced on the last page of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of this arrangement is that the USSR will not be able to receive funds from the bank in excess of what they will have already paid in for their shares in the bank over this three-year period.  The limit on the amount of funds involved is in the order of IR£80 million. In addition, the range of activities qualifying for assistance in the USSR will be more restricted than for other recipients. Any decision, at the end of the three-year period, to widen USSR access will have to command a majority of 85 per cent of the voting power of members.</P>
    <P>The initial capital of the bank will be 10,000 million ECU, 3,000 million of which will be paid-in and the remainder subject to call.  The prospective founder membership of the bank and the allocation of its initial share capital are set out in Annex A to the agreement.  The main points of interest are as follows. When the agreement was signed there were 42 prospective members of the bank, comprising 40 countries and two institutions, namely, the European Economic Community and the European Investment Bank.  The articles of agreement specify that membership is open to European countries, non-European countries which are members of the IMF, the European Economic Community and the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>The European Community holding&mdash; if we count the shares of the member states, the Community itself and the European Investment Bank &mdash; amounts to 51 per cent of the shares of the bank. However this does not secure control of the bank in all circumstances as most of the non-routine decisions require majorities of two-thirds or over.</P>
    <P>The US has the largest individual country share at 10 per cent; other major countries each have 8.5 per cent; the USSR have 6 per cent and the remaining shareholdings vary generally in proportion to a country's resources, with Ireland having 0.3 per cent.  The breakdown of share capital between Community member states is broadly on the <Col N="2401" /> lines of their shares in the capital of the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>Since the agreement was signed, the two Germanys have been reunited.  The German authorities have indicated that they will not be taking up the shares allocated to the former German Democratic Republic.  Therefore, Germany will continue to have the same proportion of shares as the other large Community members.  The former GDR shares will remain unallocated for the present and will be available for allocation to any new members the bank might decide to admit when it is up and running.</P>
    <P>On becoming a member, Ireland will subscribe for 3,000 shares at a cost of 30 million ECU or approximately £23 million at current exchange rates.  This will represent 0.3 per cent of the bank's total subscribed capital.  The paid-in element will be 9 million ECU or £6.9 million at current exchange rates, payable over five years amounting to 1.8 million ECU or approximately £1.4 million a year.  This will be paid from the Central Fund.  Payment of our subscription will become due after sufficient members have ratified the agreement to allow for its entry into force and after Ireland has ratified the agreement.  It is expected that the agreement will enter into force shortly and a first meeting of governors is planned for April.  Assuming speedy ratification by Ireland, the cost to the Exchequer of £1.4 million per annum will arise in each of the years 1991 to 1995.  Up to 50 per cent of each instalment of paid in shares may be made in promissory notes which will be encashed by the bank as needed for its operations. Ireland's maximum liability to the bank will be the unpaid share of its subscribed capital.</P>
    <P>The new bank has a number of unique features in relation to other multilateral institutions and I would like to mention a few of these.  Its statutes contain express political criteria in relation both to membership and beneficiaries.  These cover a commitment to multi-party democracy, the rule of law and human rights.  Its activities will span both the public and private sectors and it will have a wide <Col N="2402" /> range of instruments at its disposal.  It is unusual in having Soviet, Eastern European and United States participation as founder members.  It has a majority Community, and even bigger majority European, shareholding and its capital is denominated in ECU.</P>
    <P>In the course of the negotiations a number of candidates for the location of the bank were put forward, including Dublin.  It did not prove possible, however, to get a Community consensus on a single location and the wider negotiating conference eventually decided that the bank's headquarters should be in London.</P>
    <P>Overall control of the bank will be exercised by a board of governors.  Each of the members will appoint a governor, normally the Finance Minister.  Governors will meet annually to review progress and decisions on particularly sensitive issues will be reserved for them.</P>
    <P>The day-to-day running of the bank will be delegated to the board of directors. This board will consist of twenty-three directors.  Eleven will be elected by the Community, its member states and the European Investment Bank.  Of the remaining twelve: four will be elected by recipient countries of Central and Eastern Europe; four by other European countries; and four by non-European countries.  There will be an equivalent number of alternate directors.  Ireland will share a directorship and an alternate with Denmark on a rotating basis.</P>
    <P>The bank will not be in competition with any of the existing international financial institutions.  Rather, it sees itself both as a complement and a catalyst. It will complement the activities of the existing multilateral institutions in undertaking co-financing with them and in concentrating on individual projects where some of the other institutions take a more global approach.  It will work in close liaison with, and benefit from the experience of, the European Investment Bank which is also one of its own members.  It will co-operate closely with the European Commission which is co-ordinating a broad range of multilateral aid to Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2403" /> Before dealing with the provisions of the Bill itself, I would like to draw Deputies' attention to the fact that under the terms of Article 29 (5) (2) of the Constitution it will be necessary for the Dáil to pass the motion, which is number 8 on today's order paper and which formally approves the terms of the EBRD Agreement. This will ensure that the Agreement is binding upon us in international law.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, section 1 defines various terms.  Section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains the financial and other provisions.  In particular, subsection 2 provides for the payment out of the Central Fund both of our initial subscription, and of any subsequent subscriptions which might arise if the bank's capital were to be increased and we were to participate in that increase.  Subsection 3 provides for the issue of promissory notes.  Subsection 4 provides for the disposal of any moneys received under the Agreement, for example, under any distribution of net income that might be decided on.  As is customary, the Central Bank will act as depository for the EBRD and subsection 5 makes provision for this. In addition, this subsection also provides that the Central Bank may advance any moneys required for subscription payments. Under subsection (6), the servicing costs associated with any moneys thus advanced will be charged on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains the short title to the Bill and the terms of the EBRD Agreement itself are set out in the schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I welcome this Bill and the Minister giving us the opportunity to speak on the Bill here in the House.  In terms of recommendations on the expenditure of public funds, it is minor enough and its impact on our finances is small.  Our total commitment is, I understand, .3 of 1 per cent of the total capital being allocated to this <Col N="2404" /> bank, 30 million ECU according to the Minister's speech and the explanatory memorandum, and the initial commitment is to pay £6.9 million in five annual instalments so, our annual commitment is £1.4 million.  In the kind of budget the Minister introduced last week £1.4 million could be categorised almost as petty cash.  It is not our contribution to the bank which is significant today.  It is significant that we in the Irish Parliament are debating a Bill which involves our contribution to a European bank for reconstruction and which has as its primary object to aid in the establishment and the development of the States in Eastern Europe committed to the fundamental principles of multi-party democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and market economics.</P>
      <P>It is astounding that 12 months after we saw on our television screens the rapidity of change in Eastern Europe, we are debating such a Bill with an agreement attached in which those words are the first sentence of that agreement.  It is extraordinary also when we look at the list of countries that have and are willing to subscribe to the European Bank.  It is interesting to look at the recipient countries. As I understand it, all states in Eastern Europe and in Central Europe are eligible to apply for a loan to the bank, but listed as prospective recipient countries are Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the USSR and Yugoslavia. I note what the Minister has said about the German Democratic Republic and the USSR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is astounding that so soon after the most unexpected series of events which took place, particularly in 1989, we are debating a Bill now where all the recipient nations as well as the contributory nations are committed to an Eastern Europe and indeed a USSR which will be based on the fundamental principles of multi-party democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and market economics.  That is the antithesis of what Eastern Europe and the USSR stood for during our childhood and most of our adult lives.  That is the significance of this <Col N="2405" /> Bill, that it formally marks in this House the amazing changes in our time.  I hope this Bill is successful.  We have seen the changes in Eastern Europe and as the television cameras let the light in to allow us in our homes witness these changes, they also let the light into the past of those countries.  It was quite clear that the centralised socialist economies were not working.  They were not delivering on the kind of living standards which one would expect in Europe in the late 20th century.  They certainly were not delivering on the hopes and aspirations of their people.  While the rule of law was variously applied, it is fair to say that respect for human rights was less than universal in Eastern Europe and the USSR.  The most deplorable example was that of Romania which is still being brought forcefully home to us.  Later today we will be debating another Bill with an East European connection, the Bill to change the legal status of children adopted here who had Romanian parents.  Any of us who have seen film about the orphanages of Romania need no further reminder of the difficulties which were being experienced in the whole area of human rights in East European countries.</P>
    <P>I hope Eastern Europe can be reconstructed and that market economics can flourish there.  I hope the rule of law will be applied and that the multi-party system will ensure that human rights are universally respected.  There are difficulties which we should not gloss over. The Minister rightly said that the pace of development is different in East European countries.  I hope there will be no reversal of the progress that has been made as we go through the decade.</P>
    <P>This time last year there was a wave of optimism throughout the world.  Changes were taking place everywhere.  It was as if freedom had broken out all over, not only in Eastern Europe but in South Africa.  Apart from the depressing influence of the Gulf War, depressing things are happening in Eastern Europe as well. The first flush of freedom is departing from Eastern Europe.  There are real economic difficulties in many of the East <Col N="2406" /> European countries and they will not disappear lightly.  They are in need of all the help, both politically and economically, which they can get from those who are strong in Europe and in particular from those of us who are members of the European Community.</P>
    <P>In Bulgaria, for example, petrol is not available at present.  People on holidays there find that their airplane has just enough fuel to take them across the border to Romania, where it is refuelled for the journey home.  Petrol is no longer available from Russia, the traditional supplier to Bulgaria.  Turkey sells some fuel there.  Their economy is shattered, their standard of living has fallen and there is an enormous need for reconstruction. We are familiar with the situation in Romania and how tenuous the change there might be.  There is widespread fear among many sectors of the community that there will be a reversal to traditional central control on the democratic socialist model.  We know there are difficulties of other kinds in Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary whose economies need enormous reconstruction.</P>
    <P>We also know the success story of East Germany and the pace of unity which surprised everybody.  It is very revealing that in the agreement which is attached to the Bill East Germany is listed as a separate state and as one of the potential recipients from this Fund.  Before the Bill arrived in the House the political situation had changed and East Germany is now part of a united Germany.  These are astounding changes and I am glad we have the opportunity to contribute through the European Bank of Reconstruction. I am glad we have the responsibility to take on the invitation and to contribute.  I hope we will be able to do more, both in terms of investment of money and maybe by our people travelling to Eastern Europe and helping to build the economies of the East.  When the first flush of hope goes and when the brave new dawn arrives and problems still remain, sometimes it is difficult for people to maintain their optimism.  We are at that stage now in Eastern Europe. <Col N="2407" /> Areas like Yugoslavia are particularly worrying, with competing nationalist groups in conflict in that country.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the position in the USSR.  On the last page of this agreement the USSR has effectively restricted its own participation in the bank because its needs were so great when the agreement was drawn up that it did not want to be seen to be the main recipient swallowing up a disproportionate amount of the resources available.  That was signed at a time when one could be more hopeful about the situation in the USSR than one is now.  I wonder what the commitment is in the USSR to multi-party democracy, to market economics.  I also wonder as we look at the position in the Baltic republics and in Georgia what the commitment is to the rule of law and respect for human rights in the USSR.  I know the difficulties which have been and are being experienced in the Soviet Union.  I have read enough history to know the difficulties which Russia experienced in the past. Russia has no tradition of democracy. There was never a democratic state or democratic government in Russia.  There is no experience of or faith in the democratic system.</P>
    <P>That has always been matched by a parallel fear for the security of Russia. When one looks at the map one sees that the main rivers run north and south, the northern ones going into a frozen sea and the southern rivers into the Caspian Sea or the Black Sea.  The Caspian is land locked and the Black Sea, at various times in Russian history, was as good as land locked.  Through the centuries ships leaving the Black Sea had to go out under the Turkish guns.  There is a constant fear for the security of the Soviet Union. There are no natural barriers in the east or west; there is a fear of being cut off from access to the Baltic and the fear of being cut off from the Black Sea in the South.</P>
    <P>If we look at the policies which all Russian Governments have followed for centuries, a number of fundamental factors have not changed.  It was always <Col N="2408" /> policy to have access to the Baltic and in that context one can understand the fears of any Russian Government of being cut off by the establishment of a series of independent republics along the Baltic. In the late 19th century the states to the south were taken over by an imperial Russia for much the same reason: they needed access to the Black Sea.  States such as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan contiguous to the Black Sea are strategically important.  One has to understand the traditional fear of the Soviet Union of being cut off from its natural outlets and exposed to danger on both the east and the west.  There has always been a fear in Russia of the invaders from western Europe.  It happened on a number of occasions.  It happened in the time of Napoleon when the French went as far as Moscow.  It happened again in the forties when the German army rolled through Poland and into the Soviet Union.  If one goes back further there was the fundamental fear of invasion from the East, from Mongolia and, more recently, a fear of trouble on the Chinese border.</P>
    <P>Taking all these things into account we must, as a member of the Community and as a country which increasingly participates in a common European foreign policy, take into account the fears of Russia and the security fears of Russia &mdash; and I call it Russia rather than the USSR. At the same time we must never miss an opportunity to say that we are committed to an Eastern Europe and to a Soviet Union which will be based on the rule of law, on respect for human rights, on market economics and on multi-party democracy.  We should make it very clear, on occasions like this, that the provisions of this agreement and the provisions of this Bill are tied into that prospect in Eastern Europe and the investment funds being made available will not be available unless there is progress in Russia itself towards the objectives which are stated in the initial part of the agreement which is attached to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Many people have asked why did everything occur so suddenly in Eastern <Col N="2409" /> Europe in 1988 and then why was the great wave of countries in Eastern Europe seeking freedom in 1989.  The reason was that for many years systems were kept in place by the army of the USSR.  It was when the Soviet Government changed its foreign policy and rejected the Brezhnev doctrine and decided that they would no longer intervene at the point of a gun in Eastern Europe that the opportunity was given for the great outbreak of democracy which we saw in Eastern Europe.  There is nothing to suggest, however, that if circumstances changed in Russia, that if what Shevardnadze, Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union until quite recently, said were to come to pass, that we would again have a Soviet dictatorship supported by the army and the KGB, that that state in that formulation would not again seek to exercise control in its sphere of influence and effectively exercise control one way or another over the democracies now emerging in Eastern Europe and which are purported to be helped by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have to go slightly beyond the provisions of this Bill today which, in the context of domestic expenditure and international expenditure are quite small &mdash; a £1.4 million commitment every year for five years &mdash; and we have to look at the situation emerging in Eastern Europe and especially in the Soviet Union.  As a country which can be influential within the EC but not particularly influential on the world stage in our own right, we have to put down our markers too.  I would urge the Minister for Finance, and in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to take the provisions in the preamble to the agreement at face value and to insist in the European fora and through our influence when the board of this bank is established that the provisions in the preamble to the agreement mean what they say and we expect them to mean what they say.  We are for a reconstructed Eastern Europe.  We want countries in Eastern Europe that will participate in multi-party democracies where the rule of law and respect for human rights are enshrined in the constitutions of those <Col N="2410" /> countries and we want the countries also to be countries where market economics are the norm of the day and reconstructed on that basis.  It is on that basis that we are prepared to help.</P>
    <P>Very quickly the optimism which was so prevalent last year is beginning to fade away.  Our eyes internationally tend to be more on the Gulf now than on Eastern Europe, but there are very disturbing things happening in the Soviet Union at present and we should not let the occasion pass without noting them.</P>
    <P>When the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, as it has done last week, is advising Irish citizens, and in particular school groups, not to visit the Soviet Union because the Department of Foreign Affairs consider that it would be physically dangerous for them to do so, then it is time our attention was redirected again towards the events in Eastern Europe and particularly the events in the USSR.  Let us hope that whatever influence we have internationally can be used to prevent a situation which I believe is rapidly deteriorating in the Soviet Union to turn, on the one hand, into outright conflict between the states there or, alternatively, into a Russian dictatorship underpinned by the army and the KGB. That is not the basis for the optimism which we had last year.  That is not the way we saw things developing.  We should nail our colours to the mast and be prepared to support all those forces in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, who are committed to what is, effectively, the commitment in the preamble to this agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcomes the introduction of this Bill but regrets that due to its nature it is, in effect, a <i>fait accompli</i> from the point of view of parliamentary debate.  We have, in fact, a two page four section Bill accompanied by an appendix of an agreement which constitutes 63 articles and three annexes all of which has been negotiated outside this House and none of which, in effect, can be changed inside this House.  The Committee Stage of this Bill will be interesting for no other reason <Col N="2411" /> than that we will simply be going through something that will have very little capacity for change.  I put that on the record so as to alert the Minister that I do not see that this should be a long and tortuous debate but in recognition that there is a kind of democratic deficit implicit in what we are embarking upon.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to pose some specific questions for him and for his advisers which he might answer either on Committee Stage or in reply to Second Stage.  Can the Minister tell me who negotiated this agreement on Ireland's behalf?  Who decided on our sharing, our directorship on the alternate with Denmark? What mechanism produced that recommendation and agreement?  Who will be our nominee to be that director or alternate &mdash; presumably it will be the same person over the three year period? What Irish staff will there be within the bank?</P>
      <P>Financial journals, for the last six months to a year, have been full of speculation about the particular presidential style of the president-designate of this bank.  It could be said he did not pick it from a stone in one sense.  That has raised some concerns, it has to be said, about the mode and manner of Monsieur Attali's method of operation and the very large degree of discretion the bank will have in its operations.  While we may be small contributors as Deputy Noonan has said, from the point of view of a current account payment over the next five years our exposure is to the tune of £23 million over the period.</P>
      <P>It would be reasonable to expect, if one looks at the tone of the letter at the back of the Bill, that the drawdown on funds will be fairly quick and fairly substantial. Therefore any prudent Minister for Finance would have to assume that the call-down on even 0.3 per cent of share capital will be reasonably quickly if this Bill, and the bank to which it is agreeing, is to achieve its objectives in Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some specific questions which I would like to put to the Minister and his advisers.  I have specific questions <Col N="2412" /> also in relation to the operation of the bank: what arrangements, and it falls from the dimension of the Irish staff, will there be to guarantee that consultancy contracts and technical assistance provisions and various mechanisms which the bank are enabled to provide to the emerging mixed economies of Central Europe will be offered to all the member states of the bank on a fair basis?  Those of us who have some experience of the Commission, and particularly of the DGVIII which ran the European Development Fund, will be well aware of the unique capacity for a French dominated administration to scoop the pool in relation to the more lucrative contracts and the more financially rewarding aspects of work which will be generated by this bank.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear about this: there is already an enormous amount of consultancy work financed either by the EIB or by the Commission directly, and inevitably by this bank as well, that will properly fall to countries such as ours and others that would be in a position to tender for and efficiently supply those services.  If we are going to put up money to the tune of £23 million at maximum, there should be some understanding, if not safeguards, in the operation and practice of the bank that a <i>juste retour</i> would prevail in relation to Ireland's slice of whatever economic action will unfold from this.  I would like the Minister to try to respond to some of those questions either at the end of Second Stage or on Committee Stage, whichever is more convenient.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the historical background against which this bank has come into existence.  This is very much a political construction.  It is not your normal bank in any sense of the word, and to that extent banking criteria and all the safeguards that flow from it have to be taken with a certain degree of circumspection. To that extent the Gallic capacity for the grand gesture concerns me because Central and Eastern Europe no longer need grand gestures.  The history has yet to be written in detail about the remarkable transformation across the <Col N="2413" /> whole of Europe that has led to stable democracies, but, in effect, the transformation started first in Western Europe with the dismantlement in 1974 of the dictatorship in Portugal, followed by the transition from the Franco dictatorship in Spain through to the Colonels in Greece and, finally, to Central and Eastern Europe with the collapse by the classic characteristics of imperial over-reach that led to the dismantlement first of the Breshnev doctrine.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party share a certain sense of victory in the collapse of the command economies &mdash; Deputy Noonan used the phrase &ldquo;socialist economies&rdquo;, but we never regarded them as socialist economies. The collapse of the centrally controlled party state apparatus with a command economy, and rigid and increasingly out of touch central planning, were for internal debate within the Socialist movement in Europe from 1917 with the establishment of the Bolshevik revolution, and the breaking away from most European socialist parties of hard left groups which constituted themselves as Communist parties, which subsequently castigated democratic socialist parties on their failure to adhere to the correct road to socialism and on their obsession with bourgeois parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>In so far as people can take pleasure from being able to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, there is a degree of finality in the great historical debate that dominated the European political stage for nearly 60 to 70 years.  It is now over.  In bringing it to a conclusion it would be incorrect and unfair to heap all the credit exclusively on President Gorbachev although he must take primary credit for creating the political space within which the transformation occurred.  I would like to put on record the remarkable evolution of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party and their leadership starting with Kadar and then Karoly Grosz that led to that party in government deciding, without any prompting from the streets as was the case with Czechoslovakia and Eastern Germany, to abandon their monopoly in power as a single party state and uniquely <Col N="2414" /> to recognise the primacy of their obligations to the United Nations Treaties which resulted in them unilaterally dismantling the Iron Curtain in the summer of 1988 which effectively led to the collapse in Czechoslovakia and Eastern Germany in the reverse order.</P>
    <P>My reason for focusing on Hungary is that country, parallel to the political evolution which I described very briefly &mdash; and it makes fascinating reading for anybody who is interested in political evolution in Central Europe &mdash; was attempting to achieve a liberalisation of their economy and came to the conclusion that you cannot have a market liberal economy unless you have a liberal open democratic society.  They are further down the road in Hungary in terms of the transition to market economics than they are in any other Central European country.  There are some very major lessons I want to draw to the attention of this House because I fear the work of this bank, and consequently our scarce capital, as shareholders could be at risk.</P>
    <P>One of the frequent objectives in the articles establishing this bank is to assist the process of privatisation.  Let me draw your attention specifically, without entering into a Committee Stage type debate, to Article 11, page 11 which states:</P>
    <P>1.  The Bank shall carry out its operations in furtherance of its purpose and functions as set out in Articles 1 and 2 of this Agreement in any or all of the following ways:</P>
    <P>(i)  by making, or cofinancing together with multilateral institutions, commercial banks or other interested sources, or participating in, loans to private sector enterprises, loans to any state-owned enterprise operating competitively and moving to participation in the market oriented economy, and loans to any state-owned enterprise to facilitate its transition to private ownership and control;</P>
    <P>The worry that is emerging very clearly <Col N="2415" /> in Budapest &mdash; and there is an Irish presence in Budapest in the form of a CTT office &mdash; is that the title to state companies, purportedly held in the hands of some people, is extremely dubious and the way in which the state party, for example, in East Germany, apparently absconded with title to or ownership of resources that were properly the property of the state, is a fear that is increasingly being expressed by Hungarian citizens within the Republic of Hungary.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what mechanisms that Ireland, as a shareholder in this bank, will have to ensure that we do not get some kind of transfer of capital from a benign and well intentioned western market orientated Europe and the other nations involved, the United States effectively, to facilitate what will effectively become a very sophisticated rip-off by former Stalinist Apparatchiks who, with all the skill and expertise of people who had escaped through the Odessa link to Argentina, managed to take some of the remaining riches of what was then the Third Reich.  There is precedent for this. The fear of those people, who politically, ideologically and even emotionally have nowhere to go, is that they will attempt to rip-off.  My information from a variety of sources is that already there have been a number of scandals and great controversies about people selling off property, including a major hotel chain in Hungary they did not own but for which they were the beneficiaries of substantial sums of hard currency.</P>
    <P>I do not see that it is primarily the function of this kind of bank to allow for the leverage buy out &mdash; if that is the correct phrase &mdash; of these kinds of assets which are State owned in order to enable them to operate in a market orientated economy.  On the participation of the Irish negotiators in the course of the formulation of the articles setting up this bank, presumably such matters were discussed in some detail because obviously the information I would have is considerably limited and is very much second hand.  Nevertheless, some of what I am saying is a matter of published record in <Col N="2416" /> the financial journals in Western Europe and some of it I was told directly when I led a Labour Party delegation to Budapest last March.</P>
    <P>The last point I should like to make relates to how we can ensure that Ireland will benefit from this particular process because there has to be a degree of self-interest &mdash; benign and proper self-interest &mdash; in making this kind of investment because the other European member states will be doing so with like mind on their part.  To that extent I would be concerned that while the Central European economies will open up and provide potential markets for some ranges of Irish products, unless we have within the Department of Finance a willingness to capitalise on the opening of markets for skills and services, I do not think we will maximise the intent implicit in this legislation.  Specifically, what I am trying to suggest to the Minister is that this action cannot be taken on its own: it has to be matched by an awareness within the Department of Finance that the role and the resources of the IDA, the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the role of CTT and the role of technical assistant for various other companies must now be orientated at a new and emerging market that is, perhaps, far less volatile than Iraq was.</P>
    <P>To that extent I find it extraordinary that of all the Central European countries we have chosen to open an embassy in, we chose the poorest, the most chaotic and the most non-commercially attractive from our point of view.  Maybe we chose Warsaw because of a certain affection to Lech Walesa and because of the origins of the current occupant of the Vatican.  However, it does not make sense from a commercial-marketing point of view to have an embassy in Warsaw, a country which in marked contrast to either Czechoslovakia or Hungary, is perhaps the most far behind of the three Central European countries in terms of their eligibility to apply for full membership of the European Community. Perhaps the Minister could indicate on Second Stage or on Committee Stage &mdash; whichever is appropriate &mdash; if <Col N="2417" /> there has been a recognition within the Department of Finance of the consequences of our participating in this kind of financial institution with the downstream potential for contracts.  Perhaps he would tell us, too, what matching and co-ordination there will be between the Department of Industry and Commerce on the one hand and the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Foreign Affairs on the other.  If we are not on the pitch or around the territory seeking the sort of contracts and the sort of work that is capable of being put together, either in joint ventures or in all the various ways in which this work can be assembled, we will not maximise the potential that is open to us and to which we are entitled.</P>
    <P>Unlike many people I do not regard the opening up of Central and Eastern Europe as a threat to the western periphery of what is the present constitution of the European Community.  Now that other major European countries, particularly Germany, formerly the German Democratic Republic &mdash; have their own highly under-developed peripheral region &mdash; they will be, perhaps, more sympathetic to the problems of structural imbalances and cohesion than they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>For those reasons there are conclusions to be drawn from the establishment of this bank that do not necessarily impact directly on the text of the Bill in question and do not necessarily enable this House to move specific or relevant amendments. It is germane to the fact that the House is being asked to make funds available, albeit the relatively small sum which has been referred to already, but these funds can and should be maximised.  We should apply to them all the attention and all the combined focus that makes commercial good sense.  With those few words I welcome this Bill and I hope the bank will be established and be in operation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>By way of a postscript the text of the Bill states that the bank will come into operation on 31 March 1991, subject to ratification by all of the signatories to the original agreement.  Perhaps the Minister would, in this reply, indicate how many <Col N="2418" /> countries are outstanding in their ratification of this legislation and if the deadline of 31 March 1991 will be adhered to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party fully support the creation of a pan-European multi-national institution to promote the economic regeneration of Eastern Europe and which encourages increased trade on mutually beneficial terms.  We see the proposed European Bank for reconstruction and development as only one instrument to deal adequately with the magnitude of problems which may be summarised as obsolete energy &mdash; intensive industrial base &mdash; weak agriculture, heavily polluted environment, antiquated infrastructure and inertia in public administration.</P>
      <P>This is not to suggest, as a number of other speakers have remarked, that the requirements are the same throughout Central and Eastern Europe.  The countries concerned are at different stages of development and have different historical backgrounds.  No meaningful comparison can be drawn between the relatively sound and modern economy of, say, Czechoslovakia and the appalling legacy of the dictatorship in Romania where, as Deputy Noonan referred, the treatment of children in orphanages is a total betrayal of the humanitarian ethos of socialism.</P>
      <P>Therefore a balanced perspective on the region's prospects must not only recognise the disadvantages but also acknowledge the varying strengths: a literate workforce with a long industrial tradition, a rich physical resource base, strong cultural traditions and heritage and generally good networks of social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly there is a vital need for a European Bank to provide equity through laons, at concessional rates, or grants as part of an integrated strategy which would complement the intrinsic strengths and advantages already present.  The general principles on which economic or technical assistance should be given, in so far as is possible, ought to be based on co-operation and mutual respect between countries and not <Col N="2419" /> become predatory or exploitative.  Therefore the new bank should be a catalyst for a dynamic economic renewal process but one which will confer benefits on the many rather than the few, and which underpins genuinely democratic political institutions.</P>
    <P>An examination of the schedule to the Bill gives rise to serious questions as to whether the proposed EBRD will be the antithesis of the model of development bank I have described above.  This would be a tragedy because here we have the first opportunity to create a post-cold war forum which could forge a partnership between East and West, and possibly lay foundations for future institutions of a genuinely pan-European nature.</P>
    <P>Instead we are presented &mdash; as Deputy Quinn remarked &mdash; a <i>fait accomplit,</i> an institution which may do little in the direction intended but which may facilitate the economic annexation of Eastern Europe by the dominant interests of corporate finance in the West.  The new bank may very probably replicate on a wider scale the recent take-over of the East German economy by its Western &lsquo;Big Brother&rsquo; through the Bundesbank.</P>
    <P>It is already apparent that the new and emerging leaderships in Eastern Europe not only view the prospect of embracing rampant free enterprise through rose-tinted spectacles but their enthusiasm for the new nirvana is often positively naive.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that giant economies like Japan and Germany view the peoples of Eastern Europe as a potential major new market and investment opportunity.  It is not clear to me that the principle of mutuality features very prominently, if at all.  I would refer the House to an article in last Friday's issue of <i>The Guardian</i> on this general subject which concluded that the probability was that Germany would supply this vast new market with the machine tools for regeneration and that Japan would supply the consumer goods to what will be a vast new market.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the terms used in the Bill reveal that the motives of the main promoters are more concerned with market <Col N="2420" /> penetration, consumerism and commercialism than with social equity or democratic empowerment of working people in Poland, Hungary and so on. Terms like &ldquo;privatisation, market orientated economies, underwriting share issues&rdquo; and so on are prevalent throughout the Schedule to the Bill.  Where are the reference which acknowledge that there will be human casualties of the transition and that there is a need to manage that transition with a social dimension?</P>
    <P>Are we really asking the people of Eastern Europe to exchange the failure of the command economy for the anarchy of the unregulated market?  To illustrate why the fears I raise are real I should like to quote from an exceptionally frank address by a director designate of the new bank, Mr. Paul Krukowski in Dublin on 29 November last he stated:</P>
    <P>As the bank will not provide concessionary funds; the EBRD will support only those operations which will ultimately be able to turn in a profit and reflect a true example of a private enterprise operating in a market economy.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The bank shall charge, in addition to interest, a commission on loans made or participated in as part of its ordinary operations.</P>
    <P>It seems that this is tantamount to usury, adding further to the already huge debt burden of the countries concerned.  Hungary's debt is already 60 per cent of gross national product while that of Poland is about 56 per cent.  We should seek to avoid the danger of the loans of today becoming the crippling debts of tomorrow and imposing upon the people of these countries the kind of difficulties our own economy has had to struggle with because of the extent of our national debt.</P>
    <P>We can already see the dangers in Eastern European countries of the headlong rush to embrace the unfettered free market as they flee from the manifest failures of the command economy.  This is probably most evident in the case of <Col N="2421" /> Poland.  About a year ago Poland's Solidarity Government adopted the capitalist shock treatment prescribed by the Harvard economist Jeoffrey Sachs who has been described by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> as the &ldquo;Indiana Jones of economics&rdquo;. Sachs has persuaded Poland's leaders to gamble their country's future on one gigantic dose of free market medicine. Sachs holds out the prospect of what he calls a &ldquo;Slavic Sweden&rdquo; but which many others, including Jon Wiener, for example, has described as a &ldquo;bleak Baltic Bolivia&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the January 1990 issue of <i>The Economist</i> Sachs is quoted as regretting &ldquo;any lingering ideas about a third way between Soviet style command economies and American style capitalism&rdquo;.  He said that Poland must not experiment with democratic controls, public ownership, market socialism, co-operatives or worker self-management; the country is to establish a market economy in a single year by abolishing price controls and subsidies, balancing the budget, making the currency fully convertible and introducing tough limits on wages &mdash; in short, freedom for the owners for the free market and direct controls on the workers.  The Sachs plan has succeeded in slashing the Poles standard of living.  According to <i>Business Week,</i> since January last year Poles have suffered a 40 per cent drop in real wages.  According to the <i>Financial Times</i> smallholders &ldquo;may have seen their living standards halved&rdquo; and, according to <i>The Economist,</i> Poland is now experiencing a far deeper than expected recession.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development should become the stimulus towards humanitarian co-operation between East and West, which is so profoundly desired by ordinary people on both sides.  I am afraid that the conditionalities being imposed by the EBRD as preconditions to making loans are tantamount to political interference in the internal affairs of these countries.  I do not recall such stringent conditions being legislated for when Portugal, Spain and <Col N="2422" /> Greece woke from the dark light of Fascism. Rather we were quick to clasp them in the full embrace of membership of the Community.  Is there resistance to the prospect of Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia becoming members of the Community?  A country such as Czechoslovakia, for example, is in better shape to rapidly meet its Community obligations than were either Portugal or Greece.  I enthusiastically support the creation of a properly structured development bank.  I do not wish to see that objective being eroded in favour of creating a vehicle which can do little more than open up new markets for the more powerful economies and new investment opportunities for these same economies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said in his contribution that the optimism of last year was beginning to fade and referred to what he called the disturbing events under way in the Soviet Union.  As he rightly said, we ought to use the opportunity of this debate to record our views on those cataclysmic events and in doing so to remind ourselves that were it not for the courageous leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev we would not be considering these matters at all.  The Workers' Party have enthusiastically supported from the beginning the campaign for perestroika and glasnost.  I now view with some alarm the emerging new consensus which is seeking to suggest that their original view of Gorbachev and his reforms was mistaken. The Gorbachev reforms are being sabotaged.  Rather than joining in the incipient chorus of criticism of Gorbachev, we should use whatever small influence we have to maintain the pace and direction of the reforms which are under way.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote briefly from an article by Eric Foner in the 24 December 1990 issue of <i>The Nation</i> entitled, &ldquo;The Romance of the Market&rdquo;.  I make the point in reference to the historical point that Deputy Quinn referred to in terms of the evolution of the Soviet Union and its implications for where we are today. This author makes the point in this way:</P>
    <P>Ironically, the romance of the <Col N="2423" /> market arises as much from the successes of Soviet socialism as from its all-too-apparent failures.  Karl Marx expected capitalism to give birth to its gravedigger &mdash; an exploited, class-conscious proletariat.  In fact, socialism has sown its own seeds of discontent by wrenching the USSR, at tremendous cost, from backwardness to modernity and by creating, almost from nothing, a vast class of professionals, intellectuals and white-collar workers.</P>
    <P>These academics, journalists, artists, scientists and managers stand at the cutting edge of demands for economic change.  Unlike their counterparts of an earlier generation, who measured in their own lives how far the Soviet Union had travelled from the widespread illiteracy and social misery of czarist days, this generation compares its conditions of life with the contemporary West.  Thanks to glasnost, thousands of them have travelled abroad for the first time.  And coupled with the crisis of the Soviet economy, their encounter with the Western standard of living has been a shattering experience.  To remind such persons that not all Americans share in capitalism's bounty is beside the point. They are interested in their own equivalents overseas, not the plight of the poor or the homeless.</P>
    <P>That about sums up that it is quite proper that we should play our part in contributing to the creation of a vehicle that facilitates the regeneration of the economics in Eastern Europe countries.  It would be misleading to give the impression that because these countries are in the process of embracing a mixed economy all their troubles are over.  We know by pointing to our own historical and economic experience that that is not going to be the case.  We know by looking at some of the major capitalist economies in the West that that is not going to be the case.  If one has a look, for example, at last Sunday's <i>Observer</i> which featured a man sleeping under the snow in London <Col N="2424" />&mdash; one of a thousand, we are told &mdash; we know that is not going to be the case.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Cullimore in the House. He was a member of a recent deputation to visit the House of Commons as members of the Committee of Public Accounts when a report was submitted to our opposite numbers there to show that there are 70,000 such homeless people in the Britain that Thatcher created.  That is the balance we need to take into account.  There seems to be no regard in this measure to the fact that there will be need for a safety net, that there will be casualties of the transition and that that transition needs to be managed with a social dimension.  I accept that this is only one instrument in that process and that it seeks to do no more than it states, but it is important that that balancing point be made.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in underlining the point made by Deputy Quinn concerning whether the principle of <i>juste retour</i> operates in respect of our contribution; in other words, whether there is any proportionality in terms of the contribution we are making as regards the possibilities for technical consultancies or whatever that we would have in this country. Ultimately the best possible economic assistance which can be given is one which encourages increased trade on mutually beneficial terms.</P>
    <P>We have already seen an excellent example of this through the Aer Rianta-Aeroflot link up on the duty free activities in the Soviet Union.  That provided a practical example of how co-operation can lead to improved exports for Ireland, an exchange of expertise and at the same time assist in the development of effective international enterprise in the Soviet Union.  In that regard we should perhaps seek to expand the role of Shannon Airport as a gateway for further economic and trade links with the Soviet Union, particularly at a time when there is increasing pressure by the major European and US airlines to by-pass Shannon on the transatlantic routes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the House has the opportunity of debating this Bill <Col N="2425" /> because the ramifications of what we are providing for are far wider than any system of aid or assistance that we have debated here.  I hope the world community, and indeed ourselves in the European Community, will look on this measure as being in a sense a headline for things that should be done elsewhere. It is not in any sense to take away from the importance of this Bill that I observe it is a great pity we have not had the same systematic approach to dealing with the general issues of Third World development as is now being taken by the European Community in setting up this bank. There has been a coherence and a purpose about the action that is being taken here that we could very well import into the way we go about the other issues of Third World development which tend to be pushed to the backburner and the back of people's minds, which I regret.</P>
      <P>One commentator, Paul McCracken, an American economist who has been involved in drawing up plans for the economic transition to be carried out in Hungary, described what is happening in the following terms:</P>
      <P>The countries of what we here in America have traditionally called Eastern Europe are engaged in an effort of absolutely cosmic proportions.  One searches the annals of history for an era of comparable significance.  The Congress of Vienna in 1815 would perhaps come to mind, but what we see taking shape today is of vastly greater portent than that structuring of Europe that took place now almost two centuries ago.</P>
      <P>That expresses very well what we are facing and what the people of Eastern Europe are facing.  It puts in a nutshell the importance of our approach to the setting up of this bank and to the way it goes about its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity recently to read an interview with the man who is going to be President of this European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Jacques Attali.  In the course of that interview he set out his objectives.  When <Col N="2426" /> pressed to list his priorities he listed agriculture, housing, communications, energy, tourism and development of chemical industries as among the most important.  He also prioritises education and training through both western institutions and the bank's own training projects.  There is an element in that which I would like to come back to in a moment, that is Mr. Attali's insistence on the importance of training, which was not mentioned in the Minister's speech. I know the Minister cannot mention everything but that seems to be left out of his list.  It is an area that deserves a good deal more attention than it seems to have got up to now.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly pointed out that the planning and structuring of this bank is based on a commitment by the countries that have set it up and on their perception of a commitment in the countries that will benefit to the development of democratic structures and market economies, and it is perfectly right that that should be so.  I find it difficult to understand Deputy Rabbitte's hesitations about that.  If I understood the Deputy correctly a moment ago, he seemed to be asking why should we impose conditions like this on the countries of Eastern Europe and why did we not impose similar conditions on Spain and Portugal when they came out of their night of totalitarianism and joined the European Community.  The answer to that is, of course, perfectly simple.  At the time Spain and Portugal joined the European Community we did not need to make those specifications because they had already converted themselves into functioning parliamentary democracies with functioning market systems regulated by more or less free formation of prices.  That is not to say, of course &mdash; and I say this for Deputy Rabbitte's comfort if for nothing else &mdash; that the Community did not play an important part in bringing that about; indeed it did.  My own colleague and former leader of my party, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, as President of the Council of Foreign Ministers, played a central role in the efforts of the European Community to help Portugal, <Col N="2427" /> for example, to come out of the night of fascism it had suffered and to come into the family of true parliamentary democracies.</P>
    <P>Indeed the European Community in the past &mdash; and in relation to Western European countries &mdash; has played its role in making sure that true parliamentary democracy and free markets can emerge and it is perfectly proper that the European Community, with all the other countries involved in the enterprise of setting up this bank, should make those specifications in relation to the economies of Western Europe.  In insisting that this aid should be tied into democratic structures of parliamentary democracies, with freely functioning market systems, that is not to say that those countries still do not have a wide range of choice as to how they manage their economies or enjoy their democratic systems.</P>
    <P>I have no reason whatever &mdash; nor has anybody else &mdash; to suspect or to fear that there will be any less variety in mature parliamentary democracies with free market systems in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe or indeed elsewhere in the free and democratic world.  I do not see anything particularly constraining in the manner of enjoying democracy or in managing their economies for the countries which will be the beneficiaries of the kind of programmes which this bank is intended to support.  Of course, the move in that direction, which most of those countries started of their own volition, will involve those countries in enormous changes.  Very few of us have come to the realisation of just how great those changes will be.  The Minister touched on this during the course of his speech and he pointed out some of the more inconvenient consequences which we can foresee in the short term.  He talked about the danger that, during the process of economic reforms, output in these countries would stagnate or decline in the short term.  That is a definite danger.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to talk of other difficulties which will be caused, for <Col N="2428" /> example, by the elimination of widespread consumer subsidies with only partial compensation for consumers.  He went on to say: &ldquo;There is also a distinct risk of mounting inflation&rdquo;.  That is probably one of the understatements of this debate; there is not just a distinct risk of mounting inflation, there is the certainty that those countries will pass through a period of rapid and very severe inflation. Indeed, in some of them, not only will they pass through a period of rapid and severe inflation, they will have that kind of inflation while they are in the middle of a monetary reform, which most of them will have to go through.  The market economy needs free formation of prices to get from where those countries are now, basically command economies, to the free formation of prices; it is a fundamental change in the nature of the economy and in the way it works.</P>
    <P>We should bear something else in mind &mdash; the Minister touched on it &mdash; in listing the problems which we can expect.  He said that the early indications are that the authorities in these countries generally understand the importance of the kind of change that will happen but that they will have to withstand the pressures as people's expectations are not being realised quickly.  That must be the second understatement of the debate because we can already see just what that means in practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn spoke earlier about Poland and in that country we have seen a case before our very eyes of a country which has gone through very substantial changes, where people have suffered a great deal as a result of those changes, have had to strive to bring them about but are now saying &mdash; and have been saying for the last year &mdash;&ldquo;What has been the point of it all so far, we are still not any better off than we were under the old regime&rdquo;?  People's expectations will not be realised very quickly and we should bear that in mind when we are designing programmes to assist those countries in the transformations which they must make.</P>
    <P>We have seen in Poland, but more of it will be seen in Romania and probably <Col N="2429" /> in Yugoslavia, the rising sense of fury among the people of those countries as they see just how &mdash; and to whose benefit &mdash; they were exploited for so long. Talking, as I have, to Christian Democrat colleagues from those countries, I have found over the last year or 18 months that there has been a mounting anger as, with access to records and files of what previous Governments did, they have found out more and more about the exploitation, corruption and cynicisms of the Governments that were in office before.  They found out why it was unnecessary for people to suffer &mdash; as they did &mdash; in many of those countries. There was deprivation and discrimination of all kinds, all to no useful purpose and to the profit of very few people.</P>
    <P>It has been widely remarked &mdash; it is no harm to record the lesson &mdash; that although the capitalist economic system is frequently criticised for corruption, and we all enjoy the scandals from time to time, the payola deals and the kickbacks, all the evidence from the recent history of Eastern Europe points to the fact that if scandals of that kind can proliferate in a capitalist system, in a command economy they thrive and flourish, and there is one of them to be found in almost every single deal done somewhere along the line; it is an inevitable concomitant of that kind of system because, where economic decisions are made by individuals rather than markets it is always in the individual's interest, somewhere along the line, to try to make a bit out of it for himself.  Indeed, a great many of the inefficiencies of the command economy arise from the fact that the rigid structure encourages inefficiency, stultification and corruption.  It may indeed be one of the uncovenanted benefits for the people of the countries of Eastern Europe that this kind of development will get them out of the clutches of people who, for years, have been exploiting them and ripping them off in the way that a command economy allows them to do.</P>
    <P>There will be a need in many of those countries for major currency reform. <Col N="2430" /> Quite a number of them have a very big currency overhang &mdash; that is what it is called these days apparently in the jargon &mdash; and it results in the very simple fact that, even if people are low paid, in economies where there is not a substantial and a continuing supply of goods and services, they sometimes have more money than they can spend.  Although they have needs and wants which they cannot fulfil they simply cannot get their hands on the commodities they need and they build up large savings.  That happened in the Soviet Union, for example, and that currency overhang, that big mass of savings waiting there ready to be unleashed on the market will be &mdash; indeed is &mdash; a major headache for the people who are trying to reform the economy of the Soviet Union. The approach they took to it recently does not seem to be the best one.  It is totally different from the approach taken in Germany in 1948, for example, when 100 old Deutsche Marks were converted into one new Deutsche Mark.  I accept that it was a bit more complicated than that but that was a measure which soaked up, without causing huge inflation, much of the latent demand in the economy and allowed a market to begin to operate with prices that actually meant something.</P>
    <P>During the past few months I spoke to a Polish Minister about the process to make Poland's currency convertible as part of their drive to marketise their economy &mdash; another jargon word we have imported into economics.  As part of marketising their economy they will eventually have to think about full convertibility for their currency.  He said to me that they were almost at their wits end, to know how to do it, that they had prices which were not really prices because they were managed and administered and a currency which was not really a currency. In many ways many of those countries almost have to invent the wheel from basics and invent and construct a new economic system.  Of course, the needs vary from one country to another.  Poland has already begun the process and it is probably fair to say that of all the countries of Eastern Europe Hungary is probably the furthest along the road to <Col N="2431" /> marketisation followed, perhaps, by Czechoslovakia.  If we look at the Soviet Union, and all the Republics within it, we will see that they are a long way away from marketisation or having a currency which can really be called a currency.</P>
    <P>The question which needs to be addressed &mdash; the proposal before us addresses it in the correct way &mdash; is whether we should go about this process of developing market economies in Eastern Europe gradually or whether we should adopt what economists call &mdash; this is another term they have imported from astronomy &mdash; the big bang theory.  The gradualist process is one which frequently commends itself to people.  It commends itself to economists because they can observe the changes, it commends itself to politicians because it means they can change their minds if it looks like it is not going the right way but it is almost always the wrong way to do it.</P>
    <P>It was expressed very neatly to me in January last year, again in a discussion with some Polish Christian Democrats, when they said they have to change their system, they have to move from being a command economy with prices which are not really prices and a currency which is not really a currency and convert to a market economy.  They said they had thought about it long and hard and had come to the conclusion that they must do it all of a piece.  They gave an example of the way they thought about it.  They said that if one decides to start to drive on the other side of the road from where people drive one cannot just start with the buses, everything would have to change at the same time or else it would be more chaotic.  That is very true of the economic system, one cannot just start with the economic buses and have some bits of the economy working in a market system with the other bits working in a command system.  Either the whole economy works in one way or it does not.  The approach which seems to underlie the Bill before us and the objectives of the bank is the correct one.  It is that even though the process of marketising these economies and making their currencies convertible <Col N="2432" /> is fraught with difficulties, and is going to cause enormous problems which will have to be resolved, it should all be done as quickly as possible or otherwise there is the danger that it will not be done at all.</P>
    <P>If we adopt a gradualist approach to this there will be so many reasons at all stages during the process for changing our minds that it will not work.  Indeed, McCracken, whom I quoted earlier on, made a very pithy comment on this and I quote:</P>
    <P>On this issue of moving quickly to dismantle controls or trying to move more slowly, one prediction can confidently be made.  Whichever strategy the country follows, it will probably conclude later that it must have been the wrong choice.</P>
    <P>That is something we will face.  It is inevitable when one makes so many changes in an economy that there will be losers and gainers but people will question the whole process.</P>
    <P>We have to get hold firmly of the idea and it is there before us for all to see beyond any doubt &mdash; what has happened during the past two years in Eastern Europe and everything we have now found out about what was going on there for 50 years before that proves it &mdash; that if there is to be an efficient economy which serves people it has got to be a market economy, that there has to be free formation of prices and it should, if they have any sense be run with a parliamentary democracy.  It is important to bear in mind the need to keep the parliamentary democracy as far away from day to day decisions about the economy as one can as there is always the temptation, which we give in to in the west, even in the home of free enterprise, the United States, when a problem comes up to say that the Government must do something about it.  We have a proliferation of Government agencies of various kinds who are working away earnestly and solemnly with most of them achieving very little for the economy they are serving.  That is something the countries <Col N="2433" /> of Eastern Europe, and this bank in particular, must avoid.</P>
    <P>The other point which needs to be looked at very carefully and which should be built into the operations of the bank &mdash; this may seem today to be a far-fetched concern but it is not all far-fetched &mdash; is that these economies as they marketise themselves should look for export markets. There is always the danger, and it is the safe thing to do in the short term &mdash; we did it ourselves here for too long before we found out how wrong be were &mdash; that we will say what we must do is produce import substitutes.  The old doctrine says that import substitution is just as good as exports which is nonsense but that is not the issue before us today.  It is tempting to say that we should produce imitations of what we import to displace imports.  That is folly.  We did it here for a long time and we ended up with a whole bunch of industries which were grossly inefficient and we had to rationalise them afterwards.</P>
    <P>The economies of Eastern Europe should avoid that temptation.  They should look at the experience of economies such as Taiwan and the Republic of Korea which marketised themselves over a very short period of time on the basis of deciding that they were going to get into export markets.  They have lived by exporting and they have done it very successfully.  They have been great innovators, another area which will need attention in Eastern Europe.  These countries need to go for exports because if they are to produce efficient economies at home which can serve their people then by definition they must be competitive economies.  If they are forced to go for exports, if they deliberately take that choice, and accommodate themselves to being able to export successfully then by definition they are going to be efficient economies at home which can serve their people well.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest needs in Eastern Europe and the president of the bank, whom I quoted earlier, has identified this, is for training in a whole range of management skills because people must learn to manage.  Managing a business, indeed <Col N="2434" /> managing an economy, in a market system is very different from managing a business in a command economy.  I remember a good many years ago now as a student reading about the development of economic policy and theory in the Soviet Union in the thirties and on into the fifties.  I cannot recall the name of the author but I was very struck by one example he gave of the difference between management in a command economy and management in a market economy.  He gave the example of a nail factory.</P>
    <P>There was a great fashion for many years in the Soviet Union of setting quotas not only for whole industrial sectors but they went to the trouble of setting out quotas for individual firms, and some of that still goes on.  A manager of a nail factory who had begun to feel he knew something about making nails and making better nails and doing a little market research to find out what type of nails people wanted, tried to tell the commissars what he had found out and that he believed he should be making a few different varieties of nails.  They said to him, &ldquo;No, your quota is X thousand tonnes of nails for this year, that is all we are interested in&rdquo;.  He became so frustrated that one year he produced his whole quota in the form of one gigantic nail that weighed the number of thousands of tonnes set out in his quota.  He was fired for his pains but he made a very eloquent protest against the nonsense of a command economy and illustrated very neatly how it takes management totally away from any concept and understanding of what the market might need.</P>
    <P>We are now dealing in all those countries in Eastern Europe, the three Baltic Republics, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and less so in Hungary than in the others.  We are dealing with generations of managers in industry, in services, and even in public administration, who have been used to having their thinking done for them by the bureaucrats, apparatchiks and the central planners and who have very little acquaintance with what is involved in finding out what people need, how much <Col N="2435" /> they are prepared to spend on it, what varieties of products they want and how to package products to get them to the consumer.  They know very little of that but if they are going to make a successful transition from the command economies to the market economies they are going to have to find out, and the quicker they find out the better.</P>
    <P>Are there ways that this bank, for example, can help in that?  This is where I come to my question about the Minister. The Minister in enunciating what the bank is to do indicated priority areas.  He gave a whole list of the various things the bank will do.  It will provide loans, guarantees, and technical assistance, make equity capital investments and underwrite the issues of securities.  The bank's assistance will be directed towards specific projects,.  That is all very useful. The bank, however, will be able to assist the State sector for certain purposes, such as infrastructure.  I wonder what is meant by that.  However, nowhere in the Minister's speech do I find any reference to education or training in any shape, yet the president of the bank has said he will give priority to education and training. This is essential.</P>
    <P>It is being remarked, for example, that West German industry is now finding it difficult to fill vacancies in middle management and even in senior management because good managers from what used to be West Germany are finding they can make good careers for themselves in business, often on their own account, in what used to be East Germany, because they are used to living in a competitive economy.  As the old seanfhocal has it, even a moderate middle manager can go from what was West Germany into what was East Germany and find that in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king.  He knows more about management than they do and he will command a premium and get himself a corner in some piece of the market.  Indeed, it is desirable that it be so.  The more rapidly we can extend and expand management skills to the Eastern European countries <Col N="2436" /> the more easily they will be able to make the transition they need to make.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested &mdash; and is probably worth thinking about &mdash; that there may be a way in which the Western countries and managers from Western countries could help without causing great dislocation to their own economies. There is an enormous pool of experience and talent among people who have recently retired from business at the retirement age in the West of 65 and there may be many people in that category who would like at that stage of their lives to involve themselves for a few years in the adventure &mdash; and it is an adventure &mdash; of bringing Eastern Europe into the world market economy.  There might be a way in the Western countries in which we can make a special and very useful contribution to accelerating the development of those countries and &mdash; who knows? &mdash; make the operation of this European Bank for Reconstruction and Development more fruitful.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister when replying to the debate to address this issue of education in management training and so on.  I believe that is going to be a crucial area.  It may be that with the move towards a market economy we will see a sudden flowering of entrepreneurial ability in Eastern Europe.  We should never rule it out, and the experience with limited reforms that have been carried out in all the command economies has been that a certain level of enterpreneurship reveals itself once controls are relaxed. That has been found in agriculture in China, for example, where the relaxation of the previously very rigid system has allowed the beginning of a private sector in agriculture to emerge in China.  From the literature to which I have access that seems to be &mdash; although the government do not like to admit it &mdash; by far the most productive part of Chinese agriculture. There have been much more limited attempts to get external private partnership involved in industry in China and again it seems from all the literature on the subject that that is the most productive part of Chinese industry.</P>
    <P>The same is true in the Soviet Union. <Col N="2437" /> We see the newsreel photographs of empty shops in Moscow and elsewhere and side by side with them are flourishing markets where there appears to be an abundance of products, much more expensive, mind you, but people seem to be able to respond to that stimulus of the market.  However, I do not think those economies can rely only on that kind of native ingenuity or inborn entrepreneurship of that kind to make the really big transition they have to make from command economies to living in the market system.  Therefore, I hope there will be a very definite focus in this bank's activity on developing management skills for the economies of Eastern Europe because without those management skills a great deal of the money we are going to spend and they are going to spend themselves is going to be wasted.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I should remark in passing that, while we may congratulate ourselves on the level of funding that has been made available through this European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, let us not forget that the main investment, however much assistance they get from outside, is going to be made by the people of those countries themselves.  They are going to make the principal financial investment and the principal intellectual investment and they are going to invest their own labour in these changes.  Let us not get carried away with the idea that we are going to steer the whole thing.  They are going to do most of the work, but we must make sure in assisting them that we assist them to acquire the skills that will make that work most effective and produce the best results in terms of developing their economies.</P>
    <P>There is a question as to how we should go about giving assistance to those economies and a number of issues arise in that connection.  I start with one which has to do with community effort and efficiency.</P>
    <P>I intend, if I may, to quote a passage from an article written in a Christian Democratic journal in the Soviet Union by one Viktor Aksyuchits, who is a Christian Democratic Deputy in the Parliament of the Russian Federation.  He <Col N="2438" /> asks the question: what can the West do to help Gorbachev and the perestroika process?  He gives his answer, and I quote:</P>
    <P>In the first place, any help it gives must not be directed solely through the central government.  For it is primarily in the form of the central government that the Communist regime continues to exist, and everything that falls into its hands is used in the end for the internal or external expansion of the regime.  At best &mdash; and this was always the case &mdash; the departments of the central government just squander any credits they receive in a completely uncontrolled way.  Any help from the West, be it cultural, political or economic, would be at its most productive if it avoids the central government and comes into the country via the following routes:&mdash; directly to democratic parliaments and governments in the republics and cities; through the private, joint stock and co-operative sector in support of the programme to privatise the economy;...</P>
    <P>Those are the two principal examples. He continues to say, again in relation to the effective use of resources and I quote:</P>
    <P>Any credits will be at their most effective if they are mostly directed towards privatisation programmes which have been worked out by economists...</P>
    <P>&mdash; some of whom he names&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>...Conditions where credit can be offered should include the privatisation of the economy, land and housing stock of the USSR.  Credits can be made available through already existing and newly-formed commercial joint-stock, co-operative and private banks.  Credits for the privatisation of agriculture will have the greatest and most rapid effect, through agricultural commercial banks, which will finance co-operative and joint-stock farming initiatives.</P>
    <P>He adds the thought &mdash; and this is an <Col N="2439" /> interesting sidelight on the whole business:</P>
    <P>The economic effect of such a programme would help to reduce social tensions in our country.</P>
    <P>&mdash;an area we have not really look at as yet in this debate.  That is a view from inside the Soviet Union, from a democratically elected parliamentarian &mdash; I am happy to say of a Christian Democrat party so that they are moving in the right direction in that regard also &mdash; as to what is required, how assistance should be made available and channelled.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the President of the Bank for European Reconstruction and Development, Mr. Jacques Attali, seems to have that kind of idea very much in mind. He speaks about the need to develop a banking sector.  I quote from the interview with him in an article entitled &ldquo;Banker for Eastern Europe&rdquo; published in <i>World Link,</i> No. 1, 1991 as follows:</P>
    <P>To have a really sound market you need banking and financial institutions and solid property laws such as those existing in the West.  You need central banks, stock market regulations, legislation governing financial operations and fundamental accounting and control systems.</P>
    <P>It seems self-evident that all of those things should be part of a market economy. But I would like to know if, in the provisions of this Bill and the Agreement setting up this European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, there is going to be any focus on the development of a financial sector or sectors in these countries in Eastern Europe because we all know it is impossible for a market economy to work without financial institutions that basically ease the flow of money from savers to those who will invest it and produce goods and services, indeed welfare for the rest of the population.</P>
    <P>The science and art of commercial banking or of merchant banking, as we know them, are almost totally alien to any of the economic operators in Eastern <Col N="2440" /> Europe.  They have banks and, in numbers of cases, substantial operations overseas, that engage in a fairly wide range of transactions, but their head offices are not banks as we know them; they are not dealing with markets as we know them; they are not even dealing with currencies as we know them.  Therefore, the kinds of things we take for granted cannot be found in most of these Eastern European countries.  They have not got people with the skills or experience in banking who will be required if their economies are to become market economies.  They are going to need to develop functioning financial sectors, not exactly necessarily on the lines that we have them &mdash; they do not have to do it the same way we do it &mdash; but their financial sector will have to perform the same kind of function that the financial sector performs in our western economies because, without that, there will not be functioning market economies there and the functioning market economy is the <i>sine qua non</i> of development in those countries.</P>
    <P>There are some political questions needing some attention in the context of this discussion.  In the course of his remarks the Minister drew attention to the particular understanding there is in relation to the role of the Soviet Union in this new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  There has been an agreement that, for a period, the USSR will not take more out of the bank than they put into it; that is subject to review.  I would have to ask the question: should they be involved at all?  I do not pose that question just to be mischievous, far from it.  The Minister has his reservations, or there are questions in his mind about this.  He has enumerated for us all the things this bank will do, but he says:</P>
    <P>The objective of the bank is to promote private and entrepreneurial activity in those Central and Eastern European countries which are committed to multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics and to foster their transition towards open market-oriented economies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2441" /> Speaking of the different positions of the various countries in Eastern Europe he had said earlier, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The position in the Soviet Union is much more complicated.  This is partly because of its size but recent uncertainties surrounding the extent and the pace of the reform process are also a factor.</P>
    <P>I would have to say that is another one of the under-statements I find in the course of the Minister's remarks, the third I have identified but the first he used.  It is an under-statement to call recent events in the Soviet Union &ldquo;uncertainties surrounding the extent and the pace of the reform process....&rdquo;  In fact, what is happening, in spite of the periodic decisions we get, in spite of the periodic victories of differing kinds, won by Mr. Gorbachev, I do not believe he is in control of the reform process.  I do not believe there is now a coherent, steady, central thrust to that reform process. That is one of the reasons I wonder whether the Soviet Union are really in a position to be regarded as qualifying for assistance from this bank.  I wish they were.  I would be delighted to see a settled and coherent reform programme being pushed through.  But everywhere one looks one finds uncertainty; one finds either an inability or an unwillingness to face the real problems that need to be faced.  I suppose none of us in this House has a comprehensive knowledge of these things but we can begin to see what is happening if we look at the vast torrent of literature emanating from the Soviet Union, written by people inside and by observers outside.  Look at agriculture: no decision has been taken about what form of land tenure will exist under a new reformed market system in the Soviet Union.  It will be a very difficult decision, but no decision has been made.  True, attempts have been made and a number of different formulae have been tried, but there is no clear idea where they are going.  It will be extremely difficult, in fact impossible, to get on with the business of making Soviet agriculture more productive unless there is some clear idea on <Col N="2442" /> how land is to be owned or how it is to be held.</P>
    <P>Look at the service sector.  In the last four years there have probably been about 20 different laws adopted to deal with the way some element of private enterprise will be allowed in the service sector.  What typically happens is that the bureaucrats see that somebody has found a way of operating an enterprise and suddenly they find this kind of activity is making a profit.  Profit is anti-socialist; it should not be allowed.  That is still their culture.  So what they do is try to find a new way, a new tax system or some new regulation, that will take the profit out of the business so that particular business folds up.  Such is human ingenuity that somebody else gets involved in a different enterprise on a semi-private basis and again starts to make a profit.</P>
    <P>There have been umpteen different tax laws in the last four years to deal with situations where people are running what are in fact private businesses and making profits.  The system still has not said to itself, &ldquo;yes, we agree that people should be allowed own the means of production and be allowed make profits to remunerate the means of production&rdquo;, and until they say that, we will not see any fundamental reform of their economic system, just as we will not see any fundamental reform in Soviet agriculture until the system acknowledges that it will allow people to own land and make their own enlightened decisions about what they will do with that land.  None of that has been done yet and until it is done there have to be serious question marks not only over the morality of assisting the Soviet Union but over the efficiency with which funding, both Soviet and other funding, is used to try to develop the Soviet economy.</P>
    <P>It is an open secret that Soviet agriculture under-performs grossly because it is so badly organised and it is sticking out a mile for anybody who wants to see it, that both Soviet agriculture and industry could perform a lot better if they were managed in an entrepreneurial way and if they were subjected to real competition from people, from enterprises <Col N="2443" /> both outside and inside their own economy.</P>
    <P>I can see that for a number of political reasons a deal has been done with the USSR about setting up this bank.  I can see all the reasons those who negotiated this deal would say to themselves that even though they may have reservations about what he is doing, even though there is no clarity about Mr. Gorbachev's reform, it is a good thing to help him, that it is a good thing for the western world to be seen to be supporting what he is trying to do so, they should make this kind of deal.  But, there has to be some consideration of whether it will be worthwhile for the people of the Soviet Union to have money spent where there is no clear coherent reform programme. I wonder if the Minister might allow himself to be tempted a little bit into indiscretion, to talk to the House about that, because there is a political issue there and it will not go away simply because we choose to ignore it, or we sit silent because we do not want to make life difficult for Mr. Gorbachev.  We need to make life a good deal easier for Mr. Gorbachev and for all the citizens of the USSR or whichever bit of it they happen to want to belong to at any given moment.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect we should look at in this House.  Is there anywhere in the agreement or in the bank's intention, or in the way it will be directed in going about its business, that gives any importance to environmental considerations? That must be a very important part of our thinking because we have seen that &mdash; and I say this not in any sense to be sanctimonious or smug or to vaunt the superiority of the capitalist system over any other, but as a matter of fact &mdash; over the last 50 years the industrial and agricultural processes in the command economies have raped the environment of these economies.  We may think we have done grave damage to our environment in Western Europe, which we have, but we have been only in the ha'penny place compared to the agricultural and industrial systems that have been <Col N="2444" /> allowed to develop and flourish in Eastern Europe.  One day, and the sooner the better, that process will have to be reversed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we will get some gain from the fact that from here on the development of those economies should be on the basis of our latest technologies and what we now know of the effect of those technologies on our environment.  It may be that we will have a system that allows, for example, the Hungarian steel industry to be modernised so that it will not be the same kind of steel industry that is now badly polluting the rivers, streams and lakes of Hungary.  It may well be that the concern of the western world about the quality of the environment will begin to affect the way motor cars are built in the Soviet Union, or the way they use pesticides and combine fertilisers in agriculture. But, it should be a proper part of our concern when we are designing programmes and approving projects on which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will spend money.  It should be a proper part of our concern to make sure that money is being spent in a way in which, as far as we can make it, will contribute to the process of cleaning up our environment.  Mind you, even that is a vain hope because the best we can do, unless we make fundamental changes in the way we run our economies, is to stop dirtying our environment at the rate we have been doing for the last 40 years.  However, that is a concern that should come into the operations of this bank.</P>
    <P>We have seen example after example of what has happened to the environment under the command economies.  Lake Vaikal for example, is totally dead.  It was once a source of livelihood and perhaps pleasure for a great many people.  We have all seen the pictures of fishing boats in what used to be fairly deep water now lying stranded on salt flats because lakes have dried up.  We hear of cases time and time again.  Only last year a worker at a chemical factory accidentally set fire to several miles of river because on his way home he threw his cigarette butt into the <Col N="2445" /> river which was full of oil.  That kind of thing is commonplace.</P>
    <P>When units of the Soviet army left bases in East Germany they did not want to bring back with them the waste oil in their maintenance workshops.  They simply punched holes in the cans and tanks in which it was stored and let the oil pour into the ground.  I suppose a division of the Soviet army would have a fair amount of waste oil at any given time. That may not happen on a large scale but it is indicative of a lack of thought about the environment that should properly be a concern of ours when considering the kind of projects this bank should support.</P>
    <P>The Minister when replying might give us the benefit of his view, and that of the Community Ministers for Finance, on how soon we can expect to see this bank in operation, how soon we can expect to see projects beginning and when, politically, they expect to see the different countries of Eastern Europe in a position to draw down some of the funds made available.  My feeling is that the day is probably fairly far away for Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.  It is nearest of all, perhaps, for Poland and Czechoslovakia. Of course, East Germany has been taken out of this loop.  I think the Community was wrong to allow eastern Germany to be integrated into the European Community the way that Chancellor Kohl wanted.  I regret to have to say that.  It is not necessarily any criticism of Chancellor Kohl's intentions but we would all have been better off and could be happier about it if it had been done in a way agreed by the European Community, even if at the end of the day that was Chancellor Kohl's way and nobody disagreed.  East Germany has been taken out of the loop of the operation of this project.</P>
    <P>The Minister might give us some idea as to when these things will happen.  I should like to know if he agrees with what I believe to be the sensible approach to marketising these economies.  I should like to know the Minister's view as to the appropriateness of the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; theory.  I hope to hear him say he agrees with it and that gradualism and taking <Col N="2446" /> things slowly, one step at a time, would be the worst possible way forward for these countries.</P>

      <P>Before I begin my speech proper I feel bound to comment on Deputy Dukes' outrageous suggestion that import substitution is not the answer in Eastern Europe.  I would remind Deputy Dukes, and other Members, that when we had our import substitution in the fifties unemployment was at the rate of 50,000 or 60,000 a year as against the present rate of 250,000.  I suggest that these extraneous matters should not be dealt with in such a superficial way in a debate which has nothing whatever to do with the advantages of exports over import substitution.  It degrades and superficialises a very important subject.</P>

      <P>I must express grave reservations about this Bill.  While it may appear satisfactory on the surface, on further reading it is shown to be full of contradictions.  This country is being asked to contribute almost £7 million to the bank's capital.  We have very little control over how this money will be spent.  Will loans be given to arms manufacturers, perhaps to chemical and biological research centres?  We do not know where this money will go.  The bank is not amenable to democratic control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the bank is very important in restructuring the economies of Eastern Europe which have been decimated by over 40 years of Marxist totalitarian dictatorship.  In that, all Members can agree.  I wonder what will replace the <Col N="2447" /> centralised State economies of Eastern Europe.  Is this bank a stalking horse for the large multinational corporations who are now hungrily looking at vast markets in those countries?  What is surely needed is support for indigenous industry which would be small and labour intensive, at least to start with, rather than capital intensive industries beloved of banks everywhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes rightly referred to the serious environmental and ecological problems which have been caused in Eastern Europe.  We in this House can agree on the severity of these problems. What do we propose to put in their place? It is the consumerism of Western Europe, the McDonald's syndrome, which, perhaps, in a superficial way does not cause the same number of ecological problems which were caused in Eastern Europe by the command economy but they do cause very serious problems with regard to the use of our fossil fuels, the profligate way in which we use energy in western Europe.  It looks as if this is to be replicated in the east, with the many problems caused by it.  We seem to be determined to export the type of growth economics which are clearly unsustainable and are destroying our planet.</P>
    <P>There are some inherent contradictions in the functions of the bank. Article 2 deals with creating a competitive environment and raising productivity, living standards and conditions of labour.  There is nothing here about the quality of life which is essential if the further aim of promoting activities which are environmentally sound and sustainable is to be realised.  This inherent contradiction is not being dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not advert to the question of interest rates.  Deputy Rabbitte mentioned this point.  What interest rates are to be charged by this bank? Does the Minister know?  Perhaps he will tell us in his reply.  Is Eastern Europe to finish up on the same treadmill as the developing countries who are being crucified by debts which they owe to western banks?  Are we to see a similar situation? <Col N="2448" /> I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened by the tone of the debate on this innovative element in the Community's and the wider western world's, assistance to central and Eastern Europe in their path-breaking and painful transition to market economies. Ireland has played her part in the negotiation of the agreement setting up this new institution and we have signed the agreement on behalf of both our country and the Community, of whose Council we were President at the time of this critical period in the modern history of central and eastern Europe.  I should like to stress the necessity for a speedy ratification of the agreement on our part.</P>
      <P>The initiative for this bank came from within the Community.  The Irish Presidency played a constructive and unstinting role in bringing about agreement on the statute of the new bank.  There were times when the negotiations were difficult and this to some degree reflected the innovative nature of the task being undertaken. In the course of achieving agreement among such a broadly-based worldwide grouping of members, some compromises were necessary and the statute of the bank is probably a little different from the seminal idea of late 1989.  The concept matured in the course of the negotiations and the agreement reached bears witness to the willingness of all parties concerned to meet each other half way and augurs well for the future of a Europe based on mutual understanding and reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will comment briefly on some points raised by Deputies in the course of the debate.  While the agreement to set up the bank is clearly welcome I can accept the fears of reversion to the old system which have been expressed in this House by Deputy Noonan and others.  I sincerely hope that progress will continue in Eastern Europe and that where it appears to be faltering it will pick up again.  I would simply remind the House that under the agreement it is possible that the entitlement of any recipient member to the <Col N="2449" /> bank's funds be limited under Article 8 where that member is judged to be implementing policies which are inconsistent with Article 1 of the agreement, and any such limitation would require the support of two-thirds of the governors representing three-quarters of the total voting power. The basis on which any such judgment will be made will also take account of the sentiments expressed in the preamble particularly in regard to human rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte referred to the political conditionality involved for the recipient countries.  These countries themselves were quite happy to accept such conditionality as full members of the bank.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's questions I can say that the agreement was negotiated in the full conference of the 42 participants by officials on behalf of the Government.  Many of the issues involved arose also at the ECOFIN and the General Affairs Council within the Community.  No decision has yet been made on who might be our alternative director.  The Danes will be taking the first directorship and the reason this uncertainty is still there is because no decision has been made as to whether initially there will be a permanent alternate director, a temporary one or part-time one.  We have agreement with the Danes; they asked to take the first directorship and we agreed to it.  Our exposure will be limited initially to the paid in capital and the full call is more by way of guarantee.  The bank's capital is 10 billion ECU of which 3 billion will be paid in, and if they go to the limit of the 10 billion the remaining 7 billion will be raised on world capital markets.</P>
    <P>On the question of Irish staffing and the possibility of consultancy programmes on behalf of the bank, I would like to tell Deputy Quinn and others that we are actively involved in the interim team in setting up this bank and we will certainly involve all the appropriate Departments and agencies in the question of seeking contracts and such work.  While there will be no formal quota system I can assure the House that we will be pushing Irish <Col N="2450" /> interests vigorously through our members on the interim team.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment here about the supposedly restricted nature of the activities to be undertaken and I would like to deal with it.  The focus of this new institution is on the private sector.  This is clearly because the countries concerned do not have a private sector and are trying to develop one.  I stress that the countries themselves are trying to develop a private sector because they have seen that the centrally planned State system which was foisted on most of them has simply not worked.  The new bank is not purely a development bank; it is a combined merchant and development bank, one of a number of other players in the field.</P>
    <P>The EBRD is not confining its activities purely to the private sector.  Some 40 per cent of its activities can be directed towards the public sector.  There will be other institutions also working in the field, like the European Investment Bank, the Commission which is the coordinator of the assistance coming through the G24 group of donor countries and, of course, the Bretton Woods institutions, namely, the IMF, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation who are also now operating in Central and Eastern Europe.  The World Bank concentrates entirely on the public sector and is not confined to dealing with individual projects as this new bank will be.  The IFC deals also with the private sector.  There is an obligation on the new bank to co-ordinate its activities with these bodies and it is likely that it will undertake a substantial amount of co-financing with the World Bank and the IFC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn fears a sophisticated rip-off.  Indeed, that is a question raised by others as well.  This is always a matter for concern and is being addressed in the overall economic assistance programme to Eastern Europe.  There is an emphasis on creating favourable conditions for investment including investment protection agreements.  The EBRD will also have specialist staff working on the ground in <Col N="2451" /> order to avoid getting involved in any dubious operations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to consessionary finance.  In its ordinary operations the bank will act on a totally commercial basis but, of course, any special funds that come from donors or donor countries can then be treated and used for concessionary finance.  Deputy Rabbitte appeared to want the bank to provide a safety net to underpin the social and human dimension of the transition. The European Community and the G24 group are very much alive to the problems which are arising.  The International Labour Organisation is involved in the work of the G24 group and under the EC PHARE programme there is the possibility of technical assistance aimed at the development of an aggregate social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Dukes' reference to training and technical assistance.  I can accept that I may have understated the possibilities in this area by referring simply to technical assistance.  Within this term the bank expects to include a wide range of technical education and broadly based consultancy work including marketing and so forth.  This is one of our strengths in providing educational facilities, training facilities and everything like that.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the comments raised and I thank the Deputies for contributing to the debate.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Recognition of Foreign Adoptions Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael's recognition <Col N="2453" /> of a Foreign Adoptions Bill which had its First Reading in this House on 30 December last has three principal functions, First, the Bill prescribes for the first time the legal rules applicable to the recognition of adoptions completed outside this country.  Secondly, it places all children adopted outside Ireland whose adoptions are recognised in this State in a position of legal equality to that of children adopted within Ireland. Thirdly, it empowers the Minister for Health by regulation to designate specific registered adoption societies to become directly involved in making arrangements for inter-country adoptions and imposes a duty on health boards to carry out family assessments and to prepare a home study report when requested to do so for the purpose of an inter-country adoption.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Act, 1952, was the first piece of legislation enacted in this State in relation to adoption.  That Act, and subsequent amending legislation incorporated in the Adoption Acts of 1964, 1974, 1976 and 1988 makes provision for the making of adoption orders in Ireland by An Bord Uchtála, the Adoption Board.</P>
      <P>One of the anomalies of our social legislation is that since the foundation of the State no legislation of any nature whatsoever has been enacted stating the circumstances in which a foreign adoption is recognised within the State.  Moreover, there is no detailed reported decision of our courts setting out the circumstances in which a foreign adoption may be recognised. Nevertheless, as the Law Reform Commission state in their report &mdash; LRC Report No. 29 May 1989 &mdash;&ldquo;The Recognition of Foreign Adoption Decrees,&rdquo; some statute law proceeds on the assumption that recognition principles exist, that recent examples are sections 3 and 9 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, which make reference to a person adopted abroad whose adoption is &ldquo;recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can recall Sir, that when those sections were being debated in this House and when I sought to ascertain from the <Col N="2454" /> then Minister for Justice what adoptions were &ldquo;recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in the State&rdquo; he was unable to properly respond.</P>
    <P>In their report the Law Reform Commission state:</P>
    <P>It seems likely the present position is governed by the common law, and that under common law, a foreign adoption is entitled to recognition if the adopting parents were, at the time of the adoption, domiciled in the country where the adoption was effected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The legal position is not, however, in this regard certain.  The need to enact legislation prescribing the circumstances in which we recognise foreign adoptions was first articulated in the report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services published in May 1984.</P>
    <P>In their report for the year 1989 the Adoption Board referring to their receiving &ldquo;a large increase in the number of inquiries from couples wishing to adopt a child from aboard&rdquo; also stated that &ldquo;the Board would welcome new legislation to regulate the adoption of children from foreign countries&rdquo;.  The increase in inquiries to the Adoption Board about foreign adoption derived from the dramatic reduction in the number of children available for adoption within Ireland.</P>
    <P>For example, in the period 1964-84 there was an average of 1,200 adoption orders per annum made by the Adoption Board.  Since 1984 there has been a continuing decrease in the number of orders made, a mere 615 such orders being made in 1989 and fewer than 400 of these being made in favour of married couples who were unrelated to the child being adopted.  Despite the annual increase in the number of children being born outside marriage, which currently totals approximately 11 per cent of our annual births, the number of children born outside wedlock being made available for adoption has considerably reduced as an increasing number of single mothers have decided to care for their children.</P>
    <P>Many adoption societies have closed their doors to new applicants and will not <Col N="2455" /> increase the numbers currently on their waiting lists.  Many of those on such waiting lists may wait years rather than months before a child is placed with them and some find themselves arbitrarily excluded from adoption by age limitations being imposed on couples in respect of the placement of children which have no basis in statute law.</P>
    <P>In an age of greater mobility the adoption by Irish couples of children abroad is not a new thing.  Over the years Irish couples residing in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or on the European mainland, the Unites States or Australia and elsewhere, have adopted in their countries of residence.  Some couples having lived outside Ireland for employment reasons for a number of years, have then returned to this country and have again set up home.  Under our current law adoptions so completed are not recognised.</P>
    <P>Some couples living in this State have over the years adopted children from South America, in countries such as Peru, Chile and Ecuador and from other countries such as Lebanon, India and the Philippines.  Such adoptions are also not recognised in Ireland, even where all of the proper legal procedures prescribed by the law of the country in which the adoption was completed have been followed. The number of such adoptions over the years has been relatively small. I would be surprised if in the ten years up to December 1989 more than 30 such children had been adopted abroad by couples resident in Ireland.  I would expect the number of foreign adoptions in the circumstances earlier referred to of Irish couples residing for some years for employment reasons in a foreign country to be far greater.  It has to be emphasised however, that none of these adoptions is recognised under Irish law.</P>
    <P>The need to enact legislation in this area was dramatically illustrated in the year 1990.  The plight of tens of thousands of children living in horrific conditions in orphanages and institutions in Romania touched the hearts of many people throughout this country and in the rest <Col N="2456" /> of Europe.  It resulted in substantial aid being sent to Romania to improve the conditions in which the children were living and in many couples going to Romania to adopt to provide such children with a new life.  At governmental level this country did not respond at all. It was ordinary people who took the initiative.</P>
    <P>At one level the response was in the voluntary collection of funds to provide food, medical and clothes aid as well as toys.  Throughout Europe lorry-loads of such aid went into Romania based on a naive assumption that if the material things necessary were provided, the plight of these children would immediately considerably improve.  Through hard experience those who provided such aid were to discover that the problems faced by these children were not merely a lack of material things but a major attitudinal problem on the part of the staff involved in such institutions.  It is now well documented how much of the early aid found its way out of such institutions to be sold on what became a thriving Romanian black market.  We heard stories of children being washed and beautifully dressed in new clothes coming from Western Europe only to be found lying naked in their cots the following morning with their clothes, right down to their socks, having been removed by the Romanian staff running the institution for sale on the black market.  Aid workers tell stories of essential medicines being brought into such institutions disappearing overnight &mdash; again for sale on the black market.  Even bars of soap disappeared, so that today bars of soap supplied to such institutions are deliberately scraped with a nail brush or a metal instrument so they look second hand and become unsellable.</P>
    <P>Stories are told of the provision of extra cots or beds from Western Europe at the request of voluntary workers distressed to find four, five or six children put sleeping in a single bed or a single cot at night by the Romanian staff in some of these children's institutions.  The same voluntary workers recount how days after the delivery of extra bedding took place, <Col N="2457" /> the Romanian staff still put large numbers of children in a single bed or a cot at night to minimise their work and reduce the number of wards they had to observe.  Stories are also told about children between the ages of one week and three years being confined to their cots and not allowed to develop ordinary walking skills and never stimulated enough to learn to speak, rarely washed and never fed solid food.  As a result many children born in Romania with no physical or mental disability at the age of three were designated irrecuperables and locked away in institutions for the handicapped.</P>
    <P>It is in this environment that a voluntary organisation &ldquo;The Romanian Orphanage Appeal Ireland&rdquo; came into being, and sought, as did many other similar organisations set up in other European countries, to provide help within Romania for some of the children so affected.  This group formed by people from both the North of Ireland and the Republic have, without any help from Government, in less than a year raised £900,000.  They have become involved in two types of orphanages in Romania and have a longterm commitment to providing a broad range of aid and manpower to these orphanages which includes medical supplies, doctors and nurses.  The orphanages they have adopted are Tirgoviste and Videle.</P>
    <P>Tirgoviste is an orphanage for normal boys and has approximately 150 children aged between three and 18 years.  The boys are generally healthy and are now receiving a proper food diet.  The building in which they live, however, is in appalling conditions.  The walls and floors are bare concrete, the central heating does not work which causes the building to be cold and damp and the bathrooms and toilets resemble a disused public convenience.</P>
    <P>Although these children are able to go to the local school, when they are in the orphanage they have nothing to do. Apart from a football and makeshift goalposts in the courtyard of the orphanage they have no recreational facilities of any <Col N="2458" /> nature whatsoever.  The Irish organisation have managed to provide proper bed covers and curtains for all the dormitories and have provided all the boys with new shoes, two pairs of pyjamas, a tracksuit and training shoes.  They intend to purchase new recreational equipment such as table tennis tables and are instigating a complete refurbishment programme which is to begin in the spring. Because the person in charge of that orphanage is trustworthy there have not been major difficulties with aid supplied going astray.</P>
    <P>Videle is an orphanage for handicapped or so-called irrecuperables.  It houses about 170 children also aged between the age of three and 18.  Medical problems here are enormous.  The children are undernourished and many having reached the age of six or seven are still only bottle fed with a mixture which is totally inadequate for normal growth and development.  They have also been so deprived of love and human contact that many have become withdrawn and unresponsive to those around them. For the last three months the Irish organisation has had a medical team headed by a Dr. Holmes with five nurses working there every day trying to change the conditions of these children.  Major problems have been experienced with the staff of the institution.  For example, one child was discovered who had lain in bed with a broken leg for five days without the Romanian staff doing anything to help him.  In March two physiotherapists are being brought over to this orphanage and the Irish people working in it are involved in a continuing battle to bring about a change of attitude and approach.</P>
    <P>To date no funds have been provided to this organisation by our Government. I want to use this opportunity to call on the Government to provide this voluntary organisation with financial help in the important work they are doing.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has estimated that there are 160,000 children in institutional care in Romania.  The conditions suffered by these children challenge many of our attitudes and <Col N="2459" /> assumptions.  Mere relief work by voluntary agencies cannot resolve their problems but will hopefully in the long term ameliorate their conditions.  These are the children of the Ceausescu regime. In the Romania of Ceausescu every married woman was expected to have five children.</P>
    <P>Contraception was outlawed and a woman who did not comply with this obligation found herself subject to regular medical examination so as to ensure she was doing nothing to prevent pregnancy taking place.  Children in Romania during the Ceausescu years were seen by many of their families not as a blessing but as an unwanted burden.  Despite the change of regime attitudes within the population still have not dramatically changed.  Subjected for many years to a political propaganda which told women that contraception would endanger their lives, many unwanted children continue to be born and then to be abandoned. The overwhelming majority of children abandoned to these orphanages have no meaningful contact of any nature whatsoever with their parents or their families. They also have no prospect of being fostered or adopted within Romania by Romanian couples.</P>
    <P>Learning of the plight of these children many Irish couples anxious to adopt determined during 1990 to go to Romania and to provide such children with the opportunity of a loving home and family life within Ireland.  During 1990 approximately 150 Romanian children were adopted by Irish couples in Romania. Currently, three to four couples a week are travelling to Romania.</P>
    <P>In order to adopt in Romania each couple had to have a family assessment carried out and a home study report prepared to satisfy the Romanian authorities that they were suitable to adopt.  They then had to go through the proper legal procedures prescribed by Romanian law before a Romanian adoption order would be made.  It is important to emphasise that adoptions so completed had to properly comply with Romanian law and fulfil it requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2460" /> Irish couples who go to Romania to adopt face many difficulties.  Neither adoption societies in Ireland nor the health boards will currently co-operate in the carrying out of family assessments so that a home study report can be prepared. Currently, reports are prepared either by social workers, who, unknown to their employers, are doing the necessary assessments and furnishing such reports or by other professionals such as psychologists, child psychiatrists and even teachers.  I have also heard of instances of English social workers being flown into Ireland to prepare such reports.</P>
    <P>In my view the Government have an obligation to ensure that those Irish couples who wish to adopt abroad are suitable to adopt.  They also have an obligation to provide the necessary assessment facilities to enable couples who are suitable and who wish to adopt abroad to have a home study report carried out by professional personnel, properly qualified, to prepare such reports. The current situation is entirely unsatisfactory. Instead of this State providing the facilities necessary, it is driving the preparation of such reports underground and creating the possibility that some reports may be prepared by well meaning people who lack the necessary insights and qualifications.</P>
    <P>Not alone, however, is the State refusing to facilitate the carrying out of assessments but it is placing specific obstacles in the way of couples already judged suitable for adoption in Ireland.  Some couples currently on health board and adoption societies waiting lists who have not as yet had a child placed with them for adoption in Ireland, have asked that the home study report on which they were judged suitable be made available to them so that it can be furnished to the Romanian authorities for the purpose of an adoption in Romania.  These couples have been refused access to their own reports.</P>
    <P>In what way can it be said that this State has any interest of any nature whatsoever in obstructing Irish couples suitable to adopt in Ireland from adopting a child in Romania?  An Irish couple who <Col N="2461" /> surmount the domestic obstacles placed in their way are then left to their own resources to find their way through Romanian bureaucracy.  For couples going today, it is now somewhat easier than it was for those who originally went due to work done by the Irish Romanian Adoption Group.  I would like to take this opportunity to praise the work done by that group on a voluntary basis and the assistance they are giving to so many couple who have adopted in Romania and to so many couples seeking information about the possibility of such adoption. Nevertheless, it is not satisfactory that it is left to a voluntary group to provide the help and the necessary information.</P>
    <P>A couple who go to Romania may have to rely on taxi drivers and guides to show them around institutions and to make contact with maternity hospitals to find out what children are available for adoption. Some have to employ their own lawyer in Romania and rely on Romanian doctors to carry out medical checks on the child they are adopting.  They have to avoid the middlemen who have attempted to exploit the situation by seeking exorbitant payments from couples to show them around.  All of this is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to establish in this country an adoption agency or a number of such agencies which have a special responsibility in the area of inter-country adoption and which can liaise with the relevant foreign authorities in making arrangements for the adoption by Irish couples of children abroad.  The need for such an agency has been well documented and, inded, the Irish association of social workers have frequently stated it.  In the context of Romania, direct contacts could be made with the relevant authorities by such an agency and this will be now more readily facilitated by the enactment of new adoption laws in Romania last week.</P>
    <P>The couple who finally return to Ireland, having successfully completed the adoption process, discover that under Irish law they are not even regarded as the adoptive parents of their adopted <Col N="2462" /> child.  I do not believe there is anyone in this State who believes that children properly adopted in Romania, according to Romanian law, or, indeed, properly adopted in any other foreign country, according to the law of that country, should be discriminated against and treated differently in this State to children adopted at home.</P>
    <P>The Recognition of Foreign Adoptions Bill, 1990, contains provisions within it to resolve all of the difficulties outlined that relate to foreign adoptions.  Whereas the numbers of Irish couples adopting in Romania, the difficulties they are experiencing and the appalling plight of children abandoned to Romanian institutional care, makes the passage of this Bill urgent, I want to emphasise that the provisions of the Bill are not confined to addressing issues that arise from the adoption by Irish couples of Romanian children.  The Bill addresses the broad issue of the recognition of foreign adoptions generally and in doing so implements the comprehensive recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in May 1989 concerning this area of our laws, recommendations made at a time prior to the Romanian revolution. I also want to emphasise that substantial and detailed work was undertaken in the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in their introduction to their report stated:</P>
    <P>The present law is unsatisfactory. Although it is generally assumed that foreign adoptions may be recognised under existing law, the circumstances in which recognition may be afforded have never been clearly defined either in case law or by statute.  Since there are probably a number of people living in this country, both children and adults, who have been adopted abroad, it is a matter of concern that their status under Irish law should remain uncertain.</P>
    <P>The commission later states:</P>
    <P>It is highly undesirable that the law should remain in its present uncertain state&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2463" /> The report noted that &ldquo;Increased mobility within the EC has probably added to the number of people adopted abroad living in Ireland and stated that:</P>
    <P>It is important that recognition principles be explicit and clear for a number of reasons.  Numerous legal consequences flow from the recognition or non-recognition of an adoption order. Upon the validity of an adoption order may depend such a fundamental matter as entitlement to exercise parental rights.  The rights and liabilities of an adopted person in relation to such matters as succession, maintenance and taxation, may also be in issue.  In any matter of status the law should seek, insofar as possible, to avoid uncertainty.  It ought to be possible for an adopted person to obtain clear legal advice as to his status without the need to mount costly legal proceedings. Equally the law should be framed in such a way that the various administrative officials who are called upon from time to time to determine the status of individuals adopted abroad should be able to do so without too much complication and without the need to state cases to the courts.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commissions report was published in May 1989.  On 29 November 1990 when the Minister for Health was asked in response to a Dáil question whether he was promising legislation would be enacted to implement this report, he stated no such promise was being given.  On 11 December 1990 during the Report Stage debate on the Child Care Bill an amendment, proposed by the Fine Gael Party, to impose an obligation on health boards to carry out family assessments and to prepare home study reports for the purposes of foreign adoptions was opposed by the Government and defeated.</P>
    <P>On 13 December the First Stage of this Bill was moved by me on behalf of the Fine Gael Party in this House.  Conscious of the traditional knee-jerk response of the Government to Private Members' Bills, at the time of moving this measure <Col N="2464" /> I asked the Taoiseach to regard it as urgent social legislation and stated that the Fine Gael Party did not regard the Bill as one that should be seen as politically contentious in the party sense. The Taoiseach replied stating that the Government would produce their own Bill apparently unaware that just 14 days earlier the Minister for Health had said that no such legislation was promised. Needless to say no Government Bill was ever published.</P>
    <P>To-date any public comment made by the Government in relation to this area indicates that minimal attention and thought has been given to it and that there is substantial confusion as to the difference between enacting domestic adoption laws and providing rules for the recognition of foreign adoptions according to private international law.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the main provisions in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the recognition in Ireland of foreign adoption decrees of countries where one or both of the adopting parents were domiciled at the time of the making of the adoption decree.  It provides expressly that such adoptions shall be deemed always to have been recognised, whether effected before or after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the recognition in Ireland of foreign adoption decrees of countries where one or both of the adopting parents are habitually resident at the time of the making of the decree. However, in the case of such adoptions recognition of adoption decrees already granted will only take effect as and from the coming into force of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the recognition of foreign adoption decrees where such decrees are made by the lawfully designated authority of the country in which the adopted person was at the time of the making of the adoption order a national and ordinarily resident or where at such time the adopted person was habitually resident.  Recognition under this section will take effect as and from the coming into force of the Bill and under this section adoption orders properly obtained by Irish couples adopting, for example, <Col N="2465" /> a Romanian child in Romania, will be recognised.</P>
    <P>Sections 2, 3, and 4 follow the general approach of private international law in providing rules for the recognition of foreign adoptions based on there being a real and substantial connection between the country which makes the adoption order and those involved in the adoption process.  Sections 2 and 3 require that the real and substantial connection be as between the adopters and the country making the order.  Section 4 requires that the connection be as between the child and the country making the adoption order.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 implement specific recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission which provide for the recognition of foreign adoptions based on the fact that the adopters are domiciled or resident in the foreign country in which the adoption is completed. The commission, in their recommendations, did not address what recognition principles should be applied to adoptions where the adopters are neither domiciled or habitually resident in the foreign state but where the child adopted is so resident and is a national of such a State.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission left over this issue to be addressed after the Hague Conference on Private International Law to be held in 1993 which is to consider the finalisation of a convention on <i>The Adoption of Children coming from Abroad.</i> Having regard to the large numbers of children now being adopted abroad Fine Gael believe that the enactment of such legislation should not be left until after 1993.  There is also no guarantee that this issue will be finalised at the Hague Conference or that the convention ultimately drafted will be widely ratified.  In this context it is worth noting that an earlier Hague Convention on the <i>Recognition of Decrees relating to Adoption,</i> drafted in 1964, was only ever ratified by three countries &mdash;it was not ratified by Ireland&mdash;and that recognition rules in respect of foreign adoptions contained in legislation currently in force in <Col N="2466" /> many countries do not reflect many of the provisions contained in that convention.</P>
    <P>It is a general rule of private international law that recognition should only be extended to orders and decrees in circumstances where there is a substantial connection between the person or persons affected by such decrees and the country making them.  Under our adoption laws an adoption order may be made in respect of a child who is merely resident in the State and in this context the Law Reform Commission note that what our domestic legislation is doing in this context is, &ldquo;seeking to prevent an adoption of a child whose presence within the State is fleeting&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; accomplishes this goal.  Accordingly, section 4 provides for the recognition of a foreign adoption where the child adopted was at the time of the making of the adoption order a national and ordinarily a resident of the State making such order or was habitually resident in such State.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will enable the Minister for Health by regulation to designate countries or jurisdictions whose adoptions are recognised in Ireland without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in sections 2 to 4 of the Bill.  This provision implements not only recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission but also a recommendation made by the Review Committee on Adoption Services in 1984.</P>
    <P>Section 6 outlines the matters to which the Minister should regard in determining whether to make a designation.  It contains provisions designed to resolve difficulties the Minister told the Law Reform Commission he had, difficulties the Law Reform Commission felt did not need to be addressed in legislation but which are deliberately addressed in this Bill so as to ensure that no problem will arise in its implementation.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that recognition shall not be extended to an adoption order where recognition would be manifestly contrary to public policy.  This provision specifically implements another recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  In this context it should be noted that the Review Committee on <Col N="2467" /> Adoption Services in 1984 stated that they would be opposed to any measures which would encourage or facilitate trafficking in children from foreign countries for adoption purposes.</P>
    <P>Under this section an adoption effected consequent on a payment being made for the child being adopted to the parent of such a child would not be recognised here.  Some concern has been expressed that Irish couples desperate to adopt may effectively buy babies abroad in either South America or Romania.  A major problem was created in Romania during 1990 by both American and Canadian couples using the Romanian adoption process and offering payments for children.  This is not something that can be condoned or supported.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by some in this country that Irish couples adopting in Romania have bought babies and that, as a consequence, the adoption should not be recognised.  I have spoken to many of the couples who have gone to Romania to adopt and I have not yet met a couple who have behaved in this way.  Indeed, I am aware of some couples who refused to deal with co-called middle-men or intermediaries who sought payments to introduce them to mothers seeking to sell a child for adoption.  The new laws enacted in Romania last week are designed to bring this abuse to an end and I believe we should in our legislation ensure that recognition will not be extended to such adoptions.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in the context of this provision to also say something about the constitutional situation.  Comments made about this Bill from some quarters, in particular, the Minister, seem to suggest that there is a constitutional difficulty in its implementation and that for foreign adoptions to be recognised here, the adoptions must fully comply with our domestic legal provisions in relation to adoption orders made by the Adoption Board.  Such comments made by the Minister for Health, and others, have caused confusion.  In this context I again refer to the Law Reform Commission who in their report stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2468" /> The implications of the constitutional principles in a recognition context may be different from those which arise in purely domestic cases. Apart from the question of whether Irish constitutional principles should be applicable to persons having no connection with Ireland, some weight has to be attached to the problems created by limping adoptions (i.e. in this context, adoptions which are generally recognised abroad but not in Ireland)....</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that recognition cases quite often arise many years after a foreign adoption has been effected and at a time when the application of constitutional principles may serve little practical purpose.  We, therefore, believe it would be wrong to lay day the general principle in legislation explicitly mandating non-recognition of foreign adoptions on constitutional grounds and it should be possible for judges within the context of a general principle allowing nonrecognition for reasons of public policy to distinguish between cases where the application of constitutional principles is appropriate from where it is not.</P>
    <P>In referring to the restrictive circumstances in which a child born to a married couple can be adopted in Irish law the commission stated:</P>
    <P>... the fact that the Oireachtais may be precluded by the provisions of Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Constitution from enacting legislation which permitted the adoption of legitimate children other than in the exceptional circumstances envisaged by Article 42.5 does not necessarily mean that a conflict of law rule, which has as its consequence the recognition of such an adoption decree by another jurisdiction, would be inconsistent with the Constitution.  In the area of divorce, where similar problems of status and public policy in the context of private international law arise, the Irish courts have been at pains to distinguish between the effects of public policy underlying the Constitution which prohibits the positive enforcement in this <Col N="2469" /> jurisdiction of laws which offend that public policy and the more passive recognition of the status which those laws bring about as a matter of private international law.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the public comments made by the Minister on this Bill that there is some considerable confusion in the mind of the Minister with regard to the difference between domestic adoption laws and laws relating to the rcognition of foreign adoptions in the context of the constitutional provisions referred to.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill empowers the High Court to grant declarations as to the validity of foreign adoption decrees and is similar to a provision contained in the Status of Children Act, 1987, which provides for the making of declarations of parentage.  The production of a High Court declaration would not be a precondition to the recognition of foreign adoptions by an administrative authority. This provision merely provides a mechanism to obtain such a declaration where issues of recognition are particularly complex.</P>
    <P>Section 11 states the effect in Irish law of recognition being extended to foreign adoption orders.  Under it, once a foreign adoption is recognised, the child adopted in the foreign country is placed in exactly the same legal position under Irish law as the child adopted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is particularly important in the context of adoptions abroad for people living in Ireland.  At present neither health boards nor adoption societies co-operate in the carrying out the family assessments for the purpose of preparing a home study report to enable a foreign adoption to be completed. Moreover, provisions contained in the Adoption Act, 1952, prohibit the payment of moneys to any person who facilitates the making of an arrangement for adoption.  This provision was originally designed to prevent people receiving payments in Ireland for arranging the adoption of a child in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has now been interpreted by the Adoption Board as applying to any payment that might be made to a social <Col N="2470" /> worker or child psychiatrist for the carrying out of an assessment and the preparation of a home study report to be furnished to a foreign authority for the purpose of a foreign adoption.  As a consequence, those who wish to adopt in Romania and who are anxious to establish their suitability cannot have assessments and reports prepared by the relevant State agencies and are breaking the law if they pay a suitably qualified professional person to carry out the necessary assessments and prepare such reports.</P>
    <P>Health boards and adoption societies who carry out assessments for the purpose of Irish domestic adoptions are the appropriate agencies to assess Irish couples living here who wish to adopt abroad.  Section 12 of the Bill confers an obligation on a health board requested to prepare such a report to carry out the necessary assessment without unreasonable delay and to furnish such report when completed both to the prospective adopters and to the foreign authority to whom they are applying to adopt.  This section also empowers the Minister for Health to designate by way of regulation an existing adoption society or societies to undertake functions in relation to the making of arrangements for inter-country adoptions.  This would ensure that proper arrangements were put in place to effect such adoptions and that all of the preliminary contacts necessary were undertaken by a responsible body in this country on behalf of the adopters rather than adopters being left on their own to find their way through foreign bureaucracy.  It would also avoid the possibility of Irish couples being exploited or their unwittingly adopting a child in a foreign country in circumstances where such adoption may not be appropriate.  Such an agency could also ensure that the adopters knew as much as is possible about the health of the child being adopted by them.</P>
    <P>I now want to conclude by turning to the context in which the Bill is published and to the politics involved.  In September of last year the Taoiseach and other world leaders attended the United Nations for <Col N="2471" /> the signing of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 21 of the Convention recognises that &ldquo;inter-country adoption may be considered as an alternative means of child care, if the child cannot be placed in a foster or an adoptive family or cannot in any suitable manner be cared for in the child's country of origin&rdquo;.  The same article requires the signatory States to &ldquo;ensure that the child concerned by inter-country adoptions enjoys safeguards and standards equivalent to those existing in the case of national adoption and to promote where appropriate the objectives of this article by concluding bilateral or multinational arrangements or agreements&rdquo; with regard to inter-country adoption.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in the context of Romania inter-country adoption offers to many children currently in institutions the only real hope for the future.  For us to comply with the provisions in the article which require that we ensure that the child adopted abroad enjoys safeguards and standards equivalent to those existing in the case of national adoption, it is clear that those children when adopted by Irish couples must be placed in the same legal position as a child adopted in Ireland. To comply with the provisions of this convention it is clear that legislation such as that proposed in the Fine Gael Bill should be supported.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate part of our political system that whenever a Private Members' Bill is published by an Opposition party, the Government of the day feel it incumbent to oppose the measure. Within a competitive political environment legislation coming from the Opposition side of the House is seen as a threat to a Minister's authority rather than as a constructive legislative contribution to addressing a problem that the Government, due to the many demands made upon them, may not have had the time or the resources to tackle, or the insight to deal with.</P>
    <P>This Bill was brought forward by the Fine Gael Party not in order to embarrass the Minister for Health or either of the <Col N="2472" /> parties that compose this Government.  It was brought forward to address a specific area of our social legislation which had for far too long been ignored and which could no longer be ignored, and that due to new problems needed to be urgently addressed.  Ninety per cent of the contents of this Bill implements recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and in one particular instance addresses an issue that the commission thought need not be contained in legislation but about which the Minister for Health had expressed some anxiety.</P>
    <P>For the past two months I have argued that in a mature political environment it would be accepted that it is desirable that Members of Parliament act as legislators and for a Bill such as this to be welcomed by the Government of the day.  I reiterated that in so far as there are any provisions in the Bill about which the Government may have a genuine concern, and so that appropriate amendments could be incorporated in this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>While it is the view of the Fine Gael Party that the Bill fully and properly addresses the issues to which it relates, we do, of course, acknowledge that it is a rare event for any Bill to be published which is not amended in some ways as it moves through the legislative process.  If the fact that a Bill might have to be amended at some stage during the course of its passage through the Oireachtas was a reason for not supporting a Bill at Second Stage, no legislation would ever be enacted in this House.  For example, the Minister's own Child Care Bill must have had over 60 amendments made to it during its passage through this House from Second Stage to Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Until this afternoon it seemed from the Minister's many public remarks that the Bill was going to be opposed by the Government.  The Minister constantly went on record criticising the Bill and its provisions, promising his own Bill and stating that this Bill has a variety of defects, based simply on the Minister's lack of understanding of the issues involved.  I welcome the Minister's and the Government's change of approach to <Col N="2473" /> this issue, which I heard of on radio at 5 p.m. today.  I welcome the Government's agreement to the Bill now passing Second Stage and proceeding to Committee Stage.  The acceptance by the Government of this Bill will not be seen to be a defeat for the Government but as a growing maturity in our political process.  It will be seen as the Government finally recognising the desirability of Members of this House to play a role as real legislators and not as mere rubber stamps for legislation drafted by the Attorney General's Office or civil servants in other Government Departments. I welcome the Governments recognition of the need to urgently enact this legislation and I welcome their change of mind.</P>
    <P>I hope that following the completion of this debate Committee Stage can be speedily taken and that this vitally important measure can be rapidly enacted into law so that Irish couples who wish to adopt in Romania are assisted, and so that all children properly adopted in accordance with the laws of a foreign country are granted in this State the same rights as we confer on children adopted within Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have always accepted the need to set out in legislation the circumstances in which a foreign adoption order is entitled to recognition in the State.  Given the scale on which inter-country adoptions are now taking place, it is clearly desirable that there should be no uncertainty surrounding the status under domestic law of adoption decrees granted in other countries.  Indeed, Deputy Shatter referred to the reducing number of children available for adoption in our country and, in many European countries at present, there are more foreign adoptions than domestic adoptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it is the Romanian situation that is to the forefront of all our minds. Everyone who has watched the harrowing scenes on television &mdash; and who listened to Deputy Shatter outlining some of them tonight &mdash; has been deeply moved by the appalling conditions in the <Col N="2474" /> Romanian orphanages and the heartrending plight of the children there. When it became known that many of the children were available for adoption, Irish couples began to travel to Romania to adopt and to provide the children with the opportunity of a loving and caring family life here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Having returned with children to Ireland, couples find that their Romanian adoptions are not recognised here and that there are difficulties in adopting the children under existing Irish adoption legislation.  The Government appreciate the anxiety of the adoptive parents to have their position regularised under Irish law.  Accordingly, I am glad to announce formally to the House that the Government will not be opposing a Second Reading of the Bill proposed by Deputy Shatter.  There were two choices open to the Government, to reject the Bill and to bring forward their own Bill in a couple of weeks time or to accept the Bill and allow it to proceed to an all-party committee of the House.  We have chosen the latter course because we believe it is appropriate that it should go to an all-party committee; it is a serious social issue, one on which we should like to see consensus and avoid turning it into a political football.</P>
    <P>However, the Government have serious reservations about the legality and acceptability of some of the measures included in the Bill.  In order to demonstrate a positive and sympathetic approach to this issue we have allowed the Bill to proceed to a special committee where it can be examined in detail and, I hope, amended in a manner which will make it workable and acceptable to all. The Government and I are aware of the many sensitive issues which need to be discussed and agreed and, despite our reservations, we are allowing the Bill to proceed to avoid a divisive political debate.</P>
    <P>I am aware of some criticism of the Government for not acting earlier to initiate legislation on foreign adoptions but I assure the House that the Attorney General and I have spared no effort in this respect.  Adoption is an extremely <Col N="2475" /> complex area of the law and great care must be taken in the preparation of any new legislation in order to ensure that it is in conformity with the Constitution.  I should like to remind the House that on three occasions since I came into Government in 1987 we have introduced major child legislation, including the Adoption Act, 1988, child care legislation and an amendment following a Supreme Court decision in 1988.  To illustrate the difficulties and complexities associated with adoption law in this country, I should like to remind the House that the Bill &mdash; which is now the Adoption Act, 1988 &mdash; was referred by the President to the Supreme Court for a ruling as to its constitutionality and on a previous occasion regarding adoption legislation in 1979 the issue was only resolved by holding a referendum. It is essential to ensure that any legislation is in conformity with our obligations under international agreements, for example, the European Convention on the Adoption of Children and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the Government accept the principle of Deputy Shatters Bill but we have serious reservations about some of its provisions.  I would like to emphasise that these reservations are not against the overall objective of the Bill but are based on our considered examination of the technical problems arising in the drafting of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in principle with the proposals in the Bill to confer recognition on adoptions effected in countries or jurisdictions where the adoptive parents were either domiciled or habitually resident at the time of the adoption, subject of course to the effect of the foreign adoption being broadly similar to the effect of an Irish adoption.  It seems reasonable that adoptions effected in countries where the adoptive parents were either born or were living for a long time should be recognised by the State.</P>
    <P>These provisions are, broadly speaking, in line with the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in their report on the recognition of foreign <Col N="2476" /> adoption decrees.  However, in fairness to people who have adopted in Romania recently, it has to be emphasised that recognition based on domicile or habitual residence would be of no benefit to them or to other people who travelled to a foreign country for the sole purpose of adopting a child.</P>
    <P>These cases are the most difficult for which to legislate.  I would like to quote briefly from what the Law Reform Commission said about this in their report:</P>
    <P>Since the adoptive parents in such cases are neither domiciled nor even resident for any significant period of time in the country of adoption, it is obvious that such adoptions would fail to meet the threshold requirements of any system of recognition of adoption decrees which uses normally acceptable criteria.  It is unfortunately the case that adoptive parents in this position will not necessarily be assisted by the proposals in our Report if they are implemented.</P>
    <P>It is clear that even if the Government were to implement the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission it would do nothing to assist persons who have recently adopted children from Romania or others who have gone abroad with the sole purpose of adopting children while abroad.  It is important that this is clearly made known to counter suggestions made that the implementation of the commission's report would solve all the problems in this area.  This is not the case and, as the Law Reform Commission concludes, there does not appear to be any quick or easy solution to this difficult issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's proposal for dealing with this kind of foreign adoption is to provide for their recognition based solely on the nationality and residence of the child.  There are serious constitutional and other objections to this proposal.  It would result in a completely open-ended system of recognition which would undermine our own legal adoption system and the important safeguards it contains.  It would also contravene a number of international agreements which the State has <Col N="2477" /> either ratified or is committed to ratifying.</P>
    <P>It is simply not possible to consider the nationality and residence of the adopted child in isolation.  Regard must also be had to the eligibility of the child, the consent of the natural parents and the eligibility and suitability of the adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>Under the Deputy's proposals the adoption of a child born within marriage would be entitled to recognition.  It is not clear whether this is constitutionally permissible.  Because of the guarantees to protect the family and to respect the rights and duties of parents contained in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution, the law here does not permit married parents to voluntarily surrender their children for adoption.  Other countries allow parents to do so and I am aware that a significant number of the children adopted in Romania by Irish parents were born within marriage.  This is one of the issues we hope to address on Committee Stage and to resolve to the satisfaction of adoptive parents and Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Our law only permits the adoption of children born within marriage in the strictly limited circumstances provided for under the Adoption Act, 1988.  The authority of the High Court is required in every case.  The court will not give this authority unless satisfied, among other matters, that the child's natural parents have failed in their duty towards the child and that this failure constitutes an abandonment of all their parental rights.  As to what constitutes &ldquo;failure&rdquo; by parents, it is important to note what was said by the Supreme Court when the Bill, which is now the 1988 Act, was referred by the President for a decision as to its constitutionality. The Supreme Court made it clear that failure due to externally originating circumstances such as poverty would not be sufficient to justify the adoption of the child against the wishes of his parents.  As I said, that is one of the issues we will be addressing and we will certainly take a sympathetic view of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no reference to the <Col N="2478" /> consent of the natural parents and that omission is hard to understand.  I cannot conceive of a situation in which a foreign adoption could be recognised under Irish law without reference to whether the natural parents gave a proper consent to the adoption or whether their consent was dispensed with by a competent foreign authority.  The validity of any adoption order is affected by whether the consent of the natural parent was an informed one and given without pressure or, where the order was made in the absence of consent, whether the grounds for dispensing with the consent were justified.</P>
    <P>Under our law, for example, a consent to adoption is invalid if given before the child attains the age of six weeks.  The purpose of this restriction is to ensure that the mother's health and psychological balance have been restored following the trauma of childbirth.  I should mention that the European Convention on the Adoption of Children prohibits the prescription by law of a shorter period than six weeks.  This is another issue which will be studied very carefully and I would say very sympathetically when the Bill is addressed by the Special Committee.</P>
    <P>The case law on consent to adoption is considerable.  Indeed, Deputy Shatter has appeared before the High Court and the Supreme Court on a number of occasions on behalf of clients involved in disputed adoption cases.  He, more than most Deputies, is aware of the importance our courts attach to the circumstances in which the consent of a natural parent to adoption procedures is obtained.  He knows that the courts have refused to sanction proposed Irish adoptions on the grounds that the consents had not been properly given.  Again, this is an issue which will have to be addressed by the Special Committee and I hope we will be able to agree on a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty with the Bill is that it does not require the eligibility or suitability of the adoptive parents to be taken into consideration.  The law here requires joint applicants for an adoption order to <Col N="2479" /> be a married couple living together.  This renders a couple who are parties to a bigamous marriage ineligible to adopt a child in Ireland.  Such a couple who adopted a child abroad would be entitled to have the adoption recognised under this Bill.  This would be in contravention of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children, to which the State is a party and which specifically prohibits the adoption of a child by an unmarried couple.</P>
    <P>The Bill would also entitle a single person who adopts abroad to have the adoption recognised here, notwithstanding that single persons are, generally speaking, not eligible to adopt a child in the State.  This would create an anomaly in our adoption laws.  The Government are sympathetically disposed to extending the categories of single persons eligible to adopt in appropriate cases but believe that it should be done for both foreign and domestic adoptions.</P>
    <P>Any procedure for the recognition of foreign adoptions must include a proper assessment of the suitability of the adoptive parents.  This is particularly important in the case of adoptions granted in countries which do not require the adoptive parents to have had the child in their care for any length of time.</P>
    <P>The assessments carried out by the adoption agencies and the Adoption Board in the case of domestic adoptions provide an important safeguard for the welfare of the child.  It is vitally important that any child involved in inter-country adoption enjoys the same safeguards. While the primary responsibility for providing these safeguards rests with the authorities in the foreign country, the State also has a duty to protect the welfare of the child.  Indeed, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the Taoiseach signed last September with a view to it being ratified by the State, includes a special provision in relation to inter-country adoption.  It requires states to ensure that the child concerned by inter-country adoption <Col N="2480" /> enjoys safeguards and standards equivalent to those existing in the case of national adoption.</P>
    <P>Similar reservations about the lack of standards in this Bill are expressed in the January issue of the <i>Irish Law Times</i>.  I would like to quote briefly from it:</P>
    <P>Adoption in Ireland is child-centred and the law ensures that the child's interests are paramount.  In the recognition of foreign adoption orders this should remain so.  There should be no reduction in standards.  The same level of standards that apply to Irish adoption orders should be made applicable to foreign adoption orders.  This is not so clear in the proposed Bill.  Without such stringent safeguards it could be possible that a couple who fail assessment in Ireland for adoption for, say, reasons of unstableness, could be successful in adopting a foreign child.  This clearly would not be in the interest of the child and would provide an &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; adoption structure.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the provisions of the Bill are not restricted to Irish citizens or even to people who are resident here.  Thus, an adoption order granted in, say, Brazil to an English couple who are domiciled in England would be entitled to recognition here, even though Brazilian adoptions are not recognised in England.  Indeed, I am sure Deputy Shatter would not wish to see this country being used as a backdoor by foreign parents seeking to circumvent the adoption procedures in their own countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to empower the Minister for Health to designate countries and jurisdictions whose adoption orders would be recognised in the State. Again, I have no objection in principle to this idea.  The Law Reform Commission recommended the introduction of such a procedure.  However, it indicated that this would apply to countries whose legal, social and political structures are similar to our own, such as other members of the European Community.  Given the uncertain social and political situation in Romania, it is not clear that such a procedure would be appropriate in the <Col N="2481" /> case of adoptions in that country.  That is something we want to rectify in this legislation and which we will address very sympathetically in the all-party committee.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a number of criteria which would be applicable in determining whether a ministerial designation should be made.  However, there is one essential condition absent, that is whether the adoption was made with the consent of the natural parents or whether their consent was dispensed with by a competent foreign authority on appropriate grounds.  The question also arises as to whether the Minister could designate a country which allows the adoption of children in circumstances that would not be constitutionally permissible here, for example, the voluntary surrender of children by married parents.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to confine recognition to adoption orders made in respect of persons up to the age of 21 years at the date of the order.  I would point out to Deputy Shatter that the Adoption Act, 1988 reduced the upper age limit for adoption from 21 to 18 years.  I should also mention that the Law Reform Commission recommended that recognition should be confined to adoption orders made in repect of persons below the age of 18.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the withholding of recognition where recognition would be contrary to public policy.  This means that the recognition of any adoption under any of the procedures contained in the Bill could be set aside at any time by the courts.  Thus there would always be a question mark hanging over the validity of foreign adoptions under Irish law.  The adoptive parents and the adopted children would never know when their order might be denied recognition.  That again, is an issue we want to address and rectify in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill would entitle the adoptive parents or the adopted person to apply to the High Court for a declaration that their foreign adoption is valid here. However, no guidance is given to the court as to the criteria by which it is to decide whether an adoption order is <Col N="2482" /> entitled to recognition.  What is to happen to the child if the court refuses to recognise a foreign adoption order?  Again, the Bill provides no guidance on the matter. It is important that the Bill provides guidance in this area for the High Court, in the way the Adoption Act, 1988 does.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires health boards to carry out assessments of the suitability of persons wishing to adopt abroad.  This is something I am already in the process of arranging administratively.  In the context of Romania I am arranging for contact to be made with the Central Committee on Adoptions, set up in Romania last week, to agree with them on the procedures for processing applications from Irish people wishing to adopt in Romania.  I would see the health boards having a key role in the implementation of these procedures.  Indeed, I would recommend to anybody contemplating going to Romania to adopt a child that they get professional advice before they go so they will know exactly what is required.</P>
    <P>Naturally, nobody in this House can tell them what the final legislation will be, although I am sure everybody in the House is sympathetic and anxious to ensure we have the most comprehensive legislation possible for them to take account of the needs of the adopting parents, having regard to the rights of the child and the interest of the natural parent or parents.  It is important that people get good professional advice before they go to Romania.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the Minister to designate voluntary adoption societies to deal with inter-country adoptions.  This provision, in my view, is misconceived. The voluntary societies are free to carry out functions in relation to inter-country adoptions if they wish to do so.  I would also point out that the Adoption Board, not the Minister, is the registering authority for adoption societies.  The board are responsible for supervising the activities of the adoption societies and ensuring they maintain satisfactory standards. The board must have a role in any <Col N="2483" /> arrangements for the assessment of persons seeking to adopt abroad.  I find it strange that the Bill does not envisage such a role for the board.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Government had two choices.  We could have rejected this Bill in the House and brought forward our own Bill in three or four weeks time, or accepted the Bill.  We have decided to accept the Bill on Second Stage, to see it go to a Committee of the House, an all-party Committee, where we hope there will be consensus and that it will not be debated in the adversarial, across-the-House fashion because of the recognition by all Members and the Government of the importance of this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are many children adopted in our country now.  I understand there are at least 150 Romanian children in our country, and we are very anxious to have the most comprehensive legislation to ensure that we provide for the needs of the adopting parents having regard to the rights of the child and the interests of the natural parents and, of course, the interests of the adopting parents.  The adopting parents will want security.  They will not want a situation where in two or three year's time the natural parent may be able to come to this country and claim the child in court.</P>
    <P>Against that background adoption legislation is very complex.  It is difficult legislation, as has been shown in the past. In regard to the last two pieces of legislation on adoption in this House, the 1988 legislation was referred to the Supreme Court before its enactment and the 1979 legislation necessitated a referendum before it was enacted.  Everybody in the House recognises this is not easy legislation but it is important legislation and we are anxious to get it right.</P>
    <P>In that regard I might refer to Deputy Shatter's comment about the delay in bringing forward legislation.  The Government at one stage examined the situation to see if it was possible that the adopting parents could adopt children under existing law.  At the moment there are 30 applications before the Adoption Board being processed for adoption <Col N="2484" /> under existing law, so there is provision there which would facilitate a number of parents.  However, having considered the matter we discovered existing law would not cater for the needs of all the adopting parents.  The Government then decided to bring forward legislation, but it is incumbent on Government to bring forward legislation that will stand up.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Shatter's point that amendments are accepted.  The Child Care Bill is a good example of legislation that went through the House and was examined in Committee; the Committee of Members from all sides worked very hard on that legislation and I believe we have better legislation as a result.  I have no doubt that the same will happen in this legislation.  The Bill will go before an all-party committee of the House where the necessary amendments will be brought forward to address the issues I have outlined.  As I said, the Child Care Bill which passed all stages in this House was considered by such a committee and was greatly improved as a result.  While I have outlined the difficulties, we are sympathetic to the problems that exist and we want to resolve those difficulties. I have every confidence that the all-party committee will be as successful as the Committee on the Child Care in effecting the necessary improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record the Labour Party's complete support for this Bill and to compliment Deputy Shatter on introducing it as a Private Members' Bill.  There might have been periods of recrimination between Deputy Shatter and the Minister, but it is time we acknowledged that in the country at large there is at last a recognition that this House is functioning as a House of legislation whether initiated by Private Members or by the Government.  It is a good sign of democracy that the Minister with the Government have the courage to accept the legislation placed before them by a Private Member and to accept it in the spirit he has done, recognising that it probably needs and will benefit from amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day he initiated this Bill Deputy <Col N="2485" /> Shatter admitted that with the resources available to him &mdash; obviously looking at the Bill they are extensive &mdash; he was prepared to listen to any arguments that might come forward by way of amendment. It means that the Bill which started with some controversy because of the Government's stated attitude has now become positive legislation.  We, in the Labour Party, will participate fully in the Committee of the House to ensure that at the end of the day the amended Bill will be an improvement on the Bill as initiated and will meet the demands being made on all of us by parents who want to ensure that the children they have already adopted will in the future have legal standing and that they will be recognised by the State as being their children by adoption.  I hope that some of the difficulties being put in the way of families now in the process of trying to negotiate with the Department of Justice will be overcome.  The Minister has stated tonight that he is trying to overcome the administrative problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>In my constituency scenes of joy and happiness were portrayed in the provincial newspapers of large numbers of families in Tipperary who had the courage, in spite of all the difficulties, to go to Romania and to go through the necessary procedure to adopt available children and bring them home.  I look forward to the day when those new parents will see their children officially recognised by the State; both parents are Irish and their love for these children will be no less than if the children were Irish. It is appropriate that we in the House respond to that situation by bringing in appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party recognised that there were many social difficulties particularly in regard to Romanian children. There was widespread media coverage about the risks involved, especially the risks to the health of these children.  Were it not for the voluntary group known as the Irish Romania Adoptive Parents Group, were it not for the support, assistance and guidance of such people, many parents might not have continued their efforts to obtain Romanian children for adoption and have them become part of their families at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2486" /> Their most recent documentation made available to all of us abates that at present these children have no rights in this country: we are not legally their parents and they are not Irish citizens. This is a very unsatisfactory position. These innocent children are victims of an inadequate law with regard to foreign adoption.  Surely they have suffered enough already.  They continue to say: we would urge that the law here give full recognition to foreign adoptions, thus giving the adoptive children the same status as those children adopted in Ireland.  This would also confirm their Irish citizenship and, with it, all the benefits this State has to offer its citizens.</P>
    <P>That voluntary group recognise the importance, first, of children having a nationality and were proud to have an opportunity to confirm their Irish citizenship. All of us recognise how important that is worldwide because of our humanitarian commitment in that and other areas in which we have social obligations. In difficult circumstances prevailing in the past &mdash; when other countries ravaged by war has thousands of refugees fleeing from them &mdash; the Irish people were to the fore in ensuring that they had a safe haven here: that, at considerable difficulty and expense to many of our people, even as an interim measure, in removing such refugees from the trauma they had experienced in their countries.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party recognised that it was the responsibility of Government to acknowledge and respond to parents' needs to adopt children &mdash; whether they had children of their own or were childless and assist and facilitate them in every way possible.  Such Government response was not forthcoming which led to the necessity for this Private Members' Bill on which I have congratulated Deputy Shatter.  The Minister having shown the courage he did in supporting this Bill in its Second Reading &mdash; that gesture of goodwill on the part of the Minister and Government for which I thank them &mdash; means that this Bill will go through the parliamentary procedure faster, will benefit therefrom, will have the power of Government behind its provisions and all the legal advice available to the Minister, through the Attorney General's Office, <Col N="2487" /> in the event of any problems arising therewith in the future.  Surely that is the appropriate way to go forward?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party realise also that childless couples were unable to obtain children through the normal channels of adoption here because of the scarcity of children which meant many had to wait many years.  One need only be close to people who adopt children to understand and observe the joy and happiness that the news that a child is available brings to them.  If it is possible to say so on the record, perhaps it even surpasses the joy a child of their own brings couples.  One observes the real joy of people who.  for the first time, experience the happiness of a child being made available to them.</P>
    <P>That scarcity of children for adoption at home meant people turned to Romania because of the widespread publicity portraying the deprivation and conditions to which those children were subjected, particularly on the humanitarian level, having seen many of them on television. Probably it is something similar to the effect of such television portrayals of famine in the Sudan or Ethiopia when Ireland always responds.  Perhaps we need our consciences to be triggered by visual proof.  When these pictures of Romanian children were portrayed on television immediately Irish people responded and went out to Romania at considerable expense to ascertain whether they would be able to remove some of them from that regime back to the haven of Ireland where they could participate in what is recognised to be a privileged society that has such regard for our children and whose Constitution protects them.  While we may complain at times that Government and agencies do not pay sufficient attention to children, one must say there is a special regard for children and their rights here.</P>
    <P>On those grounds alone the introduction of this Bill was welcome &mdash; the fact that children were not available for adoption here and the conditions to which those Romanian children were being subjected in that regime, particularly after the fall of Ceausescu when world attention was drawn to the position obtaining there.  We are aware also that, <Col N="2488" /> despite the many difficulties obtaining there, many children have already been brought here &mdash; the Minister mentioned a figure of approximately 150 children. There are many more awaiting approval by the Department of Justice.  I suppose it is appropriate this evening to place on the record our appreciation of the assistance given by the Department of Justice in what was a wholly new area for them.  They laid down certain rules, regulations and requests for documentation which, when forthcoming, assisted parents, equipping them with some legal documentation here and rendering it appropriate for them to go to Romania to adopt children or to go through the process of bringing children back here for adoption.</P>
    <P>Of course, that led to the difficulty outlined by Deputy Shatter in section 12 of his Bill which refers to the lack of co-operation at present on the part of health boards and agencies when requested to undertake social reports or family assessments for adoption purposes.  That is the largest complaint being voiced at present. There are quite a number of genuine applicants now being subjected to negative replies on the part of health agencies to what parents would consider a normal procedure, requesting that their family circumstances be examined and reported.  Usually such applicants would not subject themselves to such investigation were they not satisified they met all the requirements of &ldquo;the home&rdquo; as defined for this purpose, rendering them eligible and suitable when assessed for that purpose.  I was pleased to note that the Minister said he was setting in train such a procedure.</P>
    <P>When replying I hope some member of the Government will outline such procedure which would benefit people at present endeavouring to obtain approval to travel to Romania, who have undertaken much research, have already visited Romania once or twice, have seen a child or children and have talked to the relevant agencies there.  As I have said, the voluntary adoptive group here have been of tremendous help to parents, in giving them the names of reputable people abroad and reputable health and legal organisations.  I know of parents <Col N="2489" /> who are awaiting this social report before being approved finally by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless it is not sufficient for us to rest on our laurels now that this Private Members' Bill has been introduced.  As a Legislature we must afford it some degree of urgency.  We should proceed, on a weekly basis, to tease out the problems the Minister has identified in its sections, clauses and regulations.</P>
    <P>Having read the provisions of the Bill on several occasions I am anxious to hear further from the Minister those areas he considers to be deficient.  There was also a comprehensive explanatory memorandum published with the Bill on the basis of all the information available to Deputy Shatter, some reverting back to the Law Reform Commission which addressed this problem some time ago. For the life of me I cannot see some of the difficulties outlined by the Minister. Nonetheless I suppose it is appropriate that all legislation &mdash; even that emanating from the Government side &mdash; with all the legal advice available to them from the Attorney General &mdash; be subjected to the same scrutiny.  After all, is not that what this assembly is about &mdash; to ensure that the best possible Bill to address any problem is enacted?  This House must try to ensure that we have the best possible legislation to deal with this problem.  The Minister said there was reference in the Bill to the consent of natural parents. The Minister said that he could not conceive of a situation in which foreign adoptions would be recognised under Irish law without reference to whether the natural parents had given a proper consent to adoption or to whether the consent was dispensed with by a competent foreign authority.  Surely we do not have our heads in the sand and we realise that things are different in Romania.</P>
    <P>There the State intervened in the privacy of marriage forcing people to have children they could not afford to look after.  Children were in danger of dying from hunger and the State had already taken these children into institutions.  The parents' rights had already been ignored by &ldquo;the competent authority&rdquo;.  The only future for these Romanian children was if another competent state like ours moved <Col N="2490" /> into this area.  Having regard to the Romanian regime which has disregarded the rights of parents and children, anything we could do will surpass anything in Romania.  The Minister's criticism of the Bill was unnecessary, taking all these things into account.</P>
    <P>We will participate fully in the committee procedure on this Bill.  We will support the Minister in changing sections on the basis of advice available to him. Working together we will have done something to address this problem.  Many of our constituents have gone to Romania to try to adopt children but found when they brought them home they had to be subjected to the naturalisation process which was only available as per a reply to a parliamentary question at the end of last year.  Deputy Shatter's Bill will encourage people to believe that the children will have future security and Irish citizenship.  All sides of the House should support this in the interest of the children.  If the interests of the children are looked after, the interests of adoptive parents will be looked after.  Everyone will benefit from this House having pursued its legislative role.  Tonight, the credit goes to Deputy Shatter for having initiated this Bill.  We thank the Minister for accepting this Bill and we should all work together to improve it and to match the challenge the public have given us.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Shatter as an mBille a chur os ár gcomhair inniu, agus go mórmhór leis an Aire Sláinte, cé go bhfuil sé ag dul i mbun an Bhille agus á chur faoi bhráid coiste speisialta.</P>
      <P>The forum of an Oireachtas Joint Committee will actually help this Bill.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee that took the Childcare Bill in hand did an excellent job.  We worked as a team.  We forgot about political football.  I hope that will be our aim in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, like my colleagues, have representations from constituents anxious to obtain information in relation to Romanian adoptions.  I am aware of people who have been to Romania and of their frustrations when they returned home to find that they were in a legislative <Col N="2491" /> limbo.  We have all seen the pathetic pictures on television.  We have all instinctively wanted to do something about it. The children we saw on television are definitely at risk and in need of urgent remedies.  The long term reasonable response to such problems is to help to evolve structural change in Romania. That takes a long time and we have to ask ourselves what we can do in the meantime while these proposals are being advocated.</P>
    <P>Many feel that to take children from an undesirable environment and to give them love, care and a good home is the answer.  I will not disagree with that but it is a simplistic answer.  The issue must be looked at carefully.  The committee will do their best to ensure that the best interests of the children, the adoptive parents and the natural parents are considered. Unfortunately, many of the children in real need in Romania will not be adopted.  The children in the cots, the children with psychological problems will not be attractive to adopt.  I do not say that in a derogatory manner.  Those are also children who may be in need of adoption or fostering and perhaps people here could provide that service.  Naturally, the better families and the families with perhaps the education to get involved with adoptive agencies will adopt children.</P>
    <P>A question arises whether this Bill stemmed from the need to help children who live in undesirable or pathetic environments or from the need to fulfil a desire, or fill a vacuum here where there are not enough children for adoption.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Shatter, that due to social change here there has been a huge reduction in the number of children available for adoption, but that has not reduced the number of people who want to adopt children.  I feel for those people who have the ability to be excellent adoptive parents.  That need should be looked at.  I hope this Bill and the concept of foreign adoptions will help that process.  Perhaps this will relieve the anguish of many people who have not been able to adopt and who feel they are being unfairly treated.  I hope this Bill will alleviate this problem to a degree <Col N="2492" /> and help people who wish to be adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>Not to be totally apolitical about the situation, it always takes me by surprise to see that Deputy Shatter is the bastion of all caring legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Members in the back benches are just as willing, just as anxious and have been as influential as any with the Minister.  The beavers in the back benches are often as good as and even better than Members in Opposition.</P>

      <P>Déanaim tagairt speisialta don mhonarcha i gCill Charthaigh a dúnadh ar na mallaibh, Éadach Chonamara, monarcha a dtug mé cuairt air don chéad uair i 1980, agus sa cheantar sin ag Éadach Chonamara agus Snáth Chill Charthaigh bhí 200 duine fostaithe, ach inniu, is truamhéileach an cás é: níl fostaithe sa dá mhonarcha sin ach 46 dhuine, is é sin go bhfuil 160 duine tar éis a gcuid post a chailliúint san am sin agus 53 ansin seachtain nó coicís ó shin nuair a dúnadh Éadach Chonamara.  Ag an am a bhfuil mé ag tagairt dó, 1980, bhí 100 duine eile ag obair i monarcha Ballymoon agus níl ansin i láthair na huaire ach thart faoi scór.  Mar sin de, tá, ar a laghad, 250 post caillte ag Cill Chárthaigh le tamall anuas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag monarcha Éadach Chonamara, a ndearna mé tagairt dó, tá tionscal an bhréidín, tionscal éadach olla bunaithe ansin ó 1928, mar tá traidisiún agus scileanna agus eolas ag na daoine ar obair éadach olla, agus bhí sníomh ansin i bhfad, fiú amháin, sular cuireadh an mhonarcha ar bun agus, leoga, is é ceann de na chéad mhonarchana a cuireadh ar <Col N="2493" /> bun sna ceantair Ghaeltachta sna ficheadaí fá choinne fostaíocht a chur ar fáil ansin.  Bhí Teachta Dála ansin romham féin agus roimh an Aire Stáit a thug aire ar leith don cheantar sin, Mícheál Óg Mac Pháidín, agus chuidigh sé le forbairt an tionscail sin agus le cur chun cinn an tionscail sin, ach inniu, mar a dúirt mé, níl ach 46 fostaithe ansin.  Bhí an tionscal ansin roimh Údarás na Gaeltachta agus bhí mé féin ansin seachtain ó shin, ag cruinniú eile coicís ó shin agus bhí míshásamh mór ar mhuintir an cheantair mar ní raibh a fhios acu cad a tharlóidh dóibh sna blianta atá romhainn mar nach bhfuil fostaíocht ar bith fágtha ansin dóibh.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh said ag cur an lochta ar Údarás na Gaeltachta mar thuig an tÚdarás go raibh deacrachtaí ag an monarcha seo agus chuir siad pacáiste tarrthála le chéile a cuireadh ar aghaidh chuig Roinn na Gaeltachta agus an Rialtas mí na Samhna seo caite agus rinne siad an rud céanna, pacáiste curtha ar aghaidh fá choinne Shnáth Chill Charthaigh fosta agus is cosúil nár tugadh aird ar mholadh an Údaráis, níor tugadh freagra air agus nuair nár tugadh, is é an chríoch a bhí leis an scéal ná gur dúnadh an mhonarcha.  Is é an eagla atá ormsa agus an eagla atá ar mhuintir Chill Charthaigh go bhfuiltear chun an dearmad céanna a dhéanamh de mholtaí Údarás na Gaeltachta maidir le Snáth Chill Charthaigh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire Stáit as an dáilcheantar liom féin agus an dáilcheantar ina bhfuil an tionscal seo, aird ar leith a thabhairt ar an cheantar seo, a chinntiú go gcuirfear fostaíocht ar fáil do na daoine seo sna ceantair fhíor-Ghaeltachta seo.  Tá moladh déanta agam féin go mbeadh ionad sciúrsála snátha ansin a dhéanfadh freastal ar an tír ar fad.  Ceantar fíorstairiúil é: tá foireann pheile acu, an fhoireann pheile, b'fhéidir, is fearr i dTír Chonaill le cúig bliana anuas agus tá craobh an chontae bainte acu, Comórtas Peile na Gaeltachta.  Tá said ag obair sa mhonarcha agus mura gcuirtear obair ar fáil dóibh ní bheidh aon rud i ndán dóibh ach an imirce.  Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire cad atá ar intinn aige a dhéanamh agus, uimhir a dó, an mbeidh sé ábalta tarrtháil a thabhairt do Shnáth Chill Charthaigh?</P>

      <P>Is cúis bhróin dom mar Theachta Dála don cheantar agus mar Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta go bhfuil leachtaitheoir ceaptha d'Éadach Chonamara Teo.  ó 28 Eanáir &mdash; cuideachta Ghaeltachta a bhí ag feidhmiú sa tionscal bréidín i gCill Charthaigh le fada agus a bhí an-tábhachtach d'eacnamaíocht Ghaeltacht iardheisceart Dhún na nGall.</P>
      <P>Níl i gceist agam dul isteach go mion sna cúiseanna gur theip ar an ngnó seo ach le roinnt blianta anuas tá laghdú ar an éileamh ar bhréidín ní amháin in Éirinn ach ar fud an domhain de bharr athruithe i bhfaisean, rud a chuir isteach go tubaisteach ar Éadach Chonamara Teo.  ó thaobh orduithe de.  Ba mhaith liom a threisiú gur thug Údarás na Gaeltachta lántacaíocht don fhochuideachta seo dá chuid thar na blianta.  Mar eolas don Teach tá beagnach £1.5 mhilliún curtha ar fáil ag an Stát tríd an Údarás don chuideachta seo.  Is tubaisteach an rud é go bhfuil líon mór post caillte ach is oth liom a rá nach raibh neart air sin. Tuigim ón Údarás go mbeadh suim ollmhór airgid nach bhféadfaí a mholadh ag teastáil le go leanfadh an chuideachta ag trádáil, fiú leis an infheistíoch mhór sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta McGinley an pacáiste a cuireadh chuig mo Roinnse.  Is fíor go raibh iarratas ón Údarás an chead chun ráthaíocht bhreise a thabhairt i leith áiseanna rótharraingt bhainc méadaithe d'Éadach Chonamara Teo.  faoi bhráid mo Roinne.  Nuair a b'éigean cruinniú creidneoirí a thionóladh, fágadh breithniú an iarratais sin ar leataobh le haontú an Údaráis.  Nuair a ceapadh leachtaitheoir ní raibh feidhm a thuilleadh leis an iarratas le haghaidh ráthaíochta méadaithe. Ar eagla aon mhíthuisceana ba mhaith liom a rá go soiléir nach sábhálfaí an gnó dá mbeadh cead ar fáil le haghaidh na ráthaíochta méadaithe sin amhail mar atá á mhaíomh ag daoine áirithe agus ag an Teachta anseo anocht, cé go bhfuil a fhios aige ina chroí istigh nach féidir é sin a shabháil leis an £150,000 sin.  Tá a fhios aige go maith nach féidir, agus a fhios sin ag go leor daoine eile atá ag rá gur chuir an Roinn deireadh leis an chomhlacht. Ní dóigh liom gur féidir le Teachta ar bith sa Teach a rá go bhfuil níos mó suime aige sa dáilcheantar sin ná mar atá agam <Col N="2495" /> féin nó ag an Teachta Coughlan, a thagann chun m'oifige gach lá chun brú a chur orm maidir leis na comhlachtaí seo. Maidir le Snáth Chill Charthaigh, tá sé sin á scrúdú agam faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na dífhostaíochta i nGaeltacht iardheisceart Dhún na nGall, tá an tÚdarás tar éis an ceantar sin a aithint mar cheantar ina bhfuil iarracht as an ngnách le déanamh i 1991-92 chun fostaíocht bhreise a spreagadh ann.  Tá coiste ar leith bunaithe laistigh den Údarás chun feidhm phraiticiúil a thabhairt don iarracht sin.  Tá ceist Dála faoi sin faighte agam ón Teachta tráthnóna inniu le freagairt Dé Máirt seo chugainn agus is féidir glacadh leis nach mbeadh aon rud eile le rá agam faoin ábhar dá bhfreagrófaí an cheist sin.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil deontas ceadaithe do chomhlacht phróiseála éisc sa cheantar sin agus tá súil agam go mbeidh siad sásta dul isteach ansin chomh luath agus is féidir, agus geallaim go bhfaighidh siad cibé cuidiú atá riachtanach ó Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Cheana féin ó thús 1991 thug tionsclóirí ón taobh amuigh cuairt ar an gceantar mar chuid dá bhfiosrúcháin maidir le tograí a bhunú.  Tá sé róluath a rá ag an bpointe seo cén toradh a bheidh ar na cuairteanna sin.  Chomh maith leis sin bíonn an tÚdarás báúil i gcónaí d'iarratais ar chúnamh ó mhiontionsclóirí ón gceantar. Tá roinnt tograí den chineál sin á bplé ag an Údarás don cheantar ach b'fhearr liom gan a thuilleadh a rá fúthu faoi láthair ar aon nós.</P>

      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton has been given permission to raise the question as to whether the new Government Buildings are accessible to a fire brigade with a turntable ladder and whether in the matter of the restoration fire regulations were borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us were startled by the finding that the fire tender that tried to gain access to Government Buildings was unable to do so.  It was brought to light on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne <Col N="2496" /> Show&rdquo; and we are all glad that the diligence of this research brought it to light.</P>
      <P>However, the real bombshell for anyone interested in fire safety is the complacency there appears to be in Government circles about this finding. It would seem that the Government's attitude is that &ldquo;a fire can never happen to us.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, we live in a time when that is far from being the case.  We only need to look at the events of last week when there was a mortar attack on 10 Downing Street to get a harrowing reminder of how things can go very much wrong.  We have had an example of what lies behind Government thinking when it comes to fire safety.</P>
      <P>The reason the fire brigade obtained these fire tenders with turntable ladders was essentially to try to service fires in buildings like the new Government buildings.  These high buildings require big ladders to gain access to them.  In the case of the Government's own building, the presence of a helicopter, and the likelihood of highly flammable fuel in the area, obviously adds to the risks.  Not only does the fire tender give access by way of ladders to a great height, it also acts as a water tower which is an essential part of fire fighting.</P>
      <P>It seems crazy, at a time when the Minister for the Environment is congratulating himself on having invested money in extra equipment for the fire service, that this fine piece of equipment cannot be used in Government Buildings.</P>
      <P>The alternatives that seem to be protrayed for fighting a fire in Government Buildings are extraordinarily convoluted and would never be suggested as an effective fire fighting strategy.  I have heard the suggestion that fire fighters will be expected to go over the top of the building.  That makes no sense.  If there is a fire underneath, firefighters cannot cross a burning building, and they certainly could not get people out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are facing a very serious issue of public confidence in the Government's approach to firefighting.  The Minister was congratulating himself on the publication of guidelines for fire safety in places of assembly.  Those guidelines do not have statutory force but he was congratulating himself that this was a great <Col N="2497" /> step forward.  Now we discover that the Government are ignoring the rudiments of safety in their buildings.  The new equipment cannot be used.  It would be hard to blame others for cutting corners if this is the approach the Government are taking.</P>
    <P>This whole issue illustrates, in a very telling way that rhetoric could not illustrate, why there is a need for statutory minimum requirements in regard to fire standards in buildings generally.  Such standards, with legal force, were recommended by the Stardust Tribunal when they reported following that tragic fire ten years ago.  Those findings are as true today as they were then.  The Government should take this issue seriously and make the corrections that need to be made to ensure there is proper access to those buildings for the fire fighing service.</P>

      <P>I can answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the Deputy's two questions as put.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to assure Deputy Bruton, the Members of this House and, indeed, all the staff in the buildings concerned who may have been alarmed by recent reports that the refurbishment works carried out in Government Buildings &mdash; including the fire prevention and fire fighting facilities &mdash; were carried out to the highest standards.</P>
      <P>The standards for fire safety for Government Buildings are set by the proposed building regulations, 1983.  While these are not statutory provisions, the Office of Public Works abide by them.</P>
      <P>The Government Buildings complex meets the current regulations governing access for all types of fire tenders.  Unlike most buildings, there is 100 per cent accessibility for fire tenders and turntables to the external perimeter.  The courtyard facade is also accessible to standard tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Regulations are mainly concerned with the provision of internal escape routes to safe places.  These have been provided in the refurbishment works.  An automatic fire alarm system provides an early warning service.  In addition, there <Col N="2498" /> is a 24 hour manned fire-watch provided by the Army.</P>
    <P>The regulations relating to fire hydrants have been met with three hydrants replacing the single unit previously located in the courtyard and supplementing those on the perimeter roadway.</P>
    <P>The building is fully equipped with dry risers and hose reels at each floor level. Dry risers are an alternative to turntable ladders from a fire-fighting point of view in most situations.  The provision of fire extinguishers is in accordance with recognised codes of practice.</P>
    <P>Special fire fighting provisions have been made for the roof top helipad.  All fire safety arrangements are under the control of the Army guard.</P>
    <P>The Government Buildings complex requires a high level of security.  The three gates fronting onto Merrion Street are manned around the clock to prevent unauthorised entry.  The special security requirements at the central gate in their present form only prevent entry for the fire brigade's larger extendable ladder, but allow entry for all other fire appliances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one moment.  The other two gates allow access for all fire appliances, including the appliance the Deputy referred to.  Fire safety and security procedures are kept under constant review. I hope, therefore, that Deputy Bruton's fears are now allayed.  He need have no worries.  There is no problem there whatever.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte gave me notice of his intention to raise the decision of the Department of <Col N="2499" /> Health not to proceed with the construction of the long promised Tallaght Regional Hospital in 1991.  Deputy Rabbitte knows the procedure&mdash;five minutes to his good self and five minutes to the Minister of State to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am deeply grateful to you for permitting me to raise this urgent and vital issue because of the importance of the proposed new Tallaght Regional Hospital not only for the people of my constituency but the wider population of the regional catchment area.</P>
      <P>The people of Tallaght, Clondalkin, Walkinstown, Rathcoole and the surrounding region have greeted with disbelief, shock and dismay the reply given by the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, to my parliamentary question last Thursday when he stated, &ldquo;the building of the new Tallaght hospital will not commence in 1991&rdquo;.  Despite rumours since budget day, 30 January, this decision was a bombshell for the people of the area who looked forward to the hospital at last commencing in 1991.  People see not only the desperately needed local facility which the hospital offers in terms of hospital care but also a badly needed boost to economic activity in the Tallaght region and the promise of jobs at construction stage to some of the thousands of unemployed building workers in the area.</P>
      <P>I tried to raise this matter with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business but to no avail.  Finally, on 7 February the Minister for Health revealed shattering news for a constituency that has been underprovided and whose electorate have had to fight for everything they got. How can the Minister, and the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government, justify this appalling decision? After all the sod turning, promises and disappointments, the Minister told me on 6 March 1990, in answer to a parliamentary question that, &ldquo;The Tallaght hospital project is currently at an advanced stage of planning and it is expected that construction will commence in 1991 and that commissioning will be completed by 1994.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2500" /> I pursued the Minister again as recently as 29 November 1990 when he told me, &ldquo;The Tallaght hospital board have recently submitted the list of selected tenderers for approval to my Department&rdquo;. Surely people were justified in taking from that reply that at last the contractor would be on site in the summer of 1991. I want to put the full text of the Minister's reply to my question of 7 February on the record of the House.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Tallaght hospital project is currently at an advanced stage of planning and it is expected that construction will commence in 1991 and that commissioning will be completed by 1994.</P>
    <P>I pursued the Minister again as recently as 29 November 1990 when he told me:</P>
    <P>The Tallaght hospital board have recently submitted a list of selected tenderers for approval to my Department.</P>
    <P>Surely people were justified in taking from that reply that at last the contractor would be on site in the summer of 1991. I want to put the full text of the Minister's reply to my question of 7 February 1991 on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation available to my Department for 1991 does not allow for the commencement of any major new capital project.  In the circumstances the building of the new Tallaght hospital will not commence in 1991.  I am at present preparing a submission to Government on the capital requirements of the health services in future years and this will include provision for the Tallaght project.</P>
    <P>What in Heaven's name are the people of Tallaght and Clondalkin and the surrounding region to make of that reply? What does it mean?  When will work on the Tallaght hospital commence?</P>
    <P>I recall for the House that in the Tallaght area alone we are talking about a bigger population than Limerick city and I remind the House that a Government backbencher withdrew his support from the Government because of the threatened closure of one of three hospitals in the city of Limerick.  We have a larger population in my constituency than that <Col N="2501" /> city and we have no hospital.  How can the Government justify, for example, the implications of this for the tens of thousands of children in Dublin South-West and the surrounding area?  It has been planned since the FitzGerald report of 1968.  The Tallaght hospital board was set up in 1980.  The Fianna Fáil Party campaigned for office on the promise that it would &mdash; and I have the card here &mdash; provide a rapid rail service and complete the Tallaght hospital.  Only last Saturday I had to leave my advice centre early in order to bring a mother and her child to the Children's Hospital after the child had pulled down a frying pan on top of himself.  The alternative that mother had was that she would wait to take two buses to the Children's Hospital.  It is almost unbelievable that the Government announced this decision on the same week as they appointed a TD from the constituency, Deputy Chris Flood, to become Minister of State at the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>It is generally believed that the appointment of a Minister from the constituency would be helpful to such major projects in his own constituency.  This must be the first example known where the appointment of a Minister was accompanied by the Minister's own Department stopping a project.  It has been said that the purpose of Deputy Flood's appointment has been to secure a second seat for Fianna Fáil in Dublin South-West.  Things have come to a very sad state indeed if the winning of a second seat for Fianna Fáil in Dublin South-West is considered more important than the building of a hospital for the people of Dublin-South-West.  I want to know tonight from the Minister for Health and indeed from the two Ministers of State from my own constituency, who I am glad to see are in the House, Deputy Flood and Deputy Harney, when work on the Tallaght Regional Hospital will commence and when it will be commissioned? That is the question that concerns the people of Dublin South-West who have been so dismayed and disappointed by the Minister's and the Government's decision.</P>

      <P>I am very glad the <Col N="2502" /> Deputy has afforded me this opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the new hospital at Tallaght.  As Deputies will be aware, we have embarked over the past 15 years on a major development programme in our general hospital service. This has culminated in the upgrading of many hospitals and the building of a number of major new hospitals throughout the country.  In so far as Dublin is concerned, the original plan provided for six major hospitals, three on the north side, Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital and Blanchardstown Hospital, and three on the south side, St. James' Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>With the opening of the new Mater Hospital recently and the commissioning of the new hospital at St. James' later this year, the only remaining part of the overall plan to be put in place will be the new hospital at Tallaght.  Tallaght always was and continues to be an integral part of the overall plan for hospital services for greater Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospitals will form the nucleus of the new hospital at Tallaght. These hospitals otherwise known as the MANCH group have been closely associated since the move to Tallaght was first mooted.  The new general hospital at Tallaght will serve the south-west of County Dublin, County Kildare and west Wicklow. The hospital will have a wide range of specialities and, as already mentioned, the existing Meath, Adelaide and National Children's hospitals will form its nucleus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tallaght hospital project has now reached an advanced stage in the planning process.  The total estimated cost of the project is £118 million.  The construction period will be four years following which a further 18 months will be <Col N="2503" /> required for commissioning.  The present position is that the capital allocation to my Department in 1991 does not allow for the commencement of any major new capital project.  However, my colleague the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon and I are at present preparing a programme of capital developments for the health services over the next few years and I wish to assure the House that this will include as a priority item provision for the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>

      <P>The rising costs of keeping students at university and other colleges is now causing severe financial hardship to many parents.  The burden on parents of middle income families in paricular in maintaining students away from home is now intolerable.  A family with three dependent children which earns in exess of £15,400 will receive no help whatsoever.  Parents who are not entitled to fees subvention or maintenance grants are under great financial pressure and in many cases have to forego their life savings or have to resort to second mortgages or loans.  The financial burden is particularly difficult where students are required to live away from home to pursue their third level studies.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant system clearly needs a radical overhaul otherwise the cost of university education will be beyond the reach of many middle income families.  In the meantime I recommend that the following measures be implemented in the Finance Bill: allow parents to offset course fees against their tax liability at the standard rate and also revise the grants scheme immediately so that eligibility for fees and maintenance are assessed on residual income as is the case in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I will deal with the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour under two headings: the question of Sealink and its retention and upgrading and the matter of the marina.  I am glad the Minister for the Marine is present as I know he is very supportive of matters in Dún Laoghaire and, more particularly, matters related to Dún Laoghaire Harbour. A campaign has been conducted by the Dublin Port and Docks Board to bring about a unified car ferry terminal. The logic of that argument is that there is a suggestion that the car ferry from Dún Laoghaire be relocated in Dublin Port.  We find that utterly unacceptable. What we in Dún Laoghaire want, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil organisation, is a commitment and a statement from the Government that the car ferry terminal <Col N="2506" /> remain in Dún Laoghaire, that it be upgraded accordingly and that passenger facilities be properly geared to the modern day needs of people travelling overseas and more particularly between Dublin and Holyhead.</P>
      <P>The second thrust of my urgings to a supportive Minister this evening is the question of a marina, or marinas, for the Dún Laoghaire Harbour complex. This argument has been going on for a number of years.  I have raised it here from time to time as I have raised the Sealink problem over many years.  I would appreciate if the Minister would indicate to the House that in the short term the interim harbour board will be reporting on this and other related matters, not only on the forthcoming hopeful installation of a marina or marinas in Dún Laoghaire Harbour but that they would also be making statements in relation to the future of Sealink specifically in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to Sealink and their directors who employ in excess of 120 people in Dún Laoghaire.  One can appreciate that if there was any suggestion that Sealink would be lost to Dún Laoghaire it would be a major economic blow to the area.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy Deenihan I will put the second part of the question raised in relation to the revision of grants, to my colleague, the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the possibility of tax relief as raised by him, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that providing this relief would involve a significant cost in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer.  In addition, introducing such a relief would be bound to generate claims from other taxpayers arising out of their varied personal and domestic circumstances.  The resultant loss to the Exchequer would have to be made up by increased taxation elsewhere.  In any event the Exchequer already spends heavily on third-level education both by way of direct allocation to the third-level institutions themselves, subsidies which are of benefit to all students, and by way of the higher <Col N="2507" /> education grants scheme.  In total subsidies to third level education, including the European Social Fund receipts, will amount to nearly £300 million in 1991. In addition, many students benefit from covenants which are also an increasing cost to the Exchequer running to something of the order of £20 million.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that the taxpaying parents of third-level students will have benefited significantly from the income tax reductions of recent years which include the reduction in the top rate by 6 percentage points and the bottom rate by 6 percentage points bringing the top rate down to 52 per cent and the bottom rate to 29 per cent.  During those same few years the standard rate band has also been increased by £4,000 for a married couple.  They are the facts. Unfortunately we have to look at the situation: if I give more tax in one place I have to take it from another.  I am sure we will come back to this matter again during the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to be able to reply to the two questions raised by Deputy Andrews.  I feel I owe him a deep debt because at one stage he got around to his friends the fishermen at Dún Laoghaire, about 20 years ago, and got some very nice fresh fish for me.

      <P>It is a pleasure for me now to say that I am aware of the recent announcement of plans by Sealink to <Col N="2508" /> increase the number of sailings scheduled from Dún Laoghaire during 1991.  In so far as these proposals provide for the accommodation of increased traffic through the harbour and into the country, thereby contributing to the target set for the expansion of the national tourist industry, I shall ensure that Sealink's operations at Dún Laoghaire will be supported in every way possible.  The interim Dún Laoghaire harbour board have been working closely with Sealink in the course of the preparation of the board's outline development plan for the harbour and how it would impinge on the ferry terminal facilities.  I have already indicated &mdash; and I can assure the Deputy because he has expressed his concern about it &mdash; my total support for the retention of the ferry service to Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
      <P>With regard to the development of the tourist and commercial amenity of Dún Laoghaire Harbour the Deputy is aware that I appointed an interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour board last year to advise on all aspects of the management and development of the harbour.  The board are at present drafting an outline development plan for the harbour which will encompass commercial and recreational amenities alike.  As soon as this plan is ready the board intend to mount a public display of their proposals and to afford all interested parties an opportunity to make an input into the nature of the developments recommended for the harbour.  I have great hopes for Dún Laoghaire and its development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 25 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>The ordinary fees payable by school candidates for entry to the 1991 certificate examination are as follows: leaving certificate.  £37.50; intermediate certificate £34; and day-vocational (group) certificate £22.</P>
      <P>My Department implement a scheme to provide alleviation of fees in the case of any pupil attending school who is experiencing particular hardship.  For this purpose a total of more than £340,000 has been allocated to recognised schools and vocational education committees in respect of the 1991 examinations.  The amount of the reduction in the case of any individual pupil concerned under this scheme is determined at the discretion of the school authorities subject to the total amount of such deductions not exceeding the specified amount already notified to each school.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; fees payable by candidates who are attending school with a view to repeating the leaving certificate examination are as follows: £37.50 for one subject; £75 for two subjects; and £100 for three or more subjects.  Where, however, the parent or guardian of a school candidate repeating the examination is the holder of a current medical card only the ordinary fee payable by first time candidates applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary fees payable by external, i.e. non-school, candidates for entry to the leaving certificate examination are as follows: £41 for one subject; £80 for two <Col N="2270" /> subjects; and £115 for three or more subjects.</P>
    <P>The following reduced fees apply where an external candidate &mdash; has not sat the examination previously, or has taken only one or two subjects previously, or is the holder of a current medical card or is dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card: £14 for one subject; £26 for two subjects; and £37.50 for three or more subjects.</P>
    <P>With regard to the overall cost of the reliefs which I have outlined in regard to medical card holders the position is that, for each candidate, the amount of relief is related to the number of subjects taken.  It is estimated that the total relief afforded in 1990 to &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; candidates and external candidates, arising from the measures which I have outlined, was about £160,000.</P>
    <P>I should add that a candidate attending school with a view to repeating the leaving certificate and who was already due to pay a reduced fee arising from possession of a medical card, could have the fee further reduced under this scheme at the discretion of the school authority.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the certificate examinations is about £12 million per year.  In 1990 the total amount collected in entry fees was approximately £5 million.</P>

    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> proposes very significant improvements in funding a post-primary school and in the educational provision <Col N="2271" /> for such schools.  A <i>per capita</i> grant of £50 per pupil for schools of 200 pupils and over, subject to a maximum grant of £17,500 per annum will be provided on a phased basis commencing in 1992 so as to expand the provision of caretaking and clerical services in these schools.</P>
    <P>The programme also provides for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, additional teaching posts targeted at the disadvantaged, expansion of guidance teaching and arrangements for the ex-quota recognition of vice-principals in larger schools thus freeing those teachers to assist to a greater extent in the day-to-day administration of schools.</P>
    <P>The programme also notes that the existing rates of capitation grants for schools will be considered in the light of an examination currently being undertaken of unit costs at primary and post-primary levels.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 38 and 41 together.  There are four post primary schools in what is known as the west Limerick catchment area: Stella Maris secondary school, Foynes, managed by the Mercy Order; Shanagolden vocational school under County Limerick VEC; Schoil Muire, Askeaton, a secondary school under lay management; the Salesian College, Palleskenry.</P>
      <P>I have recently approved, in principle, the provision of new accommodation at Scoil Mhuire secondary school, Askeaton.  In this regard, the manager of the school has now submitted detailed documentation to my Department where it is currently being examined.</P>

      <P>My Department are aware of the financial strain placed on parents of school pupils in providing school textbooks for their children and has drawn the attention of school authorities to the desirability of changing non-prescribed textbooks as infrequently as possible in order to save parents undue expenditure.</P>
      <P>The syllabus planners try to avoid over-frequent changes and are conscious that they should avoid any unnecessary increase in costs.  However, textbooks must be changed from time to time if teachers are to keep their work educationally stimulating and if content and methodology are to be kept reasonably up-to-date.</P>
      <P>Provision is made for payment of assistance towards the cost of textbooks in the case of necessitous pupils.  The scheme is administered through the principal teachers of the schools.  I am pleased to say the grant has been increased significantly over the past few years.</P>
      <P>At second level the increase was 20 per cent in 1989, 23 per cent in 1990 and it is proposed to implement a 10 per cent increase for 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For primary schools the rate of grant was increased in 1989 and 1990 by 40 per cent overall and it will be increased by a further 25 per cent in 1991.  This will allow a further increase in the rate of grant for pupils in standards I to VI and will also <Col N="2288" /> enable assistance to be made available for the first time to pupils in infant classes.</P>

Second, if the permission of the complainant is received a copy of the signed complaint is sent to the school's board of management and the board is asked to (a) send to the Department a copy of the teacher's written statement in full as supplied to the board of management, (b) give the views of the board of management on the teacher's statement, and (c) give the views of the board of management on the complaint in general. The board are reminded that it is responsible for the direct government of the school and are asked what action, if any, they have taken or propose to take in the matter.  They are also asked to send to the Department copies of any letters they may have which are relevant to the complaints.  Third, the board's reply is considered in the Department and, where appropriate, an investigation is carried out by the Department's inspector. Fourth, all details of the case are then examined and a decision is made as to what further action is required.  Fifth, when the investigation is completed the board of management and the teacher are informed of what action, if any, is being taken.

      <P>The total allocation &mdash; capital and current &mdash; for the VEC third level college and university sector for the years 1988 to 1990 together with the number of full-time students in each of the sectors for the academic years 1987-88 to 1989-90 are set out in the following tables.</P>
      <P>Variations in the level of grant allocation do not co-relate directly with proportionate variations in the student numbers due, for instance, to the need to provide for pay increases and inflation on the current side, replacement and renewal of existing accommodation on the capital side, the time lag between the initiation of capital projects and the full achievement of increased student capacity, and overall efficiency gains within the sectors.</P>

      <P>Schools in the North and South as well as in Britain, France, Belgium and Germany are already cooperating in the European Studies (Ireland and Great Britain) Project.  The aim of the project is to encourage pupils in the participating schools to explore the shared elements and the rich diversity in their historical and environmental heritage in a local and a wider European context.  The project is co-funded by the Departments of Education in Belfast, London and ourselves and a contribution is made by the Commission of the European communities.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education in Belfast and ourselves are also co-funding schools North and South which are co-spending in an environmental education project and a teacher exchange programme.</P>
      <P>Expenditure by my Department on all of these initiatives in 1991 will amount to about £200,000.</P>
      <P>On 6 February Lord Belstead, Deputy Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and myself jointly launched, in Dublin, a pack of teaching materials entitled &ldquo;From Conflict to Co-operation&rdquo;.  This pack focuses on the historical events leading to the conflict in Ireland in 1690.  It reflects a collaborative approval to the teaching of history and marks a new departure of the two Departments working together to produce teaching materials for use in second level schools North and South.</P>

A contract was placed in October 1988 for the sale as scrap metal of disused military vehicles from which servicable components had been salvaged for further use.  This arrangement was recommended by the military authorities in the interests of security and provided a more cost effective method of disposal.</P>

      <P>My Department have received a report of this campaign from the Irish section of Amnesty International.  The campaign principally concerns the disappearance of people of Western Saharan origin.  Ireland's position has always been to support the exercise by the people of Western Sahara of their right to self-determination.</P>
      <P>I have not made contact with the Moroccan Government in relation to this specific matter.  However, I took the opportunity of my visit to Morocco last May to convey to the Moroccan authorities the importance which the Twelve attach to their human rights policy, and the fact that it is a cornerstone of European Community relations with third countries.</P>
      <P>I also inquired about the Human Rights Consultative Council whose establishment in May 1990 is indicative of Morocco's concern to ensure that the rule of law prevails in the country.  I received an explanation of their objectives, composition and intended way of working.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with established practice, Ireland and its European Community partners continue to raise allegations of human rights abuses in China, both directly with the Chinese authorities and in the appropriate international fora.  Our appeals to the Chinese authorities cover <Col N="2299" /> all those arrested and punished for their political beliefs and not just those whose names are known.  The human rights situation in China remains a source of great concern to me, and once more I urge the authorities there to safeguard and guarantee the human rights of their citizens.</P>

      <P>Subject to certain conditions, there are concessions on VAT and excise duty available to severely and permanently disabled persons who purchase motor vehicles for their use as either drivers or passengers.  The concessions concerned are detailed in the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, S.I. No. 340 of 1989, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The scheme is currently under review in accordance with an undertaking given to the House last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the motorised transport <Col N="2300" /> grant scheme operated by the health boards.  Under the terms of this scheme, grants of up to £1,500 are available, subject to certain conditions, towards the cost of adapting a vehicle or buying a specially adapted vehicle for the purposes of enabling a physically disabled person to drive to his place of employment.  I understand that this grant would usually be available only in respect of the disabled person's first vehicle.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on the information available to the inspector, the taxpayer is entitled to a tax-free allowance of £2,992.  This allowance is absorbed by his income from the ESB. There is, therefore, no allowance available for set off against the taxpayer's other income.  The taxpayer is being taxed at 30 per cent at the moment whereas a higher rate should be applied. The inspector will review the position at the end of the tax year.</P>

      <P>There would appear to be some recent confusion surrounding this issue.  I therefore welcome the opportunity to clarify matters: there has been no decision by my Department to withdraw the designation of Kilkieran Bay, County Galway, and Mulroy Bay, County Donegal, as areas for shellfish farming.  These areas have been designated under section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, and these designations have not been changed or revised.</P>
      <P>The confusion arises out of recent media reports regarding the revision in classification of these two areas under a European Communities Directive.  This Directive does not alter the designation of areas for aquaculture under Irish law to which I have already referred.  The revision in classification has no effect on the trading ability of the two areas in question nor can it result in any deterioration of water quality standards.  It does not indicate any diminution in support for Kilkieran and Mulroy Bays as significant shellfish producing areas.</P>

      <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) plays an important role in assisting the fishing industry in developing markets for Irish seafood both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2308" /> The main focus of BIM's marketing activities is on market research, product development, and seafood promotion, with particular attention directed towards: underutilised and non-quota varieties; farmed fish; and added-value products.  The fast growing aquaculture sector in particular presents fresh marketing opportunities and challenges for BIM and the industry.</P>
    <P>Market research abroad is targeted on specific growth sectors of international seafood markets, such as the United States market for fresh and chilled prepacked salmon products and the UK market for seafood recipe dishes.  These sectors provide the basis for new product development and, more importantly, creation of additional employment. BIM's participation at major international food fair promotions will continue.</P>
    <P>BIM's market research and product development programme on the home market will be aimed at securing for Irish firms a stronger foothold in the import dominated sector of the Irish market.  By reducing the import share of the market by even 1 per cent we can save imports of £1 million, with consequential benefits to the economy through increased employment and an improved balance of trade.</P>
    <P>BIM's domestic promotional programmes, which encourage increased demand for Irish seafood, will be continued, with the assistance of trade and outside sponsorship.</P>
    <P>With the on going development of a more mature and sophisticated catching and processing sector, the industry itself will be in a position to develop increasingly its own capabilities in this regard.</P>

      <P>As I have already stated in a press release on 4 February last, a copy of which has been forwarded to the Deputy for his information, I welcome the Sea Trout Action Group's (STAG) report and the related research which was co-ordinated by the Salmon Research Agency.  The report is a significant contribution at unravelling the possible causes of the decline in sea trout stocks.  Following indepth evaluation of the report by my Department, in consultation with other bodies, it is hoped to reach our own conclusions on the subject and take whatever steps which can be justified in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the report I have directed my Department to examine most urgently what management steps should be introduced immediately.  I have directed that consultations be held with BIM, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the IDA and the Irish aquaculture industry and I am arranging to meet with STAG at an early date to discuss the situation.</P>
      <P>I intend to support the further work into the primary causes of the problem. I have also asked the Salmon Research Agency to prepare a programme of experimental measures aimed at improving stocks.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware my concern under the quota system has been, where possible to allocate additional quotas to small scale producers and other dairy farmers who have suffered particular hardship.  I have sought to assist them within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations.  I have, for instance, provided that at the priority categories to be covered in the arrangements for the distribution of flexi milk, the restructuring scheme and the temporary leasing scheme, include such producers.  I would suggest that the producer concerned should contact his co-operative or dairy regarding his possible entitlements in these matters.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for a free telephone rental allowance, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and must be living either entirely alone or only with dependent child/ren under 15 years of age and/or persons who are so permanently incapacitated that they cannot get help in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a qualifying payment.  He applied for the allowance in April 1989, July 1989 and November 1989.  These applications had to be refused because he was residing with his wife who, in the opinion of the Department's medical adviser, was not permanently incapacitated.  If the circumstances of the person concerned or his wife have changed in the meantime, he should reapply for the allowance and his case will be reassessed quickly.</P>

The arrangements are intended to cover persons who in the course of their careers have been insured for periods at the modified rate of PRSI for public servants and for periods at PRSI rates which provide cover for retirement and/or old age contributory pensions.  Accordingly, persons who have been insured for periods at the public service modified rate and for periods as self-employed contributors at the Class S rate would be covered by these arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the needs of adoptive mothers and I am examining what might be done to address those needs.

      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is a means tested payment made on a weekly basis.  Carer's allowance is also a means tested payment but it is paid by order book cashable at a post office.  Payment of carer's allowance would therefore have to be assessed as means in determining the amount of supplementary welfare allowance payable.  The carer's allowance of £45 was assessed as means against the person's supplementary welfare allowance and accordingly, the latter payment was withdrawn by the health board.  Any supplementary payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme would not be affected.</P>

      <P>Grants have been available from my Department towards the development of co-disposal landfill facilities by local authorities, capable of catering for industrial and domestic wastes.  The disposal of domestic wastes themselves has always been the responsibility of local authorities and I have no proposals to change the position. However, local authorities have, at my <Col N="2339" /> request, been preparing recycling plans for their areas and limited financial assistance for some of the measures involved may be possible under the scheme of recycling grants which my Department will again be operating in 1991.</P>

      <P>In 1968, Waterford Corporation made application under the Local Government Act, 1946, for the construction of a high level bridge across the Suir upstream of Redmond Bridge and further submissions were made in the succeeding years in support of the proposal.</P>
      <P>However, following receipt of a report by the corporation's consultants in 1979 on the hazardous condition of the existing Redmond Bridge, it was decided that the replacement of this bridge should take precedence over the proposal for a new high level bridge.</P>
      <P>The corporation proceeded with the replacement of Redmond Bridge and associated approach roads and the work was completed in 1987.  The scheme was funded 100 per cent from road grants provided by my Department which totalled £14.05 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1979, Waterford Corporation was informed that a public local inquiry would be held into its application for a bridge order for a high level bridge when it had clarified the position in regard to the acquisition of the necessary land.  It was also intimated that the replacement of Redmond Bridge would afford the corporation an opportunity to review the implications of the high level bridge proposal, particularly in regard to environmental and financial aspects and present <Col N="2349" /> and future traffic needs, and that information of this nature would need to be available for an inquiry into the bridge order application.  It is a matter for Waterford Corporation to compile the necessary information for submission to my Department.</P>
    <P>It is now primarily a matter for the corporation to decide whether further consideration should be given to this proposal which will have to be examined very closely in relation to the level of funding required compared to the benefits to be derived from it.  Provision is not made for the commencement of the project in the operational programme on peripherality which covers the period to the end of 1993.</P>

      <P>There are 288 adults and 97 children on the waiting list for ear, nose and throat treatment at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork.  The waiting list has decreased by about 317 or over 45 per cent since January of last year.  A second full time consultant ENT surgeon will be taking up duty at the hospital next month and I am confident that the service will continue to improve.</P>

      <P>The number and type of beds to be provided at Ennis County Hospital are matters for the Mid-Western Health Board. The board has given careful consideration to the question of hospital services for County Clare.  In determining the number of beds required at Ennis General Hospital the board examined the population of the area and its characteristics; the number of patients who travel outside the county for hospital treatment and the relationship which exists between <Col N="2356" /> this hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. Following assessment of all these factors the board decided that 78 in-patient beds and six day beds would be sufficient to provide an acceptable level of service.</P>
      <P>From time to time with extra demand for beds male and female patients may have to be accommodated in the same area.  However, every consideration is taken to provide them with privacy.</P>

      <P>Last year with my approval the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee had been authorised to provide permanent accommodation for a projected long term enrolment of 400 pupils on the site at Fonthill Road.  Additional temporary accommodation will be made available as required to cater for the anticipated short term peaking of enrolments in the school.</P>
      <P>It was intended initially that, pending the provision of a permanent building, the St. Kevin's community college pupils would be catered for in temporary accommodation on the Fonthill Road site.  The vocational education committee having considered how best to meet the needs of the pupils, decided to provide a block of ten general classrooms on the new site and to continue to use the former vocational school in Lucan for practical subjects, as a temporary measure, pending the construction of new facilities.</P>
      <P>The general classroom block provided will form part of the longer term provision for the school.  Accordingly, it will be integrated fully into the overall development to provide the 400 permanent pupil places.  As this first phase, therefore, meets the long term need for general classrooms the second phase of the development, for which architectural planning is proceeding, will provide the balance of the accommodation required for 400 pupils including the practical and other specialist facilities.  Appropriate provision will be made in due course in temporary accommodation for any additional short term requirements of the anticipated extra pupils above the 400 being catered for in the above mentioned development.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the circumstances under which this school is operating and every effort will be made to have the second phase of the development provided as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Consultants engaged by the school authorities have submitted tender documents to my Department and these are being examined.  It has been explained to the school authorities that the 1991 capital situation would not permit the invitation of tenders for the project at this stage but that the matter will be kept under review in the light of expenditure.</P>
      <P>My Department have recently approved a scheme of improvements to the existing school premises and these can proceed at once.</P>

My Department's officials have met with the school authorities since the fire occurred on 6 February 1991.  The local architect inspected the school premises on that day to assess the damage.  I can assure the Deputy that all necessary advices have been given to the school authorities and will continue to be available regarding the reinstatement of the building and the provision of temporary accommodation. The financing of the necessary measures is an insurance matter and no funds could be made available from my Department in this respect.  The school authorities fully accept this.</P>
