      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration as follows: the need for the Government to respond with disaster relief aid for the stricken people of Bangladesh, where tens of thousands are now dead and countless numbers are hungry and homeless as a result of a typhoon this week; the inadequacy of the funding provisions for Overseas Aid and Development which led to a mere £350,000 being made available by the Government for the Kurds and which restricts the ability of the Government to respond to the disaster in Bangladesh and to the crisis of catastrophic proportions which is developing in Africa where 27 <Col N="1874" /> million people are now at risk of starvation; and the urgent need for a Supplementary Estimate for Overseas Aid and Development.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would provide time for a debate on this urgent matter since your hands, a Cheann Comhairle, appear to be tied by Standing Orders.

      <P>Order.  I am not obliged to give reasons for my rulings in such matters but I feel I should say that the matter raised has not arisen suddenly. In fact, the said incident took place on Monday last.  The Deputy had ample means open to him to have the matter raised by way of ordinary notice on the Adjournment.  In addition, the question of the supplementary estimate, raised by the Deputy would require to be passed by the Dáil by way of separate motion and that clearly dilutes still further the urgency aspect of the matter.</P>

Will the Taoiseach clarify the Government's intentions in relation to legislation dealing with ill-gotten gains from crime? It would appear there is a disparity between the extra parliamentary spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats who stated this morning that the legislation was not forthcoming and the Minister for Justice who indicated by car phone some seconds later that legislation is well prepared.

      <P>In concluding, I wish to refer to the remarks of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Ray Burke, in the House on 7 February 1989 when he was replying on behalf of the Government to a Private Members' Bill introduced by the Progressive Democrats on this issue.  In the course of that contribution the Minister referred to the fact that the Fair Trade Commission had undertaken an investigation into the merits of the move from a control of abuse system to the introduction of a prohibition system.  He said that the report &ldquo;will be available to me within the next few months&rdquo;.  A couple of months ago I had cause to ask whether the report of that Fair Trade Commission investigation was available, and I was told it was not.  The first I heard of it being available was when the Minister, in his <Col N="1878" /> speech on Second Stage, referred to the fact that the report had been published simultaneously with the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have since had an opportunity to glance at the report of the Fair Trade Commission on this matter and suffice to say that it is a great deal more illuminating on the arguments of this important and critical area than is the explanatory memorandum which the Minister chose to accompany the publication of the Bill. I regret that the Minister did not decide to make reference in the explanatory memorandum to the fact that the investigation results of the Fair Trade Commission had been published simultaneously. It would have been of great assistance to the spokespersons, and other Members of the House, if the Minister had done that.  Many of the matters I raised on the last day have been dealt with to my satisfaction in this report.  I cannot see why the Minister would have any interest in concealing the existence of this report, and I am sure that was not his intention.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry started this debate by pointing to the fact that he, like the rest of us, had minimal time in which to study this critically important legislation dealing with a very complex issue.  That seems to be the trend now.  It happened with the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill.  It has added to the obfuscation, that a report like this is available and the Minister only chose to announce it in his Second Stage speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to refer briefly to the remarks of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this matter during the debate of 7 February 1989, when he listed, presumably with the active encouragement of the departmental officials, a list of disadvantages about introducing the prohibition system.  The Minister referred to the huge volume of agreements notified to the commission with the ensuing long delays and the necessity to issue negative clearances. The Minister dealt with the question of which of the commission's existing powers could be transferred to the Fair Trade Commission and which of them could be operated by the Minister.  He <Col N="1879" /> referred to the EC prohibition system and said it would be likely to be extremely costly in terms of its operation and enforcement.  That point was made in 1977 and now by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce who was also Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1977.  Deputy Burke, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, went on to say in the debate in 1989 that the absence of an efficient and adequately staffed authority would result in an extremely onerous and expensive burden of litigation being placed on business.  I presume the Minister's response then had the full support and encouragement of the Department officials.  Do we take it that the attitude of the officials in the Department has changed, that the arguments adduced in the report of the Fair Trade Commission have convinced the Department officials, and the Minister, that whatever about the down side of introducing the prohibition system, the advantages outweighed it?</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised about which I am curious, although I did not have time to study this in the detail I would have liked.  For example, I refer the Minister to the letter of March 1988 from the chairperson of the Fair Trade Commission to the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which was reprinted in the report of the Fair Trade Commission, setting out the matters on which he felt it necessary to seek the advice of the Attorney General.  One of the matters raised in the letter was one to which I referred on the last day.  The chairperson said:</P>
    <P>We are at present undertaking the study requested in the terms of reference and considering the merits and disadvantages of the prohibition system.  One view is that under the Irish Constitution it would not be possible for the FTC to be granted powers similar to those of the EC Commission because this would mean the carrying out of a judicial function.  Another view is that some of the powers of the EC Commission such as the granting <Col N="1880" /> of exemptions under Articles 85/3 are administrative procedures and that the FTC could, if legislation permitted it to do so, grant exemptions.  All decisions by the FTC, whether to grant or not to grant exemptions, could, of course, be appealed to the courts by aggrieved parties.</P>
    <P>That pertinent point, which we dealt with the last day, has to do with the competence, scope, role and powers of the Authority, what the Authority may do constitutionally and what they may not do, and the burden of litigation that will be imposed on business in the unequal circumstances that sometimes arise.</P>
    <P>In the introduction to the Fair Trade Commission report, in paragraph 1.12, the following is recorded:</P>
    <P>In March 1988, advice was sought from the Attorney General on a number of points in relation to the study.  At the time of completing this report, this advice has not been received.</P>
    <P>I am curious to know why, on a matter that is very pertinent to this legislation, the advice of the Attorney General should have been sought as long ago as 1988 and here we are with the Minister of the day explaining to the House that one of the reasons for the delay in the report was that some matters were of such legal complexity and in need of clarification that they were referred to the Attorney General.  The report, when it was eventually published, included a note that says that the Attorney General had not yet responded.  I would like the Minister to outline the reason for that.</P>
    <P>The Bill published by the Progressive Democrats in 1989 differs from the Bill the Minister has now brought before the House in a number of respects.  I do not know the reason for this.  Perhaps the Minister has been more influenced by departmental officials since his party introduced the original Bill but there are a number of differences which can be teased out on Committee Stage.  The proposer of the Progressive Democrats Bill in 1989 referred in particular to the area <Col N="1881" /> of professional services and the fact that under the law, as it stands, it is lawful for people offering professional services to engage in price fixing and collusion.  The man in the street regards himself to be at the mercy of a great many professions who it would seem to him, very often arbitrarily fix a scale of fees.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 15 on page 176 of the report states that the commission should consider preparing a block exemption for professional services.  I would like the Minister to outline his views on this matter and to state if it is his intention, in the context of the Bill before the House, to make such an application to the Competition Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House.  It forms part of the review of competition policy and consumer protection which has taken place over a number of years.  As part of the review the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, initiated the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987, the purpose of which was to extend and tighten up the system of competition legislation then in operation.  During that debate Deputy Reynolds promised that the system of competition would be examined by the Fair Trade Commission. The Bill before the House today largely reflects their findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission stated that a fundamental change was needed in Irish competition law.  The Government in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> outlined their commitment to reform competition law to ensure that our business and companies are well prepared to take advantage of the completion of the Single European Market. At European Community level, the decisive importance of new competition legislation has been emphasised time and again.  In 1987, the Commission published a report on competition law.  This Bill is part of Ireland's response and policy to ensure that the opening of the market will yield the best results for our business and they will be able to take full advantage of the new European market. <Col N="1882" /> Members on all sides of the House would agree that the anti-competition legislation in existence at present is confusing, unworkable, patchy and complicated. Indeed, it can involve extreme costs for the economy.  Some reforms have been implemented in this area but they have only tinkered with the system. Indeed, certain sectors are excluded from the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Businessmen operating in the context of the broader European Community have to deal with a system which in most cases is based on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and not on a system which is derived from the Restrictive Practices Act, 1987, which forms the basis of our domestic system.  The new system derives from Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The creation of a single market means far more than just a removal of tax barriers. In the new single market businesses will have to operate in a flexible, dynamic and efficient way.  I welcome section 6 of the Bill which will enable anyone who has been adversely affected or aggrieved by the anti-competition actions of others to go to court to seek damages.  The Bill will provide new mechanisms to deal with the so-called price wars of recent years in a way which will protect the interests of the consumer, the producer and the employee and at the same time allow freedom in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Competition is very healthy in any economy.  We have all seen economies fall where competition did not prevail. Not only does it result in greater care and attention and a better deal for the consumer, but on a productive level it encourages effectiveness, efficiency and improvements.  However, competition legislation must be based on a set of fair principles; in other words, while the marketplace should be encouraged to generate the lowest prices as a result of an efficient and fair system of competition, we must also ensure that certain regulations are in place and that the market is not reduced to the corruption of price fixing or the manipulation of prices by cartels.  Such practices are not in the interest of the consumer or producer who <Col N="1883" /> wants to be effective and efficient.  The true interests of the consumer and producer are two sides of the same coin; in other words, competition is not an end in itself, it is tied to the need to address the question of greater efficiency in production and greater choice and value for the consumer.</P>
    <P>While the marketplace must be free it must also be regulated in a fair and just way with the stress on the word &ldquo;regulated&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;controlled&rdquo;. Many small companies are frightened off by the larger players who exert excessive influence.  I mention this because of the recent controversy surrounding the sale of bread and milk.  Recently vital commodities were used by the multiples to maintain their first place in the retail sector.  The consequences of their actions are not known at present but as a result of their actions we will possibly see the closure of many small bakeries in the future as well as a lowering of prices in the current year.  The possibility is that in future the bakery business will be controlled by a very few small companies who will be able to determine the price by themselves.  I welcome this Bill and I am grateful to the Minister for introducing it because I feel this legislation will prevent the closure of small bakeries and similar companies in future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of sections 5 and 14 which qualify the old definition of &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; by a new one, the abuse of dominant position.  It is important at this stage to state that companies who are in a dominant position will have nothing to fear from this legislation provided they do not abuse the dominant position.  I am not here to adjudicate on the rights or wrongs of management or the workers involved in the ESB strike, but I wonder if it is possible to include the ESB monopoly in this Bill.  The ESB themselves have a dominant position.  When things went wrong last week the views or rights of the consumer were hardly taken into account.  The international credibility which we have built up over the last four years was damaged.  My colleagues, <Col N="1884" /> Deputy Kitt and Deputy Cowen, queried the adverse competitive effect of the use of the ESB billing system in promoting the sale of electrical goods through ESB shops.  We all know our own constituencies. In the constituency of Wexford many small retail outlets have had to close because of competition and the abuse of the ESB's dominant position in using the billing system to facilitate consumers.  The OECD has urged that policy in respect of such regulated sectors should be reviewed in order to justify or otherwise whether they should be exempt from the norms of competition policy.  I understand energy is one of these areas.</P>
    <P>The building societies have the major share of the mortgage market.  Recently I was researching the cost of mortgages and I found a great amount of hidden cost to the mortgage holder.  For example, on a £30,000 mortgage there could be a difference of £3,000 in repayments over a 20 year period.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to bringing the building societies under the new Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and I think it will have a number of very positive effects.  It will protect the consumer, the producer and the employees, and it will encourage efficiency and effectiveness in the marketplace.  It will prepare our companies and businesses to compete in the Single European Market in which many of our companies are already competing under Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  I wish the Bill a speedy progress through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we did not get sufficient time after the publication of the Bill to research it more fully.  I am also bewildered as to why the Minister for Industry and Commerce is seeking to rush this legislation through the House in advance of an examination of the report of the Fair Trade Commission on the 1987 Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order in relation to many aspects of fair trade and competition.  Maybe there is a hidden agenda in relation to the speedy implementation of this legislation.  This Bill has been signalled for quite some time but, in summary, I think it is a <Col N="1885" /> rationalisation of existing law, merging that with implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission, who reported on a study of competition policy around the same time as the publication of this Bill, have detailed many of the advantages and disadvantages and respective merits and demerits of a prohibition and control of abuse system for the regulation of competition.  I suppose the primary purpose of the considerable degree of publicity the Minister for Industry and Commerce has signalled in this matter is to outlaw anti-competitive practices to the benefit of the consumer and of further growth and employment and to remove barriers to growth and employment in the marketplace.  In the context of the developments of the EC and the completion of the internal market it is vital that our industry and our business generally are competitive, cost effective and able to cope with transactions that are taking place right across the frontiers of the various member states of Europe, particularly when one considers the huge disadvantages the Irish economy has to encounter because of our distance from the consumerism in the centre of the EC and access to 320 million people during the completion of the internal market which is ripe for a strategic marketing assault by the Irish business community. Anti-competitive practices in the Irish economy are a barrier to growth and employment and it is essential that these be eliminated.</P>

    <P>This Bill set out in a glorious blaze of publicity over a period of time to remove all the anti-competitive practices in the economy but I think the Bill's objective will fall far short of the general publicity this legislation has received.  There are many benefits in having the same law applied at national and European level and this is well explained in the report of the Fair Trade Commission.  This is hugely important in the context of 1992 and thereafter where it makes sense to have one law and one set of rules for export and import companies throughout the entire Community.  This can only be <Col N="1886" /> helpful to Irish people establishing businesses in other member states which have similar laws to our own.  Above all, it will mean that domestic companies will be familiar with competition law as already applied to them in their own home market.  This will make it easier for the European courts also to make easier and fast decisions on a European-wide basis. The opening up of all areas of business life to competition by prohibiting agreements which restrict or distort competition cannot but be good for consumers of goods and services.</P>
    <P>However, I am not convinced that this Bill tackles some of the many examples which have built up over the years of distortion in trade and anti-competitive practices.  Probably the best example we have had in recent years is the meat industry, which through the intervention of one individual has enjoyed a dominant position and has developed.  I think that is part of the reason the Minister has signalled a section in the legislation to prevent the abuse of this dominant position. In addition, there is a cartel between all the major players in the meat industry which has existed in relation to prices paid to producers for many years.  For example, there is no recourse in the legislation for a producer, to initiate an action in order to take a case before the courts in regard to this legislation and to bring to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade or to the courts that there is abuse of a dominant position to the detriment of the price being paid to the producer.  In spite of the huffing and puffing in relation to this matter while in Opposition, the Minister has failed to tackle the fundamental problem of the dominant position in the meat industry.  His failure to define what is meant by dominant position, is a major flaw in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Questions must also be asked about the activities of oil companies and the manner in which they treat retail outlets. The marginal profit enjoyed by retail outlets is minuscule and many retailers are under great pressure to meet their commitments, particularly when their outlets are located on less lucrative routes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> The Minister should spell out the impact of this legislation on the semi-State and public service sector generally, particularly in the light of the recent wildcat strike by ESB workers.  In view of the importance of electricity supplies and other essential services, it is essential that monopolies should not abuse their position. Telecom Éireann and An Post have recently issued anti-consumer proposals. The boards of these semi-State companies would seem to be allowed to do whatever they like, with total disregard for the consumer.</P>
    <P>A major flaw in the Bill is the lack of any vehicle to allow the Director of Consumer Affairs to initiate an action on competition grounds against a semi-State body.  The Consumers Association of Ireland, which represents a broad range of consumer interests, should be able to initiate an action through the Director of Consumer Affairs if it is felt that the consumers' interest is not being represented. We are all aware that actions are sometimes taken by individuals simply for the sake of it and we must ensure control of the kind of actions that can be taken by an individual.  I suggest that the Consumers Association could act as a filter.  The Bill is not giving the necessary teeth to the consumer, who should be the main beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Companies do not react in a positive manner to voluntary regulation and pleas for some by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The life assurance companies decided some time ago to introduce a code of ethics governing sales techniques in that business.  This is not working and there is evidence that it is still common practice to offer inducements to intermediaries to sell a particular product, irrespective of its merits or demerits.  This is an abuse of a dominant and privileged position and it is not in the best interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>When the Companies Bill, 1987, was being debated in the Dáil and Seanad the question of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners and their treatment as preferential creditors in the event of the winding up of a company was examined. <Col N="1888" /> I took serious issue with the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and strongly opposed the continuation of the preferential position given to the Revenue Commissioners.  They have great powers at their disposal today which they did not have some time ago through powers of attachment and the sheriff's collection system.  It is inexcusable if taxation revenue is allowed to fall behind because of the inefficiency of the collection system.</P>
    <P>There is an in-built incentive for the Revenue Commissioners to stand idly by. This could compound the financial difficulties of a company if they were not aware of it in sufficient time and it could eventually result in the winding up of the company.  The Revenue Commissioners are quite sure they will get whatever money is due to them if the company is liquidated, due to their preferential status.  This is another example of the State's dominant position and I appeal to the Minister to review this question in the context of the Companies Act and to protect small suppliers who may go out of business because they are unable to collect debts due to them, being too far down the list of creditors.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the State should make such a major contribution to anti-competitive practices through the black economy. We are all aware of the disincentives to work and the fact that people are drawing social welfare benefits while working.  Existing laws are not enforced to eliminate the black economy. The taxation and social welfare systems can, because of their independent nature, promote an escalation of black economy practices.  The State plays a major part in the system which prevents contractors from competing when faced with competition from the black economy.  I hope the State will examine this matter in the context of legislation banning anti-competitive practices.  The State must take up the challenge of cleaning up the appalling legislation mess which is sapping the spirit of the PAYE worker and causing tremendous anger among legitimate beneficiaries of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not mention how we can force companies to compete in the <Col N="1889" /> marketplace.  It is wrong, for example, that very few companies in the motor insurance business are prepared to give a quotation for males under 27 years of age.  The State has protected the general lack of involvement by further foreign companies in the non-life insurance market due to the derogation from the 1988 non-life directive to protect the PMPA and the ICI.  Now that these rescues have been largely completed, I call on the Minister to open up the motor insurance market to foreign companies and make it more competitive.  While I appreciate that this will not mean a major change in the quotations being given to many motorists, the high risk element of the market can benefit from further foreign competition.  I am aware that 75 per cent of the insurance market is taken up by foreign companies but the fact that we have secured a derogation from the 1988 directive is preventing further foreign companies from entering the market.  It is not the most lucrative market to contemplate entry, particularly in relation to motor insurance.</P>
    <P>The banks and buildings societies operating through the Central Bank have a cosy cartel arrangement and do not compete for financial business.  This is not in the best interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have long espoused the removal of State agencies from involvement in policing the marketplace and have declared themselves to be in favour of a large degree of self-regulation. The pursuit of this objective was of paramount concern in the drafting of this Bill.  The Minister drew on extensive non-Civil Service expertise in drafting the proposals.  It is known that two or three of his advisers were practising barristers.  I suppose it is important to have a legal opinion on such matters but their influence is evident in the extensive emphasis placed in the Bill on recourse to the courts as the prime means of achieving redress and preventing the continuance of anti-competitive practices. Not only is the Bill a lawyers' oasis but it is bereft of any real commercial input.  It contains wide-ranging far reaching proposals, formulated in private, by and <Col N="1890" /> large, without consultation.  I call on the Minister to undertake wide-ranging consultation with many industries, one of which should be the food trade.</P>
    <P>Generally, the food trade must welcome the concept, intent and thrust of this Bill.  There are measures inherent in it which will have a negative impact on the food trade.  The trade must feel extremely vulnerable in so far as this Bill is proceeding so quickly, without consultation, and without the input of an indepth report by the Fair Trade Commission to be published in the summer. As drafted, its provisions do not include a ban on below-cost selling, something with which I want to deal for a few moments.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 was introduced as a result of a number of practices in the grocery trade in particular.  It was felt that small, independent grocers were not getting fair and equitable shares of or indeed opportunities to compete in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Various investigations and court cases have taken place.  In particular there was the 1980 court case in respect of the supermarket chain known as &ldquo;3 Guys&rdquo;, which constituted the beginning of the process and led to the adoption of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987.  That was the culmination of a long investigative, gestation period begun in the seventies and finally became law in 1987.  Few sectors of trade or industry have ever been subjected to the same degree of scrutiny as has the grocery and food trade generally.  There have been no fewer than six inquiries or reviews, in addition to a special review contained in the report of the 1984 Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses on the grocery trade.  Undoubtedly part of the reason for the involvement of the Fair Trade Commission every six or seven years is the dramatic changes that occur within that trade.</P>
    <P>There will be almost 81,000 persons in the food trade affected immediately and directly by the provisions of this Bill. For example, there are 39,243 people employed in grocery and convenience stores around the country.  My source for <Col N="1891" /> this figure is the Central Statistics Office. In addition, there are 38,000 people employed in the food and drink industry and 3,700 employed in the wholesale industry.  Those people have provided a tremendous service, particularly by way of neighbourhood shops and convenience stores, to the consumer.  We must take cognisance of their contribution to the service industry here.</P>
    <P>There is at present a constant battle for market share here, with multiples ever increasing their share at the expense of neighbourhood shops in small towns and villages, the impact of which on life in rural areas has been enormous over the past ten years or so.  The negative impact of the development of the multiples in the short term has been of some benefit to consumers resulting in lower prices for some commodities but, by and large, the consumer pays for the benefits they gain in respect of some products by ever greater margins being sought and achieved on other food products offered within the same chains.  This has resulted in many small businesses and shopkeepers going out of business.  Some large operators have gone out of business on this account also.  The best example of that was the H. Williams company who went out of business before the implementation of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill I suggest that the Minister re-examine the provisions of section 4 in order to allow consumers initiate action rather than merely leaving it to the competition Authority to invite any Government Minister to offer observations on the granting of a licence or certificate of negative clearance.  Consideration should be given to a time limit for the consideration of the granting of such licences or certificates such as applies in the case of a planning authority.</P>
    <P>The available list of anti-competitive practices and abuses is incomplete.  It should include below-cost selling as one form of abuse because of the numerous investigations and inquiries held into the grocery trade over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> Section 5 deals with the abuse of dominant position.  Will the Minister say whether these provisions cover beneficial involvement or ownership?  Will that be taken into account under the heading of &ldquo;abuse of dominant position&rdquo; or how will that matter be dealt with?</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with studies and analysis by the competition Authority.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte in his concern about this section in that I contend this section politicises this Bill.  We have had sufficient experience recently to believe that Fianna Fáil, in particular, are not capable of being apolitical when dealing with sensitive matters in regard to legislation of this kind.  I ask the Minister to re-examine this section in view of that experience and amend it accordingly.  It is not appropriate that the Minister only can initiate an investigation into abuse of a dominant position under the provisions of this Bill, when they could become highly politicised dependent on who are the independent players within the market at any given time.  There is a vagueness in relation to the term &ldquo;dominant position&rdquo; which is unacceptable and renders the provisions of sections 5 and 14 very weak, warranting clarification.</P>
    <P>There is a further contradiction in relation to the objective of the Bill.  The challenge of the Single Market in Europe is the reason this Bill has been introduced in that it is important that we have strong companies capable of competing in the European marketplace after 1992.  The provisions of this Bill could effectively render many Irish firms dominant under Irish law.  For example, there is a danger that its provisions could reduce companies' incentives to achieve such measure of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Another example of anti-competitive practices is the fact that the medical and legal professions here can prevent people from entering their professions by restricting the numbers who can become qualified practitioners.  That is anti-competitive and not in the spirit of the free market.  This practice is urgently in need of review.  For example, it is not acceptable that nobody can police the legal profession except their own members <Col N="1893" /> through the Incorporated Law Society. There is urgent need for lay, consumer representation on the boards of certain subsidiary committees of professional bodies, established by law or charter, or recognised by law.  In addition, scale fees should be abolished whether statutory, mandatory or otherwise.  The ban on advertising by professional bodies and the placing of an obligation on such bodies to introduce codes of advertising which must meet certain minimum information requirements should be removed. All of these matters have been the subject of Fair Trade Commission reports and to date the Minister for Industry and Commerce has failed to act on them.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the enactment of this Bill will be a bonanza for the legal profession. There is urgent need to establish a small claims court to alleviate the expensive actions envisaged under the Bill and prevent them ending up in the High Court.  From the consumer's point of view it is not acceptable that all actions must go to the High Court.  This means one is immediately involved in a very expensive legal procedure and may well render the provisions of the Bill inoperable in terms of any small grocer or individual who, because of lack of finance, will not be able to undertake the expensive process of taking a case, through the Director of Consumer Affairs or otherwise into court.</P>
    <P>No small supplier can expect to compete with multinational companies or multiples of any description to take a case to the High Court under this legislation. It is essential to establish, under consumer legislation, a consumer claims tribunal and a small claims court which would operate in an informal way and without legal representation to deal with small claims.  This would make it possible for the ordinary consumer to find it financially feasible to contribute to the process of removing anti-competitive practices in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The Competition Bill in itself does not address the real issues of the consumer. It has weaknesses in so far as it does not include the continuation of the ban on <Col N="1894" /> below cost selling which, as I stated earlier, was part of many investigations and inquiries over the years.  There are glaring anti-competitive practices in various walks of life in Ireland at present on which I need clarification.  The term &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; has not been defined in the legislation.  The abuse of a term that is not defined is too vague.  I welcome the Competition Bill and legislation to outlaw anti-competitive practices but there are deficiencies in the Bill which I wish to have clarified and amendments made accordingly in the course of Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I would like to say a few words on the Competition Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has introduced the Bill to this House.  We have had much debate and discussion over the last number of months in relation to the need for competition and some type of legislation to deal with it.  Indeed, we had a Private Members' Bill from the Fine Gael Party prior to Christmas when we discussed the possibility of competition in food processing.  That occasion gave many Deputies an opportunity to discuss the need for the introduction of legislation.  I am glad that the Government have now decided to introduce the Competition Bill, 1991.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to prohibit anti-competitive practices, agreements and abuse of dominant positions in the market. These provisions are based on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and will apply to all undertakings in the State engaged in trade in goods and services.</P>
      <P>In view of the major media attention that has focused on the milk industry over the last number of weeks in relation to Dunnes Stores and their efforts to sell milk below the normal price per pint, to which we have become accustomed, this is an opportune time to discuss the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pose a few questions to the Minister in relation to this Bill on how it will enable the Minister and the Government generally to look at areas such as banking, co-operatives, amalgamations such as the bread industry, the <Col N="1895" /> milk industry and other areas which need to be seriously examined.  For example, if one looks at the operations of banking it is plainly obvious that a nice cosy cartel is operating within the banking groups in Ireland.  Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks operate more or less the same charges for cashing cheques, lodging coinage, and for access cards where we have the highest interest rates in the EC. The same interest rates are charged to farmers and other business people in this banking system.  That is not competition. I would like to see the Minister intervene in conjunction with the business people, the farmers and the other consortia to take on the banks and break up the cartel which is operating particularly in relation to interest rates.  I have no doubt that the interest rates being charged to farmers at present are exorbitant.  It amuses me that the same interest rates are charged by the different banks.  This is one area in which the Government will have to become directly involved.  I do not know how it can be done but if the building societies and other financial institutions and if some financial institutions from outside Ireland were invited in we could have more reasonable interest rates charges particularly for business people and the farmers who are trying to provide jobs and a decent salary for their employees.</P>
    <P>Motor insurance was referred to by Deputy Hogan.  The prices charged to young drivers in this country are exorbitant and are way above what is being charged in the UK.  The reason given by the insurance companies is that young drivers are a high risk, that they are more prone to accidents and that, therefore, the cost of providing cover is very high. In some cases sums ranging from £1,400 to £1,500 are charged to young drivers under 25 years of age.  Surely in the UK also young drivers are a high risk and are prone to accidents.  Young drivers here are being ripped off by the insurance companies operating in Ireland.  They can give us all the reasons they wish for charging such high prices but they do not stand up if one looks at the situation in England and in the other EC countries where <Col N="1896" /> young drivers can get insurance for as little as £200, even allowing for the fact that they are under 25 years of age.  It is time the insurance market was opened up completely to companies in the EC and that we broke the monopoly that seems to exist in Ireland which is totally unfair to young Irish drivers and is prohibitive in their securing insurance.  It is one of the main reasons many young drivers are out there driving without insurance.  I would not condone that situation. I know many young people in low paid jobs who have to travel ten and 20 miles to work who need a car but because of insurance rates they find it practically impossible to pay the premium.  That is another area the Minister should examine.</P>
    <P>We heard a criticism from the far side of the House today about the new Bill, that it does not go far enough, that it will not meet all the problems that exist in relation to competition, below cost selling and the dominant position that may exist in the market.  It would be very difficult to introduce a Bill to legislate for all the cowboys who operate in the market at present.  There is no doubt that under different guises supermarkets, retail outlets, shopping outlets and co-operatives are all able to get around the legislation that exists.</P>
    <P>This Bill will go part of the way in solving the problem.  It may not go all the way but it is a step in the right direction and, hopefully, some of the people who operate in a cowboy fashion in the market will be brought to heel and we will not have the situation that has existed over the last two or three years in the market place.</P>
    <P>The food industry has been mentioned. It appears that this industry is open to abuse, such as the creation of monopolies and below cost selling.  It is very difficult to solve all the problems in this industry. If we cast our minds back to the bread war two years ago, we will recall that it had a devastating effect on jobs and resulted in the closure of many bakeries around the country.  Indeed in my own county of Wexford a substantial number of bakeries which had been in existence <Col N="1897" /> for up to 100 years were forced to close down because of the supermarket price war.  It is not just good enough to criticise the supermarkets for mounting the bread war because they had to get their supplies from somewhere and obviously some of the bigger bread producers wanted to squeeze out the small bakeries.  If that had been their purpose, they certainly achieved it but at the cost of a substantial loss of jobs.  People lost their jobs and had to go on the unemployment register and have had to live on unemployment benefit, which brings its own hardship. While the consumer may have benefited initially, if one considers the loss of jobs in the industry it was a short term gain. Indeed bread is now back to the price it was before the price war.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill I said that the price of milk was too high.  I still maintain that position.  The price paid to the farmers for a gallon of milk has dropped by 20p to 30p over the past two years, but this is not reflected in the cost of milk to the housewife.  I think the price of a pint of milk had dropped 1p since Christmas when the Bill was discussed in this House. I believe there is still room to drop the price of a pint of milk by 2p and I would ask the Minister to investigate this.  I do not go along with the notion that Dunnes Stores should be allowed to drop the price of a pint of milk by 10p or 11p but I believe that Avonmore, Premier, Tir Laighean, Snowcream and the other milk producers in this country are operating a cartel to keep up the price of a pint of milk.  There should be ministerial intervention, and a price order should be introduced if necessary to force down the cost of a pint of milk.  I said in December, and I repeat it today, that the housewives of this country are being ripped off by the milk suppliers.  I hope that the public pressure that is brought to bear will result in a fall in the price of milk as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We now hear a lot of criticism of the monopoly created in the marketplace by Mr. Larry Goodman's Food Industries. However any farmers in the real world will tell you that it was the intervention <Col N="1898" /> of Mr. Goodman's company Food Industries that brought competition into the beef, sheep and milk trade.  They forced up the prices substantially.  The price paid to the farmers at the farmgate was forced up.  They also introduced payments on the same day a farmer sold his produce. Everything that the Goodman group did was not bad but they found themselves in serious financial difficulties because of circumstances, the Gulf War and what was happening in Iran and Iraq etc.  I have no doubt that they introduced an element of competition into the food industry which benefited the farmers and which in turn was passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I question the merger of the large co-operatives. We are told that big is beautiful. The Industrial Development Authority believe that co-operatives will not exist in the EC after 1992 unless they amalgamate.  I do not go along with that concept.  The Avonmore and Waterford co-operatives are in the process of amalgamating. Amalgamation usually means rationalisation the month after.  Rationalisation is a fancy word for job losses.  I believe there is no need for the amalgamation of major co-operatives.  It amazes me that the farmers are going along with the amalgamations because there is no doubt that in 12 to 18 months time, three or four major co-operatives will have a monopoly and then they can have a cosy cartel and set a price for all produce.  They will see to it that farmers are paid the same price for their cattle and milk, and there will be no competition. The small farmers will lose out and they could be forced out of business completely.</P>
    <P>We already know that it is the unofficial policy of the Department of Agriculture and Food that the small farmers should be squeezed out.  It is uneconomic for the co-operatives to send their lorries ten or 15 miles to collect 100 gallons of milk.  In a very underhand way the co-operatives are going to force the small farmers out of business.  I believe the small family farms should survive and that the small family farmer is entitled to a decent standard of living and they should not be <Col N="1899" /> forced out of farming by unofficial monopolies created by the amalgamation of co-operatives.  I would have to say to the farmers and the farm organisations that they have lost control of their co-operatives which were set up to look after the vital interests of farmers.  Co-operatives are now being run as a business by a chief executive and a team of managers, and accountants and the legal profession are advising farmers what is in their best interests but I think it is plain to see that monopolies are not in the best interests of farmers, particularly the smaller farmer.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the provisions of the Competition Bill will stop the amalgamated co-operatives from creating monopolies and stifling competition.  I hope the Minister will spell out clearly his views on the mergers of co-operatives and the resulting monopolies they are creating.</P>
    <P>Snowcream employed 55 people in Wexford.  Recently Waterford Co-op who owned this company closed it down, even though it was in profit, because they wanted to rationalise the operation and move it to Waterford.  Politicians from all sides met the management and workers of Snowcream and we pleaded with them at public meetings to stay in County Wexford. We thought we were winning the battle but big business and big money won the day.  Eventually I, and I am sure other politicians in the county got the same message from the workers to back off, they no longer wanted us to save Snowcream.  Waterford Co-op, because of their sound financial position, had come up with a wonderful redundancy package, much better than any redundancy that had been paid in County Wexford or in any other county in recent times.  In other words, they bought off Snowcream and the workers in Wexford. When that kind of thing happens with major co-operatives, it is time for some Minister &mdash; and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the ultimate responsibility &mdash; to investigate the matter and ensure that this is not allowed to continue because if it does, there will be thousands more on the dole queues in the months <Col N="1900" /> and years ahead when these co-operatives merge and the monopolies become more prevalent.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that any person who is aggrieved by actions prohibited under sections 4 and 5 of the Bill shall have the right to bring an action in the High Court for relief.  I wonder how many people will be able to afford to go to the High Court. Perhaps the Minister will explain this in more detail.  The general public are concerned that the onus is being put on an aggrieved person to take action, but people will not have the financial resources to do this.  As a result of the monopoly in the legal profession it is very expensive to bring a case to the High Court.  This matter certainly needs further explanation.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Competition Authority is set out in Part III of the Bill. Who will be on this Authority?  Will it be made up of people who have the knowledge and ability to make decisions?  I hope the position will not be as in the past &mdash; I am not criticising this or the last Government; all Governments have been guilty of this &mdash; where when boards or authorities were set up and political hacks appointed, some of whom in my opinion would not be capable of running a huckster shop let alone making decisions that would be of major importance to the country.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I hope that when the new Competition Authority are established the members will consist of people with knowledge and who will have a key role to play.  This Authority will have their work cut out to deal with the operations and the problems relating to competition, monopolies and dominant forces.  People of the highest integrity will be needed, people with the knowledge and ability to be able to deal with these cowboys who are operating in the market at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction. Hopefully, if Deputies put forward suggestions and amendments that may improve the Bill, the Minister will take <Col N="1901" /> them on board and will listen to what people have to say.  No one has a real answer to the problems.  For the last seven or eight years there has been a lot of talk to the effect that we should have a Bill, that we should be prepared to do something about the monopolies, the need for competition and the need to deal with below cost selling.  I welcome the fact that the present Government have decided to do something about this matter by introducing this Bill.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Terry Leyden, for the work they have done in this area.  I would ask them to consider seriously the points I have made.</P>
    <P>Some of the problems that exist will continue and will become even greater, particularly in the food industry, if operations are carried out as at present.  There is a cartel operating in the food industry and the prices paid to farmers are not as high as they should be.  Prior to Christmas the Minister for Agriculture and Food got approval for a special intervention scheme for farmers because of the problems they face, but the meat processors did not pass on the prices to the farmers. They paid at least 6p to 7p a pound less to the farmers than they should have done.  This in many ways defeated the whole purpose of the major fight by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in Europe to get this special intervention.  I hope that in future when special deals are negotiated in Europe, the meat industry, or indeed any other industry, will not be allowed to scupper them.  The Minister and the Commissioner in Europe should follow through to ensure that the farmers benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will be passed as quickly as possible and that the Minister will take on board some of the suggestions that have been made.  At the end of the day the monopolies, dominant forces and unfair trading, should be taken on board and dealt with.  The new Authority should have complete power to deal with the probems that exist at present.  If we are to ensure the protection of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs, we must have competition.  Competition is <Col N="1902" /> healthy, but over the past few years in some of the major areas where many jobs could have been created, due to the lack of competition and the existing monopolies, a sufficient number of jobs was not created.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will go some way towards resolving the problems that exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I come in to participate in this debate because I am very unhappy with this Bill.  Whatever the views of the other Members, I have the greatest reservations about the motivation of the Bill, which I believe is ideological. Competition has been ideologically hijacked by parties of the Right.  In this case we have a Competition Bill from an ideological Minister who is the head of an ideological party, and for that reason I have the most serious reservations.</P>
      <P>I am not against good competition but the definition of competition is in the eye and the mind of the beholder.  I very well remember &mdash; I will advert to this later &mdash; the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, when in Opposition, opposing the Air Transport Bill and promoting absolute competition regardless of any controls or consequences at the time and despite the history of aviation the casualties from unbridled competition.</P>
      <P>This Bill is included in the Government programme on the insistence of the Progressive Democrats; its motivation is right-wing.  As I said, of course competition in its place is good but competition is in the mind of the beholder. Regardless of what we understand by the term &ldquo;competition&rdquo;, let it be understood that competition disrupts and absolute competition disrupts absolutely.  Let it also be understood that what some people mean by &ldquo;competition&rdquo; is one of the primary causes of unemployment in the European Community and in this country which, among the Twelve, has the awful record of having the highest rate of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have prepared three memoranda on unemployment.  This debate is taking <Col N="1903" /> place within a month of the worst unemployment figures in the history of the State; the unemployment figure for March 1991 was 254,966, which includes over 8,000 people aged 60 years or over who are on pre-retirement allowances or credits.  That record register of unemployment represents 19.55 per cent of the electorate and is the result of four years' emigration.  These figures are supplied by the Central Statistics Office.  For the four years up to mid-April of last year, 136,000 people emigrated, which was twice as many as in the preceding four years, when 71,000 people emigrated. Since the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, came to Government in 1987, 136,000 people have left the country, twice as many as in the preceding four years.  If we add that number to the figure on the unemployment register it comes to a ghastly total of 391,000 people or 29.99 per cent of our workforce.  It is an appalling legacy but, what is worse, our media hail it as economic success.</P>
    <P>Competition, as understood by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, and his colleagues in Fianna Fáil, has led to unparalleled unemployment and emigration; they do not understand the meaning of competition.  The reality is that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were members of the Front Bench which advocated unbridled political competition in 1977.  It was the political equivalent of below cost selling; it is the main burden with which the country is still living and the main cause of the legacy of unparalleled unemployment and emigration. That is competition O'Malley-and Haughey-style; it is competition 1977-style. It has destroyed this country and has left a whole generation without jobs or prospects at home.  The deplorable fact is that this is seen by the media as economic success.</P>
    <P>Irish competition is impeded by the Government.  An examination of any sector of the economy will highlight this fact.  Let us take the transport sector, about which I know something as I was Minister for Transport for four years. <Col N="1904" /> In 1986 I proposed a five-year plan to eliminate the competitive disadvantaged of the road haulage sector in this State compared to the road haulage sector in the United Kingdom.  The proposal was virtually accepted by the Government of which I was a member but it was thrown out when the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, came to power.  Therefore, the 27 per cent disadvantage which the Irish road haulage industry have compared to the Northern Ireland and British road haulage industries, has widened in the past four years because of the Government's policies in relation to VAT, excise duties and taxes generally.  Moreover, because of the appalling state of our roads the maintenance costs for the Irish transport industry are much greater than those in Northern Ireland or Britain because of the damage to vehicles caused by the state of the roads.</P>
    <P>The Irish road haulage sector, one of the areas which has most opportunity to expand post-1992 has been impeded &mdash; not by their own inefficiency, lack of energy or creativity &mdash; but by the Government. The 27 per cent disadvantage which the Irish road haulage industry suffers compared to the Northern Ireland and British road haulage industries is simply because of Government policies. We should have been phasing out those disadvantages over the last four years but we have not moved a single inch to improve the competitiveness of our road haulage industry.  This is very sad, because we could create 10,000 or 20,000 jobs in the road haulage sector over the next few years in a post-1992 frontier-free European market to the whole of which our haulage industry will have access.  They can do cabotage, in other words, point-to-point deliveries and collections and return pick-ups throughout the European Community but they cannot do it competitively if the taxes under which they operate are much higher than in the other 11 member states, particularly if they are higher than those of our nearest neighbour.  They cannot do it competitively if the trucks are much more expensive here than in the UK or France; they cannot base their <Col N="1905" /> business here if repairs and insurance cost much more than in other member states.</P>
    <P>That is the situation after four years of Fianna Fáil Government and two years in Coalition with the Progressive Democrats. The distortion of competition is mainly caused by the Government.  It is not just a matter of concern to the road haulage sector; I merely use them as an example.</P>
    <P>Before the 1990 budget <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 January 1990 carried an article written by me which included a table.  I have it here in front of me.  This article illustrated all the governmental interventions before a person gets his pay packet, the net disposable income of a person in employment, what he would get on social welfare and the gross cost to the employer of giving him that net amount. I wrote a similar article in 1989 for the <i>Irish Independent</i> before the budget and was congratulated on it by the Minister. I thought the budget next day would have the effect of eliminating the distortion or at least closing the gap.</P>
    <P>The situation is that a married couple with two or more children who have the average industrial wage or less as income are worse off at work than they would be on social welfare, even though they would be badly off on social welfare. Before the 1990 budget a person with four children was about £10 a week worse off at work than if on social welfare, and this is solely because of Government policy.  Two budgets later the chap is £23 a week worse off in employment than if he was on social welfare.  The people on social welfare do not enjoy being on social welfare.  They are trapped in poverty.</P>

      <P>My main point is that the political establishment do not understand the effect of their policies on competition. Nobody is taking an overview of the situation.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest causes of higher prices here as compared with the UK is the gross cost of pay.  Despite a higher gross pay than in the UK we have a lower net pay.  That is because of taxes, social insurance and other policies and this has a significant bearing on competition.  I have been making that argument for five or six years, even when I was a Cabinet Minister.  It was seen as an attack on social welfare, but we have this ridiculous situation of so much work having to be done &mdash; potholes by the million is an example &mdash; and so many tens of thousands unemployed.  The main cause is that the political establishment do not understand the overall effect of their accumulation of policy.  The Government are causing a distortion of competition; they are spending hundreds of millions of pounds causing unemployment.</P>

      <P>Of course I will <Col N="1907" /> endeavour to observe the rules of the House.  I do not wish to fall out with you.  The primary purpose of this Bill, according to the explanatory memorandum, is to prohibit anti-competitive practices and agreements and the abuse of dominant positions in the market.</P>
      <P>These provisions are based on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and will apply to all undertakings in the State engaged in trade in goods and services. However, the positions of those undertakings are gravely distorted by Government policy.  The Government are chiding industry for anti-competitive behaviour when in fact the main cause is Government policy.  I think it is well within realms of order in this House for me to cite Government policy in so many other areas which are causing record levels of emigration and unemployment. Nobody can dispute the figures.  It is our job on this side of the House to highlight the distortion and unco-ordinated nature of Government policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour came into this House to answer questions.  He eventually admitted that my arguments of four years standing were correct, that a person with £217 gross pay was actually worse off than somebody with £106 social welfare. Four weeks ago when the Minister for Finance came into the House I highlighted the position that somebody on £3,000 could be better off than somebody on £12,000.  An employer must add 35 per cent to the £12,000 he gives to the employee to cover costs which include holiday pay, sick pay, public liability insurance and employers social insurance.  That means another £6,000 can be added to the £12,000 to get the gross cost to the employer.  It, therefore, costs the employer £18,000 to make his employee worse off than if he was on the dole.  This is all because of Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; a party who are ideologically to the Right and believe in the latest fad from Right wing thinkers as the solution to every problem &mdash; demonstrated this ideology amply when we dealt a few years ago, with competition in air transport, competition which I introduced.  As a result of my policies as Minister with responsibility for air transport, there was enormous growth in air traffic which brought about great reductions in the price of travel.  At that time the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, wanted unbridled competition, despite the fact that there had been casualties in <Col N="1909" /> aviation throughout the world every year because of unbridled competition.  I warned that competition had to be guided and balanced.  As I said earlier, competition always disrupts to some extent and absolute competition always disrupts absolutely.</P>
      <P>There cannot be unbridled competition. If we had unbridled competition there would be serious casualties, as happened in regard to air transport, for example, the unfortunate incident in relation to Avair, the first independent Irish airline, licensed by me, and the difficulties being experienced by Ryanair. There would have been even more acute difficulties if the policies advocated by Deputy O'Malley, when in Opposition, had been agreed.  For example, Ryanair would not have lasted until now.  There have been enormous casualties in air transport where unbridled competition was allowed, for example, Air Florida, People's Express, Air National, Pan Am, and so on.  As I said, absolute competition disrupts absolutely.  Competition has to be balanced and it should not be invoked for ideological reasons.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to fall foul of the rulings of the Chair again, but we have to understand the complete picture of what is causing anti-competitive pressures. Sometimes influence outside their remit cause companies to be uncompetitive.  I contend that the uncompetitive position of many Irish industries has nothing to do with industry; it has to do with Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many pubs per square mile there are in Ireland but certainly no one would argue that we have a shortage of pubs.  Will this Bill bring down the price of drink?  Will it improve the service in pubs where there is competition and very high prices?  Would anyone argue that we are short of banking outlets?  Has &ldquo;competition&rdquo; between the banks led to lower interest rates, lower service charges and a better service for the public?  Will this Bill bring about any of these improvements?  My strong contention is that the price of drink will continue to increase, the service given by banks will be as bad and service charges <Col N="1910" /> will continue to be as high as they are today.</P>
    <P>There is competition in the newpaper industry both from within and outside the State.  However, newspapers are extremely costly here.  Competition has not brought down the price of newspapers. Will the Bill bring down the price of newspapers and thereby benefit consumers. I am certain that the Bill will not have the slightest impact on the price of newspapers because the price of newspapers is affected by other factors such as the price of labour which, in turn, is affected by Government policies such as tax, social insurance and means testing policies, transport costs and so on.</P>
    <P>I know it is unfashionable to talk in these free market times about price controls but I suspect that if a poll was carried out among the women of Ireland, Mná na hÉireann, the overwhelming majority of them would vote for a return of a price control mechanism.  I know there are arguments for and against price control and that we have had low inflation for the past six years.  In 1985 the Government of which I was a member brought inflation down to 3 per cent from the 21 per cent they had inherited from Fianna Fáil in 1982.  The rate of inflation has been about 3 per cent ever since.  Yet that low inflation does not seem to have been manifested in the shops.  The average housewife is absolutely appalled at the price of goods in shops.  Even though the rate of inflation in the United Kingdom since 1985 has been much higher than it has been here it seems possible to buy a wide range of goods in Newry, Belfast, Liverpool or London at prices which are much cheaper than they are in this State. This is happening despite our low rate of inflation and the sacrifices made by the workforce and unions in accepting low pay increases.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill change that competitive position?  Will the Dublin branch of Marks and Spencer be able to sell goods as cheaply as their Belfast branch?  The answer is that this Bill will make no difference because it does not address the factors which distort competition such as Government policies on health, social <Col N="1911" /> welfare changes, tax, differential rent and so on.  Most people do not realise that it is these added cost factors which distort prices ultimately.  This Bill will have no impact whatever.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being introduced simply to satisfy an ideological craving on the part of the Progressive Democrats.  It is an ideologically inspired Bill which will do little for prices, nothing for unemployment and absolutely nothing for emigration. For those reasons the Bill is not worth the paper it is printed on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a number of points on this Bill which I believe will prove to be one of the most important Bills to have been introduced into this House in many years.  The Progressive Democrats take particular pride in the introduction of this legislation.  The Competition Bill, 1991, honours one of the key commitments secured by the Progressive Democrats in the negotiations on the agreed programme for Government. However, the genesis of the Bill goes back not to July 1989 but to February of that year when the former Deputy Martin Cullen introduced the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill on behalf of the Progressive Democrats as a Private Members' Bill in this House.  Ironically that Bill &mdash; which proposed much of what we now have before us &mdash; was opposed and was defeated.  It is particularly satisfying, therefore, that we should be witnessing the introduction of this legislation as Government legislation this week.</P>
      <P>The Bill also marks a second key piece of reforming economic legislation introduced by Minister O'Malley in recent weeks.  I believe that this Bill and the recently passed Companies Act will play key roles in creating a more efficient, more capable and more open economy to benefit all the people of this country. The development of both pieces of legislation, however, holds important lessons for this Oireachtas which we must try to ensure are heeded in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1912" /> The Companies Act began its marathon journey through the Oireachtas many years ago and took the best part of a full decade to pass from Bill into Act. This Competition Bill has been subject to a number of delays since the formation of the Government and has taken almost two years to be introduced into the House.</P>
    <P>Both examples highlight the pressing need for a comprehensive programme of Oireachtas reform to put in place a system which will allow for the speedy and detailed processing of legislation without bringing all other business of the Oireachtas to a halt and which will encourage a progressive and, indeed, aggressive attitude on the part of legislators towards the search for new and better ways of doing things and for new and better regulations to govern our economy and our society.</P>
    <P>The Competition Bill, for example, may be mould-breaking in this country but it is commonplace in the stronger economies of the world.  Similar legislation in the United States of America dates back over 100 years.  The European Community incorporated competition legislation on its foundation as key elements of the Treaty of Rome.  Why then must this country always be left lagging behind?  Why must we always be the last to realise the need for change and improvements?  Why must we always be the trend followers and never the trend setters?  What sort of parliamentary and political system has developed here that not only obstructs progress but positively militates against it?</P>
    <P>The necessity for widespread Oireachtas reform is unanswerable and the Progressive Democrats will be focusing on a package of reforms as a key aspect of the forthcoming review of the agreed Programme for Government with Fianna Fáil in July.</P>
    <P>I hope that the delays which we have seen in this House in processing previous economic legislation will not be repeated on this occasion and that this Bill will be processed as quickly as possible because this legislation is of crucial importance to the Irish economy, to Irish consumers <Col N="1913" /> and to the future growth of many Irish companies.</P>
    <P>The key aim of this legislation is to ensure the most efficient and the fairest possible workings of the marketplace to benefit those who operate within that marketplace, who aim to operate within that marketplace and those consumers who depend on that marketplace.</P>
    <P>Some commentators seem to think that competition law is incompatible with the free market.  The reality is that without competition law, the market will never really be free.  This has been recognised by the most successful economies in the world such as the United States of America and Germany.  It has also been recognised by the most important and largest trading bloc in the world, the European Community.  All of these economies have recognised the need for proper competition law to ensure the smooth operation of the marketplace and to facilitate the development of strong, vibrant and fair businesses.</P>
    <P>Running an economy without proper competition legislation is like running a car without oil.  It is only a matter of time before it seizes up completely.  In the absence of competition legislation heretofore, that seizing process has been one of the major obstacles to a more efficient, fairer and stronger economy in this country.</P>
    <P>Even as we speak, the ongoing milk war, the fears of beef producers at the threats posed by dominant operations within the agricultural sector and the ongoing problems within the bakery industry testify to the shortcomings of our existing legislation.  The persistence of companies with domineering positions within the economy and the inevitable disadvantages faced by would be newcomers to the marketplace are actively dissuading new enterprises from competing in the marketplace.  Like a vicious circle, the absence of the competition which would follow increases the dominant position of existing companies and further militates against newcomers.</P>
    <P>In the absence of stout domestic competition, existing companies get complacent, lazy and inefficient.  The <Col N="1914" /> companies suffer, the economy suffers through lack of innovation and sharpness, through excessive costs and the consumers suffer because they are forced into an unreal dependency on the <i>status quo</i> and have little choice or option in what they can purchase, where they can purchase it or how much they should pay for it.</P>
    <P>The lack of competition is also placing our domestic companies at a serious disadvantage in the growing European marketplace. Unused to the disciplines of competition, they have no training in how to compete in the hugely competitive international marketplace.  They are less able to compete on price or quality and our marketplace will become vulnerable to leaner, more efficient and more hungry competitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>This aim to have more companies and greater competition has to be balanced by the need to encourage domestic companies to expand to the size necessary to allow them to compete on the international stage.  A myriad of small producers would be as damaging for this country in the long run as the uncontrolled rampage of a few.  This Bill strikes this balance by the prohibition which it places on the abuse of a dominant position while not outlawing a dominant position in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is not size about which we have to worry; it is the abuse of that size.  By all means, let companies expand, but what we must not allow is for those companies to abuse their size to the detriment of other companies in the same market or to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In recent months farmers have rightly expressed worries about the potential threat which a huge agricultural enterprise poses for their livelihood.  They fear that the very size of this competitor will allow them to unfairly dictate to the market exactly what they want and that the market will have no option but to agree.  That fear has been answered in this Bill.  Under this legislation an aggrieved party &mdash; whether competitor, consumer or representative association &mdash; may go to the courts to restrain an <Col N="1915" /> unfair practice or abuse of market position and to secure an award of damages. At last this legislation will mean that companies who abuse their positions will have to consider the very real possibility of losing money because of their actions. Yet large companies who are not abusing their position will have nothing to fear and will be allowed to further expand to strengthen their position.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based heavily on the competition legislation governing the European Community; Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  It is particularly valuable, to base our legislation on these articles as it will ensure that domestic companies gain an intimate knowledge of this crucial area which will benefit them in 1992 and the opening of Europe.</P>
    <P>The legislation has also been identified as necessary by the social partners and by many independent commentators.  Most importantly, our experience shows the need for this legislation.  I, and my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats, welcome its introduction and look forward to its early implementation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, and his junior Minister, Deputy Leyden for producing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum of the Competition Bill, 1991, tells us that the primary purpose of the Bill is to prohibit anti-competitive practices, agreements and the abuse of dominating positions in the market.  These are noble sentiments and I doubt if anybody in the House would disagree with the basic principle underlying those sentiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could get the impression from the introductory speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he, and he alone was unique in recognising that anti-competitive practices and the abuse of dominant market position are detrimental to the common good.  It is a concept that has been widely expressed throughout the various levels of industry and commerce, particularly when the common good of the community has been placed at risk by the actions of a minority <Col N="1916" /> interest.  It is an important fact of life that the greater good of the community has been regularly placed at risk in this country by sectional interests.  The House does not need to be reminded of the widespread effects of the recent electricity cuts, the end result of the actions of a minority interest.  Does this amount to the abuse of a dominant position to which the Minister referred and which the Bill will prohibit?  I fear not and that a great opportunity has been lost given the manner in which the Bill has been cobbled together.  It resembles the Chinese paper tiger; all bluster and no bite.  Whatever good intentions the Minister may have had in originally promoting the concept of a competition Bill it would appear that the daily grind of holding together the frail and fragile coalition of ideologies within Government has resulted, in this instance at least, in a gestation which has been long and painful where the embryo has been born without any of the vital organs.</P>
    <P>Competition is fundamental in a growing economy.  It is the lifeblood of an efficient market, a dynamic regulator without which everyone suffers &mdash; so said the Minister last Tuesday in his introductory remarks.  He went on to say that without competition cosy cartels can emerge to share markets to the detriment of the consumer and supplier.  In that one sentence the Minister revealed many of the weaknesses in the Bill.  In so doing, he blatantly ignored one of the basic tenets of service industries in Ireland.  We cannot set aside the fact that the major public utilities are all monopolistic industries, partly owned by the State and consequently subject to State control, but it is not clear whether they will be subject to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill will apply to all undertakings in the State engaged in trade in goods and services.  It appears that the Minister has conveniently forgotten the extent of the monopolistic service industries and their influence on the life of this country and has chosen instead to view one segment of goods and services as being the target of this Bill.  How can you segregate <Col N="1917" /> the provision of an essential service and products such as electricity or telecommunications from the provision of a daily necessity such as bread or milk? Yet, it seems the Minister has conveniently chosen to do so in putting this Bill together.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that, on the one hand, the Minister introduces to the House proposals to prohibit the abuse of a dominant market position, while at the very same time, in another place, the Minister for Labour makes a statement about the need for a code of practice to prevent a recurrence of the recent ESB strike.  Are the Ministers not on speaking terms or do they not know what is going on in Government?  One seeks to end the abuse of a dominant market position by introducing a code of practice, while the other seeks to achieve the very same objective through the enactment of legislation.  Is there a point here which is being lost on the rest of us?</P>
    <P>In this context, let me say categorically that I fully support the right of any worker or group of workers to withdraw their labour as a legitimate negotiating strategy, but if, by so doing, the livelihood of thousands of non-participants and the greater good of the entire community are threatened and put into jeopardy, then a serious issue is involved and serious questions must be asked and answered. This Bill has skirted many of the issues involved and the opposing views of the two Ministers indicates the presence of a tunnel vision which will ultimately lead to faulty and inoperable legislation.  The abuse of a dominant market position can stem from management or from labour and if a dominant market position can be manipulated for the good of the few by any stratum of its workforce, then there must be legislation to curb such practices. It is my belief that the bill does not allow for this and the question which must be asked is, why?  Competition is competition whether it refers to the transmission of data or entertainment on national or international airwaves, or to the selling of a loaf of bread to the corner shop.</P>
    <P>There is another point which seems <Col N="1918" /> to have been lost on, or missed by the Minister.  Let me refer back to his introductory statement that, in the absence of competition, cosy cartels can emerge to the detriment of consumers and suppliers alike.  If the Minister is saying that suppliers can be the victims of cosy cartels, while being incapable of forming their own cartels then surely he is mistaken. Supplier cartels are not unknown in Ireland in recent times and the consumer is generally the loser.  When suppliers arbitrarily withdraw their products from a section of the consumer market, then surely this is a cartel in operation, not the normal idea of a cartel operating at national level and manipulating vast sums of money but a cartel nonetheless.</P>
    <P>We have recently seen such a situation when milk supplies were withdrawn from particular outlets because of an attempt to introduce an element of competition into the price structure.  Without making a case for either side, surely this was a cartel in operation?  We would like to be assured that the Bill will cater for such situations and that the rights of the consumer to have free access to products in whatever area he or she chooses will be protected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister states he is convinced that a properly competitive economy can be achieved by constantly exposing all Irish firms to the stimulus of competition.  We can only assume the Minister is referring to competition from outside the country, since he has already referred to the fact that this proposed Bill owes much to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and to the fact that next year will see a further and perhaps final stage in our absorption into the EC system of inter-nation trade. In many ways this Bill would not be necessary if existing legislation was properly implemented.  The point which must be stressed is that competition cannot be imposed on an economy; it must be a healthy and vibrant thing, it must spring from the economy itself and be the result of common consent within all the different disciplines involved.  Fine Gael believe that just as interference by minority interests in the operation of any dominant market force is to be abhorred, <Col N="1919" /> so also is any legislative interference by Government or, worse still, by the inability or the unwillingness of Government to impose existing legislation in situations where much is clearly called for, and where the interest of the final consumer demands it.  Laws are good only if they can be effected and if their implementation leads to the common good.  When legislation merely adds to the spiders' web of confusion as to whose rights are being protected, as this Bill seems to do, then we should look for much more clarification than the Minister has offered or than the Bill seems to provide.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt about the need for competition and for legislative guidelines for manufacturers, suppliers and consumers.  I think we are all agreed to that, but that need must be filled from within ourselves, albeit in the context of our role as members of a European partnership.  The Bill, as already stated, owes much of its thrust to two Articles taken from the Treaty of Rome, Articles taken in isolation from a document which, however well-intentioned, referred in principle to an integrated Community located on mainland Europe.  Despite out steady progress towards complete integration into the ethos of a united and integrated economy, there will always be problems peculiar to our country as an island nation and the removal of these problems can only be carried out by consensus from within ourselves, from all sections of trade and industry and from all sectors of the market.  It cannot be done by unilateral application of legislation either from within or without, which is what this Bill seeks to do.  There must be consensus from all areas if any competition Bill is to work properly but it does appear that consensus was neither sought nor desired by the Minister.  The question has to be asked, for example, whether the Minister for Labour had any input into the Bill or whether he was consulted at all at any stage of its preparation.  As may be apparent from my earlier remarks, it would appear that the Minister for Labour did <Col N="1920" /> not believe that this Bill would provide the solution in at least one example of the abuse of dominant market forces.</P>
    <P>We have to ask also whether the Minister for Agriculture and Food was involved in the preparation of the Bill.  It is evident from what we have seen and heard so far that the stimulation of competition is one of the prime objectives of the Bill.  Yet the whole area of food production and marketing in this country is a minefield of restrictive practices which could almost demand a separate competition Bill of its own.  What input did the Minister for Agriculture and Food have into the preparation of the Bill, and is he happy that supplier-led cartels will be a thing of the past with the enactment of this Bill?</P>
    <P>Will the price fixing which has been part and parcel of the distribution scene now be laid to rest and will the supermarkets and stores, with the willingness and the ability to stimulate real competition at the checkout, be allowed to implement consumer-oriented policies under this Bill, without having the burden of imposed price structures?  Massive profits are being generated in the food sector distribution system because of the manner in which supply cartels dictate the terms.  Genuine efforts by many outlets to bring about price reductions are frustrated time and again by market forces and the consequence is that the Irish supermarket trade is in a very lucrative state indeed and will be viewed with covetous eyes by our European neighbours when the final restrictions are limited. I firmly believe that it will be open season on all Irish distributive outlets in the next two or three years and whether this is good or bad is anyone's guess.  My belief is that, ultimately, the consumer will lose out, which defeats the whole purpose of what we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>It is my belief, contrary to the impression given through the media and particularly by the independent retailers, that the supermarket trade in Ireland is enjoying a very lucrative position at present and I am convinced that when the markets open up in 1992 many of our supermarkets will be the subject of <Col N="1921" /> takeover bids.  That will be bad in the long term for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Another long-held bone of contention which does not appear to have been tackled by the Bill is the situation regarding the drinks industry.  Will the Bill encourage competition in the retail end of the trade, the area which most needs the stimulus of competition?  Again, while individual outlets compete with each other as to the peripheral areas of presentation, decor, service and so on, there is no competition in the area where it should really count, which is in the area of price to the consumer.  This is principally because of the obvious unwillingness of the vendors to enter into meaningful price competition, indeed to circumvent any attempts to remove agreed price structures.  I could ask the Minister whether the Bill will provide an avenue for meaningful competition in this area but I think I already know the answer.</P>
    <P>As is usual with proposed legislation emanating from the Government, there is an element of humour contained within these proposals, although I strongly doubt whether the Minister had any such intention when putting this document together.  I refer, of course, to the escape hatch of the licence, what I call the planning Act, section 4, of the Competition Bill.  The very idea of introducing an escape clause in the form of a licence provision is a total negation of the whole thrust, the ethic behind this Bill.  It is indeed a typically Irish solution and should have no part to play in this document.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, let me say that I and my party welcome the concept of a competition Bill and that we will support it heartily when it arrives, but this is not the Bill we perceive to be the one needed in the present climate having regard to events in Europe in 1992.  It is flawed in its structure and lacks the breadth of vision required to meet universal approval.  I suggest that the Minister rethink his position, involve more of his Government colleagues in arriving at a broader picture of what is required at all levels of Irish business life, and initiate <Col N="1922" /> meaningful discussion before presenting his ideas to the House.  The Bill as it stands, might well succeed in a &ldquo;green field&rdquo; situation where no problems existed and where a fresh start was being made, but problems exist and the Minister must seriously question whether this Bill can prevent other problems arising, as well as solving present ones.  I respectfully submit that the Bill can do neither in its present flawed state.</P>
    <P>There are other matters the Bill has not addressed but my principal concern is in the food and drink sectors and the monopoly in areas under State control such as telecommunications and An Post. Competition is needed in these areas because the systems in place at present are not sufficient to ensure the consumer is getting a proper deal.</P>
    <P>I hope that by the time the Bill has passed through both Houses it will be amended and will bring about a satisfactory solution to the problems that exist.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for their contributions to this debate on Second Stage.  There is no doubt from what has been said that cases of perceived or actual anti-competitive behaviour have come to everyone's attention.  Existing legislation has not produced satisfactory solutions or, in some cases, any solution whatever.  The need for reform is clear accordingly and is borne out by what Deputies generally have said.  The direction that reform should take, given the example of the EC and its component parts, can hardly be questioned.  Articles 85 and 86 guarantee competition at Community level over decades while the Community has expanded its membership, its population and its economic dynamism.  It is a working, practical model of competition law and not a theoretical, academic thesis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked if Articles 85 and 86 provide an appropriate model for a small country.  Those Articles are based on the principle of prohibition which has been adopted in many member states of the EC with further notable examples <Col N="1923" /> outside the Community.  Within the Community the prohibition countries include France, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Germany.  Outside the Community the most striking examples are the US and Japan.</P>
    <P>Of course, it should not be seen as just a new regulatory system replacing the old one.  It is much more than that.  It is a component of economic policy aimed at producing growth and expansion.  It will hamper certain types of activity certainly, but only those activities which amount to a conspiracy to deprive others of a fair chance to do business.  It will free business from the imposition of anti-competitive constraints which are at present all too common here.  The new freedom will foster business development by small, medium and large enterprises.</P>
    <P>I propose to respond briefly to some of the specific points made by Deputies in the course of this debate.  Deputy Barry damned the Bill with faint praise.  While he said he was not opposed to it in principle, he dismissed it as &ldquo;scissors and paste&rdquo; and as a potentially disastrous cocktail for industry in Ireland.  Of course, the Bill extracts Articles 85 and 86 from the Treaty of Rome.  That is my intention, and I thought, on the basis of earlier proposals from the Deputy's party which were put before this House in Private Members' time, that they want to do precisely the same.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry also spoke of widespread concern and unease.  This has not been made known to me or to my Department. Some specific points have been made to me and the Department but to describe some specific points and suggestions for possible amendments to be considered on Committee Stage as &ldquo;widespread concern and unease&rdquo; would be an exaggeration. The converse is much more the case. There is a great deal of support for the Bill.  The Bill is a confident and bold approach to competition policy.  It has been seen as such and only those who fear the demise of certain types of cosy business arrangements which were almost endemic here need be worried about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> The Bill is quite different in its approach from the sort of Bills usually brought into this House to amend existing legislation or rules, in as much as Bills of that kind normally accept what is there and simply make changes.  This, to a large extent, sweeps away what is there on the basis that it is unsatisfactory and applies a different approach which has not been traditional here but has been proven beyond doubt to work well in other countries, particularly in the most economically progressive countries.  One of the important reasons that countries who have this type of competition policy are economically successful is that they enforce it stringently through the courts, in the way we propose to do.  The obvious examples are Germany and Japan and particularly the United States, which has had it longer than anyone else and has enjoyed economic success for longer and for a more sustained period than anyone else.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barry and Taylor asked about the scope of the Bill.  It is designed to apply to all sectors of the economy and there is no differentiation between the public and the private sectors.  Several Deputies seemed to have the impression that it would not apply to public sector activities.  Of course it does.  The same competition discipline that currently applies in the internationally traded sector of our economy will be extended to all sectors.  The Bill applies to all undertakings, large and small.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry indicated that the Bill was not sufficiently comprehensive.  It covers all sectors of the economy, unlike the Bill introduced last year by Deputy Barry's party relating to competition in the food processing industry.  That Bill was confined to one sector and on examination it clearly did not cover all the food processing industry but only part of it.</P>
    <P>This Bill does more than introduce Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome into Irish law.  It sets out how they can be applied and repeals what will be irrelevant in the Restrictive Practices Acts and Orders and amends the existing law relating to mergers and monopolies. <Col N="1925" /> Events in the past couple of years have made it abundantly clear that changes have to be made in some aspects of the mergers and monopolies law.</P>
    <P>This may not be a long Bill but it covers a great deal of ground and lays down general principles of general application. Some Deputies criticised the length of time it took to produce the Bill.  I too would naturally have preferred to see it produced earlier but there are complex legal aspects involved to which one cannot apply instant solutions.  A great deal of thought and consideration had to be given to it.  In spite of the relative length of time it has taken to publish the Bill, it is worth reminding ourselves that it would have taken at least as long to bring into effect a single restrictive practices order dealing with a single sector of trade.  It should also be remembered that it is only 21 months since this Government came into office.</P>
    <P>There has been some misunderstanding, particularly by Deputy Barry, regarding the licences which may be granted by the Competition Authority. They are not of the same nature as taxi licences or public house licences. Licences will be issued by the Authority in respect of agreements that have anti-competition elements but whose benefits from the public point of view outweigh these negative aspects.  The criteria for these decisions are clearly set out in section 4(2).</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry seemed somewhat sceptical about the granting of licences but his point of view was different from that of Deputy Barry.  He described this as a typically Irish solution, not I think to an Irish problem but to a general problem. He said we should have absolutely blanket prohibition and should not allow any form of agreement to escape that prohibition. In the real world of business that would not work.  This idea is not a typically or specifically Irish solution.  The Commission in Brussels issue these exemptions or licences all the time and it is a feature of the prohibition system in all countries which have it.  We could not in practice have a situation in which we outlawed every possible agreement.  If we <Col N="1926" /> did so some of the basic services would break down.  Every country recognises that, not least the European Community. The matter of licences is specifically referred to in section 3 of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better if prior public notification were given that a licence might be granted rather than publishing the information afterwards?  A person might want to make a point about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a detail we can discuss on Committee Stage.  We can look at how other countries operate the application system.  I would think that if the Competition Authority were in doubt as to the efficacy or otherwise of issuing a licence and as to whether the public benefit would outweigh the anti-competitive aspects, they could call for the views of other people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked a pertinent question about the role of the consumer under the Bill.  The authority can grant a licence in respect of an agreement which as section 4 (2) specifies &ldquo;Allows consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit&rdquo; from the agreement.  The report of the Fair Trade Commission states in summary that &ldquo;competition leads to lower prices and better service&rdquo;.  Where that happens there is a clear benefit to the consumer.</P>
      <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Hogan were critical of section 11, implying that it undermines the independence of the Authority.  This is simply not the case. The essential task facing the Competition Authority will be taking decisions on applications.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has no role here.  The Competition Authority take the decision. If a Minister dislikes a decision, like any other aggrieved party, he can appeal to the High Court under the provisions of section 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another role of the Competition Authority under the provisions of the Bill will be to examine proposals for mergers referred to them just as the Fair Trade Commission do at present.  In this respect <Col N="1927" /> I am glad Deputy Rabbitte drew attention to the practice in Germany where in such cases there is transparency.  Under existing legislation here &mdash; that is, the 1987 Act &mdash; there is no such transparency. However, the provisions of section 17 (4) will change that so that in future reports of the Competition Authority will be published.  Decisions taken subsequently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce can be judged in the light of those reports.</P>
    <P>When the Competition Authority examine a possible abuse of a dominant position under the provisions of section 14 they will, of course, act independently and will carry out such examination at the request of the Minister only.  That does not limit any aggrieved party's right to take action.  Such a party, under the provisions of section 6, can seek appropriate relief in the courts and no permission of the Minister, the Competition Authority or any official organ, is necessary. Of course, at present it is not possible for an aggrieved party to do any of those things.</P>
    <P>Section 11 does not involve the decision-making process of the Competition Authority.  It is a provision that allows studies and analyses to be undertaken by the Competition Authority at the request of the Minister and is more in the nature of a consultancy role than anything else. The meat of the Competition Authority's functions is to be found elsewhere in the Bill.  What I am saying is borne out by the fact that in section 11, for example, the Competition Authority would be allowed carry out studies and analyses of developments abroad for the information of the Minister, the Oireachtas and the country generally as to how certain things work elsewhere and how they might, or might not, be applicable to our circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies criticised the fact that the provisions of the Bill place the onus on those aggrieved to seek remedies in the court; as it were, the Bill placing a burden on them which Deputy Taylor described as intolerable.  If that argument were correct we would see very <Col N="1928" /> little litigation here, much less than we all know exists.  I can offer the example that happens every single day of the week, many times over, of small, private individuals suing insurance companies who have vast resources</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very different type of situation from that envisaged under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Many plaintiffs in this country are quite impecunious but, by and large, are well able to assert their rights because of the system obtaining here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is dependent on the kind of action; in a &ldquo;running down&rdquo; case, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong to say that, simply because a system is new, everybody will be terrified to seek to vindicate their rights.  The courts appear to give an equal hearing to all parties, whether large or small, and I am confident they will continue to do so.  Where people feel strongly aggrieved at the way they have been treated commercially, they will seek to vindicate their rights under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Cases do not have to be taken simply by individuals.  For example, they can be taken by associations of different kinds whose resources can be quite extensive. One group within our economy who have complained frequently about improper commercial practices being exercised against them are farmers.  In appropriate cases I would not envisage just a couple of individual farmers taking cases of that kind against, let us say, meat companies. Rather I would envisage the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, or some such body, doing so on their behalf, as they are entitled to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side of the argument it can be said that the provisions of the Bill open up business to some danger of being sued.  However, there is a balance struck in the Bill.  For example, it provides the freedom for someone suffering damage <Col N="1929" /> to seek a direct remedy without relying on any organ of the State, such as a Minister or an authority.  That is a useful direction in which to move because, for too long, somebody who felt a sense of grievance in this respect thought almost exclusively in terms of going to see the Minister with a view to having their grievance rectified, with all its attendant problems and difficulties both for the individual and the Minister.  It is correct that the emphasis be placed on the initiative of those who are affected by anti competitive behaviour.  Who is better placed to judge whether that action is justified than the one who suffers its consequences?</P>
    <P>Neither am I in favour of introducing a system of fines to be imposed by the Competition Authority.  The primary task of the Competition Authority will be to grant, or refuse to grant, licences or certificates.  The strength of the Bill is that it is self-policing.  It is more consistent with natural justice that an undertaking be penalised in terms of the damage caused by its anti-competitive actions than by some abstract system of fines.</P>
    <P>Obviously I gave quite some thought to the whole question of whether this Bill should be based on the civil law or on the criminal law, or on a combination of both.  At an early stage I came to the firm conclusion that it should be based on the civil law only.  If you like, we are different in this respect from most other countries with a prohibition system because they rely quite heavily on the criminal aspect. In the United States, in particular, as well as the right to seek civil damages, people have the right to have prosecutions brought.  They are brought by the Department of Justice, or by the Attorney General, at federal level.  As Deputies will be aware, quite severe penalties are imposed by their courts including, frequently, long terms of imprisonment for engaging in some of the practices that would be encompassed or prohibited by the provisions of this Bill but which have not been prohibited to date.</P>
    <P>We have decided not to go that far, not to introduce a criminal element but <Col N="1930" /> rather to ascertain how the civil enforcement will work.  I believe it will work very well.  There is, within the EC, a system whereby the Commission can impose fines for practices or activities they regard as anti-competitive without any recourse to a court at all.  Such fines are imposed frequently.  Sometimes, by our standards at least, they are astronomically high. For example, within the past year the Commission imposed on a small group of companies a fine in excess of IR£50 million for engaging in price fixing as a cartel.  There will be no power under the provisions of this Bill to impose fines directly by the Competition Authority, by the Minister or through the courts. This will be a purely civil system.  I believe it should work well once people get adjusted to something that is new and not, I hope, condemn out of hand something that is new, different and better because it is unfamiliar and because many people inherently are conservative.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be possible to establish an elaborate enforcement agency that could be as big as one liked but it would have to be paid for.  The questions then arise: how efficient would it be?  How much of their time would be devoted to explaining why they did not take up certain cases rather than investigate actual cases?  The Government and I, as Minister, made this choice. Although section 6 (4) allows the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take action on the civil side, Deputies are correct to interpret the provisions of the Bill as largely placing the onus for action on those who are themselves affected by breaches of the provisions of sections 4 and 5.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 are designed as indicative rules.  I am not in favour of detailing long lists of examples &mdash; I do not think it necessary &mdash; other than those listed in section 4 (1).  The reason we listed those is that they are the same examples as are listed in the Treaty of Rome.  Deputy Barry, who raised this matter, I am sure knows well that business practices often change quite rapidly.  Any detailed rules that we would make today in respect of specific, definable, identifiable practices <Col N="1931" /> would quickly go out of date.  Indeed, that has been the experience with restrictive practices orders.  It is preferable to have general rules leaving it open to the regulators to calculate rationally the probable social advantages and/or costs of whether current practices offend the rules of competition.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at the list of restrictive practices orders made over the years, particularly those made under the earlier Acts in the fifties and sixties, to realise how irrelevant so many of them are now.  They have not, in fact, been formally repealed to the best of my knowledge, but they are totally ignored because they were made to deal with business practices that are no longer current and are of no consequence.  It appears that in the fifties there was a major commercial row in Ireland about sewing machines and detailed rules had to be made on what you could do in buying and selling sewing machines.  That was designed to calm down some agitation at that stage.  I am not aware that there are any problems in the sewing machine market today.</P>
    <P>A further point raised by a number of Deputies, particularly Deputies Barry and Hogan, was the question of below cost selling.  Under the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, below cost selling is not permitted in that sector or in large parts, at least, of that grocery sector.  Let everyone be clear that it is only in that sector that a restrictive practices order bans below cost selling.  It is not, as might be gathered from some commentators, a general rule of our laws even in that sector.  There are exceptions in regard to certain products liable to deterioration such as fresh fruit, vegetables, fish and meat.</P>
    <P>A ban on below cost selling constitutes a serious interference in the play of market forces.  If a grocer wishes to sell goods at below cost for the purpose of promotion I see no basic reason the consumer should be deprived of the resulting benefit.  Predatory pricing on the other hand is one form of abuse of a dominant <Col N="1932" /> position.  The abuse of a dominant position in any sector is prohibited by section 5.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that I am proceeding with this legislation without waiting for the Fair Trade Commission's review of the 1987 groceries order.  That review was supposed to have started in 1989.  It has only now commenced and I cannot delay the whole Bill for that purpose alone.  It would be unreasonable to do so but, as the House will appreciate, none of the existing orders will be repealed until after this Bill has been passed and until the relevant sections have been brought into operation by order.  They do not come into operation automatically on the passing of the Bill.  Commencement orders have to be made under section 2.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies claimed that the provisions of the Bill will be onerous for business.  Any business which is not a party to anti-competitive practices arrangements or decisions or which is not engaged in the abuse of a dominant position is in full compliance with the requirements of the Bill and need do nothing. Any party to an anti-competitive agreement must seek a licence for it to continue or, if they do not seek a licence they must desist from that practice.  Anti-competitive arrangements impose burdens on others and the onus, in my view, should be reversed and the Bill provides for that.</P>
    <P>The abuse of a dominant position has no justification and must cease.  The existence of a dominant position where there is no abuse remains untouched.  A business can seek relief by way of damages, an injunction, or a declaration without any intervention from the Minister, the Director of Fair Trade, the Competition Authority or any other official organ. Such a course is not without cost but it is open to the free choice of the business concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said there had not been an opportunity to debate industrial policy and does not see when this will happen.  I expect he will have such an opportunity on an industrial investment Bill which I hope to introduce in the House before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> As I said in my contribution on Tuesday last at the opening of the debate on Second Stage, the system that will be introduced by this Bill will not give complete satisfaction to everyone at all times in respect of all the issues that will fall to be dealt with under its provisions.  No competition law can produce such perfection. This is particularly so when the outcome of individual cases is often looked at through partisan rather than through objective eyes.  What I might regard as a reasonable arrangement to ensure market stability might appear to someone else as unjustified price fixing and may appear to yet another as nothing less than a near criminal conspiracy to defraud business rivals of customers.  This Bill means that competition issues will be decided openly and objectively.  There will be nothing partisan in the way it operates.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me repeat that the Bill is not just a regulatory measure.  It is fundamentally an economic instrument that is a key contribution to overall industrial policy objectives.  I think there are some more individual points that were raised which I have not dealt with.  It might be more appropriate if I dealt with the specific individual points in the debate on Committee Stage rather than take up the time of the House going into them now.  On that basis I commend the Second Reading of this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="1934" /> move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Contractual Obligations (Applicable Law) Bill, 1990, is to enable two conventions to be implemented.  The first and most important of these is the 1980 convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations. The second is a related convention, the 1984 convention, which provides for the accession of Greece to the 1980 convention and makes the Greek text equally authentic with the other seven language texts.</P>
      <P>The 1980 convention, our primary concern, was drawn up by the then nine member states of the European Communities who wished to establish uniform rules concerning the law applicable to contractual obligations in order to facilitate the free movement of persons, goods and capital among the member states. The 1980 convention sets out rules determining which country's law will apply in a contract case where there is a choice between the laws of different countries.</P>
      <P>In the case of litigation concerning an international contract three key issues arise.  They are: (1) which country's courts will have jurisdiction to try the dispute?  (2) What law will those courts apply where there is a choice between the laws of the different countries involved and, (3), will the resulting judgment be enforceable in other states?</P>
      <P>Two of these issues, i.e. jurisdiction and enforcement are already dealt with in the 1968 EC Judgments Convention which was brought into force in Ireland by the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.  It is the remaining issue, that of the applicable law, which this Bill, and the conventions it will bring into force, addresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of applicable law although technical is of considerable practical importance because of its implications for international trade.  I do not need to expand on the importance of international trade to our economy.  The importance of this Bill can be gauged by the fact that nearly every future contract with an international element will be <Col N="1935" /> affected by the rules of the 1980 convention.</P>
    <P>The area of private international law dealt with in the Bill is not well developed in Ireland and is uncertain.  The benefit of the Bill will be to replace the existing uncertainty with a coherent and comprehensive set of rules as well as bringing our law into line with that of our Community partners.</P>
    <P>The rules of the convention are broadly similar to the existing law as far as it has been determined.  In particular the convention allows parties to international contracts the maximum freedom to choose whichever country's laws they wish to govern their contract.</P>
    <P>Before expanding further on the provisions of the 1980 convention, I will deal with the particular provisions of the Bill itself.  The Bill has four sections and four Schedules.  Sections 1 and 4 are straightforward procedural provisions and require no elaboration.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the key section.  It gives the force of law to the 1980 and 1984 conventions.  The English and Irish language texts of both conventions are set out in Schedules 1 to 4 of the Bill for convenience of reference.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 2 provides that one provision of the 1980 convention will not be applied in the State.  That provision is Article 7 (1) which deals with mandatory rules.  When I turn to discuss the detailed provisions of the convention I will explain the reasons this is being done.  I would like to make it clear, however, at the outset that the convention itself in Article 22 allows states to reserve the right not to apply Article 7 (1).</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with the two matters relating to the interpretation of the conventions.  The first matter relates to the interpretation of the conventions by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.  In December 1988 the Twelve member states agreed that powers should be conferred on the Court of Justice to interpret the 1980 convention. This was done by means of a Protocol to the 1980 convention.  Since <Col N="1936" /> the Protocol would empower the Court of Justice to give rulings which would be binding on the courts of the contracting states it is not possible under the Constitution for Ireland to ratify this Protocol. Accession to the 1980 convention or the Protocol is not necessitated by the obligations of our membership of the European Communities and therefore is not covered by the terms of Article 29 4.3º of the Constitution.  While decisions given by the Court of Justice on the interpretation of the 1980 convention will not be binding on the Irish courts, they are decisions which the Irish courts may consider in interpreting the convention. Accordingly, section 3 (1) (a) provides that judicial notice shall be taken of such interpretative decisions.</P>
    <P>The second matter covered by section 3 is the official report on the 1980 convention by Professors Giuliano and Lagarde.  Section 3 provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the report and the courts shall have discretion to decide what weight they shall give to the report when interpreting the convention.  There is a similar provision in section 4 of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988, in relation to the reports on the 1968 Brussels Convention.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the 1980 convention. Certain types of contracts listed in Article 1 are excluded from the scope of the convention for a variety of reasons.  For example, rights in property arising from a matrimonial relationship are excluded because it is a family law matter and not appropriate for inclusion in a convention dealing primarily with commercial law principles.  However there is only a limited number of exclusions and the convention will apply to the generality of commercial contracts.</P>
    <P>The two basic rules of the conventions are set out in Articles 3 and 4.  The first, contained in Article 3, is that parties to a contract are free to choose whichever law they wish to govern their contract. The law chosen does not have to be related to the contract.  For example, two Irish people entering into a contract to be performed here could conceivably decide <Col N="1937" /> to choose a law other than Irish law to govern their contract.  This reflects the existing law in Ireland.  The Supreme Court in 1988 accepted that parties are free to choose the law they wish to govern their contract even to the extent of choosing a law wholly unconnected with the contract.</P>
    <P>If the law governing the contract has not been chosen by the parties the second basic rule, contained in Article 4, applies. The purpose of this rule is to determine the applicable law in the absence of choice.  It provides that where no choice has been made by the parties to the contract then it will be governed by the law of the country with which it is most clearly connected.  This reflects existing Irish law which is to the effect that in the absence of choice a contract is to be governed by the system of law which has the closest and most real connection with the contract and transaction.</P>
    <P>How does one decide which country has the closest connection with a contract? The convention provides in Article 4 for a series of presumptions to be used to determine the country with the closest connection.  Under existing law the court has to look at all the factors involved to determine which system of law has the closest connection with a contract.  The convention rule should provide greater certainty although in most cases they will produce the same result as would be achieved under the present law.</P>
    <P>These two basic rules are supplemented by other rules dealing with specific issues.  For example, the convention contains special provisions, which have no equivalent in present Irish law, to protect the weaker parties to certain consumer and employment contracts. These provisions are contained in Articles 5 and 6 respectively.  Both articles include provisions to ensure consumers or employees are not deprived of the protection afforded to them by the mandatory rules of law of the country where he is resident in the case of the consumer and the country where he is working in the case of an employee.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other provisions in the convention concerning mandatory <Col N="1938" /> rules.  A mandatory rule is a rule of law which cannot be derogated from by contract. In giving parties to a contract wide freedom to choose which law should govern their contract there is a danger that this freedom could be abused to avoid the application of a mandatory rule of a country which has a legitmate interest in the matter.  The approach taken in the convention to resolve this problem is to allow freedom of choice but to make that freedom subject to the application of relevant mandatory rules. In addition to the specific instances of consumer and employment contracts, the mandatory rules of a country are applicable where all the elements relevant to the contract are connected with that country but the law of another country has been chosen to govern the contract. This is provided for in Article 3 (3) of the convention.  Under Article 7 (2) the mandatory rules of the country where the case is being tried are always applicable irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract.</P>
    <P>Controversy surrounds the remaining provision in the convention &mdash; Article 7 (1) &mdash; which deals with mandatory rules. Article 7 (1) provides that courts shall have discretion to apply the mandatory rules of another country with which the contract has a close connection.  Objections were made to the inclusion of this provision in the convention on the basis that it would place a too onerous task on national courts and would create uncertainty. For that reason, although the provision was maintained in the convention, member states may, under Article 22, enter a reservation against its application. It is proposed that Ireland should avail itself of the reservation as have Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom and as I have already said the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with Article 7 (1) is its vagueness and the uncertainty that would result from its application.  In a contract involving a number of countries it may be impossible to predict in advance which countries might be considered to have a close connection with the transaction &mdash; close connection not being defined in the <Col N="1939" /> convention.  It might also be impossible to predict whether a court would apply the mandatory rules, if any, of that country. This would make it extremely difficult for Irish companies entering into international contracts to be advised fully in advance on the implications of a contract or the likely outcome in the case of a dispute.  I might mention that the views of the Law Society and certain academic experts in this field were sought on this issue and they were strongly in favour of entering a reservation regarding Article 7 (1).</P>
    <P>The remaining articles of the 1980 Convention deal with a variety of technical matters such as validity, scope of the applicable law and assignments.  I do not propose to go into detail on these points which are subsidiary to the principal rules of the convention.  However, if any Deputy has a specific query on these articles which is not addressed in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill I will be happy to deal with it now or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to refer to is the entry into force of the convention. Article 29 of the 1980 Convention provides that it shall enter into force on the first day of the third month following the deposit of the seventh instrument of ratification.  The United Kingdom was the seventh contracting state to deposit its instrument of ratification and did so on 29 January 1991.  The 1980 Convention entered into force on 1 April 1991 for seven out of the original nine contracting states.  The 1984 Convention which provides for the accession of Greece to the 1980 Convention also entered into force on 1 April 1991.  Ireland and the Netherlands have not yet ratified either convention. It is proposed that as soon as this Bill is enacted arrangements will be made for Ireland to ratify the convention and bring it into force for this jurisdiction. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I welcome this Bill.  We will not be opposing it on Second Stage and we will not seek to amend the legislation <Col N="1940" /> on Committee Stage to any great effect. It is a reasonable Bill, inspired by the European Community and, eventually, responded to by our Government.  It struck me during the course of the Minister's speech to ask him a question I am sure he will not be able to answer on this occasion but perhaps he might consider answering towards the completion of Second Stage.  How many international conventions have we appended our signatures over the last decade or more, conventions which were signed but, ultimately, not ratified?  Ratification requires domestic legislation.  I urge the Minister, and his Cabinet colleagues, to consider preparing a full and detailed list of such conventions and, perhaps consider taking appropriate action.  In my estimation four or five Bills are introduced on an annual basis to ratify conventions, most of which were signed in the seventies or early eighties.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Contractual Obligations (Applicable Law) Bill, 1990, I urge the Government to proceed as quickly as possible with ratification of other conventions, many of which I recognise are not within the portfolio of the Minister for Justice.  This legislation offers a measure of protection and comfort to people within this jurisdiction who engage in the delivery of goods and the provision of services abroad.  It will facilitate their work when they enter into contractual obligations abroad.  It will offer a measure of protection against international rogue financiers and, perhaps, also against some of our rogue contractors, and that is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is non-contentious.  It simply enables us to ratify the 1980 Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations. The convention introduces a measure of order into an area of commercial activity, and that is to be commended. This convention, like many other conventions, is an example of the ability of the European Community to help countries co-operate at various levels.  That ability is given further expression when we look at the effects that the whole concept of the Single <Col N="1941" /> Market and 1992 will have on our domestic law.  The buzz word in matters of EC conventions and ratifications must be harmony, harmonising our law, harmonising the civil and criminal code in so far as we can, and accepting that different countries, including our own, have their own peculiarities and stances on many issues.  Notwithstanding that we should be moving towards harmonising our laws.</P>
    <P>It is precisely for that reason that I am somewhat perturbed that the Minister has abandoned, rather simplistically, Article 7 of the convention on the basis that it may give rise to domestic uncertainty among our courts.  That is regrettable because it is certainly against the spirit of harmonisation and, therefore, is a deterrent towards the letter of harmonisation. I hope that will be considered in more detail on Committee Stage.  To state that it will give rise to uncertainty may be an over-simplification.</P>
    <P>A growing proportion of our legislative activity is motivated from the European Community, and the closer we get to economic, monetary and political union, the more that is going to be the case.  It is very appropriate, therefore, that each member state has a code of legislation to protect its citizens from breaches of contractual obligations and from the various types of fraud carried out against institutions and individuals.  One thing that is certain is that our national legislation is quite inadequate to deal with the question of large-scale fraud.  There is general agreement that our legislation dealing with criminal activity cannot deal with matters of serious and complex fraud.  This raises the question as to whether our legislation could cope with all disputes arising from the breaches of contractual obligations.</P>
    <P>Assuming this Bill has the force of law, and I believe it will have over the coming weeks, the criminal sanctions that our national law has at its disposal following on a breach of a contractual obligation are matters that should be questioned.  If there is a dispute about a serious fraud our laws are plainly deficient to deal with it.  A person or company based in this <Col N="1942" /> jurisdiction could certainly be found to be in breach of contract under this legislation and our criminal law does not have the force to deal with the necessary investigation and consequent prosecution. Suffice it to say that we would not have sufficient armoury at our disposal to carry out a successful investigation not to mind a prosecution.  I again appeal to the Government to urgently introduce a Criminal Justice Bill that would enable the consumer to feel a little more comfortable with regard to the level of theft, dishonesty and fraud and the tardy way in which many of these matters are brought before the court.  Public confidence in many areas of our criminal law, particularly relating to fraud, has been undermined recently and not unjustifiably.</P>
    <P>We can certainly handle with some measure of satisfaction the area of blue collar crime but the white collar criminal far too often is let off scot-free by the courts, if indeed the person is even brought before the courts.  I hope the Government will show a little more concern in this area; I do not believe that they appreciate the very high level of dissatisfaction and disgust among the general public in this regard.  Everybody knows someone who has a conviction for a minor or petty criminal offence; most people also know of those who carried out large scale frauds and who were not even brought before the courts.  If we have laws and ratify conventions we must do so in the hope that our laws will stand on some form of high reputation.</P>
    <P>Our criminal law, because of its glaring loopholes and inattentiveness towards white collar crime, is held in disrepute at present.  We have a fraud squad but we need a serious fraud squad to tackle this problem; we need a team of highly trained professionals, lawyers, accountants and members of the Garda Síochána whose sole function will be to investigate serious fraud in society.  Modern technology is often used for the purpose of detecting fraud and modern methods should be employed to detect, prosecute and ultimately convict.  The only deterrent for this kind of dishonesty is an <Col N="1943" /> efficient investigative team and a speedy prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to protect the financial services sector from crimes of serious and complex fraud but they have utterly failed to do so up to now.  I appeal to the Minister to bring in an effective code of criminal justice at the earliest possible date.  Fraud leads to misery and while the financial services sector may need a measure of protection, ultimately the consumer loses.  If financial institutions, as a result of fraud, lose large amounts of money it is the ordinary Joe Soap who always picks up the tab.  For example, the public remember quite well a statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he could not establish the ownership of Master Meats when the Goodman empire collapsed some time ago.  It was later confirmed, to nobody's surprise, that the Goodman Group owned a major shareholding in that company, although they had denied it on various occasions prior to that.</P>
    <P>I hope that while ratifying this legislation we do so with the intention of updating our laws to tackle the very serious crimes of fraud to which we are closing our eyes.  The legislation is somewhat watered down.  I referred to the Minister's reservations in regard to Article 7.  It is a pity that the Bill merely covers contractual obligations; I note that it does not cover any matters pertaining to tort.  With an eye to harmonising our laws in 1992, I would have thought that this was an opportunity to cover areas other than contracts.  The Minister referred to the other exemption, the rights of property, arising from a matrimonial relationship, which are excluded irrespective of their contractual degree.  I am surprised that rights of property based on marital relationship, family homes and all matters pertaining to family law, are excluded.  Are they not regarded as contractual obligations?  Why is there such an exclusion as far as family law is concerned?</P>
    <P>Another watering down of the Bill is the absence of direct involvement of insurance contracts which, it was deemed <Col N="1944" /> by the convention &mdash; or somebody &mdash; should form the basis of a separate matter and that it was not necessary to include them under these contractual obligations. That is a pity; contracts of insurance between states are matters of fundamental importance, particularly as far as liability is concerned.  This is particularly so in regard to increased and advanced international trade.  There is a huge involvement in the insurance industry as a result of contracts undertaken in countries other than this jurisdiction where there may be a degree of uncertainty as far as liability, ultimate responsibility and contractual arrangements are concerned.  I would have thought they would have been included in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a measure of our advancement in terms of harmonising our laws; I would not place too much on it as it will not have any major earth shattering effects.  It introduces a measure of greater security as we move to the greater Europe of 1992 but it leaves many questions unanswered in relation to the consequent ramifications and effects on our criminal law code.  I hope the Minister will give the House assurances that the necessary wherewithal will be made available to the criminal prosecutors in this State so that if persons are in breach of contractual obligations &mdash; and if it is deemed necessary that there should be a criminal investigation &mdash; the full resources will be made available to allay the fears of the general public.</P>
    <P>This is technical legislation and I hope we can iron out some of the technicalities on Committee Stage.  Will the Minister elaborate on his reservations in regard to Article 7 (1) which reduces the force of applicability of the convention as far as our academic law is concerned?  It smacks of a type of derogation; Governments of many hues, since we joined the European Community, have liked the weapon of derogation.  Can we have derogation and still be committed Europeans?  If we glibly accept exemptions of the type envisaged by Article 7, does it reflect an Irish attitude towards the European <Col N="1945" /> Community?  Is it something regarding which we have extreme and serious difficulty? Does it mean that &ldquo;in the vital national interest&rdquo; we must be accorded this exemption?  Nevertheless, I welcome the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I wish to indicate that we accept the principle of the legislation before the House today.  We welcome its introduction and will be supporting it on Second Stage.  There are very few matters in the legislation that will require us to enter into controversy.  I gather from what the previous speaker, Deputy Flanagan, said, that we may, nonetheless, need a very short Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we should not believe everything and anything we read in the newspapers, but I read of the Minister for Justice addressing a body and telling them that he had an extensive programme of law reform to bring before the House.  He itemised a number of matters. I do not recall them all, and I do not recall the Contractual Obligations (Applicable Law) Bill being among them.  Perhaps he was quite right to leave it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the extent that this measure might represent part of the armoury the Minister relies upon when he suggests that he has a wide ranging package of law reforms to bring before the House, we should address one thing.  There are three pieces of legislation in the Minister's name waiting to be dealt with, all of them, if I am correct, at Committee Stage.  There is no legislation outstanding <Col N="1946" /> from the Minister for Justice being debated at Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the Statute of Limitations Bill, the Criminal Damage Bill and the rather controversial O'Higgins pensions Bill.</P>
      <P>The point I want to come to is that the Minister was for some time a part-time Minister for Justice.  He had another portfolio dealing with Communications. We were all quite happy to see him depart from that for reasons that need not be gone into now.  One would have thought that with the long overdue appointment to his Department of a junior Minister to assist him we would see a good deal of much needed legislation coming before the House in the Minister's name.  That has not happened.  The Department of Justice have ground almost to a standstill in regard to reforming legislation and the point must be made that there is no shortage of material available to the Minister. There are the reports he commissioned himself dealing with matters of urgency such as prison deaths, rights of appeal dealt with by the Martin Commission and the very many pieces of legislation from the Law Reform Commission that are now accumulating dust on the shelves of the Minister's office.  I wanted to make that point because this is the first opportunity I have had to address this idea that the Minister is putting about that he is in some way an actively reforming Minister. Unfortunately, that could not be further from the truth.  The Minister has suggested to me across the floor that I should hang about.  I will, willingly, and look for legislation that is so badly needed in many areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heading in that direction.  I consider this a very poor form of legislation employing, as it does, a method increasingly being relied upon by the Minister and his Department of <Col N="1947" /> borrowing the conventions of the European Community or elsewhere on the international scene and incorporating them lock, stock and barrel into a Bill to be presented to this House.  Complex and weighty as this document is, it comprises merely four sections of work on the Minister's part.  That being so, why has it taken successive Governments since 1984 so long to present a Bill to the House?  I say 1984 because that was the year of the small convention regarding the accession of Greece to the Community, but the substantive convention dates from 1980. Why did it take this Minister and his predecessors 11 years to put four sections together so that we could become what has been described as good Europeans?  It is a remarkable delay and no explanation whatsoever has been given as to why it could not have been brought before us sooner.</P>
      <P>Beyond the delay, there is the format itself.  It is very lazy and sloppy legislation to transport a convention, lock, stock and barrel, as is done here.  It is a device all too frequently used in this House.  It goes on on a weekly if not a daily basis in every ministerial Department.</P>
      <P>The directives and the rules of the EC are being incorporated into our domestic law not by statute as they should be, not by the actions of this or the Upper House, but by Ministers signing a directive and bringing into law certain directives of the European Community.  The directive is reproduced in its entirety.  The Minister simply signs it and there we have a new addition to the corpus of Irish law.  This is happening in Departments every day unbeknown to us as legislators, and more important, unbeknown to the great public out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That process is unfortunate because, first, we are getting in a language that is untypical of our own domestic legal language so that when courts, tribunals or anyone else try to interpret it there are major difficulties.  What should happen is that a Minister doing his job and keeping pace with what is happening in Europe and the international arena, should be drafting legislation with his officials <Col N="1948" /> reflecting the spirit and intentions of the conventions but translating and tranforming it into our domestic legislation. That is the way these matters should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The other obvious defect and shortcoming of this method is that while the document here is entitled a Bill, the only parts that I or any other Member of this House can deal with are the first two pages, the first four sections.  If I object to something in the convention itself, which by virtue of section 2 of the Bill is being given the force of Irish law, I cannot amend one jot of it.  If I put down an amendment to change, say, the provisions of Article 2 of the convention as it appears in the Bill I will be ruled out of order.  We have to accept the convention as it stands because that is the way it was drafted and agreed in the international arena.  It is because of the sloppy and lazy way the convention is being incorporated into Irish law that we cannot deal with approximately 99 per cent of this document.  This is not good legislative practice.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a practical example.  Article 2 of the convention refers to the areas of law which will be excluded from the very good principle being laid down in the legislation, namely, that there should be certainty and uniformity of the practice of rules of law that shall apply in inter-state inter-trade, disputes, issues and contracts. However, a whole range of matters are being excluded, for example, questions involving the status or legal capacity of natural persons; contractual obligations relating to wills or succession rights to property; rights and duties arising from a family relationship; obligations arising under bills of exchange; arbitration agreements; questions governed by laws of companies and other bodies corporate or unincorporate; the question of agency; constitution of trusts and evidence and procedure.  Those matters will be excluded from the workability of this good principle which I welcome.</P>
    <P>Some of the reasons given in the explanatory memorandum for the <Col N="1949" /> exclusion of these are that other deliberations are going on, that perhaps other conventions are to be concluded or that ministerial directives will issue from the EC in time.  Those were the reasons given in the years leading up to 1980.  It has taken us 11 years to get around to discussing this issue and God only knows what has happened in the interim.  That was the explanation given that far back and it is borrowed here.  If I, as a legislator, would like to include any one of those items into the legislation before us I cannot do so because I cannot put down an amendment and I cannot change, add to or subtract from the major body of this legislation as a result of a lazy and sloppy formula being adopted.</P>
    <P>This is a very bad legislative practice. I am disappointed it has happened and I hope it will not be the practice of the Minister's Department for much longer. If the Minister is going to bring in this great body of reforming legislation about which he has spoken he should bring it in in substantive form so that Deputies and Senators will have the opportunity of addressing it in the way legislators should.  We should not only be given the opportunity to speak on it but we should also be given the opportunity to amend in substance all of the provisions sought to be given the force of law.  This is a regrettable procedure and I hope it is ended.</P>
    <P>Having made those preliminary points, I should like to emphasise that I support fully the principles in regard to certainty laid down by the convention.  The convention attempts to streamline and introduce uniformity to the rules governing the laws in the public area.  I note that the Minister said our corpus of law in this area is poorly developed.  I accept that it is poorly developed in the context of legislation but, perhaps, he is being unfair to our Judiciary when he talks about a poorly developed corpus of law.  I remember from my law school days that I was impressed with the extent to which the Irish Judiciary had on occasion over the decades addressed this area of the law and given good rulings.  We should not forget that we also have available to us <Col N="1950" /> as guidelines and authoritive statements the Judicial pronouncements of other common law countries.  I would argue, from the point of view of commerce on an international level, that there has been little difficulty in dealing with the laws as they stand and are being developed.  I agree with the reservations expressed by the Minister in regard to poorly developed legislative law but I am not entirely certain that we should extend that criticism to the judge-developed law in this area.</P>
    <P>Having made that point, I want to express a major reservation about section 3.  Will the Minister say why he proposes to legislate to tell our judges that they should take judicial notice of any rulings or opinions of the European Court on questions relating to the convention?  I raise this query because it represents an intrusion into the time honoured and well established separation of powers which exist in our State between the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary.  I query whether or not it would be better to leave matters stand as they are on the basis that our judges will, as a matter of prudence and good practice, have regard to the rulings and opinions of an august body such as the European Court.  We should leave it at that.  Will the Minister say why he thinks this provision is necessary? Is he not concerned that it represents an invasion into the separation of powers which should properly and correctly exist between the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary?</P>
    <P>Another point which needs to be raised relates to the proposed reservation in section 2 in respect of Article 7 (1) of the convention.  I welcome the provisions of the convention and the way it will protect consumers.  For example, it recognises that even though consumers may, as a matter of choice or otherwise, elect to adopt the law of a particular country relating to their contract, they cannot opt out of certain provisions referred to in the legislation as, &ldquo;mandatory provisions of the domestic country&rdquo;.  This is particularly good in this State because very important, although perhaps not well known, rights are available to consumers <Col N="1951" /> under our hire purchase and sale of goods legislation.  It is important that consumers are not forced or obliged to forego those rights.  The provisions of the convention in this area are to be supported and welcomed. It is important that these mandatory provisions and protections in our legislation be sustained and adhered to.</P>
    <P>Article 7 (2) provides that a court may, of its own election, decide, in a particular instance, to import some of these mandatory provisions or protections for the consumer from the law of the country concerned without the say so or prior agreement of the parties to the dispute. That is a good working principle and I do not accept the Minister's suggestion that it will lead to uncertainty in the area of law for parties generally.  Even if it does, it is better, in the balance of things, to forego certainty in this area in order to maintain this additional protection for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that we should, for reasons of certainty, enter a reservation, and he may well have his way on this at the end of the day.  I should like to ask him why he does not leave it as it is on the basis that when this convention is ratified, after this legislation is passed, he can append a reservation to the Treaty when it is being signed or when our ratification documents are being lodged?  Why should we introduce a specific provision in section 2 (2) which will exclude Article 7 (1) from operating in our law?  As I see it, attitudes may well change.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a different view might prevail and the Minister or his successor in office would allow Article 7 (1) stand.  At that stage we would have to bring back amending legislation to this House.  The same effect will be achieved for the time being if the reservation is lodged with the document of application.  If a Minister came to the view that things should change and that the provisions of Article 7 (1) should apply, he could simply withdraw the reservation.  Is that not a much simpler, more straightforward way to deal with this?  Why are we being asked to specifically legislate a provision into <Col N="1952" /> the Bill under section 2 (2)?  The Minister suggests, in advancing his case that we should have regard to the derogation entered by Germany, Luxembourg and the UK.  That is a matter for them but equally, Belgium, France and Italy have not entered one.  We should stand with Belgium, France and Italy on this issue and give the protections, as far as they go, to the consumer as enunciated under the convention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill. I am dismayed at the delay and I am disappointed with the method and form of the legislation.  Nonetheless, it is a useful measure to adopt so that we can work towards uniformity of laws in this area which will make trade and the rules governing such trade more easily dealt with in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the House for their helpful and constructive approach to this Bill.  This is highly technical but important legislation.  It is part of a general reform of certain aspects of our private international law which has been undertaken in response to the challenges posed by our membership of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>In the recent past that area of our private international law which dealt with international civil and commercial transactions was underdeveloped and full of uncertainties.  It relied almost entirely on the development of case law and certain common law principles.  It did not provide an adequate framework for our increasing trade within Europe.</P>
      <P>In 1988 the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act brought into force the EC Judgments Convention.  This represented a radical step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overnight we gained a modern and comprehensive set of rules which were <Col N="1953" /> applicable throughout the Community and which governed jurisdiction in cases with an international element.  In addition to these jurisdictional rules, the EC Judgments Convention provided reciprocal arrangements for the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between Ireland and eight of our Community partners.  In 1989 this regime was extended to include Greece and is now being extended to include Spain and Portugal.  These developments which have only taken effect over the last three years have already had a dramatic effect and this is apparent to anyone practising law in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before this House continues the reforming work of the 1988 Act giving us a clear and modern code of rules determining which law is applicable in the case of contractual obligations.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the EC Judgments Convention this Bill represents a Community code which will make a significant contribution to the judicial aspects of the internal market.</P>
    <P>Our work of reform however will not be completed by this Bill.  Legislation is already under preparation to extend the reciprocal arrangements under the EC Judgments Convention to Spain and Portugal. There are also plans to introduce legislation to give effect to the 1988 Lugano Convention which would extend the system established by the EC Judgments Convention to the countries of the European Free Trade Association. The effect will be a legal network providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters covering all the states of Western Europe, and there is the possibility that in the future it will be extended to the newly emerging democratic States of Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan and Deputy Flanagan touched on the procedure of making the conventions directly part of our law. Making an international convention directly part of our law is a normal method of implementing conventions. <Col N="1954" /> Two recent examples of this are the Jurisdiction of Courts (Maritime Conventions) Act, 1989, and the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.  The method of direct implementation facilitates uniform interpretation and is the method favoured by the European Commission in respect of the 1980 convention. The Commission has criticised the German legislation which gives effect to the 1980 convention as it does not make the convention directly applicable in Germany. The Commission went so far as to issue a formal recommendation that Germany should incorporate the convention, in the words of the convention, into German law.  The reason was that it would assist uniform interpretation throughout the Community.  While Deputies might consider this as being sloppy drafting, it is done in that way intentionally.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to Article 7 (1) was touched on by Deputy Flanagan and Deputy McCartan.  I understand we will take Committee Stage immediately after Second Stage, so I will reserve my comments in relation to that Article until then.  Deputy Flanagan touched on the important and interesting question of the number of conventions that we have signed through the years.  I share his concern that we should ratify these conventions as soon as possible.  In relation to the conventions that come within my Department, it is my policy to proceed as rapidly as possible with ratification.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the question of tort.  The Community has not yet come up with proposals in relation to tort.  The Deputy also referred to other matters in relation to white collar crime, which will be appropriate for another day.  There are questions in relation to that today and I will respond to them later.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan in his opening remarks referred to my programme of legislation.  The Deputy's mind must be slipping somewhat, because we have sat in this Chamber for many hours in relation to a long list of legislation.  When the Deputy made the accusation I began <Col N="1955" /> to think of the legislation that I have brought through this House in less than two years.  Amongst others was the major reforming legislation in relation to rape.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The list includes legislation on rape within marriage, the Forensic Evidence Bill, the Child Abduction Bill, the Larceny Bill geared to getting at the handlers of stolen goods, the Video Nasties Bill, the firearms legislation, the Abolition of Hanging Bill, the Criminal Damage Bill, the Statute of Limitations Bill and the Prohibition Against Incitement to Hatred Bill.  That is just some of the legislation that has been passed or is going through this House at the moment. As far as future legislation is concerned I hope, within the next two weeks, to publish a new Courts Bill, a Confiscation of Assets Bill &mdash; which was commented on in the Law Reform Commission report &mdash; before the end of this session.  A Solicitors Bill will be published during this session and it will be taken during this session.  There will be phone tapping legislation in the next session.  There will be a major Criminal Evidence Bill and a Court of Civil Appeal Bill which will be taken in the next session.  There will be homosexual legislation and family home legislation.  These are all major Bills, very important in improving the quality of life of all the people.  As well as that major work is proceeding in the Department on the preparation of a White Paper on marriage breakdown.  I would suggest to Deputy McCartan that that is not an insignificant body of work.  To his credit, Deputy McCartan shared in that work in this House as we went through the Bills section by section.  With regard to the rape legislation, we have during the past two years improved the quality of life of at least half our population &mdash; the female half.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on (1) the growing public concern in relation to the level of under-age drinking in public places (2) the fact that alcohol appears to be readily available to young people for purchase and (3) the level of vandalism and crime associated with under-age drinking; and if he will outline the steps he intends taking to deal with these problems.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about all aspects of the problem of under-age drinking and I am anxious that all possible steps are taken to keep the problem under control.</P>
      <P>In this respect, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 introduced a wide range of controls which provide a solid framework within which the problem of under-age drinking is being tackled.  The Act provides the following curbs on under-age drinking:</P>
      <P>(1)  It is now an offence for any person under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol, whether in or at an off-licence or to consume it in any place other than a private residence.</P>
      <P>(2)  It is now an offence for any person to purchase alcohol for consumption by a person under 18 years of age in any place other than a private residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The Garda have been given powers to seize intoxicating liquor in <Col N="1957" /> the possession of person under 18 years of age in any place other than a private residence.</P>
    <P>(4)  Persons under 15 years of age are only allowed into licensed premises if accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>
    <P>(5)  No person under 18 years of age is allowed in the part of licensed premises where an extension under a special exemption order is in force.</P>
    <P>(6)  Persons under the age of 18 are not allowed on off-licensed premises unless accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>
    <P>(7)  The law has been changed to make it easier to prove that alcohol has been supplied to persons under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The basic approach behind these measures was to make it as difficult as legislatively possible for a person under 18 years of age to get possession of drink, and thus to consume it, and where he did so get possession, to make it possible for the Garda to seize it.</P>
    <P>The question appears to imply that there is a problem with young people holding drink parties in public places.  I am informed by the Garda that this is in fact not the case.  On investigation of the few complaints received the Garda have found that most of the complaints relate to parties held on private property.  I am also assured by the Garda that alcohol is not readily supplied by licensees to persons under 18 years of age.  However, no amount of legislative steps will totally overcome the problem of young people acquiring intoxicating liquor from other sources.  As I am sure the House will understand, the problem of under-age drinking cannot be solved by legislation alone.  The social, cultural and economic factors involved in the problem of under-age drinking need to be considered in a broad approach to the problem.  The Garda are involved in organising and assisting local initiatives to deal with alcohol and other substance abuse.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a question by Deputy Tom Kitt on 24 October 1990, my colleague <Col N="1958" /> the Minister for Health set out details of programmes for the education of young people on the dangers of alcohol abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but I disagree with him on the size of the problem.  Would the Minister not agree that there is evidence from residents that the high level of vandalism in some areas arises directly from the fact that there are some places selling alcohol to very young juveniles?  The Minister informed me on 26 March 1989 that only 135 cases had been brought before the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that while the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act &mdash; which formed part of the Private Members' Bill that I introduced &mdash; are there, in reality they are not working?  The Minister has not yet made an order covering the sale of alcohol in supermarkets where drink is freely available.  Secondly, provision is made in that Bill for the issuing of identity cards on a voluntary basis.  Would the Minister not agree therefore that if we are serious about tackling this problem he should immediately introduce those provisions to enable identity cards be issued to those who want them?  Furthermore why has he not introduced the order covering the sale of alcohol in supermarkets?</P>

      <P>My final supplementary is to ask the Minister if he would not agree, given the current level of policing in urban areas, that it is not possible for the Garda to deal with this problem because of low numbers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer each of <Col N="1959" /> the supplementaries asked.  With regard to identity cards, I indicated in my reply to Deputy Barrett on 6 March that I was reluctant to introduce a scheme whereby young persons would carry an identity card in schemes operated by the Garda. I have not changed my views in this matter in the interim.  I could give a number of examples of successful voluntary identity card schemes being operated at local community level throughout the State &mdash; the one in Greystones is a good example.  I believe local initiatives by concerned parents, teachers, the Garda Síochána and others interested in this matter are likely to be more successful than a scheme operated on a national level without local involvement and support.</P>
      <P>With regard to the supermarkets, I still have under consideration the question of whether I should make such an order but I have to bear in mind that such an order would have severe repercussions, financial and otherwise, for supermarkets, large and small.  I want to be sure that the other measures we have put in place to curb under-age drinking are working as effectively as possible before I make the order.</P>
      <P>On the general question of policing, the Garda assure me that numbers are kept under constant review.  They also gave me the assurances I outlined in my initial reply.  On the question of vandalism, neither legislative steps nor an increase in Garda manpower would curb that problem.  Lack of respect for property, both public and private, is considered to be a root cause of vandalism. Respect for other people's property must be passed on by parents and leaders in society in general to our young people if we are to succeed in cultivating responsible attitudes.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they continue to enforce the law and take whatever steps they deem necessary when instances of vandalism come to their notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that these questions are motivated by concern about the commission of offences by people on bail. I am aware of that problem.  However, I <Col N="1961" /> would point out that since the law relating to bail was strengthened in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, by providing that a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed by a person on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed or about to be passed on him for a previous crime, the number of offences committed by persons on bail has shown a very significant decrease.  In 1983, before the 1984 Act was passed, 8,295 offences were committed by persons on bail.  Last year the comparable figure was 2,494 offences.  I accept that the commission of 2,494 offences by persons on bail is a matter of grave concern.  The figures I have quoted do show, however, that, contrary to recent public statements, the situation is improving.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to monitor the situation and if I am satisfied that further measures including an amendment of the law on bail are needed, I will bring forward appropriate proposals.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that, while he can quote statistics on the reduction in the number of crimes committed by persons on bail, they relate mainly to petty crime and that the level of offences committed by persons on bail in relation to serious crime is continuously increasing?  Will he not agree that it is extremely wrong to see somebody out on bail engaging in gun battles with gardaí following a bank robbery? Therefore, will he not agree that other measures must be taken to see to it that those who get bail are not likely to commit offences while out on bail?</P>

However, I am satisfied that the situation is improving and I assure the Deputy, the House and the general public that every measure that can be taken to improve the situation, short of the referendum to which I have just referred, is being taken and will be taken in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 3 and 4 and Questions Nos. 14, 24, 46, 68, 69 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to place on the record of the House the Government's appreciation of the excellent work being <Col N="1965" /> done by the Garda Síochána in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>As the Government Minister with immediate responsibility for the Garda Síochána, I am always conscious of the need to treat the members of the force fairly in all matters affecting their conditions of employment.  The Garda associations have fought hard in the past for the establishment of the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The scheme, which is similar to schemes operating elsewhere in the public service, provides for a conciliation council and an arbitration board both of which are designed to deal exclusively with pay and other specified conditions of service of members of all ranks of the Garda Síochána up to and including the rank of chief superintendent.</P>
    <P>The scheme, I believe, works well as is evidenced by the fact that the Garda associations have secured significant benefits under it for their members.  In the recent past, for example, those benefits included two special pay awards &mdash; totalling 16 per cent &mdash; which are over and above the general pay increases.</P>
    <P>With regard to Question No. 14, I want to make it clear that gardaí retiring with 30 or more years' service receive a pension of 50 per cent of basic pay and pensionable payments.  The 40 per cent figure cited relates to total earnings taking account of certain non-pensionable payments as well as payments for working unsocial hours.</P>
    <P>The matter of the pensionability of payments for working unsocial hours is currently the subject of negotiations at the Garda Conciliation Council.  Confidentiality of proceedings at the council is a feature of the scheme and it is a feature that must be respected by all parties to the scheme, including the Minister for Justice, if the scheme is to maintain the confidence which is so necessary if it is to operate effectively.  In those circumstances, I am sure the House will appreciate that I have gone as far as I can in this reply without breaching that scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is <Col N="1966" /> correct in saying there is a case before conciliation, will he not agree that it is a cop out?  There is a claim before the conciliation board since 1986, but as the Government have refused to make any offer, the case cannot proceed.  Will the Minister please make arrangements immediately to deal with that matter through the proper channels?  Will he further agree that, given the fact that these special allowances are taxed in the ordinary way as income, it is only right and proper that they be made allowable for pension purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than a cop out, the situation is that it is before the conciliation and arbitration council.  I am not prepared to break the confidentiality of that hard won conciliation and arbitration scheme that is there for the benefit of the gardaí, and I am not prepared to comment further on it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I now call Deputy Michael Bell whose Question No. 4 refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who was formerly secretary of a joint industrial council I know a little about that and I am very concerned, as I am sure the Minister is, at the length of time it has taken to process this claim.  It has been on the table since 1982 in one form or another.  Will the Minister agree that this would be unusual and unacceptable in any other form of employment, particularly where a trade union was involved?  Will the Minister also agree that the pension of 50 per cent of basic pay mentioned would not be abnormal?  In my experience the norm in industry, services and the public service, where the maximum pension would be 33.3 per cent of pre-retirement wages, would normally include all payments &mdash; bonuses, allowances etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of points that are more relevant to a debate within the conciliation and arbitration scheme and I am not prepared to comment on them.</P>

      <P>A very brief question, Deputy Bell.  The time available for dealing with Priority Questions is exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I suggest that the Minister use his good offices to ask the council to bring this matter to a conclusion?  It is not possible to deal with this by arbitration because the arbitration referred to by the Minister was part of the 1982 national wage agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to 1982 and an offer made at that time.  As I have said, I cannot discuss the present claim before the conciliation council because that would have the effect of breaching the scheme.  The position in regard to 1982 is that the official side made an offer to have unsocial hours and a number of other allowances, excluding the main rent and other expenses, made pensionable.  The staff side indicated acceptance of the offer and said they would take the rent allowance aspect of the claim to arbitration.  The official side could not agree to this and the entire claim went to arbitration.  The arbitrator recommended that a number of allowances, including rent allowance, be made pensionable.  He recommended, however, that unsocial hours allowances should not be made pensionable.  The current economic climate is substantially different from the climate in 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 26, 43 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first part of Question No. 26, the figures available regarding cases under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, are for the period 19 October 1989 &mdash; on which date the Act came into operation &mdash; to the end of November 1990.  In that period there were 762 applications for a decree of judicial separation and 225 decrees were granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of Question No. 26 and to Questions Nos. 6, 43 and 67 the position, as already indicated by the Taoiseach, is that the <Col N="1969" /> Government have decided to carry out a comprehensive review of current developments in the area of marital breakdown and to publish a White Paper following the review.  Work on the review is well advanced in my Department in consultation with other interested Departments and the White Paper will be published in the autumn.</P>
    <P>When the White Paper is published I will be inviting all interested persons to make their views known on the Government's proposals.  However, if people want to make submissions on any aspect of the matter before the White Paper is published, I will be happy to receive and consider them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in relation to the scale of marital breakdown.  The paper will be available in the autumn and I hope it will then be the subject of a wideranging public debate.  If individuals wish to make submissions on any aspect of the matter before the paper is published, I will be happy to receive such submissions in writing and to consider them in the context of the publication of the paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In deciding upon the publication of the White Paper, do the Government accept that in view of the social crisis in relation to marital breakdown we need urgent reform of our law? Is this accepted in particular by the Fianna Fáil component of the Government? Do the Government accept the principle that urgent reform of the law is needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate when legislation is likely to be introduced to deal with this problem?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we have divorce in all but name in our law and that there is an undoubted need for divorce legislation, would the Minister agree that there is no need for a White Paper or for this discussion?  The Minister should be introducing legislation in this area at the earliest date rather than according to the timetable as outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much more involved than just the question of divorce. The White Paper will deal with all aspects of marital breakdown and the way in which our legal system and social services can give improved support and protection to dependent family members.  It will also deal with the avenues of legal redress open to those whose marriages have broken down and safeguards required to protect more vulnerable family members in these circumstances. It is not simply a matter of preparing for a divorce referendum.  We say what was referred to as a debacle <Col N="1971" /> occurred when the type of simplistic approach was taken.  It is a better course to go forward with preparation of a considered White Paper on which we can have a debate and proceed from there.</P>

Is this another case of kicking to touch to create a mirage of concern for the predicament of thousands of people whose marriages have collapsed?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the terms of reference and say who is preparing the White Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

In view of the fact that the Minister is undertaking a comprehensive review of the areas he has outlined in detail, have the Government arrived at a conclusion and are they starting out on this comprehensive review on <Col N="1972" /> the premise that because of the state of our laws in relation to marital breakdown we need to provide a legal facility for remarriage where there is irretrievable marriage breakdown?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have set out on the road of preparing a White Paper, adopting a comprehensive approach to the whole question of marriage breakdown, not just one aspect but right across the board, encompassing the social, social welfare and housing aspects, all of which have effects on the children, right across the spectrum of those involved, who are victims of marriage breakdown.

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that approximately 200 decrees of annulment are being granted each year by the Marriage Tribunals of the Roman Catholic Church and that a number of people who have obtained such annulments have, contrary to the law, celebrated second marriages in church; and the steps he proposes to take to prevent such second marriages being celebrated and to ensure that those who break the law are prosecuted.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I have no functions in relation to the granting of marriage licences.  Responsibility for the law relating to marriages is a matter generally, for the Minister for Health.  That apart, I can say that I have no plans for changes in the law on the lines suggested in Question No. 8.</P>
      <P>With regard to prosecutions I am informed by the Garda authorities that any complaints made to them alleging bigamy are investigated and that, where sufficient evidence is available, cases are referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Statistics relating to bigamy offences are published in the Commissioner's Annual Report on Crime, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the context of the review to which the Minister referred in the last question, can he say whether he has received in his Department a submission from a group of Catholic priests and lawyers proposing that, instead of having divorce, we should license people for second marriages or license polygamy, so as to resolve the problem of the constitutional ban on divorce?  Would the Minister himself say whether he <Col N="1974" /> would favour such an approach?  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that there is a substantial number of second marriages taking place in churches throughout this country of people who received Church annulments in circumstances in which those second marriages are bigamous and no action is being taken?  Can the Minister indicate what new steps the Government will take to prevent increasing numbers of couples living in bigamous circumstances &mdash; apparently another Irish solution to an Irish problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received the report to which the Deputy referred but, from the public press, I am aware of its existence.  The Deputy asked for my views, and I should say I would not be in favour of such proposals.</P>
      <P>The Garda say that bigamy is difficult to prove and that the successful prosecution of such offences requires establishing, <i>inter alia,</i> that a previous marriage had taken place, determining whether a foreign divorce should be recognised and ascertaining whether in fact there had been a second marriage ceremony.  Statistics of cases of bigamy recorded by the Garda and convictions obtained show that in 1990, for example, there were four recorded, that proceedings had commenced in respect of four and there was one conviction.  Of course, civil actions alleging bigamy may also have been instituted but details of such cases are not readily available.  If the Deputy has evidence of particular cases I suggest he might bring them to the attention of the Garda authorities; that is the way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister saying that he would not himself support legalised polygamy.  Would he not accept that we now have an illegal, informal system of polygamy in that the Church is licensing second marriages by celebrating them after the granting of Church annulments? Is the Minister aware that the reason the Garda cannot proceed to bring prosecutions in such circumstances is that <Col N="1975" /> the wives or husbands of the first marriages are prohibited, under evidence laws, from giving evidence against their spouses?  Is the Minister aware that four years ago the Law Reform Commission recommended that the law in that area should be changed?  Will he say whether he intends changing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are proposals for changes of the law in relation to evidence of spouses.  The points raised by Deputy Shatter again highlight the need for a comprehensive view to be taken of this whole area of marriage breakdown.  It is because of the problems caused by marriage breakdown here that the Government are adopting the comprehensive approach they are in the preparation of this White Paper on the issue.</P>

      <P>Arising from consultations between the Garda authorities, the Director of Public Prosecutions and <Col N="1976" /> officials of my Department, revised investigation and prosecution procedures have been put in place in the case of motorists involved in fatal accidents where drunk driving is suspected to be a factor.</P>
      <P>For obvious reasons it would be inappropriate for me to disclose all the details of the revised procedures but I can confirm that they include the following: all decisions on prosecutions arising from traffic accidents in which fatalities occur &mdash; except, of course, where there are no survivors &mdash; are now taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions; Garda instructions have been revised with a view to ensuring that, where warranted, successful prosecutions are mounted in such cases by the force; the Garda, again where warranted, now accompany the motorists in question to hospital with a view to ensuring that they are not seeking medical attention solely for the purpose of avoiding a prosecution for drunken driving; and in cases where it is not possible to make an arrest or to obtain a blood or urine sample, the Garda have been instructed to make every effort to secure other relevant evidence in relation to alcohol consumption.</P>
      <P>Deputies may be assured that the utmost diligence is exercised by the Garda in the prosecution of all cases of the serious offence of drunken driving.</P>

Until November last that could be done without a Garda presence but now if a Garda suspects an individual is over the limit he can accompany the person feigning the injury to the hospital and from there secure a sample which can be used in a case at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 18, 65, 66 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission are currently finalising a review of the law relating to dishonesty generally.  The commission have been looking at this area for some time now, and have addressed possible measures to tackle the problem of so-called white collar crime and computer-based fraud.  It is the Government's intention to make whatever changes in the criminal law are necessary to modernise the law in this regard as soon as the commission's recommendations have been received.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to introduce a system of examining magistrates.  The alternative suggestion made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to increase the powers of the Garda with regard to search and seizure will be considered.</P>
      <P>I also expect to be in a position soon to introduce legislation to deal with the admissibility as evidence in criminal matters of business and computerised records in a proposed Criminal Evidence Bill. This was a matter touched on also by the Director of Public Prosecutions in his address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no specific offence of commercial fraud as such and details of larceny and other fraud offences can be obtained from the annual reports of the Garda Commissioner on crime.  I would refer Deputies to my reply of 5 February last dealing with the Garda Síochána Fraud Squad in which I indicated that a <Col N="1981" /> total of 39 companies are under investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that part of the problem relates to the fact that the people with the necessary skills who have to deal with commercial fraud in the Garda Síochána are such that they can be very easily enticed into civilian life and that it is difficult to maintain the level of staff and expertise in the section generally?  Is the Minister aware of that and can he indicate what he proposes to do to strengthen that section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of resources required by all sections in units of the Garda Síochána for the proper and efficient discharge of their duties is kept under constant review by the Garda authorities and necessary adjustments in manpower or other resources are made as required.  The Garda Síochána Fraud Squad comprise a detective superintendent, two detective inspectors, six detective sergeants and 35 detective gardaí.  The strength of the squad is kept under review in the light of changing needs and circumstances.  At present a total of 39 companies are being investigated by the fraud squad.  While specialist lawyers, accountants and auditors are not attached to the fraud squad, the Garda authorities are fully aware that any specialist assistance they may need in these areas will be readily made available to them.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that investigations by the squad are not and never have been inhibited by any lack of resources, specialist or otherwise.  Also the legal services of the Chief State Solicitor's office and the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are made available as required to the squad to assist in their investigations.</P>

May I specifically ask whether the Law Reform Commission are examining specifically the Forgery Act, 1913, with a view to having it repealed and amended?</P>

      <P>I have already referred to the need for change in the legislation.  I can assure the Deputy that there is a high level of co-operation between the police forces on crime matters not only between our neighbouring island but also with our colleagues in the rest of Europe.  I can assure the Deputy, as I have already outlined to Deputy Bell in response to his question, that whatever facilities, resources, training, personnel, technical or expert backup are required by the Garda will be made available to them on request.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that he is satisfied with the level of resources at present but this matter is constantly under review and if additional resources are required, they will be made available immediately.</P>

Comparisons have been made with our neighbouring jurisdiction where there was a successful prosecution of a case in Belfast and there was no prosecution of the same case in Dublin.  Guinness were on trial in the United Kingdom but there is an understanding that that type of trial could not take place here. Will the Minister not take the necessary steps, whether by changing the laws or providing additional resources, etc., to respond to this sense of outrage and to ensure commercial fraud is and will be dealt with properly in this country?</P>

      <Quest>if he has considered the report of the Fair Trade Commission into the legal profession in so far as the recommendations relate to his area of responsibility; if, in particular, he has reached any conclusion in the matter of the appointment of a legal ombudsman; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that indication from the Minister.  Obviously I hope the Bill will be issued very shortly. In the context of the report of the Fair Trade Commission and the proposed Bill, is it intended to extend the provisions of the Bill to include legislation for the Bar for the first time or is that side of the profession to be left in the nebulous state of having no legislation to regulate and control them?  Second, has the Minister any proposals for the establishment of an institute of legal education or for fusing the legal schools that exist, as recommended in the report?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is attempting to tease out the substance of the Bill.

Will the Minister say that he will go that far in his legislation?  Has the Minister taken cognisance of the fact that the Fair Trade Commission report also referred to the wearing of wigs and gowns and the impression this gives clients of getting a service which only an elite can provide and that this, of course, affects the cost of the service?  Has the Minister considered whether the wearing of regalia will be allowed to continue in the future?</P>

I can assure the Deputy that I am having legislation prepared on this and it will be introduced in the autumn session.  The implications of the European Court of Human Rights' ruling on 24 April 1990 on Kruslin v. France are being examined and when they are clear, the Bill will be published and debated.

I understand that the judgment raised questions as to whether the procedures for telephone tapping which were provided in the 1985 Bill would be adequate in terms of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is important that we get it right this time.  I can assure the Deputy that the legislation will be published as soon as possible &mdash; he may not have to wait until the autumn session.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that drug dealing activites are taking place in certain parts of Dublin.  However, the evidence available to the Garda does not support the suggestion that these activities are of epidemic proportions or anything like it.  The areas concerned receive on-going attention from Garda patrols, from the Drug Squad and from other specialist units. The Garda authorities have informed me that they monitor the situation in Dublin and throughout the country very closely, <Col N="1990" /> and that they constantly review and adapt their strategies to deal with the drugs problem.  These strategies include close liaison with customs authorities and continuous international co-operation with police forces abroad so as to curb the supply of illicit drugs to this country.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there has been some increase in recent years both in the level of drug seizures in this country and in the number of prosecutions for drug related offences.</P>
    <P>Particulars of quantities and types of drugs seized, mostly cannabis, are published in the Commissioner's Annual Reports on Crime, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.  These reports also contain details of prosecutions for drugs offences, again mainly cannabis related.  I might add that the number of prosecutions brought under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, for the sale or supply of drugs, increased from 109 in 1988 to 170 in the year 1990.</P>
    <P>While these figures would seem to indicate an increase in the number of persons dealing in drugs, the Garda are satisfied that the measures taken by them to counteract the problem have resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of detections.  They are also satisfied that there are major organised groups involved in drug trafficking at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that the problem of drugs is one which will continue to receive the highest priority. Everybody concerned about the matter is acutely aware of the need for constant vigilance, aware of the havoc which the criminals concerned can visit upon our society and aware also of the need to bear in mind that the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for our young people is at least as important as effective Garda response in dealing with the problem of drug abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not quarrel with the Minister's definition of the word &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo;, but I can assure the House that there is a very serious drugs problem in certain areas of Dublin.  May I ask the <Col N="1991" /> Minister if it is intended to introduce legislation shortly to give effect to the report of the Law Reform Commission on the seizure of drugs, which was recommended by the former Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism of which I had the honour to be vice-chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A very good vice-chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he aware of the need for a diplomatic offensive at EC level against the exporting countries which continue to deliberately turn a blind eye to the fact that they are exporting these drugs which are finding their way here, through places like Amsterdam? Would the Minister consider that legislation is required to deal with tenants and residents who constantly prey on their neighbours and that the local authorities and the local communities are not in a position to deal with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Law Reform Commission's report, as I made clear this morning, each piece of legislation in relation to the confiscation of the assets of those involved in drug trafficking and in crime generally has been approved by Government.  The legislation is with the parliamentary draftsman at the moment and I hope to publish it this session, but it is highly unlikely that it will be debated this session because of the volume of work on the Dáil Programme. However, it will be published this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as co-operation at European level is concerned, I can assure the Deputy that through Trevi, the organisation of the member states of the European Community, there is considerable co-operation at all levels, not just in drugs but in organised crime generally.  The drugs issue was the principal point taken by the Irish Presidency of the EC up to end-June last year.  At the Trevi meeting in June last year a programme of action was agreed to tackle the whole question of drug trafficking and organised crime. That programme was actively followed <Col N="1992" /> by the Italian Presidency, is being followed now by the Luxembourg Presidency of the Community and I expect further action at the June meeting in Luxembourg. There is also co-operation at UN level.  The whole question of drugs coming into Community warehousing and from there going to other countries is being tackled by the police forces of the EC who are now co-operating very closely.</P>
    <P>On the question of neighbours I would appreciate if the Deputy would elaborate on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that in many areas the drug trafficker is known to his neighbours.  He or she is usually either a tenant of a local authority, a resident in the locality, perhaps a tenant purchaser or a person who has taken out an ordinary mortgage, and local communities have no power to take steps to have that person removed from the vicinity.  Would the Minister consider introducing legislation empowering some authority to remove these people from a community where they are preying on others, particularly young people?</P>
      <P>I have a couple of other questions to ask the Minister and perhaps I could dispose of them while I am on my feet.  Is the Minister aware that there is strong co-operation between the Garda authorities and the police in London?  It is considered that there is a two way trafficking route between the two countries and when the Garda and British police become aware of one route the traffickers switch to a different route &mdash; for example, instead of importing the drugs to Britain and bringing them here, they import them here and bring them into Britain.  Does the Minister see the necessity for a joint drugs enforcement agency between this country and Britain?  Does he consider that training should be provided for legislators and judges on the types of drugs that are available, such as cannabis and heroin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought I was fairly well informed on drugs from the problems I witnessed in <Col N="1993" /> my constituency during a previous epidemic but I only realised after a considerable time, for instance, that heroin can be smoked.  Judges and legislators do not know a lot about drugs.  Would the Minister agree that such courses for legislators and judges would be very useful in stamping out the problem?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point I believe that in some areas suspected traffickers are residing in local authority tenancies and it is a matter for the local authorities &mdash; they have the power under their tenancy agreements &mdash; to take action. However, I strongly discourage the activities of vigilante groups within communities who attack homes.  If somebody has knowledge of the activities of a neighbour or suspects him of being involved in drug trafficking, making drugs available to our young people and destroying their lives, the name of the individual and whatever information is available should be given to the Garda and I assure the House they will act on it immediately.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago I had a meeting with the deputy commissioner and the senior gardaí involved in the drugs area; two one day seminars are being held for all the gardaí involved in the drugs area to make sure that all resources are used to the maximum effect.  I assure the House that there is the closest co-operation not only between London and Dublin, but with our EC partners.  However, I would not go as far as advocating a joint police force but, as I said, they are working in the closest possible co-operation.  The idea of a training and educational process for legislators and the Judiciary has merit.  I will consider it and take appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What practical steps have been taken at European level to face up to the difficulties which will be experienced on the completion of the Single Market on 1 January 1993 in relation to the disappearance of boundaries? Can the Minister foresee a situation in the not too distant future where a specialist drug squad within Europe <Col N="1994" /> could be developed to deal with this problem which affects the whole Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very wide subject. I will partly respond now but I suggest that the Deputy submits a question for the next Question Time when I will give him a detailed response in relation to the measures being taken.  However, the UN Convention on Confiscation and the Vienna Convention are being operated. The action programme agreed in Dublin is also being implemented.  One idea mooted is that we would have one bank of information on all known traffickers throughout Europe.  There is close co-operation between the European police forces and the police forces in producing countries.</P>
      <P>There is also very close co-operation between the European police forces, acting through Trevi, and the United States and some of the countries in the former Eastern bloc because of transit through their countries to Europe.  For example, drugs come from Colombia to America and from America to Europe, which is a problem.  There is also co-operation with the Moroccan and North African countries, between police forces in Europe and those in North Africa. There is a network of contacts and co-operation to break the chain of supply and to stop the chemicals needed by the Colombians in the manufacture of cocaine and other substances.  Some of those chemicals are legitimately manufactured for other purposes in Europe but we want the illegitimate trade to be stopped.  However, as I said, I will commit myself to giving the Deputy a detailed response to the various points if he submits an oral or written question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in a recent Garda journal, it was stated that the drug squad, particularly the undercover plain clothes members, were severely under-resourced?  Will the Minister look at that area to ensure that resources in terms of personnel &mdash; and others &mdash; are available to them?  Will he agree that that is probably the most <Col N="1995" /> effective way to defeat the pernicious trade of drug trafficking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>All areas of Garda operations are kept under review in relation to manpower and resources.  I am assured by the commissioner and the deputy commissioner that there is no shortage of resources in this area.

Sometimes an over-supply of manpower could mean that they get in one another's way in their activities.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why it is mainly cannabis which constitutes the bulk of Garda drugs seizures? As heroin is readily available from London and in most urban areas today involving a large number of addicts, why are the seizures of heroin so small?  Will the Minister agree that the present drug problem is worse than it was in the early eighties in so far as at that time it was largely confined to inner city areas, but heroin is now available in virtually every major working class urban area in Dublin and the bigger suburbs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The number of persons charged with drug offences in 1990 was 2,071, up 54 per cent, which indicates that Garda resources are adequate. Drugs seizures have increased by 48 per cent in the same period; 70 per cent of all seizures relate to cannabis.  The Garda view concerning heroin in Dublin is that there is some sign of increased activity but that it does not constitute a serious problem.  The position today is very different from that which prevailed in <Col N="1996" /> the early and mid-eighties when bigger quantities of heroin were being handled in a more organised manner by hardened criminals.  As a consequence of successful Garda operations, many of these so-called godfathers were imprisoned.</P>

      <P>Since all the business ordered for today has been disposed of, I am proceeding to the Adjournment Debate forthwith.  I now call on Deputy Nora Owen who has given me notice of her intention to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make emergency aid available for the victims of the typhoon in Bangladesh.  Deputy Owen has some five minutes to make her case and the Minister five minutes to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  I would like to make an urgent appeal to the Minister to ask the Government to give immediate emergency aid to the people of Bangladesh who have been devastated by a typhoon on Sunday-Monday of this week.  I would also like the Minister to take up the case as a matter of urgency at EC level.  More than seven million people have been made homeless by this typhoon and while there is no confirmation of the number of deaths we understand that in excess of 50,000 lives may have been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seven million people who have been made homeless are from the poorest areas of Chittagong and the islands that were devastated.  The immediate need is for shelter materials such as heavy plastic sheeting, canvas and wood.  Already both Trócaire and Concern, two Irish agencies, have given aid to the region and <Col N="2022" /> Concern have sent some of their team to work in distributing the aid.</P>
    <P>Clear information is not yet available of the full extent of the damage and the number of deaths but the area of Chittagong where the typhoon hit is densely populated with the poorest of people in the poorest of houses.  I have a fax that came from Caritas in Bangladesh which estimated that 80 per cent of all dwellings in that area were destroyed and that thousands of cattle, poultry and crops have been destroyed.  It is estimated that the cost of the damage is 1.5 billion US dollars.</P>
    <P>There is a great fear among those who made contact with the country that once the water supplies become contaminated &mdash; and contaminated they will become &mdash; diseases will spread rapidly and more lives will be lost.</P>
    <P>To put the situation in that country into context I would like to tell Deputies that the population of Bangladesh, a country only marginally bigger than this island, is 110 million.  If we had a similar scale of population per square foot our population would be 75 million people. Three-quarters of the country is less than ten feet above sea level and in 1988 alone floods killed 10,000 people.  The average income per capital is £100 per annum. Deputies will see that it is not possible for them to make good the damage from their own resources and bring some quality of life back to the people.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned that the entire international effort to help the Kurdish people might take away somewhat from the efforts to help the Bangladeshi people after this terrible tragedy.  I should like to ask the Government, and I know the Minister is deeply concerned about this too, to take the lead both here and at EC level and highlight the moral responsibility of all developed countries to tackle what is essentially the unlying underdevelopment of Bangladesh and other countries like it.  When natural disasters hit those countries they are less able to take the effects of it which are far more <Col N="2023" /> catastrophic.  I make my appeal to the Minister in regard to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to Deputy Owen for giving me this opportunity of addressing this very important issue.  The Government are very concerned by the reports of the deaths and devastation caused by the cyclone which hit Bangladesh just after midnight on Monday, 29 April.</P>
      <P>The cyclone was very severe with winds of over 200 miles per hour and massive tidal waves.  Devastation is widespread and there are fears that the death toll may rise to tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands may have been made homeless.</P>
      <P>The centre of the storm hit the south eastern coast of Bangladesh between Chittagong and Cox's Bazar.  These areas, together with Pataukhali, Noakhali, Bhola and Barguna have been the worst affected.  The destruction of communications links has made it difficult to fully assess the scale of the disaster as yet.</P>
      <P>Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world.  It is unable to deal with this crisis and the Government of Bangladesh have appealed to the international community for assistance.  The United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation (UNDRO) has begun co-ordinating relief efforts.  Irish agencies are also responding and an application for assistance has been received today by me from one agency &mdash; Concern &mdash; and others are expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have earmarked £200,000 for disaster relief for this crisis and have made the following allocations today.  The Concern application has been assessed and the amount sought, which is £75,000, is being provided towards their programme of relief based in Chittagong and Feni. Under this programme, food, clothing, plastic sheltering, water purification tablets and some basic household utensils <Col N="2024" /> will be provided to 9,000 families according to needs.  A further grant of £50,000 is being made to UNDRO in respect of UN agency operations.</P>
    <P>As has been said in relation to previous disasters, the Government are always ready to respond to the best of their ability. No one wants to delay assistance for a moment from the victims of disaster but in the chaos created by a major emergency, it can be very difficult to organise the delivery of relief.  It is important to ensure that the agencies seeking funding have worked out carefully how they can reach disaster victims with the necessary aid.  The agencies are very conscious of this and are constantly seeking to improve their methods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister, or the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, cannot be here.  However, I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will deputise and I hope he will take back to the Minister for the Environment my urgent plea on behalf of this remarkable scenic area of Dublin city that a special area amenity order be put in place at the earliest possible opportunity and that there be no further or undue delay in this proposal being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Howth is probably one of the more remarkable facilities and amenities of this city.  It is spectacular in its beauty and it is an area to which many hundreds, if not thousands of citizens have recourse to for recreational purposes on a weekly basis. Because of its beauty it is also, unfortunately, a major speculative area for development and one that demands very high prices and profits for the developer. Very little sensitivity has been shown by the planners, by Dublin County Council in particular and, in more recent times, by An Bord Pleanála, towards the importance of Howth as a major amenity facility for the citizens of Dublin.  For that reason I believe a special area amenity <Col N="2025" /> order must be put in place as a final and last resort against unwarranted and speculative developments on the peninsula.</P>
    <P>In recent times three developments have taken place that sound alarm bells for the future protection and preservation of the peninsula.  It is the policy of Dublin City Council, of which I am also a member, since 2 April last year to promote and support any application or any procedure for the implementation of a special amenity order for the peninsula in its entirety.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of very worrying developments.  To the east of the hill is an area which is mostly open heathland and which provides spectacular walks and views of the area and, particularly, of Dublin Bay.  An application was granted by Dublin County Council for the demolition of a two roomed cottage and in its place the construction of a monstrosity in terms of a mansion including a swimming pool, tennis courts, outhouses and servants' quarters.  I will not mention the name of the person who made this application but he is well known to people both inside and outside this House.  I believe it is the tradition in this House not to mention names, no matter how well they are known.</P>
    <P>Thankfully An Bord Pleanála turned down the application.  However, the owner-developer has submitted another application. It is extremely worrying that Dublin County Council have not considered this application, as they properly should have, as a material contravention of the plan.  In view of the history of the area, the people of Howth are concerned that this development will proceed and that, therefore, all open space on the peninsula will be up for grabs.  Recently An Bord Pleanála supported the decision by Dublin County Council to demolish perfectly good houses on the main street. Developers are now seeking the demolition of three further houses on the main <Col N="2026" /> street.  Consequently, anything is up for grabs in Howth village.</P>
    <P>The most worrying matter of all, which I tried to raise directly with the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Minister for the Environment during the week, is the question of Howth House, the fine Georgian residence of the man who built the harbour, Captain Taylor.  Permission has been granted by An Bord Pleanála for the demolition of this integral part of the seafront at Howth.  It is propably one of the most damning decisions made by that authority and one which has created widespread dismay among conservationists, citizens generally and the residents of Howth in particular.  If Howth House is demolished, then Howth in its entirety will not and cannot be protected in the future.  The only apparent safeguard available to protect this important amenity for the citizens of Dublin is the making of a special area amenity order.  I understand this work has begun in the county council but for some reason or other the necessary progress has not been made which would ensure that it is put in place at an early stage.  I plead with the Minister, not just on behalf of the residents of Howth or the village but on behalf of all the citizens of Dublin, if not the country, to ensure that this order is put in place so that this important amenity can be protected and preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am requested by the Minister for the Environment to say in reply to Deputy McCartan that he is a little surprised that the Deputy, given his legal background and reputation, has put down this motion.  I have been asked by the Minister for the Environment to outline for the Deputy the statutory provisions governing the making of a special amenity area order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power to make a special amenity area order devolves on the planning authority under the 1963 Planning Act, section 42, as amended, and is a reserved function.  Such order may be made by the planning authority for the area by reason of: (a) its outstanding natural beauty; (b) <Col N="2027" /> its special recreational value; and (c) a need for nature conservation.</P>
    <P>When a planning authority have made an order they must comply with a set of procedures in section 43 relating to the public notice and consultative process. This section also sets out the main role of the Minister for the Environment in relation to an SAAO; namely to hold a public local inquiry into any objections made against the Authority's order.  He then has the function of confirming it with or without modification, or of refusing to confirm it.  Every such ministerial order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This is a mere thumbnail sketch of a quite elaborate statutory procedure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment understands that the council have received requests to make SAAOs for a number of areas including Howth, Baldoyle, Portmarnock and the Dublin Mountains.  He further understands that a list of the SAAO requests is being drawn up for presentation before the council members who will then have to decide the priority of the SAAO list.  In due course, the members will have to submit their orders to him in accordance with the statutory provisions already outlined.  From his understanding of the position, the Deputy would be better advised pursuing this matter with the county council if he wishes to see progress in regard to the Howth SAAO in the near future.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for the Environment has power under section 42 to direct a planning authority to make an SAAO?, he would be reluctant to exercise these powers.  Since the making of an SAAO is a reserved function, he would prefer that councillors would bring forward their own policies in this regard, with all their local knowledge and concern for their areas.  This is a very important consideration: the Government are in the process of local government reform and part of this process will be increased <Col N="2028" /> local democracy and enhanced public accountability for the actions of locally elected representatives.  Now would be a most inopportune time for the Minister to interfere with the local democratic processes, as proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that in March 1990 the Minister for the Environment confirmed, with minor modification, the first SAAO &mdash; the Liffey Valley SAAO &mdash; since the introduction of the present planning regime more than 25 years earlier and he is proud of his record in this regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy raised the question of what might be undesirable development in Howth.  Dublin County Council and An Bord Pleanála, in the case of appeal, are empowered to exercise appropriate development control in respect of all development in the area. The House will understand that the Minister for the Environment is precluded by law from seeking to exercise any power or control over any particular case with which those authorities are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy McCartan, I too am disappointed that the Minister for the Environment cannot be here to deal with this matter. I have raised it with the Minister on a number of occasions in the past and I had hoped that he would be present today to give good news to the people of St. Joseph's Mansions and other flat complexes in the inner city, but obviously this is not to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the conditions many tenants of Dublin Corporation flat complexes in the inner city have to endure, but in the first instance I want to refer specifically to what are perhaps the most severe conditions of all, in St. Joseph's Mansions, Killarney Street, Dublin 1.  I am not sure if the Minister is familiar with St. Joseph's Mansions.  In the region of 140 families live, or should I say endure <Col N="2029" /> an existence, in this complex.  These people have to live in what has been described as almost Dickensian conditions. These families do not have any washing facilities available to them, their homes are in a state of decay and window frames are in a state of collapse.  This complex is dangerous, particularly for the young children who live there.</P>
    <P>If there is a fire or explosion in the complex, as there has been in the past, the emergency services, the fire brigade and ambulances, cannot gain entrance to it because of the low archway entrance, the only entrance, to the complex.  This has caused fear among the residents for their safety in the event of fire.  Seriously ill tenants have had to be carried out of the complex by stretcher to an ambulance waiting in the street outside.  About four years ago the corporation submitted proposals to the Department of the Environment for the refurbishment of St. Joseph's Mansions.  These included the provision of modern washing facilities and alterations to the existing access to allow emergency services to enter the complex.  The fact that the complex is a fire hazard for this reason, and the conditions that exist there are a shameful indictment of the Department of the Environment who have so far chosen to ignore the request of Dublin Corporation for the necessary funding to bring about the improvements.</P>
    <P>Each time I raise this matter here the Minister passes the buck to Dublin Corporation by saying that Dublin Corporation are responsible for their housing accommodation and to their tenants.  Of course, Dublin Corporation rely completely on the Department of the Environment for the funds to do the work they so desperately want to do.  It is a slight on the officials of Dublin Corporation that the Department of the Environment and the Minister, should continually pass the buck to them in this way.  I hope the Minister will not pass the buck to the officials of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The city manager, the architects and <Col N="2030" /> officials working in the corporation feel strongly for the people living in St. Joseph's Mansions and would like to see this work done.  To this end for the last three or four years they applied to the Department of the Environment for money but so far they have not been successful.  Dublin Corporation designated St. Joseph's Mansions as one of their top five priority inner-city flat complexes for refurbishment and each year the Department refused the necessary sanction.  This is an appalling reflection on the Minister.  After all, the buck stops at his desk.  The Minister is aware of the problem.  I raised it with him and I invited him to look at the conditions there.  The Minister has chosen not to look, but he is well aware of the conditions which are unacceptable.  In the context of the Government spending £17 million to glamorise Government Buildings it is an absolute disgrace that the meagre amount of money required to provide decent conditions for people not just in St. Joseph's Mansions but in many other inner-city flat complexes has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings are the responsibility of Dublin Corporation, to be funded from their revenue resources.  The corporation spend some £30 million annually for this purpose and they can determine their own priorities in regard to the spending of this money. If estates are run down, then the corporation must take steps to remedy the situation from their own resources, as well as implementing the necessary improvements in their housing management and maintenance systems, to ensure that the problems are tackled and do not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Department's remedial works scheme, funding is made available to local authorities for major structural works to estates which have been designated for the purposes of the scheme. <Col N="2031" /> It is primarily intended to enable authorities to undertake necessary structural works to low-cost, pre-1940 dwellings and, in certain cases, to run down urban estates.  This year £16 million was allocated to authorities under the remedial works scheme and an additional £2 million, in accordance with <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> was made in order to supplement local authority expenditure on the provision of bathroom facilities.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation were allocated £5.6 million this year for the remedial works scheme &mdash; one-third of the national allocation, and £750,000 for their bathroom programme &mdash; almost 40 per cent of the national allocation.  A total allocation of £6.35 million to the corporation for housing refurbishments this year, is not inadequate by any standards and especially so, when this is designed to supplement the corporation's expenditure of £30 million.</P>
    <P>In relation to St. Joseph's Mansions, an application for remedial works scheme funding of a major refurbishment programme for the complex has been received from the corporation.  This consists initially of proposals for an eight flat pilot scheme followed by the refurbishment of the entire complex with separate proposals for window replacement and the raising of archways.  The overall cost of work is estimated at some £2.3 million.</P>
    <P>The corporation have on several occasions been requested to nominate, from their unapproved list which includes St. Joseph's Mansions, the project to which they attach the highest priority. This information is still awaited.  When it is received, it will be considered in the light of the corporation's expenditure on the seven schemes already designated, and the competing demands of other authorities.</P>
    <P>The £2 million bathroom sub-programme is intended for the provision of bathroom facilities in dwellings which are not included in the remedial works <Col N="2032" /> scheme.  This has been clearly stated in <i>A Plan for Social Housing,</i> and has already been confirmed to the corporation.</P>
    <P>It must be made clear that the special funding provided for the remedial works scheme and for the bathroom sub-programme does not remove from the local authority their responsibility for adequately managing, maintaining and improving their housing stock.  The capital provisions for these schemes have been allocated in full to local authorities and there are no further such funds available to me for allocation this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing my request to discuss the basis on which farm income is calculated for social welfare purposes.  I also thank the Minister of State for attending but I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister for Social Welfare is not present.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to his reply to me yesterday in the Dáil at Question Time.  I regard the answer to my question to have been misleading and not reflecting the system used by social welfare officers when calculating farm income.  I do not place any blame on social welfare officers.  As far as I am concerned they carry out the instruction as per their masters in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take issue with the information contained in the Dáil reply yesterday when the Minister stated that means from farming for unemployment assistance purposes are assessed on a factual basis and are investigated by social welfare officers, that these assessments make allowances for all the typical expenses and for any exceptional circumstances, that means are not assessed on the basis of stock on hand and that they are assessed by reference to sales of stock and farm produce in the past 12 months plus income from grants and subsidies.  I have <Col N="2033" /> extensive proof to show that livestock numbers are notionally calculated.</P>
    <P>I know of a farmer who applied for unemployment assistance and was credited with selling 75 lambs.  This farmer has 50 ewes but in 1990 there were only 58 lambs born so he could not sell 75. The Department of Social Welfare use a calculation system the equivalent of 1½ lambs per ewe.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I have seen cases where a farmer had ten cows and would normally purchase five calves.  Thus it would be reasonable if 15 cattle were sold as two-year olds, if none of these animals were retained as breeding stock.</P>
    <P>However, a farmer holding three such animals for breeding purposes would be financially worse off during the second and third years while he was waiting for these animals to go into production.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare do not recognise properly compiled farm figures duly approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Also I find stock values are notionally assessed.  It appears that the Department have guidelines to calculate prices for cattle and sheep on an average basis.  If for any reason a farmer gets less at the mart or factory it is not reflected in the calculations.</P>

The <Col N="2034" /> Minister is unable to be here as he is opening the National Technology Centre for the Deaf.  Before I read the Minister's speech I would like to say that I understand the Deputy received a full written reply on this subject yesterday.  The Deputy acknowledged this.</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that the provisions of the social welfare Acts, which govern the assessment of means from farming for unemployment assistance purposes, are interpreted in as fair a manner as possible by his Department's deciding officers who have statutory independence in making their decisions and by appeals officers who also have statutory independence.  The independence of appeals officers was underlined recently when he established the social welfare appeals office as a separate entity.</P>
      <P>The practice adopted over the years in assessing income from farming is to estimate what this income is likely to be in an average year with due allowance being made for necessary expenses.  A farmer is given every opportunity to present his-her case, supported by whatever evidence is available.  Reasonable allowances are made for expenses which cannot be directly supported by evidence. The objective at all times is to be fair to the client within the context of the legislation.  If there is any case where the smallholder is experiencing special difficulties his claim can be reviewed on an interim basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has introduced several measures during his term in office to improve the lot of the smallholder.  He increased the rural rate of assistance to equal the higher urban rate.  He arranged that the value of produce from a farm consumed by the household is no longer taken into account in means assessments. This benefits all smallholders throughout the country.  He has also arranged that the income in Gaeltacht areas from keeping Irish language students is no longer taken into account in means assessments for unemployment assistance.  This benefits many smallholders in Gaeltacht <Col N="2035" /> areas and is additional to the exemption from assessment of farm produce.</P>
    <P>This House can rest assured that the Minister's approach will always be to be fair and as reasonable as possible within <Col N="2036" /> the parameters of the legislation to all social welfare clients, including smallholders, and to improve their position to whatever extent is possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 May 1991.</P>

      <P>The problem of false alarm calls to the gardaí in the Dublin metropolitan area has reached worrying proportions.  The alarms in question are those which are relayed to the gardaí either directly through the 999 system or else through monitoring centres provided by security firms.  Though intended as a useful instrument of crime prevention these alarms, because of the high level of false calls which they generate, are now, by and <Col N="1997" /> large, operating in a way which hampers effective crime prevention.  Responding to false or accidental alarms results in a costly waste of Garda resources and means that these resources are not available to respond to genuine alarm calls and other emergencies.</P>
      <P>The commissioner has carried out a detailed review of the problem and has looked at how it is dealt with in other countries.  I have approved the introduction of a new policy aimed at reducing the incidence of false calls, the details of which will be finalised following discussions with the security industry and other interested parties.</P>

      <P>A few courthouses in Dublin and all courthouses outside Dublin are the responsibility of local authorities.  I accept that many of these courthouses are in a deplorable condition due mainly to the reluctance of local authorities over the years to spend money on them.  It was partly for this reason that I secured Government approval last year for a change in the method of financing these courthouses.  In future, while local authorities will continue to be responsible for courthouses, my Department will recoup to them the full capital cost of approved major renovation schemes.  It will also recoup some of the maintenance costs.  I am satisfied that the new arrangements will, in the course of time, lead to significant improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law with respect to rape and other sexual assaults has recently been amended by the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  That Act entered into force as recently as 18 January 1991.  It represents a significant updating of the law on sexual assaults and provides for increased protection for women who are victims of rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalties provided for in the Act are severe.  Crimes which were heretofore classed as indecent assault &mdash; carrying a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment &mdash; can now result in a charge of sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault or rape under section 34 of the Act.  The offence of sexual assault covers the less severe offences and carries <Col N="1999" /> a maximum penalty of five years. However, the more serious charges of aggravated sexual assault and rape under section 4 attract a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for rape itself is life imprisonment and was unaffected by the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>The Act brought about a major improvement in the protection afforded by the criminal law to married women who may have been subjected to sexual abuse.  It abolished the rule that a husband could not normally be found guilty of raping his wife so that marital rape is now fully recognised as a crime.</P>
    <P>Before the Act was introduced concern was expressed that rape trials were extremely distressing for the victims and that this had discouraged women from reporting such crimes.  A number of measures have been taken to reduce the trauma suffered by complainants in sexual assault cases.  Restrictions on adducing evidence relating to the complainant's past sexual history have been extended and provision has been made for the anonymity of complainants in all sexual assault cases.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions for rape, rape under section 4 and aggravated sexual assault are now by virtue of the 1990 Act tried in the Central Criminal Court rather than the Circuit Court and the general public are not admitted.  Furthermore the civil legal aid scheme has been extended, subject to the normal conditions, to allow a complainant in such cases to consult a legal aid solicitor who may accompany her into court.  Arrangements are being made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to provide pre-trial consultations with all witnesses including the complainant and to enable complainants to be familiarised with the procedure and layout of the court.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are very much aware of the problems of rape and sexual assault and gardaí have, in recent years, undergone specialised training to equip <Col N="2000" /> them to deal sympathetically and effectively with the victims of such crimes. The Garda authorities also make every effort to ensure that female gardaí are made available to deal with victims of rape and sexual assault.</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to proceedings initiated in rape cases are set out in the Commissioner's Annual Report on Crime, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, dealt comprehensively with the matters raised by Deputy Byrne in responding to a Dáil motion raised on the Adjournment &mdash; also in the Deputy's name &mdash; on 23 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a nutshell, the position is as follows. The documents which must accompany applications for passports are photographs, birth certificates and, if appropriate, marriage certificates, but such documents do not in themselves provide proof of the identity of the applicant. For the purpose of deciding whether a passport should issue, the Department of Foreign Affairs also require that a <Col N="2003" /> member of the Garda Síochána certify the identity of the applicant.  Where the applicant is not known to the gardaí, identification may be provided by any person known to the gardaí whom they are satisfied is in a position to do so.  The central issue in considering evidence of identity put forward by a person other than the applicant is that person's capacity to provide evidence which satisfies the Garda concerned as to the applicant's true identity; reputability is a relevant consideration only in that connection.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the onus on individual gardaí to exercise a high standard of care in this regard is considerable.  The international reputation of Irish passports, which is a matter of great importance, depends on the maintenance of such standards.</P>

      <P>There is no provision for building a new women's prison at Wheatfield in this year's Estimates.  However, provision has been made for the total refurbishment of the existing women's prison as part of the refurbishment of St. Patrick's Institution. Work commenced on this project in mid-1990 and the first phase will be completed by the end of August.  The other two phases will be completed next year.  With the completion of the first phase it is intended to move the women into the refurbished accommodation as an interim measure.</P>

    <P>The work being undertaken involves major refurbishment and reconstruction and will result in the provision of additional cell accommodation and vastly <Col N="2004" /> improved facilities for education, work/training and recreation.

    <P>With regard generally to the question of providing a new prison for women the position is that while no option has been ruled out the total refurbishment of the existing facility, which is currently well advanced, is the only means whereby a significant improvement in conditions for women can be brought about in the short term.</P>

      <Quest>if it is his intention to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners, which was signed by his predecessor in 1986, in view of the fact that (1) it has now been established that only a relatively small number of prisoners would be affected and (2) these would be offset by some prisoners being transferred from Irish prisons to other countries.</Quest>

      <P>As explained in reply to a similar question on 5 February 1991 (Official Report: Volume 404, No. 6, column 1484), it is estimated that there are approximately 1,000 Irish citizens in foreign jails.  It is difficult, however, to estimate how many of the 1,000 would qualify for transfer to Irish prisons were the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to be ratified by this country.  It is estimated that about 98 per cent of our prison population are Irish citizens leaving only approximately 40 prisoners whose nationality status is unclear.  It is apparent, therefore, that a small number of prisoners who would qualify for transfer from Irish prisons is most unlikely to offset to any appreciable extent the <Col N="2007" /> number of those who would qualify for transfer to our prisons and that there is a danger that accommodation difficulties could be caused for our prisons system by repatriation of prisoners.</P>
      <P>This is among the issues which must be addressed in considering the practical and legislative measures which may be necessary to enable ratification of the convention to take place.  This matter is still under active consideration and any decisions reached on it will be announced in the usual way.</P>

      <P>As I have made clear to the House on a number of occasions in the recent past in reply to parliamentary questions, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978 prevents the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 provides, as regards existing ground rents on dwellinghouses, a low cost purchase scheme by virtue of which any person can abolish the ground rent payable on his dwellinghouse.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987 extends indefinitely the operation of that scheme.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the existing law provides a ready means by which any ground rent lessee can acquire the fee simple in his dwellinghouse.  Over 60,000 people have already availed themselves of that opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the existing legislation is operating satisfactorily.</P>

In pursuance of this policy, which is essential to secure the long term future of the <Col N="2011" /> dairy industry in increasingly difficult and competitive international markets, the IDA have been active in promoting the restructuring of the industry; they have welcomed and supported the merger of Mitchelstown and Ballyclough Co-operatives and are now working closely with Dairygold as regards its future development.</P>

The Córas Tráchtála survey found that product quality from Ireland would be similar to that available from British sources.

    <P>There are various conditions depending on the nature of the application which must be satisfied for the issue of court certificates, which are the necessary prerequisite for the grant of publicans' licences by the Revenue Commissioners, and these are set out in the Licensing Acts.  Those conditions include provisions relating to the surrender of existing licences, consideration of the number and location of existing premises in the particular area and increases in population.</P>
    <P>Any proposal to increase the number of publicans' licences in areas of large urban population would require specific legislation and I have no plans at present for any such legislation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is not correct in implying that a liquor licence can be sold without any benefit accruing to the Exchequer. Stamp duty is payable on transactions both in licences and in licensed premises at the standard rates of conveyance or transfer on sale of property.  Capital gains tax is also chargeable on the gain in value of the licence and/or the licensed premises since the last sale, or since 6 April 1974, if the property has not changed hands since that time.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends establishing a criminal law reform commission to update our criminal law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals for the establishment of a separate Law Reform Commission for the purpose referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>My approach to the need for updating the criminal law is to deal with the matter on a systematic basis affording priority to those areas most in need of review.  In this I am assisted by the work of the Law Reform Commission who have published recommendations on many aspects of the criminal law and are currently reviewing other criminal law matters.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office as Minister in July 1989 I think I can justifably claim a large measure of success in bringing forward and securing the enactment of legislation in the criminal area.  I have promoted a number of important Bills which have been enacted &mdash; the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989; the Larceny Act, 1990; the Criminal Justice Act, 1990 &mdash; abolition of the death penalty; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990; the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990.  The Criminal Damage Bill, 1991, introduced by me, is before this House at present.  I hope shortly to be in a position to publish a criminal evidence Bill and a Bill to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and the prevention of money laundering.  I will also be bringing forward proposals to amend the law relating to certain sexual offences (including homosexual offences) and to amend the law in relation to criminal insanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission are at present conducting a comprehensive review of the law on dishonesty and fraud <Col N="2016" /> and their recommendations will be dealt with when received.</P>
    <P>I think this record is clear evidence of progress on criminal law reform and of the effectiveness of the manner in which it is being tackled.</P>

      <P>Two bridges on the Cork-Kinsale road (R660) between Belgooly and Kinsale are subject to weight restriction because of their structural condition.  I understand that Cork County Council propose to leave these old bridges in place but to realign the road in the area, and to provide two new bridges.</P>
      <P>Contract documents have been submitted for one of the bridges while outline proposals have been received for the second one.  Amendments to the contract documents and the proposals are being discussed with the county council.  These consultations will be concluded as early as possible.</P>
      <P>As these two bridges are on a non-national road, their construction would normally fall to be financed from the local authority's own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department.  The discretionary grants notified to the local authority for 1991 amount to £8.163 million.  The local authority have applied for a special grant for these works but, I am unable to provide such a grant in the current year.</P>
