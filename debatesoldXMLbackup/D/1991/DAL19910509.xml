      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two matters which may not be strictly in order but which, I hope, will be seen as constructive. The Ombudsman recommended that the Oireachtas should take action in regard to the lack of parental leave in the social welfare code for adoptive mothers.  Given that the Social Welfare Act has now been passed, has the Minister for Social Welfare any intention of bringing in an amendment to cover this matter?  The other issue relates to something which was raised here yesterday and concerns the Brooke talks.  I fully understand the Taoiseach's view that a debate would not be helpful but I wonder if he would consider it helpful to at least express the view that it would be worth considering a neutral venue for some of the talks in addition to having talks in Dublin or London, or both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I accept that your ruling is correct, I anticipated that that would be your view.  However, in both cases the House will acknowledge that what I have raised are issues of substance and, if the House wishes, I am sure the Taoiseach would be prepared to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that we are now just 18 months from the completion of the 1992 project, does the Taoiseach intend to make time available or to publish an interim report to the Members of both Houses outlining the progress this country has made in relation to the various directives?  It is a separate issue from the intergovernmental conference and it seems to have gone off the agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I suggest that perhaps, if parliamentary time allows, on a relatively non-contentious day, the Whips could arrange for a debate to take place in which the Minister responsible for co-ordination could give a fairly detailed outline of what progress has been made. I understand that considerable progress has been made in a number of areas although that is not widely known.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that a debate would hold any substance because <Col N="351" /> it is a factual matter at this stage, it is just a question of getting the directives through and implemented.  As an individual member state we are well up in the league of implementation but I will arrange some sort of factual report for Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1991: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>

    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <P>

    <P>the clear intention of the Government to provide by law for the gerrymandering of electoral areas in the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway; and</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last night, I was referring to section 6 which deals with the promotion of the interests of local communities and which will give statutory effect to what many local authorities have been doing. Some of the more progressive local authorities have already initiated many projects. I welcome the provisions which will give these measures, particularly those in relation to workshops, statutory effect. While Deputy Ferris welcomed section 6 he was worried about the amount of finance which would be made available to local authorities to carry out these works.  I know from experience that very little seed capital or finance is needed to get some projects off the ground.  FÁS have also played a part in this.  Many sustainable jobs have been created in the small industries sector, particularly in the services area where we have been lagging for too long.  Many of us have been talking for a long time about the need to develop our small industries and this section will go a long way towards doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> Section 49 deals with the twinning of local authority areas.  Twinning arrangements have already taken place between many towns, cities and counties but, again, these had no statutory effect. Many of the more progressive local authorities have already gone down this road, which is particularly important from the point of view of tourism.</P>
    <P>Even though it may not be a matter which should be dealt with in this Bill, I should like the system of local authority accounting to be addressed at some stage, perhaps by way of a public bodies order. This is a ludicrous and antiquated system and it is about time it was changed.  I do not know how far it dates back but it bears no resemblance to present commercial reality.  I am an accountant and it was three or four years before I could understand the accounting procedures used by local authorities.  I am sure many members of local authorities have extreme difficulty in understanding this system.  It seems to be an exercise in fooling local authority members who do not really know what is going on.  County managers can do what they like with the figures because nobody really understands what they mean.</P>
    <P>I visited England recently to look at how local authorities there operate.  They use a more commercially based accounting system which we should consider adopting here.  I should like to give an example of the accounting procedures used by local authorities here.  The accounts in relation to materials and machinery are contained in the book of estimates which is produced at the end of the financial year.  These accounts do not show what materials cost during the year. For example, items which have not been paid for, items which have been paid for in advance and items which are in stock are not taken into consideration.  All machinery is supposed to be included in the revenue accounts but there are no procedures whereby local authorities can depreciate the value of machinery.  This is ludicrous.  They have to follow a fairly antiquated and circular route in writing off that material through the capital accounts over a period of time.  This is <Col N="355" /> nonsensical.  We may also be shown a deficit of X number of pounds and told that it is not really a deficit.  How are members of local authorities supposed to understand what is going on when they are told a deficit is not as bad as it looks because a payment from the Department of the Environment has been held up? We are told not to worry about those deficits because they are not really deficits.</P>
    <P>The auditing of local authority accounts should be taken away from the local government auditor.  As a Member said last night, it can take up to four or five years before some local authority accounts are audited.  However, because of the way the system is structured at present I do not think any commercial firm would be capable of conducting an audit of local authority accounts.  This system should be changed completely so that commercial firms would be in a position to carry out audits.  Proper balance sheets setting out their exact position should also be produced by local authorities at the end of each year.  They should give a list of their assets and liabilities in the same way as any commercial firm.  This is not happening at present and such a system will have to be introduced at some stage.  We should conform to the standard statements of accounting practice laid down by the various professional accounting bodies.  If commercial firms have to conform to SSAPs, why do local authorities not have to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 50 which provides that a local authority shall publish an annual report.  However, when we talk about an annual report we usually mean a financial annual report.  Section 50 provides that a local authority shall publish a report of their activities for the preceding year.  As a next step, the accounting mechanism should be reformed and incorporated in the annual report.  I do not think anyone in this House would object to such a proposal.  Local authority members would certainly not object to such a proposal because if this was done they would finally be able to understand <Col N="356" /> the figures placed before them and county or city managers would not be able to pull the wool over their eyes, which I am sure is happening at present.</P>
    <P>I want to be parochial in my comments about Part V which deals with the new boundary committees.  This is one of the most important Parts of the Bill.  Section 28 will empower the Minister to constitute new boundary committees to look at local authority boundaries.  I have put down a motion on behalf of Waterford Corporation on this matter so that our city manager can start work on a submission to the Department of the Environment on a badly needed extension of the Waterford city boundary on the north side into County Kilkenny.  We have been seeking this extension since 1979.  I do not blame the Minister, or previous Ministers, for not granting this extension as there had been an extension on the other side into Waterford County Council. That extension was agreed between the two local authorities.  If the local authorities concerned agree to the extension of a boundary, the Minister for the Environment can agree to it.  As there has been no agreement in this case between the local authorities in Waterford and Kilkenny obviously the Minister for the Environment could not act.  The setting up of boundary committees will mean that an independent body can look at the reasons for such an extension.  I have no doubt that our case will stand up. Obviously, the Minister's hand will be strengthened if this independent body can look at the reason for an extension. If they recommend to him that something should be done it will be easier for me to accede to such a request than it as at present.</P>
    <P>Local authority houses in Waterford are in the Kilkenny County Council area. I do not know where else that happens, except in Dublin which is unique.  It is fairly ridiculous to allow that sort of situation to continue.  We cannot develop our entrance to the city along the main Dublin to Waterford road as we do not have authority in that area.  I am not knocking the other local authority, but their priority lies elsewhere.  It would be <Col N="357" /> in the interests of everybody if we were granted that extension.  Section 31 of the Bill refers to the interests of effective and convenient local government.  That extension of powers is what that would be.  I am sure there are other areas which are crying out for extensions due to the expansion of many urban areas over the last number of years.  This section will be generally welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 38 empowers local authorities to form advisory committees with reduced statutory functions.  This would mean that Waterford County Councillors could sit down with Kilkenny County Councillors in committee, and that would perhaps advance what I am talking about here.  In some areas that happens already. We have had several meetings with our counterparts in the Piltown electoral area of Kilkenny, but it is nice to see statutory effect being given to something like that. It is only common sense and it is something to be welcomed in this Bill.  It will increase the spirit of co-operation between local authorities.</P>
    <P>When local authority areas are extended compensation has to be paid. Nothing come without a price.  If we or any other urban area were to extend, it would be at a price.  Perhaps the Minister for the Environment would consider picking up the tab for that.</P>
    <P>This Bill is only a start, as the Taoiseach pointed out, in shifting the real functions of the local authority from the city and county managers to the elected representatives who are the people who have to knock on the doors to be elected to local authorities.  Neither the manager nor his staff have to go out knocking on doors.  They are not answerable to anybody.  The effort in this Bill to change that around is to be welcomed.  Anyone reading the Bill will see that the words &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo; pop up all over the place.  This means that functions are being given back to the members of local authorities, and that is welcome.  I do not have any quibble with the provision whereby Ministers or Ministers of State may not serve on local bodies.  This is something that should have come in <Col N="358" /> before.  We were criticised because perhaps some of our Ministers or Ministers of State did not resign from local authorities and we in turn criticised the Opposition for the same thing when they were in power.  Something has been done about it now and I have not heard complaints from anybody about it.  Ministers and Ministers of State are busy enough without the added responsibility of serving on local authorities.</P>
    <P>Many people are worried about the abolition of urban district councils and town commissioners.  They are not to be abolished.  Both the Minister and the Taoiseach made it clear that any town with an urban council, or borough corporation or a town commissioner will not lose them.  Perhaps they might be extended but that would be a good thing as many of the urban areas have expanded rapidly over the last number of years and the greater part of the areas is now outside the various boundaries.</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the advent of regional bodies.  The RTOs failed before for a number of reasons, one of them being the lack of power.  In these bodies the public representatives from the various local authorities will have a greater say on this occasion.  They are the people who should serve on such bodies and it should lead to better co-operation between local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is not often that I take a member of my party to task for something he said, but I have to disagree with Deputy John Browne in what he said last night.  The Deputy complained about the south-eastern area.  He was correct in that the south-east always seems to be forgotten. However, the Deputy said that when anything comes it comes to Waterford and that nothing comes to Wexford.  I am being constantly told that Fianna Fáil are neglecting Waterford, which is the capital of the south-east, and I agree with that. We are being by-passed on many things, including decentralisation.  We have been promised a decentralised office since 1979.  To a large extent I blame the Opposition parties for dismantling the decentralisation programme between 1982 and <Col N="359" /> 1987 but it is about time we got a decentralised office in Waterford.  We do not have anything special in Waterford.  They have the South Eastern Health Board in Kilkenny and they recently got the regionalised ordnance survey office. Deputy Browne seemed to have forgotten that the Environmental Protection Agency is to go to Johnstown Castle, which is in Wexford.  I contend that it is Waterford that is not treated well, and not other areas in the south-east.</P>
    <P>Section 37 which deals with devoltion of various powers and functions to committees is welcome.  Public representatives are aware that at public meetings, politics being what it is, people will play to the gallery, but that much more work is done in committee away from the glare of publicity.  Committees should be seriously considered by local authorities.  I do not suggest that we try to hide anything, but decisions can often be hammered out more quickly in conmittee and then the decision can be conveyed afterwards.  This section should be used as much as possible by the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 42 (5) is welcome.  Up to now, the lord mayors of the five county borough councils were able to decide on the expenses of the mayor for a given year. They did not need the approval of the Minister for the Environment.  However it would appear from a reading of section 42 that they will now need it.  I contend that they should not be covered by its provisions given that this practice has been operated in a very satisfactory way up to now.  It is important when a new provision relating to county council chairmen is introduced that the Minister monitor its implementation.  However I am aware that he has no intention of interfering and needs to have this power in case somebody goes off the rails.  As I said, I contend that lord mayors should not be covered by this provision and the legislation should be amended to take account of this.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;the chairman&rdquo;, in <Col N="360" /> relation to a local authority, includes, in the case of a borough, the lord mayor or the Mayor of such authority.</P>
    <P>I think this refers to a county borough as there is no lord mayor in a borough. It appears that the subsection is flawed. Overall, I welcome the provisions relating to the payment of allowances to chairmen of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposal that county councils be given the power to confer honours.  Why should they not have the same power to honour people as urban councils?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to section 4 motions.  The provisions relating to these motions are to be welcomed.  I have not heard anyone criticise them yet, but we will obviously have to wait and see how the system works.  The local authority of which I am a member do not use section 4 motions but it has been suggested that it is quite easy for a member in one electoral area to put down a section 4 motion for a member of another electoral area which will not affect them.  It is an eminently sensible suggestion that if a section 4 motion is to be put down that it should be put down by a member of the electoral area concerned.  It has been mentioned that there have been abuses but this provision should help to eliminate them.  As a result the public representative concerned will be held accountable within his own area.</P>
    <P>The planning procedure needs to be reviewed.  In England power rests with the local authority members when it comes to planning and and not with the officials.  Furthermore they do not have a body like An Bord Pleanála to hear appeals.  I think it was Deputy Yates who attacked that body yesterday, but I would have to agree with him that it is ridiculous that we cannot get any information from them and it is unbelievable in this day and age that it takes them so long to make a decision.  That matter needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the tenure of office of city and county managers &mdash; they will now only be able to serve for seven years &mdash; are eminently sensible and <Col N="361" /> are in line with the provisions relating to tenure of office of departmental secretaries. I am of the opinion that a city manager should be appointed half way through the life of a council and should seek re-appointment half way through the life of the following council and that the membership should have a say in the matter.  Since it is possible that a city or county manager may not perform or get on with the elected members or do what they want, perhaps they should have the power to remove him from office. However, I am still happy with the provisions in the Bill under which the matter will go before the Local Appointments Commission.  The provisions of this section will not affect anyone in office at present and I do not think they should affect any good city or county manager in the future.  If they do their job properly they will be re-appointed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this is eminently sensible legislation.  I wish to emphasise once more that it is the first step in reforming local government.  It is a good start and I look forward to further legislation to further reform local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority for the past 17 years &mdash; I have served on both Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council during that period &mdash; I welcome any legislation which will bring local government closer to the people.  Life is changing fast and for the better.  Yesterday's legislation will not cater for today's needs.  Legislation should be revised regularly to cater for the needs of a rapidly changing society in the area of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the changes proposed in the Bill were initiated by Fine Gael when in Government prior to the 1985 local elections.  It was they who proposed that three new local authorities be established within the Dublin County Council area. The areas proposed were Dublin-Belgard, Dublin-Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  I represent the Fingal area.  However, since 1985 the members for the Fingal area have acted only as a committee within the 78 member Dublin County Council making <Col N="362" /> it the second largest body in the country next to Dáil Éireann and even larger than the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Since 1985 there has been no reform of Dublin County Council.  The committee set up within the council, called the local government reorganisation and monitoring committee, have held no meetings since the elections to the council in 1985.  On occasion the efforts to have council business carried out were farcical. I fully support the establishment of the three local authorities, which, if given the necessary powers and finance, would certainly bring local government closer to the people.</P>
    <P>The proposed Fingal council would consist of 24 members and represent an area from Balbriggan to Howth, one of the fastest growing areas in western Europe.  Therefore, it has special needs. It is a coastal area with many fine beaches and it at present enjoys an excellent environment.  Portmarnock strand has received the European Community blue flag award for clean water on many occasions.  However, it is increasingly coming under pressure from the effluent entering Dublin Bay from the nose of Howth, which has become an open sewer.  The European Community recently announced that such untreated sewage schemes must have a treatment works established before the end of the decade.  This is a very welcome development. I notice that good news and announcements of this kind are usually made by the Minister for the Environment or the Minister of State at that Department before the local councils have even been consulted on such matters. What I am saying is that the Minister or Minister of State is very happy to give the good news but when bad news has to be delivered this is left to local councillors. I hope the Bill will enable local authorities to deal direct with the European Community when such works are proposed without the need to contact the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Local government reform is about granting more powers to local authorities and reducing bureaucratic red tape <Col N="363" /> imposed by the Department of the Environment. There are some excellent areas of scenic beauty in the Dublin-Fingal electoral area, including the Hill of Howth and its environs which is constantly under threat from developers.  If this is allowed to continue, in a very short time Howth and its environs will become more like Hong Kong.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday a voluntary group anxious to preserve this excellent amenity organised a demonstration to highlight the rape of each green open space in the area. The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, attended and was made welcome by the locals.  Given her presence they felt they had some support from the Department of the Environment.  A large number of people turned up to show their displeasure at the delay in granting a special amenity area order for Howth.  I have on several occasions here in the Dáil and on Dublin County Council requested that such an order be proceeded with as soon as possible so that we may preserve this scenic and green open space which is in danger of being gobbled up by creeping development.  Starting at Sutton Cross and continuing over the Hill of Howth right down to Howth Village, this area has been under threat from developers. Every place where a house could be erected is put before Dublin County Council for planning permission.  Will this legislation allow for a more meaningful process or a quick response to granting special amenity orders where such urgent situations arise?  Will the Bill provide the necessary finance?  Will it enable councils such as Dublin-Fingal to put in place work schemes to carry out the necessary and tedious work involved in preparing such order?  I understand this is the reason the present required amenity area order is delayed.  The Department of the Environment acted swiftly in granting the Liffey area order and I feel it was that Department who initiated that.  I hope this legislation will allow for similar swift action within local councils.</P>
    <P>Will this legislation allow the Dublin-Fingal Committee to establish their headquarters within their own boundary?  I <Col N="364" /> note it will allow for the appointment of their own manager and staff.  How soon will that happen?  That provision is most welcome because Dublin-Fingal Council have been acting as a committee over the years.  They have not had their own staff. They have to report back to the full council, and people who are elected for the Dún Laoghaire area make decisions which affect people in Howth.  That is wrong and the sooner it is ended the better.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be locally focused.  Areas like Dublin-Fingal should have their own headquarters established in an easily accessible place.  As I said, I support fully the establishment of the Dublin-Fingal Committee within Dublin County Council.  When that committee are established we would like to see them having their own headquarters and for this I suggest somewhere like Swords.  It will cost some money to achieve this, but the headquarters should be put in place where people can get to local government and local government is seen to be near to them.  People need a local council office near them to process local matters such as planning applications which affect their areas, and housing list and housing grant applications.  However, local offices should cater for a much greater range of services such as taxing motor vehicles and processing driving licence applications.  I am sure many motor vehicles go untaxed because of the problem of getting to the motor taxation office where it is situated at present.  I have called on several occasions for the establishment of local offices even in shopping centres where people can tax their motor vehicles.  This would be a most welcome development.</P>
    <P>Housing is a major part of any local authority's activities and I cannot let this opportunity pass without bringing to the Minister's attention the deplorable state of the housing list within Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council. Virtually no houses have been constructed in the last three years and housing list applications have reached crisis proportions.  In the city and county we are back to the old days of mass overcrowding, unhealthy living conditions <Col N="365" /> and two or three families in the one household.  Will this Bill provide money to enable councils to get rid of the atrocious waiting lists?</P>
    <P>Because local government reform has not progressed over the last four or five years infrastructure in the council has deteriorated seriously.  A member of the Dublin-Fingal Committee or Dublin County Council has about six questions down to the county manager on each month's agenda.  While the manager can give a sympathetic reply to any query raised, he must add that there is no finance available to carry out urgent works. I instanced questions I put to him about the break up of roadways and pathways in the Baldoyle-Howth-Sutton area.  No proper resurfacing or reinstatement has taken place there in the last five years.</P>
    <P>On the environment side, the marvellous walks and rights-of-way on the Hill of Howth are overgrown and impossible to use.  Thus a very valuable tourist amenity is ruined.  The Dublin county manager has made several efforts to put in place schemes for the necessary work in this regard, but he has failed so far this year to get approval from the Department of Labour.  Annual cleaning up schemes for beaches such as the Burrow Beach in Sutton, Dollymount Strand and other beaches in the area and the Baldoyle estuary have not been carried out at all in the last few years.  This is deplorable. The development of the Baldoyle nature reserve has not progressed because of lack of finance.  I know the Department of the Marine have a say in that and it is not fair to blame the council because the work has not progressed so far, but I ask the Minister to use his good offices to have this excellent amenity upgraded and to provide the proper signs and pathways and make it more accessible to people who like to come and see the wonderful wildlife which over-winters there.  I am sure the Minister is aware that this estuary, like Rogerstown estuary, has been twinned.  The Baldoyle estuary has been twinned with an estuary in the Polar Bear Pass and it is a vital link in the food chain of migratory birds who over-winter in the Baldoyle estuary.  I ask <Col N="366" /> the Minister to use his good offices and put the excellent amenities there on the map by providing proper signs and pathways.</P>
    <P>Another area local councils must address is vandalism and teenage drinking in parks and open spaces.  This has been highlighted recently in Grange Park, Raheny, where gangs of youths are congregating in open spaces, terrorising households with house breaking and handbag snatching to finance their drinking parties.  The local gardai and local authorities are powerless to do anything about this because no proper deterrent is available to them.  The courts can only impose fines of £2 on conviction.  I have asked the Minister for Justice to impose a fine in the region of £200.  This problem is rampant throughout Dublin city and county.  The Minister should ensure within this legislation that powers are available to local authorities to provide their own security.  Local authorities should have powers to provide even their own policing of parks and open spaces where real problems arise.</P>
    <P>Another area I wish to address is the much publicised section 4 motion procedure used by councillors to instruct a county manager to carry out developments against his advice.  Dublin County Council's agenda is crammed each month with section 4 motions most of which call for the rezoning of land, in some cases allowing for the building of 400 or 500 houses.  These motions cause serious division in local communities.  On the one hand there is the developer whose only interest is to build houses, usually against the wishes of the local community and against advice from planners.</P>

      <P>I will not do so and I have not done so.  I am talking about myself.  Local residents must then campaign against such developments, mostly without proper back-up and they must raise funds in order to engage the services of a planner and lobby their local councillors to vote against such a proposal. On most applications councillors are put under seige by the developer and residents and often have to run the gauntlet when entering Dublin County Council meetings to avoid unwelcome approaches from developers and local community groups who in general do not come from one's own constituency.  I suppose that point is worth making.  Many of the section 4 motions which are put down at Dublin County Council level come from councillors who do not represent the area in question.  This is deplorable and should be stopped.  I am not campaigning for the abolition of section 4 motions.  Councillors need this power in relation to matters other than planning and I welcome the new arrangements proposed in the Bill.  However, I would suggest that section 4 motions concerning planning and development matters be abolished.  These matters should be left to the experts, the architects, town planners and others employed by the council who are qualified in the area.  The abuse of section 4 has led to much undesirable development within the Dublin County Council area.  The proper infrastructure for these developments does not exist and the manager is forced to seek the necessary money.  This is a principal reason for the number of unfinished estates in the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council areas.  If planning proceeded in the proper way there would not be unfinished estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> Will the Minister assure the House that each of the three new councils within the Dublin County Council area will have adequate staff and finance?  Have the personnel in Dublin County Council been consulted or have negotiations taken place with their unions?</P>
    <P>This Bill is flawed.  The reintroduction of the majority vote can lead to an abuse of democracy.  If the majority vote were to apply in Dublin County Council or the proposed councils and committees, Fianna Fáil would have a majority on the committees and other parties would be left without any say.  This is an abuse of democracy.</P>
    <P>The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Michael Donnelly, is doing an excellent job.  I served with him as a member of Dublin Corporation for many happy years.  He has proposed that the office of Lord Mayor should be filled by direct election and I would support that proposal.  The role is mainly ceremonial and I believe the Lord Mayor should have more powers.  That system works well in the United States.  I would not be against directly electing Chairpersons of Dublin County Council or the three proposed new councils.  Chairpersons, whether directly elected or appointed under the existing system, should be paid a proper salary and given proper back-up services. It would be well worth the money and local government generally would benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the House that the Government proposed that an all-party committee should be set up to consider the question of local government reform and that the principal Opposition party refused to participate. Their rather lame excuse was that the terms of reference did not include the funding of local authorities.  They should have realised the importance of deciding in the first place on the broad structures which are desirable and have sought to make significant progress in that area. The experience of our sister island in trying to find a workable replacement for the heated poll tax should make it <Col N="369" /> obvious that it would be foolish to postpone reform until the extremely difficult problem of local revenue can be solved.</P>
      <P>The Government were determined before embarking on this legislation to use the democratic process to the limit. In the absence of a proposed all-party committee, the Taoiseach took the initiative in establishing a special committee of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, whose terms of reference provided that they should make an important input to the Government's deliberations on local government reorganisation and reform.  I had the honour to act as chairman of this committee and we were grateful to have the skilful assistance of Dr. Martin Mansergh who acted as our secretary. The Committee consisted of 14 Deputies and Senators, all of whom had considerable experience of local government. We met on 18 occasions during the latter half of last year and I must pay tribute to the members for the manner in which they performed their task, sometimes at general personal inconvenience, especially during the summer recess of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In preparing our recommendations we carefully studied many reports issued during the past 20 years.  We also invited submissions from Fianna Fáil councillors throughout the country.  The response was most heartening and valuable.  We made a working visit to England to study their system and their experience of reforms implemented over the years.  Our final report was submitted to the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment on 5 December last and to our parliamentary party a week later.  Backbenchers are often preceived by the general public as merely voting fodder in these Houses.  The experience of this and other committees in the recent past shows that the Government believe in involving as many Members as possible in the formulation of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant number of our proposals have been incorporated in this Bill.  We wanted to cut out unnecessary bureaucracy which involves referring virtually every significant decision to Dublin for approval.  The Bill enables the Minister <Col N="370" /> to devolve a whole range of functions and powers to local authorities by provisional order, to be confirmed by the Oireachtas. The Opposition have made a deal of noise about the Minister giving himself wide-ranging powers.  He is making sure that reform takes place progressively as it is seen to be desirable.  To expect details of every item to be listed at this stage is less than realistic.  Fianna Fáil Members will be as vigilant as any in ensuring that these powers are devolved without unreasonable delay.  I am confident that the Minister will not require to be pushed in this respect.</P>
    <P>We urge the re-establishment of committees to deal with such matters as health, agriculture and education.  Part VI of the Bill provides for the establishment of such committees, either in an advisory capacity or with designated functions.  This is a welcome development which has been called for by many public representatives and political parties.</P>
    <P>We recommended that managers, and other staff, be more accountable to the councils and that the system adopted for departmental secretaries should apply to managers.  Section 47 prescribes a maximum term of office for future city and county managers.  The day is gone when people could sign on and expect to be employed for 40 years.  We are all accountable.  Public representatives are accountable on 27 June next when we go before the people.  In some parts of the country there has been much criticism of the attitude of management to public representatives.  We do not have that problem in Cork where we have had excellent relations with our city manager and his predecessors.  I envisage that this part of the legislation will help to develop greater liaison, greater co-operation and greater accountability in this area.</P>
    <P>We stress the importance of making the planning process more accountable rather than leaving all the important decisions in this area to the experts.  To say that planning should be left entirely to the experts is like saying that defence policy should be left to the generals.  We acknowledge that the role of elected <Col N="371" /> members needs to be the subject of review, but we urge that in the meantime the rules regarding section 4 motions must be tightened so that the signatories are properly accountable to the people affected.  Section 44 provides for changes in section 4 motions which will ensure they are not brought into disrepute.  Similarly, section 45 provides that three-quarters of the total membership must vote in favour of material contravention of a development plan as will be the case with section 4 motions.</P>
    <P>In my 12 years as a member of Cork Corporation, section 4 motions were moved on only three occasions.  This is a good record of co-operation with both management and the council.  Unfortunately the experience of the committee was that this was not the situation in many parts of the country where section 4 motions were used weekly.  This is unsatisfactory because today we want value for money, greater efficiency and up-dating local government.  This part of the legislation will be of immense assistance to councillors and management and I hope it will eliminate many of the unnecessary section 4 motions being put down in various parts of the country, but this may be directed to the attitude of the manager. I hope as a result of what the Minister is endeavouring to achieve it will eliminate that problem.</P>
    <P>We recommended the setting up of regional authorities in order that the roles of county councils and county borough corporations could be co-ordinated in certain areas of operation.  Section 43 provides for the setting up of eight regional authorities based on the areas at present applying to health boards.  Some people were concerned that these authorities would be imposed on the councils. The Minister makes it clear that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>Regional authorities can have an important role in future regional planning and can have a direct role in the area of EC funding.  This is a welcome development. It is reasonable that public representatives at local level would be concerned that, in the event of another <Col N="372" /> tier of local government, their power would be eroded.  I can assure them this is a progressive step.  We have designated regions for EC Structural Funds, such as tourism, transport and many other areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Cork and Kerry where we have a common interest; one's interest does not end at the boundary of one's county.  This will be an ideal opportunity for public representatives to become involved in a broader sense and make a greater contribution to the region they represent.</P>
    <P>These are some of the many recommendations the Minister has taken on board from our report.  The fact that he did not refer to the report merely underlines the shyness and modesty of our party.  With the exception of the Labour Party, we were the only party that made any submissions in this area.  I would like to deal at length with many other aspects of the Bill but I do not want to use up the valuable time the Opposition have claimed is so urgently needed to debate the Bill.  However, there are a few other points I would like to make.</P>
    <P>Already, there has been some controversy concerning the powers the Minister has in regard to the adjustment of electoral area boundaries.  Perhaps the Minister would consider an amendment to section 32 which states: &ldquo;The Minister may request a boundary committee &mdash; (a) to prepare a report under section 33 with respect to the boundary of any local electoral area ...&rdquo;  The Minister should be obliged to have the views of the boundary committee on the adjustment of local electoral area boundaries before a decision is made.  Such a change would be in keeping with the general approach of having boundaries the subject of a report from the boundary committee.  I appreciate that it may be onerous for the committee to have to examine all possible changes in local area boundaries.  It may well be appropriate that the committee be consulted where the views of the local authority concerned are not acceptable to the Minister.  In these cases the Minister may refer the matter to the boundary committee for report.</P>
    <P>The council's primary functions will <Col N="373" /> continue to be in the areas of maintaining the basic fabric and the basic services for cities and counties for example, roads, parks, libraries, housing, sanitary services and so on.  However, in today's world there is a greater need for the local authorities to become involved in economic development to help markets to promote their own areas and to encourage the development of tourism.  These are all areas of activity which are extremely important.  I see the need for this type of involvement in my own area of Cork.</P>
    <P>Cork Corporation have already taken on board the task of encouraging job creation in the Mayfield area of Cork and through the use of an innovative and imaginative approach have managed to bring about the construction of a number of advance factories and more will follow. It is important that this type of approach be followed more fully since we cannot rely totally on economic forces to create employment in areas of greatest need. Local authorities are the best judges of the real needs of their areas.  The broadening of the legal powers of local authorities to help the development of their own areas is a very important element in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the legal framework necessary for the achievement of many of the objectives all Members wish to see. The success of the Government's efforts in this regard will depend on the political will to see them through eventually and the willingness of the central Government machine to be prepared to devolve downwards the functions of local areas which can be properly carried out at local level.</P>
    <P>Serious anomalies arise in the financing of local government.  Cities such as Cork find that because boundaries are so restricted there is very little buoyancy in terms of revenue generation.  Major developments tend to take place in green field sites outside cities.  The result is that cities find that their rate base is located outside their boundary while at the same time the need to provide services is greater.  In Cork our experience has been that groups such as the homeless tend <Col N="374" /> to go to cities thereby putting greater demands on cities.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to look at the area of greater equalisation of resources. I regret that people have been jailed for non-payment of service charges.  Those people are in jail because of legislation brought into this House by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, in July 1983, ably assisted by the main Opposition party, Fine Gael.  There has been much public comment and protest regarding this matter.  I respect the right of any individual to protest on any issue but I abhor the attitude of The Workers' Party in encouraging people not to pay their service charges and taking part in protests.</P>
    <P>As a political party The Workers' Party have the opportunity to express their views in this Chamber and in the council chamber in Cork city but they are working against the system from within, as identified in a document by one of their Dublin members, which I have in my possession.  This is irresponsible.  While there is a problem which we must try to resolve, we must not run away from the central point, as certain politicians in Cork have endeavoured to do, that is, that legislation to introduce service charges was passed in this House in July 1983. I spoke during the debate in June 1983 and I advised the Tánaiste on that occasion that service charges would develop into a much greater problem. Unfortunately I was right.</P>
    <P>We can all talk about promises.  People can refer to the promises made by Fianna Fáil.  However we could also talk about the promise to pay £9.50 a week to a housewife who stayed at home but which was never adhered to, for good economic reason.  I find a direct conflict in the contributions made by some Members yesterday when they referred to what Fianna Fáil did.  They acknowledged that they had to impose charges in 1983 because of the state of the country's finances but the reason the charges have not been removed is because of the drastic position of the State's finances.  When we took office, the national debt had been doubled, inflation was rampant and interest <Col N="375" /> rates were high.  That was the legacy we inherited from the people on the Opposition benches.  Let the people, particularly those who are making great political play of this issue locally, take note.</P>
    <P>I am stating this morning that we have a problem but we must find a solution to it.  As I understand it some of the political parties and certainly the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party believe we should have some form of local taxation.  We should sit down and discuss the problem and come up with a solution.  I have already called on the Minister to ensure that there is a greater equalisation of resources at local level.  The finger has been pointed at Dublin.  I do not wish to refer in particular to Dublin but I have tried to explain to the people of Cork that the rates support grant was cut in Dublin, the same as everywhere else but because of their wide commercial base, they were able to offset the imposition of domestic service charges against developmental charges in commercial and other areas.  In Cork, we have a very small commercial base and we need greater assistance.  If Dublin has advantages over poorer parts of the country we must find some way of correcting this anomaly and find some other way in the rates support grants to assist areas in the country that are in greater need.</P>
    <P>I was surprised yesterday to hear Deputy Mitchell making a personal attack on the Minister.  Deputy Mitchell spent two terms, almost seven years, on this side of the House during the eighties. What will he be remembered for?  He spoke about people, living just a short distance from the Minister's office in the Custom House and having no bathroom facilities but he did not say what he did when he was in Government.  Let me ask how many bathrooms he put into houses. He did not say that.  What assistance did the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government provide to those people?</P>

      <P>Much needed facilities have been provided by this Minister.  We have received more than 20 per cent of the national allocation over the past three years because of the plans we have submitted to the Department.  I can remember listening to the radio and hearing comments about Deputy Mitchell's performance in Government that were not very nice.  He may wish to forget that and I am not going to develop this point here but before we start throwing stones we should remember that.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to some of the points raised by Deputy Allen.  I agree with him that we have a housing problem and I am not running away from that.  We have to tackle the housing problem in Cork. However I must compliment the Minister on his most recent document on housing because for the first time we have options in relation to housing people.  At present 61 per cent of the people on the housing list are lone parents and many of them are being offered accommodation in locations that are unsuitable locations in which, and I am referring to my own city, I would much prefer not to live.  The Minister is giving a number of options to local authorities to house people where they wish to be housed and in the way they want to be housed.  The blanket knocking of the Minister, statements calling on him to resign, and so on are mere waffle.  This is unbecoming of people who are supposed to be making a constructive contribution to the debate and it is not very helpful either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will certainly lobby the Minister for greater resources for my own area. However, if we want to take an all-party approach to this problem, we should <Col N="377" /> adopt an all-party approach and not say one thing one day and something else at local level.</P>
    <P>Members referred to the allocation of national lottery funds but my Opposition colleague did not give us accurate information when he spoke yesterday.  Last year over £750,000 in lottery funds was allocated to Cork, of which £250,000 went to the city.  I am not saying that is enough, we all need more, but we should at least acknowledge the assistance that has been given to the region.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  For the first time in over 40 years a real attempt is being made to do something at local level.  I believe this offers an ideal opportunity for the Members of the Dáil to participate in framing the legislation. This is only the beginning of local government reform.  It is an ongoing process that will take time, effort and co-operation. We are also members of local authorities and irrespective of the political division in this House &mdash; naturally the Opposition have to play the Opposition role and I understand that &mdash; I appeal to them to play a positive role.  I hope that as a result of our contributions on this legislation, local government will be seen to be effective into the nineties and into the next century and then we can say we will have made a worthwhile contribution to improving things and achieving greater efficiency thus creating a better environment at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Wallace let me say that I found his contribution enlightening particularly his reference to the vast investment in housing and inner city development in Cork.  He certainly has scotched a perception that seems to be prevalent in Dublin that we in Mayo are getting a large slice of the action.  That is far from the truth.  I wonder if it is the Progressive Democrats input into Government that is responsible for the allocations to Cork, or if Deputy Wallace and his Fianna Fáil colleagues are responsible for it.  Be that as it may, we in Mayo have not been so fortunate in getting our share of the national largesse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> One of the major sources of grievance of local authorities over the years has been the gradual whittling away of powers.  There has been a very gradual, but perceptible diminution of the real powers of local authorities, whether urban councils, corporations, borough councils, town commissioners or county councils.  The words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; are a misnomer in this context.  Over the years those involved in local government have found themselves gradually relegated to being not local representatives but local administrators.</P>
    <P>The Bill was a long time coming.  There was great controversy in relation to the composition of the committee.  As Chief Whip, I expressed major reservations in relation to our participation on the committee. Our participation was conditional on a very reasonable ground, that we would not participate in any all-party committee unless that committee tackled the fundamental, basic, elementary problem of the financing of local authorities. We said we would agree to participate provided the Government agreed to set up an all-party taxation committee.  We regard the financing of local authorities as being part and parcel of the overall national financial component.  Local taxation cannot be taken in isolation.  There needs to be reform of the overall tax system, whether it be income tax, indirect taxation, or value added tax.  The whole spectrum of taxation needs to be tackled. Therefore, we would participate in a committee only if a parallel committee would operate that would de-politicise the whole aspect of the debate.  That was a reasonably generous and reasonable offer, but it was turned down by the major party in Government.  The Government parties decided to go ahead on their own.</P>
    <P>The Bill that eventually emerged has been a gross disappointment.  In the months the committee have met there have been informed leaks about what the Bill would contain.  There was a general air of expectation that there would be fundamental and major reform of local <Col N="379" /> government, but what eventually emerged was nothing more than a pallid dissertation of the compromise views of the parties in Government.  I have no hesitation in joining my colleague.  Deputy Mitchell and other colleagues on this side of the House in opposing the Bill.  After all the deliberation and the informed leaks the Bill is a hopelessly inept attempt to bring about much-needed and long-promised local government reform.</P>
    <P>In the twenties we got our freedom as a nation but we certainly did not get our freedom as a people.  My belief is that we in the provinces will never free ourselves until we shake off our shackles or dependency on central Government and control from Dublin.  In gaining our freedom what we have done is simply replaced control from London with a different kind of colonial power, control from the centre in Dublin.  Over the years, rather than devolving power to the regions and the people of Ireland, power has in fact accrued in a very colonialist way to the very centre in Dublin.  Rather than bestowing genuine local democratic input to the people on the ground, the Bill further solidifies and consolidates the central control of the Minister and the Government.  It is quite clear, therefore, that if there is to be genuine devolved power in rural Ireland and in the provinces to enable genuine local government input then there will be a major battle ahead and some other Government will have to bring forward another major local government reform Bill.  Another, more meaningful, Bill is required if we are to give discretion, autonomy, and democracy to the countries and the regions at local level.</P>
    <P>A strong and independent local government system is worth fighting for. There will be bitter disappointment among local authorities and members of all parties when they sit down to deliberate the contents of the Bill, because it does nothing for local democracy.  Every provision in the Bill means that the regions will have to genuflect to Dublin before they can take any real or worthwhile local initiative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> It is clear that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government view of democracy is very much that power resides by right at the centre and that the centre therefore allows at its own discretion, and only at its own discretion, that part of power to drift down to the people at grassroots level.  That is precisely the wrong and inverted view of democracy.  In any real system of democratic government power has to be seen, and must be underlined and underpinned, at local level.  Democratic power is delegated upwards, not downwards. The institutions of Government, and the tiers of Government through which the public services are delivered must reflect the delegation of power upwards.  In other words, the strongest tier of Government for the provision of services must be the closest to the people.  Not only is that argument to be made in terms of democracy, but it has also been proved conclusively in numerous studies undertaken through the years that the most effective, efficient, and economic way to operate public services is through multipurpose local authorities based on average units of population of 18,000 people. Unfortunately, we do not appear to have learnt that lesson here yet.</P>
    <P>There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the primary reason for the decay and death of the west of Ireland has been the constant refusal by Dublin Government after Dublin Government to delegate any kind of independent decision-making powers to the counties and the regions.  I do not have the slightest hesitation in saying that the provinces &mdash; and I can speak as a Member from the west &mdash; would be much better off as autonomous or semi-independent regions on their own than they are under the present set up.  At present we must constantly doff our caps in a beholden fashion when time and time again we come on delegations in the direction of the mandarins in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>Every local authority house has to be approved by the Minister for the Environment. Every sewerage and water scheme must have his specific approval. Every time we move a speed limit we <Col N="381" /> must send a memorandum to the mandarins in the Custom House.  We cannot build a library, a fire station, or a halting site without the time-consuming and costly procedures of submitting the proposals and plans to the Department of the Environment, getting permission to go to tender, vetting the tenders locally, and then sending them to Dublin for further examination and approval.  There follows the inevitable stream of queries, clarifications, and further points of clarification, and the recommendation from Dublin to scale down or water down the project.  Eventually, perhaps &mdash; and only perhaps &mdash; after a long and time-consuming delay, there comes the green light.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most recent and glaring example of lack of central Government's trust and confidence in local authorites was the handling of the amenity grants scheme under the national lottery fund. Local authorities were asked by the Minister to advertise in the local press for applications.  There was a great air of expectation that there would be a major bonanza for communities.  Every community group, sporting and recreational, submitted applications.  The applications were taken to the offices of county secretaries in the local authorities but the secretaries cannot vet them.  The secretaries simply have to put them in alphabetical order, having been specifically told not to prioritise them in any way. The applications will go to the Custom House and after three or four months the Minister will decide exactly who is to be grant-aided.  That is an indication of the lack of input by local authorities on something so fundamental, independent local knowledge.</P>
    <P>The west of Ireland will never thrive as long as there is a centrally handed down system of Government. The ironic point is that the west has the real resources of this country.  The west has huge natural resources that have not been harnessed, tapped, or properly exploited because of lack of Government interest. We have failed to harness the resources through either local or national interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> For example, in Mayo we have more Blue Flag beaches per kilometre of coastline than anywhere else in the world.  We have clean, unpolluted air, lakes, rivers, and the Atlantic laden with fish.  There are numerous golf courses, magnificent scenery and cheap accommodation.  We have land which, if not suitable for agricultural purposes on the same scale as are the plains of Meath, the plains of Kildare, or the Golden Vale, is certainly extremely suitable for the production of one of our greatest shortages, timber.  Yet we get only a minuscule share of the national tourist revenue.  We have never been vested with the real power of selling our own product.  For example, Ireland West, the local tourist promotion organisation, and their counterpart in the north-western region are extremely limited in their promotional opportunities.  For example, they cannot advertise abroad.  All the details as to requirements and standards must be set down by Bord Fáilte.  As I said, all foreign promotional work is done by the Bord Fáilte office in Dublin. Despite the modern era of promotion and advertising, and specially hiring agencies to sell a product, if an agency is selling a similar product for nine different people, there is nobody else better qualified or more committed to selling your product than yourself.  There are dozens of communities in provincial Ireland with vast resources, capable, willing and anxious to put together integrated packages and sell them directly abroad, but this local initiative does not get a single penny of central Government funding because Bord Fáilte are the national organisation vested with the power to do the job.</P>
    <P>The promotion of the counties and regions of Ireland for industrial purposes is not carried out by the local IDA offices but by the central IDA office in Dublin. There is liaison between the regional offices and the central office, but nothing more.  There is an understandable tendency that industrialists who come here go in the direction in which they are pointed by headquarters in Dublin.  After all, they are the people who give the grants.  At county council level there are county development teams, but they are county <Col N="383" /> development teams in theory only.  They have enormous potential and goodwill but they get a mere £20,000 to £25,000 per annum, sin an méid.  They are toothless tigers.  There is more money spent on travelling expenses than in stimulating local initiatives or giving priming grants because the resources are not available.</P>
    <P>I fail to see why a decent industrial loans scheme cannot be set up.  For example, £200,000 per annum, not an excessive amount, could be given to each county development team to promote small local initiatives either of a service or manufacturing nature within each county.  It would be a revolving fund that would be self-financing because people would repay the loans, at a low rate of interest.  That is an initiative that would be well worth while, yet there is no reference to it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The plea to devolve powers to the provinces has been made time and again over the years but has amounted to nothing. One of the biggest tragedies is that we were led to believe that with access to the EC, particularly in the context of 1992, greater cohesion and the availability of Structural and Regional Funds, the regions would thrive.  However if a region has a good idea it cannot apply directly to Brussels for finance.  Every application for finance, from £1 to £1 million, must be channelled through the Department of Finance in Merrion Street, and we know it will never see the light of day in Brussels.  If the local authorities are to function properly surely it is fundamental that they be given the right of direct access to Brussels for finance.  Again this possibility is precluded.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Wallace talking about devolving power to the regions. He said section 43 sets up eight regional authorities, but that is meaningless.  It is another charade.  They would simply be replacements for the regional development organisations if they could not make direct application to Brussels for Structural Funds.  The Structural Funds go directly to the Department of Finance and only the crumbs from the rich man's table get to the regions.  A good example <Col N="384" /> of that is the new roads plan where the funds simply go as far as the border, Rosslare, Kinnegad or Portlaoise and no further.</P>
    <P>The relationship between central Government and local government was well illustrated when the now defunct national development plan was being put together.  The EC naively had the idea that Ireland in common with other countries would promote the idea of partnership with local and regional interests. Instead, the Government responded by abolishing the nine regional development organisations.  Everybody accepts that the RDOs were not perfect but at least they provided a democratic forum for councillors and officials to discuss regional development.  In their place the Department of Finance set up seven new sub-regions, each with a working group dominated by civil servants from Dublin and an advisory group drawn from the social partners, with the county council chairmen thrown in &mdash; and I mean thrown in &mdash; to give the whole charade a veneer of democracy.  It emerged later that their degree of input into the National Development Plan was only to the extent to which their ideas corresponded with what had been decided by the Department of Finance.  One could hardly find a more classic example of top-down planning.</P>
    <P>Examining the contents of the Bill which is based on the Barrington report, I must go back to what Dr. Barrington said in 1989.  Dr. Barrington is a well known critic of the way we run our affairs, particularly our form of local government.  Talking about Ireland's system of local government he said:</P>
    <P>Intensive centralisation since the 1920s has been a ghastly failure with central Government sinking into a sludge of detailed business that clogs channels of decision, swamps strategic issues, frustrates initiative and bureaucraticises the whole.  But rather than seek the causes of the failure we take another fix of bureaucratic centralism. What a crazy way to run a democracy!</P>
    <P>I am sure Dr. Barrignton must share our <Col N="385" /> collective disillusionment and disappointment at how little of his recommendations found their way into the Local Government Bill, 1991.</P>
    <P>In this country we do not have local democracy or local government.  What we have is the trappings of local democracy. What we have, as the late Deputy John Kelly said two years ago from the backbenches, is the empty husk of democracy and faceless officials who get on with the show of running the job.  We simply have an elaborate system not of local government but of local administration. While we might fool ourselves by thinking that we have local government structures with 115 local authorities, town commissioners, urban councils, corporations and borough councils, they are authorities in name only.  Indeed, the relationship between them and central Government is very much one of acting simply in <i>loco parentis</i> because local councils are treated no better than errant children.  Nothing is too small to escape the attention of the civil servants in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that we who fought so hard for democracy should end up with the most centralised democratic form of government.  Furthermore it is ironic that at a time when the highly centralised systems of the East are disintegrating, we should introduce a Bill which further asserts central control and tightens the stranglehold of the Minister and the Government on local government and stultifies, negatives and kills off any prospect of local government.</P>
    <P>Looking at the developed western democracies, particularly continental Europe, local government is the main vehicle for the delivery of public services. Yet democracy in this country is based on a model in which all power resides majestically in a highly centralised core. This power and discretion are delegated and circulated downwards away from the centre.  We get eventually what is left over, the power that central Government are simply not interested in, the residual powers which are no use to them, the peripheral powers, the crumbs from the rich man's table, as I said previously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> When one compares this attitude with continental Europe one can see the huge contrast.  In continental Europe, country by country &mdash; these are the new models even after the break-up of the Warsaw Pact countries &mdash; they see power residing naturally with the grass roots and the people.  Responsibility for services is seen as residing most effectively, efficiently, economically and democratically with the local community.  Only the services which cannot be provided by the community from their own resources are delegated to the region and, if the region cannot provide the service in question, it is ultimately delegated to central Government. This is how it should be in Ireland but it will not be under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is an official attitude within Government Departments that certain files which come from the provinces are sometimes initialled or stamped MAD &mdash; in this instance &ldquo;MAD&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;maximum administrative delay&rdquo;.  In other words, if it does not suit central Government, and if it will cost too much, every possible administrative obstacle will be put in the way.  In relation to various plans, developmental, environmental or others, which have come from the regions over the years quite a number have been consigned to the MAD scrap heap.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell said that one of the frightening aspects of the Bill is the degree of power and the stranglehold which the Minister will have in relation to a number of key issues.  One of these relates to the electoral areas.  For example, section 12 of the Bill says that the Minister may by order fix for each local electoral area the number of <Col N="388" /> members of the council of the county borough to be elected therefore and the number of those members who are to be aldermen, but what is crucial and fundamental to democracy is that if a number is to be fixed it should be done in relation to proportionality.  However, having perused the Bill I cannot find any evidence of proportionality or ratio.  We know that in existing local authorities there are an extreme number of variables in relation to the number of councillors representing particular areas, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the population.  Furthermore, the Minister has the power to alter the number of such members who are to be aldermen. It is essentially a question of title but it again gives absolute discretion to the Minister.</P>
      <P>One of the most sinister powers also devolved to the Minister is the discretionary right to draw the boundaries without necessarily having recourse to the independent committee referred to in the Bill.  I take on board the point made by Deputy Wallace but this is an aspect of the Bill which should be again examined by the Minister and amendments should be accepted by him.  It is fundamental that any tinkering with boundaries or numbers should be done by an independent commission at local or national level.</P>
      <P>Section 16 of the Bill deals with vocational education; we know that VECs are comprised of not fewer than five and not more than eight members of local authorities, county councils in other words.  We also know that every urban council can nominate two members provided there are fewer than four urban councils within a particular county council area.  Every local authority can and do nominate two members of urban district councils directly to vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that, unfortunately, elections for the urban councils and town commissioners are not going ahead, the members of urban councils <i>in situ</i> which means that the results of the 1985 local elections in urban council areas will decide the urban council members on the <Col N="389" /> new VECs which will be elected something like 21 days after the local elections on 27 June.  I do not doubt that the stranglehold on many of those urban councils has been by the major Government party which, therefore, translated to VECs.  Despite the fact that there may be an anti-Government swing in local elections which would give control of county councils to other parties.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Wishful thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen, the Deputy's party have never done well in council elections, apart from 1985. This will give an unreal majority to Fianna Fáil, in particular on VECs.  We know the consequences of that &mdash; it means the appointment of teachers, post responsibility holders, principals, vice principals and caretakers to community colleges and vocational schools.  I know the Minister had a particular difficulty in this regard.</P>
      <P>What worries me in relation to the Bill &mdash; it has been said in the House on numerous occasions over the last three days &mdash; is why the Minister has not been specific in relation to giving a definite headline within which the urban council or the town commissioner elections should be held.  He would allay many fears and suspicions if he did so.  He should do so at the conclusion of Second Stage because there are genuine anxieties on the other side of the House in this regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wallace's contribution was interesting.  As chairman of the committee, he had a full involvement in what went on within the committee.  He admitted that there is a crisis in relation to the financing of local authorities, particularly in his native city of Cork.  It is unfortunate that there is no financial provision in the Bill because, if we are to have meaningful local authorities, they must have devolved revenue raising powers.  It is a difficult problem, a political bed of nails, a minefield, but it is something which should be tackled and which should have been tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the problem in <Col N="390" /> relation to the financing of local authorities did not begin in 1977, it began before then, but it was exacerbated by what happened in 1977 and it got progressively worse within the next two to three years, it will have to be tackled.  I do not know whether it should be tackled on an all party, single party or unilateral basis.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to understand the present outrage in certain local authorities in relation to service charges.  A service must be paid for.  My own belief in relation to service and service charges is that, unfortunately, when the 1983 Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill was brought in, it was not uniformly implemented and enforced across the board.  That was a tragedy and it has given rise to the glaring anomaly where, for example, there are service charges in Leixlip in County Kildare, which is on one side of the Liffey, and no charges in Dublin, which is on the other side.</P>
    <P>I come from County Mayo, a county which would not be looked on as having a high level of <i>per capita</i> income; yet we have an 85 per cent success rate in relation to service charges.  We have a charge of £75 for water and sewerage services and a £25 charge for refuse services. Perhaps we have managed to inculate a better degree of civil appreciation of the services among the people there. We have found that the charges work well and people appreciate the services they get.  There is a general acknowledgement that a charge of £100 per year or £2 per week per household for water, sewerage and refuse services is good value.</P>
    <P>The key safety valve in relaton to service charges is the waiver.  It is also the great safety value in relation to the provision of social equity and equalisation across the board.  Our county manager, his later predecessor and officials operate the waiver in a very worthwhile and discretionary fashion.  I believe this is what has helped us to have the kind of financial equilibrium and general acceptance of the scheme we have.  If this can happen in County Mayo, the most far flung <Col N="391" /> county in the country, I do not understand why it cannot happen elsewhere.  It is unfortunate that these charges were not enforced when they were brought in.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am disappointed with the Bill.  I thought it would have teeth and clout and would genuinely reform local government.  I also thought it would give us from the provinces a worthwhile democratic input but unfortunately it has done very little, if any, of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what Deputy Higgins had to say.  I do not agree with everything he said but I have to say &mdash; I will refer to this point in more detail later &mdash; that it is the first contribution I heard from that side of the House which tried to address the issue before us, local government reform.  As I said, I will refer later to the contributions made by other members on that side of the House.</P>
      <P>Perhaps on mature reflection, Deputy Higgins will withdraw the remarks he made about civil servants and what they do with files from County Mayo, County Meath or elsewhere.  I am not that long in this House but I think it is a tradition here that civil servants who cannot defend themselves in the House are not attacked in this manner.  I am sure Deputy Higgins will withdraw his remarks at the earliest opportunity.  He may want to transfer the blame to the Minister of State who is broad shouldered and can take that on.  The tradition of not referring to people who cannot defend themselves in the House is one which should be continued.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to some other points raised by Deputy Higgins.  Section 12 provides for the division of county boroughs into local electoral areas and so on.  All that is involved in this section is a consolidation of existing laws which have been scattered over a number of enactments since 1898.  As recently as 1985, a defect was found in relation to Galway arising from the Local Government (Re-Organisation) Act, 1985.  There is nothing new or sinister in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also referred to the <Col N="392" /> boundary changes and the discretionary powers of the Minister.  The Minister has the power at present to change boundaries without reference to anyone.  Contrary to what has been alleged, the Minister is making provision in the Bill for consultation &mdash; local authorities may initiate boundary changes themselves. This is a step in the right direction.  Perhaps, as Deputy Higgins and Deputy Wallace said, this could be amended further so that this function could be carried out independently.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill in this area which will be a welcome addition to the powers of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which I regard as the first real reforming measure to be introduced in 20 years of talking.  I am a passionate believer in local government; strong local government is essential.  Like Deputy Higgins, I believe very few people would say that local government is alive, well and healthy in Ireland; it is not.  This problem has been with us for the past 20 years &mdash; perhaps it existed before that &mdash; when mention was first made of reform and White Papers were published.</P>
    <P>I firmly agree with the principle of subsidiarity. Where services can be provided they should be provided at the level closest to people.  Yesterday some speakers referred to subsidiarity in relation to the EC and said that as the Government have accepted the principle of subsidiarity in relation to EC and Government affairs they should also do so nationally.  I should like them to go a step further and accept the same principle in relation to local government and local services.  What we need is local government, something we do not have at present.  What we have at present is the administration of central services by local authorities at a local level.  Government means having power and power means responsibility.  Perhaps some people would not like to see this at local level.  It is a double edged sword. Councillors who are shouting for more powers and so on will have to be prepared to accept more responsibility for their own affairs.  Even though I only regard it as a preliminary Bill, this Bill contains <Col N="393" /> many provisions which will give councillors added powers.  I hope they will be able to face the responsibility that this entails.</P>
    <P>Much of the malaise in local government stems from a lack of power and responsibility by councillors to manage their affairs locally.  In case I am misquoted, I am not saying that they act irresponsibly.  However, they have no real responsibility for many of the things which happen in their areas and 85 per cent or 90 per cent of their budgets are decided before they start to talk about estimates, pensions, employment and so on.</P>
    <P>I believe many councillors feel frustrated in their role as local public representatives because of this lack of responsibility and power.  If this Bill has not been published, no procedures put in place over the past 12 months, no recommendations made by the expert committee and no commitment given by the Government to reform local government, I believe many councillors would not be standing for re-election in this year's local elections.  Councillors have felt totally frustrated and believed they were getting nowhere.  This Bill and the report of the expert advisory committee restored their belief that reforms would be introduced in the local government area.  I also believe many members of the public were frustrated with our system of local government.  They were frustrated at the inability of local authorities and their members to do things.  Simple things which could have been done very quickly a few years back can no longer be done and people believed there was no point in giving local authorities extra powers or functions.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am a firm believer in local government.  I was looking forward very much to this debate as I felt it was an ideal opportunity to put local government reform to the fore in this House.  I thought there would be an exchange of views across the Floor and that new ideas and suggestions would be put forward which would improve the Bill.  I also thought suggestions would be put forward in regard to the remainder of the reform <Col N="394" /> programme which must be put in place. So far I have been gravely disappointed.  I listened with interest to Deputy Higgins, the first Fine Gael speaker to address the structures of local government and the broader issues rather than talk about potholes, housing and so on as did other Fine Gael speakers.  They are all important issues in their own right but this debate should not be hijacked to try to score political points in the run up to the local elections.  A housing Bill, and a national road authority Bill, will be introduced shortly and people can make points about roads and potholes and so on in the debates on them.  The issue to be addressed here is local government reform.  I have heard nothing but whining and complaints from the Opposition, particularly from Fine Gael, to the effect that they did not have enough time, that there was not enough in the Bill and so on.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's initial criticism was that they did not have enough time to consider the Bill and to consult with various bodies on it.  I am not surprised that Fine Gael are in such disarray.  For 20 years there has been talk about local government reform and dozens of reports have been produced.  In 1981, when Meath County Council, at the request of the Minister for the Environment, began studying reports so as to prepare submission on local government reform, 17 reports had to be consulted.  There have been dozens of reports since then dealing with all aspects of local government.  There have been hundreds of seminars and conferences about local government, and yet Fine Gael tell us that they have not had enough time to consider this Bill or to consult. Even without the preamble to which I referred the Government clearly signalled their intention to reform local government as far back as July 1989.</P>
    <P>The Government waited nine months for Fine Gael to join an all-party committee, but they refused point blank to do so.  In desperation, when we could not get all-party support, the Government in June 1990 announced that they were setting up a Cabinet sub-committee. They commissioned a report from the Barrington Commission who asked for <Col N="395" /> submissions.  When those submissions were considered on 7 March this year the Minister announced that would be in the Local Government Bill.  There are not any surprises in it.  That was two months ago.  Is 20 years not long enough for Fine Gael to prepare for a debate on reforms like this?  Did they not have enough time to consult people since June 1990?  Could they not have consulted people since 7 March 1991 when they knew the specifics of the Bill?  Why did not their spokespersons contact their own councillors to get a reaction to what the Minister was proposing.</P>
    <P>If the front bench spokespersons from Fine Gael had contacted some of their members on Meath County Council, those councillors would have been able to brief them fully on the merits of many of the proposals the Minister is putting forward in this Bill.  They could have contacted the secretary of the General Council of County Councils, AMAI and LAMA to try to get a reaction.  Those bodies are not that remote that they would not facilitate Opposition spokespersons. I have no doubt that the Labour Party's and The Workers' Party's spokespersons did precisely that.  If Fine Gael had done that they would have been better prepared for this debate and would not have had to whine.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the time argument is all nonsense.  Fine Gael did not need time, they needed a few ideas, clear thinking and a more positive attitude to the Bill.  Fine Gael at parliamentary party level do not give a hang about local government or local democracy and that is a shame.  The Fine Gael front bench spokespersons have let many fine local Fine Gael public representatives down by their attitude to this and their incompetence in handling it.  The front bench spokespersons I heard certainly do not reflect the views of many Fine Gael councillors who are deeply committed to local government.  The spokespersons should get their act together and consult with those councillors before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The expert committee which was set <Col N="396" /> up received submissions from all types of groups &mdash; banks, chambers of commerce, local authorities, local authority members, residents' associations, planning institutes, An Taisce and various professional organisations.  It is not surprising that Fine Gael are not included in that list.  That is the extent of their commitment to local government.  Are they so bereft of ideas that they could not make a submission even to the expert committee?  The debate so far shows that they are bereft of ideas and it is no wonder that they are in the state they are in.  I regret this very much as local government deserves better.  I sincerely hope we will get better from Fine Gael when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the concept of local government, because of the problems local authorities have faced, we are often asked why we need local government. The closer decision-making is to the people the better.  If decision-making is more accessible, it is obviously more acceptable.  People may not agree with all the decisions made but they feel they can have some influence if they know the people making the decisions, whether it be the local councillor at local level or the TD at national level.  People need to know that they can have some influence either directly or indirectly on the decision-making process.  If people feel they do not have that influence frustration sets in.  Over the last eight to ten years particularly, there has been an increased number of pressure groups on various issues.  This is because people have been frustrated with the system.  They feel it is not amenable to them, that they do not have access to it and so on.  This has occurred because local authorities seem to have less and less power and control. At the extreme end of this phenomenon it can lead to subversion and undermining of all democratic institutions.  We do not have to look too far away from this country to see that.  It is important that people have direct access to decision-making processes in local government.</P>
    <P>It is important also to have a strong system of local government because studies in Britain and Europe have proved <Col N="397" /> that &ldquo;local&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;more efficient&rdquo;. Services can be delivered more cost effectively at local level than at national level. Administration at local level where local publicly elected councillors have influence is more flexible in meeting local needs.  The further one goes from the people the less flexible the system becomes, with the result that people feel frustrated and lash out occasionally because of it.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism from all sides of the House that this Bill does not go far enough in reforming the system of local government.  I agree with that, as does everybody else in the House.  The Minister also agrees with it.  He has repeatedly stressed that this is but the first step.  In his first release of 3 May he stated that it initiates a major programme of reform. On 7 March he outlined what he would include in this Bill and went on to say that other aspects of reform would be dealt with afterwards.  The Minister has not said that this is local government reform and that this is the end of the whole thing as seems to be implied by a number of speakers.  This is just one step in the process of local government reform, and I am looking forward to the other steps along the way.</P>
    <P>If this legislation consisted of nothing else but what is in section 6 it would be very worthwhile.  Every word that has been written in relation to local government reform since 1970, with the exception of one submission that I saw, mentioned the principle of <i>ultra vires,</i> which means that the local authority must have specific legal authority to carry out any function or to carry out any work. Every submission or recommendation that I have seen over 14 years as a member of a local authority strongly advocated the abolition of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule.  Section 6 of the Bill does this.  The <i>ultra vires</i> rule is outdated and totally inflexible.  It hampered local authorities and prevented them from doing much needed work in their own areas and from responding to obvious needs and aspirations of the local communities.  The local authority had no say whatsoever in major happenings in some counties and local <Col N="398" /> authority areas, but often ended up with a Bill for those.  Let me take one example in my own constituency, the now famous concerts at Slane Castle, where promoters brought 80,000 to 100,000 people into a small village in County Meath for a two to three day period.  That created massive problems for the local population. It created huge problems regarding sanitary services, refuse collection, control of traders, sale of alcohol and so on.  The local authority, however, had no power to deal with any of that.  But for the co-operation of the promoters, there could have been chaos there.  That is just one example.  Deputy Higgins would have experience of similar events in Castlebar some years ago.  The change in section 6 will, I hope, allow local authorities to regulate and control such things and other things as well.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would suggest the making of by-laws to regulate such events and allow local authorities to impose such conditions as are necessary for regulating events such as that.  The report on crowd control suggested that some regulatory committee be set up to monitor and advise on all of these things.  I do not think there is any necessity to do that. The local authority should be given the powers to make by-laws to respond to events such as this and to regulate anything that happens within their local authority area.  The section would be strengthened by the inclusion of a provision relating to by-laws.  Overall this section is very important and has been called for by everybody who has made submissions in relation to local authority reform.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the Advisory Committee report and of the committee itself because there was no county councillor on the committee.  I can accept that local public representatives would feel snubbed by this and would always defend their right to make submissions and to be part of such committees. In this case councillors individually and local authorities as bodies made submissions and put across the points of view of members; the AMAI, LAMA and the General Council <Col N="399" /> of County Councils made submissions which would have weighed heavily.  It is obvious from the report itself that they did weigh heavily with the committee.  In another forum recently I referred to the report of the advisory expert committee as a charter for local councillors.  The general thrust of this report is excellent. There may be some disagreement in regard to some items in it which I will refer to later, for instance, the discussion on a sub-county tier of administration and the lack of clarity in regard to the functions to be devolved.  The report itself, however, accepts the principle of subsidiarity and strongly recommends it. It also accepts the primary role of the elected member of the local authority and urges a monitoring process for the implementation of the report itself.  It also urges a basic statement of principle from the Government in relation to local government.  From that base the report has gone from strength to strength in endorsing the repeated calls for a releasing of control at central level down to local level.  Deputy Higgins put the case eloquently in regard to that so I will not go back over it.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I can find no fault with this report.  I would endorse it fully.  I join with Deputy Higgins in my support of those recommendations. I take the opportunity to request from the Government a commitment to ratify the charter for local self government.  I request also a commitment from the Government for a constitutional recognition for local government.  Now that we will have regional bodies in place after the local elections a further commitment from the Government to allow access to EC funds by those regional bodies should be considered. I accept there would be difficulties but such a move would underline their obvious commitment to reform local government.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the recommendation that there be a sub-county tier of local government.  On a number of occasions in the recent past <Col N="400" /> the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at the Department, who is present in the House, sought publicly to reassure us &mdash; I welcome their assurances &mdash; that no town which already has one will lose its council or town commissioners.  I also heartily welcome their assurance that the councils will not be downgraded, if anything their functions will be enhanced. This should allay any fears people might have.</P>
    <P>With regard to a sub-county tier of local government, only two options were considered in the report.  As they were considered in great detail I do not intend to go into the pros and cons but neither is acceptable for the simple reason that they would not work.  One would have to wonder therefore why these were the only two options considered.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the district councils should consist of members of town and county councils and that in each electoral area a directly elected council should be set up in the largest town or to cover a number of towns if need be.  Some of their members together with members of the county council, should then form part of the sub-county tier being referred to. I would further suggest that these councils be financed by both the town council and the county council and that both urban and rural interests be represented at this level.  Indeed, the proposals dealing with the sub-county structures should be referred back to the advisory expert committee, if this has not been done already, as my one criticism of the committee is that they fudged this issue for some reason.  As I have said, my proposal to make the procedure used to change boundaries much simpler should be welcomed. It is the experience of the authority in my own constituency &mdash; I do not think we are the exception &mdash; that approximately two-thirds of the hinterland of each town is not included within the established urban boundaries. This makes a nonsense of local government.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposal that joint committees consisting of members of a number of county councils be established <Col N="401" /> which would form part of a regional tier of local government.  There is a definite need for co-ordination and greater co-operation between councils.  My own local authority, because of its closeness to Dublin, faces particular problems. Indeed our problems are mutual in that there has been an overspill into the countryside where the soil is not suitable for the construction of septic tanks.  We are holding discussions with Dublin County Council on a possible link with their sewerage systems.</P>
    <P>We not only are getting their co-operation but also that of the Department on that matter.  Joint committees would be very welcome in this regard given the need to co-ordinate major infrastructural developments and expenditure.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for underlining in the Bill the important role played by elected members as it is crucial they be given the status they deserve.  Their status will be enhanced if they are given a greater role and new powers with the result that people feel they are being listened to and have some influence.  The measures in the Bill dealing with the payment of allowances to chairmen of local authorities, with civic honours and with twinning arrangements are to be welcomed as they will ehance their role.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we should consider introducing an allowance to be paid to members of local authorities to cover the costs incurred in making phone calls or sending letters given that they work on a voluntary basis.  I do not think it should be done any other way.  Neither do I agree with the suggestion that councillors be paid.  However they should not find themselves out of pocket in performing their duties on behalf of the public.  Even a local authority should be able to provide franked envelopes or telephone facilities and I would ask the Minister to consider this suggestion.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to section 44 of the Bill which deals with section 4 motions.  I accept, like other Members of the House, that concern has been expressed about the abuse of these motions.  If there have been abuses they <Col N="402" /> have occurred in a minority of local authorities and have been well publicised and criticised either by members of the Opposition parties or interested groups.  The procedure is subject to public scrutiny in that members have to sign and discuss the motion.  This is all done in public. Therefore if people feel that members are abusing their position and that something untoward is happening, they have a remedy: they can remove the councillor or councillors concerned at the next election. That is what the elections are for. Given that the procedure is subject to public scrutiny and councillors are answerable to the public for their actions those who abuse the system will get their answer when the election comes round.</P>
    <P>A further safeguard in the planning laws as they are at the moment is that every one of these decisions can be appealed to an independent body.  There are cases where local authority officials appeal section 4 motions that are passed by the council to An Bord Pleanála.  I think the Bill is an unsuitable vehicle for dealing with this aspect.  We need a whole review of the present planning laws and procedures.  There has to be a careful scrutiny of decision making procedures whether at local authority or An Bord Pleanála level.</P>
    <P>Many people are concerned about the increasing number of appeals decisions made by An Bord Pleanála that are being referred back to them or that are thrown out by the High Court because proper procedures were not followed.  Very recently in County Meath the board gave a decision in relation to an employment project in the meat processing industry and it was appealed to the High Court on the basis that the board did not give the objectors enough time to get a human and social impact study.  The High Court upheld that claim and sent the file back to An Bord Pleanála.  In a previous decision on the same case the High Court referred it back to An Bord Pleanála because they had not followed proper procedures.  I am not alleging any illegal activities or irregularities in the case; I am saying the file was sent back because the High Court felt the procedures did <Col N="403" /> not protect the objectors fully.  We must have a serious look at that.</P>
    <P>To digress slightly, if we are talking about changing planning laws, section 4 decisions and so on, the structures in An Bord Pleanála should be changed to allow for different types of development. Rather than follow Deputy Browne's suggestion that we divide the board into area Boird Pleanála, perhaps we should decide that one section in An Bord Pleanála would deal with housing and such development while the other section would deal with industrial and commercial development, have experts in both and streamline the procedures and so on.  Since proposals to set up industrial projects tend to create hassle, I suggest we should have designated industrial sites where planning has been cleared and there is no need to go through a lengthy procedure.  People will know this is an industrial estate where certain types of industries will be permitted to be sited. The type of building and the facilities provided can be agreed and put before the people in a form similar to the county development plan.  All this would be subject to appeal, of course, but it would eliminate the wasteful, time consuming procedures that are necessary at present.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread criticism about the powers conferred on the Minister in the Bill.  That is nonsense.  This Bill is an enabling Bill which will allow things to happen.  Local government has been hamstrung for the last 20 years.  It is not adaptable; it is inflexible and cannot respond to change because there is no mechanism within local government legislation to make changes and to move quickly.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill give greater freedom to local authorities but many of the other sections that are criticised allow the Minister to devolve power to local authorities by ministerial order.  At present the Minister can do nothing even in regard to area boundaries.  With the best will in the world he might want to do what a local authority or groups of local authorities might ask him to do but <Col N="404" /> the legislation is so inflexible that he has no power to do it.  He is powerless to bring about change.  I appeal to Deputies, particularly those who criticise this and say the Minister is taking all the power unto himself, to read the Bill again carefully. If in future we want the changes we hope to have in the light of this report, the Minister should have power to make the changes without having to go through a cumbersome procedure.  Considering it has taken 20 years to get this Bill into the House, I would not like to have to wait another 20 years to get another one in. The powers provided in the Bill will enable the Minister to hand down further powers to local authorities.  I welcome that and those who criticise the Bill on that account should have another look at it.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister recall the expert committee and ask them what functions should be devolved to local authorities. That has to be the next stop.  A criticism I have of the report is that it is very woolly regarding what functions should be devolved.  It states clearly that functions should be devolved and that is the basic thrust of the document, but it does not spell out the functions.  We will be working in the dark until we have this information. Maybe the Minister will come forward with his own list of suggestions.</P>
    <P>The conventional wisdom, which I have heard repeated in this debate, in relation to local government reform is that you have to get finance first, whether by raising it locally or nationally.  All the discussion has been about finance up to now.  As the Minister said in his Second Stage speech, that is putting the cart before the horse.  First you talk about structures and functions and then about finance.  We have talked here about structures and the Bill will finalise the structures we are talking about.  We must talk about functions before we decide what we are going to do at subcounty level.  If you have structures in place and you know what functions these structures, or bodies within the structures, will perform, then you can say X amount will be needed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to get that <Col N="405" /> committee together again, or perhaps he would come up with a list of functions he feels could be devolved over a time and we can work towards that.  I ask him to consider favourably also the suggestion in the report that a committee be set up to monitor the implementation of reform. Perhaps on this occasion he would include representatives of the local authority associations.</P>
    <P>We have talked about the enhancement of the role of the councillor and there is mention here of giving the chairman an allowance.  Because, for one reason or another, managers are actually running local authorities, making most of the decisions and, in some cases, thwarting the views and policies of members, the Minister might consider providing that chairpersons of local authorities be directly elected, employed on a full-time basis and paid accordingly.  The chairperson would act as a counter balance to the manager in the role he has increasingly taken to himself.  There is frustration that elected members are not being listened to by the manager and that decisions taken by councillors are not being implemented.  When reports are called for councillors get only one side of the story.  With an elected public representative having a status equal to that of the manager, that position would be redressed.</P>
    <P>I warmly endorse the idea of a manager having a term of contract.  All of us can get stale in a job and I do not believe anybody should have a job of that importance for the rest of his life &mdash; we do not yet have any lady managers.  Certainly if a manager takes on a job on a contract basis he must be properly remunerated if his contract is not renewed.  Some kind of golden handshake arrangement would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The question of the funding of local authorities must be addressed if we are to decide on the structure and the functions to be devolved.  If local authority members want and expect more power they will have to accept more responsibility. While it may not be popular to say so, more responsibility means raising some portion of their own finances.  Local <Col N="406" /> authorities must have central Government support but must also raise some of their own charges.  At regional level they should have access to EC funds.</P>
    <P>The system of election to all local authorities should be changed to single seat constituencies with the retention of the PR system.  That would enhance local democracy, with members answerable to a much more specific electorate.  The elected public representative would be closer to the electorate and reflect their views more accurately.  Some people might regard that system as being anti the small party but single seat constituencies in local elections would help rather than hinder smaller parties.</P>
    <P>Talk about the reform of the Oireachtas is pointless unless the reform of local authorities is in place.  We could all benefit in this House from some procedural changes, particularly in relation to the voting and committee systems, but until such time as we have an effective system of local government there will not be any major change in the Oireachtas. There are few Deputies who can afford the time they should give to national legislation, simply because they have to watch their back in their own constituency. Most Deputies would agree with the proposal which has been floated that Deputies should be barred from standing in the local elections, provided councillors were barred from Dáil elections. It is not realistic with the existing system of election and procedures at Oireachtas level.  What is needed is a proper system of local government which is local and is government.  If we had that we could realistically talk about electing members to this House to deal with national legislation.  Until that is in place we cannot talk about major reforms.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is a good first step on the road to local government reform. I look forward to further reforming Bills from the Minister so that within four or five years we will have a local government system that will be efficient and will constitute government by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it touching to listen <Col N="407" /> to Deputy Dempsey, and other contributors from the Government side, talk from the moral high ground and pontificate to the rest of us.  It would seem that the 1985 local elections manifesto was never published.  That manifesto, and the reckless type of politics indulged in during the run up to the 1987 general election, has brought local government and all politics into disrepute.  In this criticism I do not exclude the Progressive Democrats.  This notorious document, the 1985 Fianna Fáil local elections manifesto, contains two signatures, those of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Energy, then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the Environment.  Deputy Dempsey told us we should not concern ourselves with local authority finances at this time. We put the structures in place first and then we talk about finance.  Since Fianna Fáil came back into office in 1987 local authorities have been decimated, jobs have been lost, services have contracted, there is an appalling housing crisis in the country.  Finance is a problem and must be addressed.  I should like to quote from the Fianna Fáil document which states:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to the new system of local charges and on return to Office will abolish these charges and repeal the legislation under which they are imposed, namely, the Local Government Financial Provisions No. 2 Act of 1983.</P>
      <P>That never happened.  Fianna Fáil have been in power for the past four years and have allowed the system of charges to continue.  The Fianna Fáil party are presenting us with a Bill which in my view is a pig in a poke.  It is the typical &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; syndrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much play has been made on the Government side regarding the relaxation of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule.  If you look carefully at the Bill you will see that other restrictions are being introduced.  If any statutory body in the area is providing a service similar to the type the local authority wish to become involved with then that local authority is prevented from becoming so involved.  There is also <Col N="408" /> the enabling power for the Minister to exercise appropriate controls in relation to the relaxation of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule; by way of legislation he can make the new situation much more restrictive than the present one.  This applies throughout the whole legislation.  I agree with Deputy Dempsey when he said this was an enabling Bill.  We are in a similar situation now to that which obtained in 1985 during the run-up to the local elections when Fianna Fáil produced this document over the signature of their party leader and the then spokesperson on the Environment.  They are now asking us to accept a Bill, which they say is an enabling Bill but which gives great powers to the Minister to do what he wishes by way of regulation.  He may or may not introduce regulations, but they could be very restrictive.  I do not believe Fianna Fáil or, indeed, this Government can be trusted when we look at what has happened in the run-up to the 1987 election and what has happened since then.</P>
    <P>Much play also has been made from the Government side in relation to subsidiarity or devolution.  There is nothing specific in this Bill concerning what services would be devolved to local government. There are many recommendations in the advisory committee's report but Fianna Fáil and the Minister are not telling us what is intended.  A lot of aspirational talk from the Government side and vague talk in principle is no substitute for specifics which this Bill lacks.  We are told this Bill is a first step and that there will be further legislation.  There may very well be further legislation but, under the provisions of this Bill, the Minister is being conferred with very substantial powers by way of regulation.  My fear is that when 27 June has come and gone the urgency and the high-falutin talk which is emanating from the Government side, as has happened in the past, will be forgotten and we will be left in a situation not dissimilar to that obtaining now.  The fundamental question &mdash; the real question &mdash; the question of finance which has <Col N="409" /> been totally ignored in this Bill will continue to be ignored and there will be a further run down of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were responsible in 1977 for the abolition of rates.  In its place, and funded by taxation measures, came the rate support grant.  One fundamental flaw in the rate support grant is the method by which it is assessed.  It is assessed from the baseline of 1977 but since then many houses have been built in local authority areas for which the local authorities do not get any recognition or subvention. Indeed, Fianna Fáil have reduced very dramatically the rate support grant during the period they have been in government since 1987.  The Taoiseach and the Government kept one promise which was made before the 1987 general election, and that was to abolish the land tax.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the Supreme Court found that the PLV system was unconstitutional in terms of assessing the amount which farmers should pay but did not suggest that farmers should not pay a local charge.  The Coalition Government of 1982-87 introduced a land tax.  This land tax was welcomed by small farmer organisations. In many cases farmers were paying very large sums to accountants and at the end of the day found they had no tax liability.  Farmers have said to me they would much prefer to pay the money they were paying to accountants to local authorities.  I am aware of a very large holding in my own constituency of 4,000 acres where the owner of that property is not paying a penny to the local authority while the widow in the nearby village is paying water charges, admittedly at a reduced rate because of waiver.  There is an injustice here and an imbalance also because Waterford County Council have a very low commercial rates base.  The agricultural rates were the major part of their finance each year.  Other county councils have a very large commercial rates base.  The rate support grant was adjusted to take into account the revenue lost to local authorities because of the Supreme Court decision and this was very damaging to local authorities such as Waterford County Council because of <Col N="410" /> the cutbacks made by Fianna Fáil to the rate support grant.</P>
    <P>It ill becomes Fianna Fáil to take up the moral high ground and to treat this House to a display of pseudo statesmanship. In the eighties they acted in a reckless and opportunistic way in an all-out run for power, and having got that power they made U-turns in every direction. I put it to the Minister that Fianna Fáil have done more damage in the eighties to local government by bringing the system and the councils into disrepute than any other agency has done in the history of the State.  I would ask the Minister and his colleagues on the Fianna Fáil backbenches not to lecture the Opposition.</P>
    <P>In dealing with some of the provisions of the Bill we are told that there will be a regional tier.  This has been lauded to the high heavens by those on the Government benches.  Let us cast our minds back a little.  It was this very Government that abolished the RDOs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for school-based initiatives in dealing with children who are suffering educational disadvantage for whatever reason this may occur.</P>
      <P>Those initiatives include the appointment of remedial teachers, of special resource teachers, of guidance teachers &mdash; the question spans both primary and second level schools &mdash; whose functions include personal counselling and of additional teachers in disadvantaged schools.  The development of home-school links will be an important feature in dealing with disadvantaged pupils now and in the future.</P>
      <P>The home-school-community liaison project currently embraces 55 primary schools in disadvantaged areas.  These schools enjoy the services of 31 local co-ordinators who work under the supervision of a national co-ordinator.</P>
      <P>As part of the new resources provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, it is proposed to appoint a further 14 local co-ordinators to the scheme and this should bring at least a further 30 schools into the scheme, bringing the total number of schools involved at primary level up to 80.</P>
      <P>My Department's psychological service provides support to schools in coping with pupils who have particular problems. In-service courses are provided for teachers, in co-operation with the Department of Health, in relation to dealing with particular social problems arising, for example, from alcohol and other substance abuse.</P>
      <P>In addition, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for additional funding of £1 million in 1991, £2 million in 1992 and £3 million in 1993 to assist in areas of disadvantage at all levels.  The measures I have just outlined are in place or are about to be put in place.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a worsening problem of discipline in our schools and that a number of children in our schools could be termed emotionally disturbed?  Whereas great <Col N="412" /> efforts are being made in schools &mdash; I certainly welcome the initiative of home-school links &mdash; and agencies, both voluntary and statutory are providing a service for the disadvantaged, the service is not co-ordinated and that is why I put down a question.  Would the Minister consider initiating a pilot project on a trial basis as I have suggested in my question, and may I add that we would be very glad to accept one in Waterford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I know the Deputy would.  I have received correspondence from the Deputy on a particular matter and I wish to thank him for that.  This is a very interesting question. The question of discipline is the subject of a separate number of questions on the Order Paper and therefore I will be dealing with it in that vein.  With regard to what the Deputy perceives as a lack of co-ordination between the various agencies outside of the school who work with the schools in ongoing work of this nature, I am at present having on-going talks with the Minister for Health on my initiative on home-school links which I went in to at length in my reply.  The Department of Health will meet the back-up needs identified by teachers in the home-school-community liaison project and they will link up with the support of agencies operating under his aegis.</P>
      <P>I found the Deputy's question interesting because we are just beginning the process of co-operation and liaising with the Department of Health and I will be pleased to report to the House on how it develops.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for co-ordination.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to a recent OECD observer analysis of Irish education which states that a regular infusion of healthy new blood into the teaching force is essential in order to prevent its arteries from hardening and to the subsequent recommendations to deal with the matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Although the report of the OECD examiners will not formally be published until next month, I am aware of the references in question. For the information of the Deputy I have listed a table giving the age profile of teachers.  Without going into detail on the table, it discloses quite remarkable facts which need to be highlighted.  I am glad to have the opportunity to do so.  The age profile is not what is popularly perceived. It depends, of course, on how you view age.  Age is different depending on your viewpoint.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the creation of substantial numbers of new teaching posts at both primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>The reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools to 25:1 by September 1992 will entail retaining 700 posts which will become available to in-coming teachers, in addition to the creation of 250 new posts this year and approximately the same next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio to 19:1 at second level involves the creation of 500 new posts.  A further 60 additional posts will be created for disadvantaged schools this year as they were last year.  Additional posts arise also from <Col N="414" /> the commitments to provide ex-quota posts as vice-principals and guidance teachers.  In addition, pupils entering second level schools this year will have the option of a transition year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures will provide ample opportunity for the entry of new teachers into the profession.</P>
    <P>The OECD report will be launched formally in June.  It is interesting that the Deputy should draw our attention to a sentence in the OECD report because the sentence immediately prior to that quoted by the Deputy states that in the long term it would be beneficial to lower the pupil-teacher ratio strictly on pedagogical as well as on equitable grounds, to institute a six year secondary cycle for all students, to lengthen the school year and to appoint more specialised teachers, to strengthen school management structures and to put in place a comprehensive system of induction and in-service training. We are doing everything that is suggested in the report except that I have no intention of lengthening the school year. Another important sentence in the report states that in the immediate term it is urgent to provide more help to disadvantaged students.  The school system could only benefit from this.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  I am not privy to the information because obviously it is going to be in the cubby holes afterwards.  Is the Minister aware that the OECD analysis stated that by and large there was a danger that the teaching profession in Ireland was going to become a &ldquo;greying&rdquo; profession?  Does the Minister agree that a requirement of 40 years teaching service in order to qualify showed that up to 45 per cent of them would like to change jobs if given the opportunity of an alternative position and that the issue of burnout and the inability to cope with the modern classroom was very much the theme at the recent teacher conferences which both she and I attended?  Does the Minister further agree that there is an urgent need for an early retirement scheme whereby we would allow people who are jaded and demotivated to leave the profession thus allowing in bright, breezy, motivated young people who are on the dole queue at present?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that every teacher over a certain age and who is presently teaching in our schools is <Col N="415" /> jaded or burned out.  What was amazing was that following the teachers' conferences, I had scores of letters from teachers telling me they were of such an age and that they loved teaching and that they did not like the way they were globally bracketed.

It takes age and wisdom to give the education system its even tenor.  I would consider under 45 years as a reasonable age, and a high proportion of our teachers are under that age, as statistics show.

      <P>The matter of the number of young people who are appearing before the courts for serious offences is one of concern to all involved with this problem.  In addition to the secure centre administered by the Department of Justice for young male offenders aged 16 to 21 years, my Department operate a secure centre for boys aged 12 to 17 years.  The number of offenders from time to time referred by the courts for secure detention varies considerably and may at times exceed the institutional capacity available as happened in the particular case referred to.</P>
      <P>I should, however, point out that arrangements are already well advanced for the provision of additional custodial places for young offenders.   Work on refurbishing the former Scoil Árd Mhuire in Lusk is proceeding on schedule and this facility, when ready in September of this year, will provide an extra 36 places for boys and eight to ten places for girls. In addition, plans have been drawn up for the construction of a new centre for 20 girls in Finglas.  This centre, which is projected for completion in mid-1993, will allow the female occupants of Oberstown girls centre and those on the adjacent Árd Mhuire site to be relocated in Finglas, thus freeing further places for boys in the Lusk centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the specific measures being taken by my Department, the Government have appointed Deputy Chris Flood, Minister of State at the Department of Health, with an overall co-ordinating role in the child care area. <Col N="417" /> This will ensure that the input of the various Departments involved in this area will be as efficient and effective as possible.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Holy Family School for mildly handicapped children in Renmore, Galway.  The position in relation to that school is that enrolments have declined rapidly in recent years and indications are that this trend is set to continue.  A consequence of this development is that six of the current ten teachers in that school are due for redeployment and it is expected that there will be further redeployment.  In this situation, it was considered that a continuation of Holy Family School no longer represents the best response to the needs of the Galway area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset, it has been clearly stated that the closure of the Holy Family School would only take place in the context of a wider development programme <Col N="419" /> aimed at meeting the needs of handicapped children in the Galway area generally, including those from the Holy Family School.  I remain convinced that the action proposed in relation to the Holy Family School and the implementation of an alternative and more comprehensive support programme in the Galway area, represents a positive development from all concerned and will be seen as such in the years ahead.</P>

This is contrary to the wishes of the parents, both in the case of the Holy Family School, with which the Minister will be familiar, and in all other cases.  Despite the fact that the Minister for Education at a recent conference stressed that parents would be consulted about these matters, I ask her if she really means that.

      <P>It is totally incorrect for the Deputy to say there is wholesale closure of special schools.  That is not the case.  The Department's policy is as far as possible to integrate slow learners into the normal education process, providing the necessary resources for specialist education and specialist services to those children in the normal education environment.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that there is major disquiet among educationalists about this matter.  They are pushing the Department to get on with this development, and we are very satisfied with the positive nature of the development.  Only last night I indicated to the Deputy's colleague from Limerick that we are developing speech therapy services in Limerick, and that is also being done in other places throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Galway school, I wish the Deputy would be a little more responsible in terms of his attitude to the efforts being made there.  I assure him that parents have been consulted &mdash; and will be consulted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 25, 26, 63, 67, 70 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>Following extensive consultations with management, unions and the Department, a code of discipline was issued in 1988.  A revised code was issued in 1990 to all primary schools.  It contained all the various agreements which had been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that, there was a call from the post-primary sector for a similar code.  Discussions are taking place at present with management and unions and between management, unions and Departments to see how the code of discipline implemented in primary schools <Col N="423" /> can be implemented in post-primary schools.  I have in my possession the various circulars which went out with the agreed code of discipline, I will not read them because they are very lengthy, but I will give them to the Deputies who asked the question and if there are any more details, I will be glad to give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When may schools expect the precise guidelines at post-primary level in relation to what they can and cannot do because the only code of discipline at present is that you do not hit a child?  The Minister is aware that there are huge, mounting discipline problems, discipline in many cases has got so much out of hand that some classrooms are literally like jungles; it is a question of damage limitation rather then education. Children who want to learn cannot learn and in many cases teachers are confronted and insulted daily.  Strict, definite, precise guidelines are needed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress that the agreed code of discipline between management, parents, teachers and the Department of Education &mdash; indeed the parents had a huge input &mdash; issued to primary schools in its revised format in 1990.  Of course, it will not find common agreement but it was sent out by common consent.  The similar code &mdash; or whatever is arrived at &mdash; of discipline for second level schools will issue for the school term beginning in September 1991.  Deputies will be aware of the recent court findings in regard to the Longford case which states the matter very explicitly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahern Mrs. T. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it might be better to devise a programme where discipline problems would be prevented from arising?  In that regard, has she any plans for providing in-service courses for teachers to help them to cope with discipline problems and, more important, to help them avoid discipline problems arising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggested lines <Col N="424" /> of the code of discipline already sent to primary schools envisages that very point.  Co-operation between all the agencies is referred to and I have reaffirmed that this week in a letter to the parents and management of the boards of primary schools.  The Deputy is quite right; as in anything in life, it is better to anticipate what might happen and to have ways around it.  We have already instituted in-service courses although we need more of them; I will bear that point in mind.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Will the Minister agree that the procedure is so convoluted that, by the time the problem is dealt with, a teacher may be more dead than alive?  If the system needs psychologists they should be in the school.  As it is, we will force teachers to go to psychologists for advice after school.  There should be a back-up system for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I have taught in the classroom although at different levels.  We both know that the handling of a pupil is a personal matter and the same applies to rapport between a student and a teacher.  You cannot lay down a national guideline which would be applicable to every child.  You have to lay down a suggested code of discipline, and I know it requires a great effort in some schools for teachers to cope with what they are faced with daily.  I have gradually discerned a greater awareness and wish among the various interests in education to come together on this knotty problem because, of course, we are all working for the good of the children.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if she will outline the schemes operated by her Department, if any, to foster and encourage exchange and contact between schools and students in other EC countries; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very lengthy answer and I say this before I begin lest the House thinks I am prevaricating.  It is very interesting because Deputy Howlin asks me to outline the schemes operated by my Department, if any, which implies that we are somehow tardy or remiss. As Deputies will hear, there are more schemes operating than I would have thought possible.  I wish to inform the Deputy that I make provision annually on a bilateral reciprocal basis for student exchange scholarships with the following European Community member states &mdash; Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.  I hope in addition this year to provide for third level student exchange between this country and Portugal.</P>
      <P>I have been particularly interested in promoting school and student exchanges with the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Irish schools in the North and South as well as English schools are already cooperating in the European Studies Project. The aim of the project is to encourage pupils in the participating schools to explore the shared elements and the rich diversity in their heritage in a local and a wider European context.  The project is co-funded by the Department of Education in Belfast, London and ourselves and a contribution is made by the Commission of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education in Belfast and ourselves are also initiating an environment education project involving 24 schools from North and South this school year.  The project will be jointly funded by both Departments.  A pilot programme of teacher exchanges between North and South is also being operated for the first time this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many school children participate in cross Border exchanges under the schemes administered by the Youth Exchange Bureau on behalf of my Department and steps are being taken by the Youth Exchange Bureau and the Central Bureau for Educational Visits in <Col N="426" /> Belfast to improve the quality of these exchanges in the future.</P>
    <P>My Department provide funding to Co-operation North towards the cost of their youth links and school links exchanges schemes. My Department also promote and participate in many European Community programmes involving student exchanges such as Erasmus, Commet, LINGUA, Petra and Youth for Europe.  The prepared answer in relation to these programmes takes two pages and I am sure the Deputies are aware of most of the components of the third level programmes. Therefore, I will not go into them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that Irish students would benefit a great deal more from such exchange programmes if a European language was introduced in national schools?  I know this was not recommended by the Curriculum Review Body, but I should like to hear her personal view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is pushing the boat out a bit far because his supplementary question has nothing to do with the original one.  The LINGUA programme, which is one of the European exchange programmes, has that very matter in mind.  I know the Deputy has an abiding interest in the furtherance of other European languages in primary schools, but we already have two, Irish and English.  As the Deputy knows, the curriculum board did not make any recommendations in this regard.  Nevertheless I will keep the Deputy's suggestion in mind.</P>

      <P>With regard to Question No. 20 to which the Minister referred, is she satisfied that all the resources she is making available for these exchanges are being taken up?  It has been suggested to me that there has been a decline in such school exchanges in recent times.  I know that, like me, the Minister believes these exchanges are an <Col N="427" /> excellent way of overcoming misunderstanding between young people North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was replying to Question No. 71 thought of the Deputy's Question No. 20.  That is why I referred to this matter in passing.  I will give the Deputy specific information when I am replying to his question.  I have looked at the special arrangements between the North and South in regard to exchanges and I agree with what the Deputy has said in regard to these exchanges.  It is amazing to see how quickly barriers can be broken down by these young children when they are together.  Of course, young people are very good at doing that.  The more exchanges there are at ministerial, official and student level the better the potential for future understanding between the two communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister encourage these welcome exchanges between schools?  Do the Department send an annual circular to schools outlining the resources they are prepared to make available or do the schools have to initiate the exchange and then write to the Department asking what funds are available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally schools write to my Department.  I take the Deputy's point about a departmental circular informing schools of the funds available; that is a good idea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My supplementary question relates to exchanges between this country and countries on the Continent, particularly exchanges between language teachers.  May I ask the Minister how many teachers are seconded on an annual basis for exchange between the Department of Education's teaching force and continental countries?  Can she say in particular to which countries they go?  I have the impression from my days as a teacher of French that the liaison is mainly between Ireland and France to <Col N="428" /> the exclusion, by and large, of Germany, Spain, Portugal and other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have precise information on the number of teachers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the countries to which they go but I can get it for the Deputy.  As the Deputy said, these exchanges used to be mainly with France.  However, this has changed dramatically since we were teaching in that now there is greater emphasis in schools on German and other languages.  There are countries other than France to which teachers and students can go to gain useful experience.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Priority Question No. 5 and Questions Nos. 8, 30, 37, 39 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from commitments made in the context of the last programme for Government, and carried forward into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, my Department entered into discussions with representatives of management, teachers and parents in order to establish agreed criteria on relative disadvantage in schools.  The agreed criteria are based on socio-economic indicators of disadvantage and include such factors as unemployment levels, local authority housing, rural deprivation, medical card holders, children of lone parents and information on basic literarcy and numeracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All primary and post-primary schools were invited to supply details of the number of pupils to whom agreed criteria applied.  The schools which responded have been placed in an order of priority. Some 60 additional posts were allocated to post-primary schools for the 1990-91 <Col N="430" /> school-year on the basis of that information. In the case of primary schools, 30 home-school-community liaison teachers were allocated to groups of schools in selected disadvantaged areas.  A further 60 posts will be allocated to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas from September this year, arising from the agreed criteria.  There are already 180 teachers in primary schools in disadvantaged areas and 30 additional teachers will be appointed.  In addition, further home-school-community liaison teachers will be appointed.  This will bring the number of schools served by this scheme to approximately 80 and the total number of schools deemed to be disadvantaged to over 200.  In addition, 80 remedial teachers will be appointed for the school year commencing in September 1991.</P>
    <P>At present all schools with an enrolment of 500 pupils or more qualify for a guidance teacher.  Under the terms of the programme, schools in the 350-499 enrolment category will, in a graded way, qualify for a guidance teacher.  The same will apply to VEC schools.  I will not delay the House by reading out the entire reply. I will gladly answer any questions raised by Deputies on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact.  Of course, there will never be enough resources for education.  Even if we were to appoint an extra 1,000 teachers other problems would arise overnight.  We have made an excellent start, building on the good foundations laid by previous Governments of every hue.  For the first time we have an accelerated programme which will improve the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the findings of the most recent study commissioned by the Daughters of Charity which confirms the north inner city to be the most deprived community in the State with 44 per cent of schoolchildren leaving school before the age of 15?  This is by far the worst percentage in the country and is three times the national average. At most only 1 per cent of children in these schools go on to third level education compared with a Dublin average of 15 per cent.  Does the Minister accept that this represents a special case which can only be reversed by additional resources and teachers over and above the limited measures to which she has already referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the study to which the Deputy referred to hand but I know of it.  He referred to schools in the north inner city area and the high levels of disadvantage which lead to educational deprivation.  We have had regard to this not just in the schools which served disadvantaged areas but also in the initiation of the formal home-school-community liaison scheme introduced last year and which will be intensified this <Col N="432" /> year.  Under that scheme the schools in the areas to which the Deputy referred will be given particular attention.  My Department are doing this at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from her reply, may I ask the Minister if she accepts that the educational disadvantage of the north inner city, the area where her departmental offices are located, results from Government indifference and traditional neglect?  Evidence of this can be seen in the grounds of her Department where 250 children are being taught in damp, leaking and shabby prefabs while across the road from that school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that one of the big problems contributing to educational disadvantage in the city is the drop-out rate at about the age of 15 and that some inducement is needed to keep children in schools longer?  There should be some sort of financial or social inducement from the point of view of getting maximum social benefit from the educational system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>All the studies show that the longer one stays at school the better one's chances in life.  The PESP has made allowance for a special fund to target towards keeping people in school. This was primarily meant to go towards retaining people in second level and encouraging second level students to go to third level.  I had an extensive meeting with the co-ordinator of the home school liaison scheme whose primary work relates to inducement to children to stay on at school.  I agree that the longer people remain at school the better.</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 30 I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that apart from efforts being made to keep children in school there is need to deal with those who have already dropped out.  There have been a number of research projects, one in Finglas, the St. Paul's project, which attempts to deal with young people who have dropped out of school.  Is it intended to extend this kind of special schooling to these children?  Has the Minister had an opportunity to look at a proposal from the Ballyrnun area for such a project?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

The Finglas project <Col N="434" /> is very interesting.  The evaluation of that project will have an influence.  It has already influenced schemes which have been initiated, though not in a formal sense.  I am prepared to look at the Ballyrnun project in that context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of places in universities, <Col N="439" /> regional, technical and other third-level colleges is kept under review in my Department.  The Deputies will be aware that under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> special initiatives will create almost 9,000 additional third level places within the period of the programme.  Initiatives include the provision of 3,600 places in universities under arrangements initiated by the Government in the 1990 budget to be followed through in the 1991 budget and in the 1992 budget the provision of funding to UCD, the utilisation of spare capacity in the Colleges of Education including Thomond College involving linkages within the university system and the provision of a new Regional Technical College in Tallaght, County Dublin, and other third-level facilities.  The possibility of a further 1,000 places being provided with private sector financial participation is being explored by one of the universities.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the above consensus will go a long way towards meeting the demand for further third level places in a cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>In terms of participation in higher education both Mayo and Tipperary fare relatively well compared with other areas of the country.  According to the second National Survey of Participation in Higher Education by Patrick Clancy, both these counties had higher than the then national average entering higher education in 1986; I hope to discuss the matter fully at a later date.</P>

      <P>I am shocked because it would appear from the Minister's reply that she and the Government are reneging on their commitment to establish a fully fledged third level college in Thurles.  Would the Minister agree that the case for establishing such a college has been well documented?  Would she elaborate on the nature of third level courses under consideration for Thurles? There have been consultations between the vocational education committee and the Department of Education in this respect.  Could the Minister indicate <Col N="440" /> where these courses will be conducted? Will they be held in existing second level institutions or in a new building on the site which has already been purchased for that purpose?  Are they to be certificate or diploma courses?  Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has already heralded these courses in my constituency and has she been in consultation with him in this respect?</P>
      <P>Finally, let me say that there is an expectation that these courses will be up and running in September-October.  It is now May and we have seen little effective action on the ground.  Will the Minister agree that time is running out?</P>

      <P>The Minister obviously had amicable discussions with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy: will she confirm that she also had amicable discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn in relation to the Castlebar project? Since this is a national issue, judging by the questions put down by Deputies, would the Minister not agree that there would seem to be some ominous soundings in view of the fact that she said <Col N="441" /> that this year 8,600 additional third level places will be provided?  Will she not also agree that her acknowledgment that there is such a high participation rate from Mayo and Tipperary simply underlines the fact that there is a high degree of consciousness of the need for third level education facilities, which helps to copperfasten the argument for third level courses for both counties?  Will tertiary courses happen in Mayo as promised this September/October?</P>

Various conclusions can be drawn from the high participation rate, depending on how one looks at them.  I see it as evidence of one thing and the Deputy sees it as evidence of another, but both views can be combined. I have agreed to the suggestion of the Minister for the Environment that I meet with the County Mayo VEC to discuss the proposals they are putting forward.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>AIDS education resource materials for post-primary schools have been developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health.  The costs have been shared between the Departments. These materials have been provided to all post-primary schools free of charge. The design and printing costs of these materials have been borne by the Department of Health.  During the years 1989, 1990 and 1991 my Department have allocated approximately £11,000 towards the cost of in-service days for teachers in relation to the development of the materials and their subsequent use in addition to the cost of substitution where necessary.</P>
      <P>As I have mentioned, in-service days for teachers have been and are being held throughout the country on the use of the materials.  In all 17 such seminars will be held by the end of this school year.  A one-week summer school for teachers on drugs and AIDS will be organised this summer and further in-service days will be organised during the next school year.</P>
      <P>To date about half of the post-primary schools in the country have been covered by the seminars and the indications from the schools are that all of them are making full use of the resource materials in developing their education programmes on AIDS.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the reaction to the seminars that post-primary schools in general are using the materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only assume from the Minister's reply that she is not training special counsellors in this area.  I would put it to the Minister that the AIDS situation in this country is now reaching epidemic proportions and the expenditure of £11,000 is grossly inadequate to deal with this matter.  Surely the Minister would agree that this is an emergency and special counsellors should be appointed to speak to schools around the country on this very serious problem before it worsens considerably?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not share the Deputy's view that teachers are not <Col N="443" /> willing to participate in in-service courses.  The teachers are very willing and are doing a very good job.  I would be dismayed to think the Deputy thinks otherwise.  Second, £11,000 was the cost of the materials each year.  I also said that there was replacement aid for each teacher who wishes to go on a-course in connection with drugs or AIDS.  That is a cost which would have to be quantified school by school.  I am satisfied that the teachers in the schools who have. responsibility are carrying out their duties satisfactorily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The Minister said that she is satisfied in general that the materials are being used by teachers in post-primary schools.  Could she expand on that by telling the House if the information and training seminars are being targeted at particular teachers in schools or is it open to all teachers to take up the offer of in-service training?</P>
      <P>Let me ask the Minister also if she could indicate at what point in the school curriculum information on AIDS and drugs is given to the pupils?  Will she consider the feasibility of addressing this question in relation to the later years in the primary schools where there are children of 12 and 13 years of age who may also benefit from the information concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the programme is directed at pupils in post-primary schools but the matter is constantly being reviewed.  The Deputy asked if it is open to all teachers to attend <Col N="444" /> seminars or in-service courses, but in general it is those teachers who accept responsibility for this matter in schools who express a wish to attend such seminars but if any teacher expresses an interest in addressing the issue in their classroom I am sure the school manager will be very glad to release them and we in turn will be very glad to cover the cost of a replacement teacher.  In reply to the Deputy's question as to which heading covers the matter it is left up to the manager of the school to decide.  When the programme was first introduced we sent out letters to school managers suggesting the kind of letter they could send out to parents.  We did not say that it should be covered under a certain heading, rather we left it up to the school manager to decide.  Some have decided that the topic should be dealt with in social awareness courses and others in civics.  If we were to give a direction that a subject should be dealt with under a particular heading, this would be seen as centralised control.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's earlier question as to whether the programme is being availed of in second-level schools, I always ask the principal of the school that I am visiting if they are availing of the AIDS programme and under what heading it is covered.  They then respond.  I am satisfied that there is a steady takeup of the programme in the schools.  We will consider the question of whether to introduce the programme in primary schools.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that I do not want to impugn the good faith and dedication of teachers who are doing their best, but I put it to the Minister that there is a need for greater liaison between her Department and the Department of Health.  I suggest that she should seek more help from the Department of Health and the assistance of special counsellors who are both educators and health experts in fighting this terrible disease.</P>

      <P>The programme was devised in liaison with the Department of Health.  Indeed, Members of the House will remember the furore which ensued at that time.  The materials were prepared with the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, and his officials.  The programme was based on the health data available, bearing in mind the need for good educational practice.  Teachers will know their pupils far better and be more familiar with the ambience of a classroom than a person brought into the classroom setting.  As I said, I am satisfied that the professionals in the classroom are carrying out their job very well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In an address to the Conference of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, where I was received very enthusiastically, both beforehand and afterwards, I dealt generally with assessment for the junior certificate.  I referred to the fact that relying on a written paper only means that an assessment is arrived at by reference to a pupil's performance over two or three hours on a particular day.  It appears to me that, depending on the result, such a procedure in the case of young students could affect their future potential.  I believe that this view is generally shared.  I also said the important issue was to bring out the best in the young people under our care.</P>
      <P>I went on to point out that the whole question was being examined by a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Tom Murphy, present chairman of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Definitive decisions on assessment must await consideration of that committee's report which I expect to have by the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister hold this view?  Is she commencing the junior certificate with no input of assessment? Will she not accept that it was her change of heart on assessment that has led to the delay in the issue of sample papers for the new junior certificate?  I am sure she will agree that the in-service courses on the junior certificate to date have been generally unsatisfactory because of the non-availability of sample <Col N="450" /> papers.  Can she indicate today when sample papers will be available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a load of questions but I will go through them.  In regard to the last one, there were sample questions for the in-service days.  I accept that they were not sample papers, they were sample questions.  I accept also that there was a degree of dissatisfaction, and I expressed it myself, with that period of in-service I refered to last term.  Sample papers and a programme of in-service are currently being worked out between the various interested parties under the aegis of the entity and will be available for September.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if it was not my change of heart which brought about the delay in the introduction of assessment. Deputy Deenihan and I know quite well that in the educational world, particularly in education terms, if a consensus is arrived at that is the best way to go about one's business.  It must be painstaking and it often seems slow and laborious but it is not really so.  I would have wished I could have had a percentage of assessment introduced in the first junior certificate to be sat for in June 1992.  Given the time available and the various views legitimately held by the various interests it was not possible to do so, but I hope that, under the wise guidance of the chairman and the interested bodies, a consensus conclusion will be arrived at. Finally, I remain committed to a degree of assessment in subject materials for junior certificate level.  I am not so overwrought about when it comes in but I am very keen that it does come in and will be in place and remain to be evaluated and monitored and worked to for all children in future.</P>

      <P>Of course the Minister realises that when talking to the TUI about assessment she was preaching to the converted.

      <P>Did the Minister not promise that examination papers would be made available?  We still have not got them.  Did she not promise there would be in-service courses?  These cannot be made available now before the summer. Does she not agree that children this time next year will be sitting for the first time for their junior certificate and neither teachers nor students have a clue as to where they are going at this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I dispute that strongly.  What the Deputy has said about teachers is shameful.  Teachers are the formulators of the in-service courses. <Col N="452" /> They are on each of the course committees. They are on each of the in-service committees.  I and they agree that the last round-up was not satisfactory but at their special request and at my instigation they are on the committees themselves at the devising of the courses. What the Deputy said is incorrect.</P>
      <P>Let me go back to what the Deputy said and turn it on its head.  He said promises were made of the introduction of the 25 per cent and of this, that and the other.  He got his answer to that in the newspapers.  You cannot in any manner of educational provision simply ride rough-shod over what has been established practice.  You push out the boat as far as it can go.  You float the idea of assessment, which I did.  Up to then nobody had put it forward.</P>

If I had my way I would have had the 25 per cent in place in 1992.  I realised it was not possible without major disruption.  Who wants major disruption?  Parents and pupils do not want it.  They want everything to come about in a civilised fashion and I hope that will happen.  I do not share Deputy Deenihan's forebodings about friction between the two unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking earlier about the regional tier which is to be introduced under this Bill.  It would appear that the regional development authorities which were abolished by Fainna Fáil in the post-1987 period are to be replaced.  There is not specific information as to what exactly the regional tier will develop to.  This is a criticism I have made in regard to many sections of the Bill.  An Foras Forbartha were abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government during the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> I now turn to the principle of subsidiarity. One area which should be brought into the local authority ambit is the provision of funds to deal with coastal erosion.  Heretofore this has been a matter for the Department of the Marine. Counties Waterford and Wexford have a particular problem with coastal erosion. The local authority deal directly with the Department of the Marine when seeking funds to effect emergency repairs or to carry out works in anticipation of difficulties which may arise.  This is a matter more appropriate to the Department of the Environment and the Bill should have applied itself to this matter in terms of subsidiarity.</P>
    <P>There were bodies on which local authority members had representation until the coming to power of Fianna Fáil in 1987.  I mention specifically the local health committees.  The remoteness of centralised bodies does not take full account of local problems.  Local health committees provide a forum for local authority members to become directly involved in the health problems of their areas.  These committees were abolished in late 1987 or early 1988.  This did a great disservice because it prevented public representatives from highlighting the many problems which were arising due to vicious cutbacks in the health area.</P>
    <P>Regional tourism bodies on which local authorities have representation play an important development role.  These bodies, which are grossly under-funded, deal with projects on a regional basis. Under the present system local authorities are stymied from becoming involved in tourism projects which could be of great benefit to their area.  The fact that no direct funding of any consequence is available through the tourism organisations is holding back much worthwhile development which could take place and could stimulate the commercial life in various areas by generating extra funds and thereby creating employment.</P>
    <P>As regards the sub-county structure, I am a member of three local authorities one of which is the town commissioners. I am also a member of the county council for that area.  The town commissioners <Col N="499" />&mdash; of which I have been a member since 1979 &mdash; play a very important role as a pressure group.  My experience has been that one does not get the same degree of party politics at that level and a very constructive attitude exists.  If something is good for the area, irrespective of political allegiances, people will come together and unanimously push the particular project.  In my experience the town commissioners, of which I am still a member, have been very effective.  We were told this morning by Deputy Dempsey that there is an assurance that none of the existing local authorities, be they town commissioners, urban district councils or the smaller corporations, will be abolished.  I hope this is so.  In larger towns if you have not got an elected body of public representatives it can create a great deal of confusion when pressure groups come together and give the impression that they represent many more people than is the case.  Members of smaller local authorities have a mandate as everyone there has been elected by the people.  I would be very critical of the vagueness in the legislation relating to this matter.  If there are no proposals to abolish local authorities one wonders why the smaller local authority elections have not gone ahead.</P>
    <P>As I said this morning, the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1985 did a great disservice to local government.  It brought local government into disrepute by giving undertakings such as the one I instanced, the abolition of local authority charges.  As I stated then, the signature of the Minister who is present, was on that document; he was then the spokesperson on the Environment for the Fianna Fáil Party, so that the hands of the Progressive Democrats are not clean either.  There is a big task ahead of all of us in terms of winning back the confidence of the electorate in public representatives on local elected bodies.  I have absolutely no doubt that the type of campaign run by the Fianna Fáil party in Waterford city in 1985 and the subsequent U-turns have done a great deal of damage in relation to the credibility of <Col N="500" /> local government.  At the end of the day this Bill is or should be about bringing power back to the people.</P>
    <P>As I said this morning, this Bill is asking this House and this country to accept a pig in a poke.  We are not given any specifics particularly in the area of subsidiarity.  We are not told what type of devolution is envisaged. Equally, with the <i>ultra vires</i> provision, it is still provided that the Minister for the Environment can put restrictions on local authorities in this area.  The Bill which has been greatly vaunted was published only last Friday and the explanatory memorandum became available only last Tuesday.  Much play was made on the Government side this morning of the fact that there had been ongoing consultation.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that had a few weeks been allowed, after we got the text of the legislation, for public representatives throughout the country to appraise the Bill &mdash; I am talking about the great deal of experience among local authority members and, indeed, among the officials of local authorities &mdash; the Minister and the Deputies in the House would have benefited greatly from the input of those many councillors who are committed to a proper system of local government and who would highlight the many practical problems with this legislation.</P>

      <P>In case Deputy O'Shea was not aware of it, in 1985 I was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party but I resigned from that party in January 1986. <Col N="501" /> It is a fair old stretch of the imagination to seek to tie the Progressive Democrats Party to a document which was Fianna Fáil Party policy in 1985.  The fact that I resigned surely had some significance which seems to have escaped Deputy O'Shea.  The commitments contained in that Fianna Fáil policy document of 1985 before the elections did contain some specifics.  In fairness to the Fianna Fáil Party they did not come into Government until March 1987.  The party of which he is a Member today was then in Government and took no steps to implement the items with which he seems to agree now but did not agree with when his party were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to remind this House that it was the Labour Party Minister for the Environment who changed the legislation which caused havoc in the financing of local authorities.  One would not imagine that one would have to give a short summary of recent history to remind Members of this House of the sequence of events.  The rates were abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government with a statutory obligation to replace the sum of money lost to each local authority by way of a statutory grant equivalent to the amount they would have received from housing rates.  That was the position. Local authorities were able to operate fairly satisfactorily under that system, but when the Labour Party came into office and Deputy Spring, their leader now, became Minister for the Environment he chose to introduce, with his colleagues in Fine Gael, a change in the law which removed the statutory obligation on the Government to fund local authorities with an amount equivalent to what would have been the revenue from rates on houses.  An arbitrary system ensued whereby the Fine Gael Minister for the Environment could then decide how much money they would give to local authorities.  They told them in the same breath that they must introduce service charges to make up for the cutback, which nowadays is a popular cant from the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and even Fine Gael.  It was they who introduced this whole change and upset <Col N="502" /> the system which had been working reasonably successfully.  Local authorities have suffered drastically since then as a result of the legislation introduced by the Labour Party.  I would like to draw this to the attention of Deputy O'Shea, who was not a Member of this House at the time but who supported the Labour Party.  He was so satisfied with the policies the Labour Party followed in Government that he stood for election because he wanted to see that party back in Government again so that they could put their policies into operation.</P>
    <P>I cannot answer for Fianna Fáil as to why they did not fulfil the commitments that were made in the 1985 policy document for the local elections.  Fianna Fáil came into office in 1987 and were in office until 1989.  During this time I sat in the Opposition benches as a member of the Progressive Democrats.  However, since the Progressive Democrats came into office as part of this Government, which we did in July 1989, we have certainly taken steps to have the mess at local government tackled in regard to structures, powers, functions and, of course, finance, which seems to be so easily overlooked by some of the Deputies in the Opposition parties and indeed by media commentators.</P>
    <P>A very important study is being undertaken at present in regard to how local authorities are to be funded in the future. A formula for an equalisation grant is being devised at present by a group of experts at the behest of the Barrington committee.  The preliminary report was published and made available to Members of the House and an extensive study is now under way.  This fundamental study will have a dramatic effect on the way in which future rates support grants are allocated.  A successful formula may be devised and the Government may decide to implement it, but the studies to enable such a decision to be arrived at are under way and that is a very major step.</P>
    <P>I do not accept any criticism from people in the Labour Party or in the Fine Gael Party about what has happened in local government.  I have been one of <Col N="503" /> those people who have constantly spoken out about the damage being done to local government and about the need for change and the fact that the whole system was antiquated.  The system has been in place since the last century.  Government after Government of the parties that have been in Government over the past 30 years have failed ignominiously to tackle this problem in a meaningful way.  This Bill is the first step that has been taken to do anything meaningful about local government.  It is important that I should say that, because this reforming legislation is a first step in what hopefully will be an overall package of local government reform, which my party see as essential to making local government truly local, truly efficient and truly cost effective.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is largely an enabling Bill to transfer power from central Government to a reconstructed local government system.  It also introduces some important innovations agreed between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in our joint deliberations on this very important issue.  However, it is only with the addition of further legislation, particularly to provide sub-county local government structures, and the extensive use of the enabling powers in the Bill that we will see the present reform programme begin to realise its overall target.</P>
    <P>For that sub-county structure the Progressive Democrats are advocating the creation of a network of 150 directly elected district councils, covering the entire country, and making no distinction between urban and rural areas, as is made at present.  These new district councils will include urban and rural areas alike and are designed to deliver a whole range of local services, such as refuse collection, litter control, road repairs, traffic control, maintenance of local amenities such as parks, beaches and open spaces and also maintaining infrastructural services for health, safety and employment purposes and providing a local community input into matters like education and policing.  Indeed, the whole range of <Col N="504" /> services provided through the different Government Departments should be looked at to see what functions could more effectively and efficiently be administered at a lower tier in the Government structure.  There should also be an extensive tier of local government below county level.</P>
    <P>Among the important measures which this first-phase Local Government Bill now before us provides for are: the creation of three separate county councils to cover the greater Dublin area and to get away from the present unwieldy 78 member county council structure; the establishment of eight regional authorities to co-ordinate major regional development projects; to give local authorities a general competence and to abolish the <i>ultra vires</i> rule thereby enabling local authorities to pursue development and employment activities in the interests of local communities; the establishment of independent boundary committees to make recommendations on any changes in county, urban or any other local authority area, including local electoral boundaries, and to provide that any such change must be formally approved by a majority vote in the Dáil and Seanad.  If necessary, an amendment will be introduced to copperfasten this aspect of the Bill in case there is any doubt about it.</P>
    <P>We are also introducing major restrictions on the use of the section 4 provisions in planning matters so that local authorities will in future require a majority of 75 per cent of their full membership to support any such resolution and also the support of 75 per cent of the councillors elected in the area in which the development is proposed.  This 75 per cent voting requirement will apply also in the case of material contravention motions.  We are providing local authorities with greater discretion in spending the block grants allocated by central Government under each programme, for example housing, roads etc.  Councillors will have a new discretion to determine their priorities for spending the block grants.  That is a very fundamental change but it seems to have escaped the notice of the commentators and the Deputies who have <Col N="505" /> contributed to the debate so far.  We are providing that in future city and county managers will be appointed for a fixed term of seven years.  We are also providing statutory controls on the payment of expenses to councillors for travel at home and abroad.  That is a brief summary of some of the main points provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The contents of the Bill are derived primarily from the terms of reference agreed by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in Government just over a year ago.  On 5 April last year the Government announced the appointment of a Cabinet sub-committee, with representatives of both parties in Government, to draw up proposals for the reform of local government and to look at the question of structures, functions, financing and related matters.  The Cabinet sub-committee in turn appointed a specialist committee of nine people, chaired by Mr. Tom Barrington, former director of the Institute of Public Administration. Their final report was received by the Government towards the end of last year, in December, and a second detailed report on financial aspects of local government funding is still awaited from the London Institute of Fiscal Studies.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Tom Barrington and to each and every member of his committee for the tremendous work they have done in reviewing our whole local government system in the very short time span allocated to them. As the Progressive Democrats made clear at the time of the publication of the report, our party warmly endorse the overall findings of this expert body.</P>
    <P>The form of this legislation follows closely the recommendations of the Barrington committee, which said in paragraph 11.4 that:</P>
    <P>This legislation should set out the broad Local Government framework and allow for necessary consequential changes to be implemented by way of statutory order.  This would provide the <Col N="506" /> legal flexibility and adaptability to proceed quickly on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>This is what the Government are proposing by means of this legislation.  We intend to radically reform the operation of local government here and to achieve this we need a solid legislative framework followed by ongoing implementation of the reforms.</P>
    <P>The Barrington committee recognised that it would be almost impossible to achieve meaningful reform of local government in a reasonable timeframe through primary legislation alone.  The solution proposed, and adopted by the Government, which the Progressive Democrats support fully, is to provide legislation to broaden the ambit of local authorities and provide for a speedy and streamlined devolution of powers from the centre to local authorities, to be achieved by a combination of administrative reform and statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>A central aspect of this framework legislation is the relaxation of the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine and the conferring of a general competence on local authorities. That was suggested by the expert committee in paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 of their report and is presented here in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill which to my mind are probably the most significant sections of it.  Section 6 is certainly of enormous importance.  It will enable local authorities to engage in a wide range of issues enabling them to play a more active and relevant role in the lives of their communities.</P>
    <P>The expert committee also recommended that greater autonomy be provided to local authorities in the allocation of resources.  Section 8 (4) provides for a significant degree of new autonomy to be given to local authorities.</P>
    <P>A central consideration of the Government in the reform of local government was the need to have elections this year to enable our people to exercise their franchise.  The expert committee recognised and recommended the holding of elections for city and county authorities in June, subsequent to the introduction <Col N="507" /> of this legislation.  The committee recognised the immediate need to reform the structures in the Dublin area, and Part IV of the Bill give substance to the recommendations of the expert committee in that regard.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for the setting up of area committees covering the county of Dublin, excluding that part of the city governed by the corporation.  The three area committees, Fingal, South Dublin, and Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown will, eventually, become full county authorities. That will replace the shambles that exists at present, a remnant of the flawed centralist policies of the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition, who left office in 1987 and left us with a 78 councillor Dublin County Council, nearly half the size of Dáil Éireann, but which has proved to be ineffective and very remote from the people it is supposed to represent.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended in paragraph 5.2.3 of their report the setting up of a boundary review group and a new legislative framework for boundary change.  The committee stressed the need for &ldquo;a new, modern, simpler and flexible statutory framework in place of the current variety of outdated provisions&rdquo;. These recommendations are taken on board in Part V.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be able to initiate boundary revisions, thereby facilitating a bottom-up approach to local government reform.  The report of the independent boundary committees will be published to ensure a full and proper disclosure of their recommendations.  Finally, any changes proposed by the Minister for the Environment will be subject to the confirmation of both Houses of the Oireachtas before they can have effect.</P>
    <P>When I listened to the Fine Gael spokesman on these matters I wondered whether he had read the Bill, whether he understood it was being mischievious, was being reactionary, and whether he wanted any change, reform, or improvement. It is very difficult to understand how a Bill written in simple and plain English could lead the Deputy to his <Col N="508" /> extraordinary conclusions about the so-called gerrymander of electoral areas.  It is particularly difficult to understand the position when one recalls the record of the Deputy's party in regard to gerrymandering, not only of Dáil constituency boundaries which is well known from the time of the Tully gerrymander, the most blatant gerrymander of constituencies ever implemented here &mdash; but also of local authority electoral areas.  There are many examples of the Fine Gael and Labour parties in Government changing boundaries to seek to obtain electoral advantage for their party candidates. Some disgraceful things have been done by those parties.  In that regard, Deputy Mitchell made an extraordinary allegation that this Bill facilitated the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries.  In fact, the Bill is changing the system that those parties abused and ensuring that such abuse cannot be undertaken in the future.  It is doing that by insisting that an independent boundary committee will study the matter and publish a report so that there will be full transparency and that the public will be able to read the proposals.  Changes proposed for implementation by the Minister following on the recommendations from such an independent committee will have to come before the House by way of an order.  So much for the outlandish and inaccurate allegations made by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a proper response to the need to provide a simple, flexible, statutory framework as suggested by the Barrington committee.  It has adequate safeguards to meet the fears of even the most sceptical of Deputies, consistent with the need to respond to the real needs of local government.</P>
    <P>Section 13 disqualifies Ministers of Government and Ministers of State from membership of local authorities.  We will also need to keep the general issue of parallel membership of various governmental tiers under review, particularly when the issue of subcounty structures is determined.  Indeed, my party's policy preference is for local government to be confined to non-Oireachtas Members, <Col N="509" /> but we recognise that it would be foolish for us to adopt that course unilaterally.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides for the establishment of regional authorities.  That again is in keeping with the recommendations of the expert committee in paragraph 5.1.8.  It provides for the setting up of definitive administrative regions abroad which public bodies will be expected to organise.  This layer of Government will operate mainly on a basis of co-ordinating public services in their regions.</P>
    <P>While this section provides for the setting up of statutory regional authorities we will need to see a parallel commitment by public bodies to reorganise their structures and systems of decision-making to reflect this new tier of Government, rather than have the anomalous situation that pertains at present where a variety of regional authorities are established and carry out important functions with very few of them having the same boundaries. There is need for rationalisation to establish once and for all the regions and the regional authorities across all of the services that are provided and organised.</P>
    <P>Part VII implements several recommendations of the expert committee. Section 42 provides for allowances for chairpersons of local authorities, section 47 limits the tenure of office of county and city managers.  Section 48 provides a statutory basis for the conferring of civic honours and section 49 provides for the twinning of local authorities.  Section 50 places a statutory obligation on each local authority to produce an annual report of their activities so that the public may have full access to knowledge of the way in which their money is being spent.  Section 51 provides a basis on which attendance at conferences by councillors, especially overseas events, can be determined.  We are all aware of the highly publicised cases of local councillors attending conferences abroad at which the subject matter under discussion was very remote from the particular councillor's area of responsibility.  This section should help to prevent bringing into disrepute the legitimate participation of councillors at conferences abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> The expert committee also addressed the issue of section 4 planning appeals and recommended that section 4 motions should no longer apply to decisions on planning applications.  The Progressive Democrats agree with this recommendation because there already exists an appeal process vested in An Bord Pleanála.  We do not support the wanton disregard for the planning system exercised by some councillors in the past and even up to recent times.  Neither do we want to see the issue of local government brought into disrepute by such irresponsible action.  The Government decision does not involve the complete abolition of section 4 in planning matters. However, sections 44 and 45 of this legislation provide for substantial controls over this abuse by requiring such motions to have the support of 75 per cent of the members of the local authority along with the requirement that the motion be signed by 75 per cent of those councillors in whose area the planning appeal lies. As I have said already, this voting requirement would also apply in the case of material contraventions.</P>
    <P>We believe that these steps were necessary, unfortunately, because of the very clear abuse being undertaken by some councillors.  All councils and all councillors were being tarnished because of the actions of a small number.  I hope that when this Bill is passed we will see an end to that practice, except in exceptional cases.  It is very regrettable that it has become the norm in some authorities that when a person makes a planning application he does not even wait for the decision of the planning authority but approaches three councillors and gets them to sign a motion which is put in before the application can be decided by the manager.  The manager is directed to grant planning permission by three people, who in many cases may have never seen the site, are not aware of the detail of the application and have no expert or technical knowledge of the various aspects of such applications.  Yet they are confidently prepared to put their names to section 4 motions.  They then stubbornly argue for them against the <Col N="511" /> advice of the manager, the chief planning officer, the county engineer and the health boards, who have an important role to play in regard to the disposal of sewage effluent in these planning application cases.  I have seen this happen time and again.  This is one of the areas where some councillors have abused the system and it was time for Dáil Éireann to act.</P>
    <P>I am very proud that it was the Progressive Democrats who highlighted this abuse and called for change.  I am very pleased that the Barrington report fully supported the approach we had taken publicly in that matter.  I am satisfied to support the 75 per cent requirement in the hope that it will deal with the difficulty. If it does not, we will keep the matter under review and see how it progresses. To hold a special meeting once a month to deal with practically nothing else but section 4 motions is a serious abuse.  It means that a lot of expense is incurred, with all officials having to be present and some councillors having to travel many miles for the meeting.  That procedure has to be gone through to put through these motions.  I am complaining only about the cases where due consideration is not given prior to signing the motions. As happens in Galway, the manager takes legal advice and refuses to implement the direction given under the section 4 motion.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious from a summary of the various provisions in this first Local Government Reform Bill that it represents a very significant step forward from the present <i>status quo.</i>  For that reason alone the persistent and misleading remarks of the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Mitchell, some of which were given even before the Bill was published, were irresponsible, absurd and even reactionary.  This is even more so when it is borne in mind that the Progressive Democrats sought to ensure all-party involvement in local government reform.  In the Programme for Government negotiated in July 1989 it was agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that an all-party committee of this House would be established <Col N="512" /> with the task of carrying out a major review of the local government system and coming forward with agreed proposals for change.  The Fine Gael Party declined to participate in this exercise and prevaricated for so long that valuable time was lost which in the end necessitated the postponement of the local elections last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell's comments lack credibility when one considers the poor record of Fine Gael in this area of reform. They also lack credibility because his comments bear no relationship to what is in the Bill.  It seems that he spoke before he knew or understood what was in the Bill.  His contribution to the debate has failed to substantiate his claim that the Minister was taking unto himself draconian powers.  His claims in particular relating to the Bill's proposals on revising local government boundaries are totally perverse and incorrect.  Until this legislation was introduced the fixing of local government boundaries was exclusively the preserve of the Minister for the Environment of the day, and the last Government of which Deputy Mitchell was a Minister utilised this power to the full in the run-up to the last local elections in 1985.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell has also done a great deal of huffing and puffing about the amount of time allocated for debate on this Bill.  Here also he stands guilty of downright hypocrisy.  I would like to remind this House, and especially the Fine Gael and Labour parties, that the last time the Dáil debated local government reform was under the Local Government (Reorganisation) Bill, 1985, prior to the last round of local elections. While that Bill was a shambles, and its limted measures were not even subsequently enacted, the fact is that the total time allocated then for the Second Stage debate was a paltry six and a half hours.  This week a total of 26 hours had been allocated for the Second Stage of the Bill before the House.  Furthermore, less than 11 hours were allocated for all Stages of the Fine Gael-Labour Bill in the Dáil in 1985.  That exposes the sham and humbug of Deputy Mitchell and Fine <Col N="513" /> Gael.  Their stance is one of pure desperation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that seems to be the excuse for policy which Fine Gael in their desperation are seeking to cast about.  I am very disappointed with the debate so far.  As the House had an opportunity of 26 hours debate on this stage, I expected that the contributions would focus on the matters before the House which relate to the structures of local government and the functions and powers of councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the House recognises that the elections to the urban district councils and town commissioners have been postponed because no decision has been made by the Government in regard to <Col N="514" /> that level of local government?  The sub-county structures to be put in place for elections to be held in June 1992 have not yet been decided; this debate should have presented an opportunity for the Opposition parties to inform the House of the type of changes they wished to see, including the recommendations the Fine Gael Party want to make to the Government who will have to consider this matter after the elections on 27 June; legislation will have to be introduced in time for elections to be held next year because it is certain that the elections to be held in June 1992 are most unlikely to be to the existing authorities, known as urban district councils and town commissioners, in their present form.  It is very disappointing that Fine Gael, the Labour Party or The Workers' Party have not yet formulated a policy in regard to this matter.  This would have been an opportunity to inform the House of their thinking and what steps they wanted the Government to take.</P>
    <P>Some of the parties are resorting to waiting to hear our proposals so that they can criticise and misinterpret them to the public.  They have already refused the offer of an all-party committee, a very generous offer not often extended from Governments.  However, that hand of friendship and co-operation on this issue was rejected.  We have been in office for nearly two years, and the Opposition have not come forward with any solid proposals, and they have enunciated none in this debate.  Before the debate concludes I hope we will hear the proposals of the other three parties in regard to the sub-county structures.</P>
    <P>I am very proud to be a member of a Government who have, at last, begun to take positive measures to reform our out-of-date system of local government and to begin to put structures in place which will allow communities around the country to have more of a say in the administration of their local areas.  Of course, we have a very long way to go.</P>
    <P>Leis an fhírinne a rá níl anseo ach an tús.  Tá seanfhocal ann a deir, &ldquo;Tús maith leath na hoibre&rdquo;, agus creidim gur tús an-mhaith é seo.  Tá tábhacht ag baint leis <Col N="515" /> na hathruithe seo agus leis na toghcháin do na comhairlí contae agus comhairlí na mbailte móra a bheidh ann an mhí seo chugainn.  Ach tá an cheist is mó, an córas rialtais áitiúil, le socrú fós, is é sin, cén sórt córais áitiúil, ag an leibhéal is ísle sa tír, a bheidh againn le haghaidh an toghcháin a bheidh ar siúl taca an ama seo an bhliain seo chugainn.  Tá rialtas baile ann faoi láthair ag bailte faoi leith agus séard a theastaíonn ón bPáirtí Daonlathach &mdash; agus, maidir leis an cheist seo, níl mé in ann labhairt ach ar son mo pháirtí féin mar níl aon chinneadh déanta ag na páirtithe le chéile sa Rialtas fós &mdash; ná go mbeadh córas ann do na bailte ar fad agus do na ceantair thuaithe ar fad agus nach leanfaí leis an struchtúr amaideach atá ann faoi láthair ina bhfuil údarás do bhailte áirithe agus nach bhfuil aon údarás ag bailte eile, agus nach bhfuil aon údarás dá laghad faoi leibhéal na comhairle contae ag éinne a bhfuil cónaí air faoin tuath.</P>
    <P>Táimid 30 bliain ar gcúl, déarfainn, i gcomparáid le gach aon tír eile in iarthar na hEorpa.  I ngach aon tír eile sa Chomhphobal Eorpach tá atheagrú nó athordú déanta acu ar an gcóras rialtais áitiúil atá acu agus tá a thairbhe sin le feiceáil sna tíortha sin ar chaighdeán maireachtála mhuintir na dtíortha sin agus ar an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh acu de bharr go bhfuil córas éifeachtach á fheidhmiú ag gach aon leibhéal iontu agus nach bhfuil an gnáthphobal scoite ó chumhacht ná ó thionchar bheith acu ar cad a tharlaíonn ina gceantair féin.  Tá suim ag chuile dhuine i ndul chun cinn na tíre ach tá suim phearsanta ag chuile dhuine ina dtimpeallacht féin, ina mbaile féin, ina dteach féin ar dtús, ina dtimpeallacht lasmuigh dá dtithe, sa bhaile nó ceantar tuaithe ina bhfuil cónaí orthu.  Tá déistin ar dhaoine nach bhfuil ar a gcumas aon bheart fiúntach a dhéanamh chun na deacrachtaí a chuireann as dóibh ó bhliain go bliain a leigheas, de dheasca nach bhfuil córas rialtais áitiúil éifeachtach againn, de dheasca nach bhfuil guth ag na gnáthdhaoine sa chóras sin agus go bhfuil a dhóthain cumhachta ag an Rialtas láir, agus nach bhfuil an Rialtas láir, <Col N="516" /> is cuma cé bhí ann go dtí seo, sásta aon chuid den chumhacht a ligean as a lámha.</P>
    <P>Níl sé ceart bheith ag iarraidh an milleán a chur ar na daoine atá ag obair sa tseirbhís phoiblí.  Braitheann sé orthu siúd atá i gceannas ar an Rialtas chun polasaí bheith acu ar dtús agus an polasaí a chur i gcrích.  Ar ndóigh, ní féidir athrú a chur i gcrích taobh istigh d'achar gearr. Caithfidh plean bheith ann ar dtús agus ansin caithfear bualadh ar an mbóthar chun na hathruithe polasaí a chur i gcrích. Is é mo thuairim, dá mbeimis dáiríre sa tír seo maidir le cumhacht a aistriú ón Rialtas láir go dtí na daoine sna ceantair éagsúla, agus é sin a dhéanamh ar bhealach éifeachtach ar fad, thógfadh sé idir sé bliana agus, b'fhéidir, deich mbliana. Ní bheadh aon imní ormsa faoin méid ama a thógfadh sé; an rud a chuirfeadh imní orm ná nach bhfuil aon tús déanta chuige sin.  Gan tús a chur le rud, ní tharlaíonn aon rud.</P>
    <P>Bliain is fiche ó shin go díreach roghnaíodh mise mar Aire Rialtais Áitiúil sa Dáil anseo agus, maidir le rud áirithe a raibh an-spéis agam ann, chuir mé moltaí le chéile agus d'imigh mé liom timpeal na tíre.  Bhí naoi gcruinniú réigiúnda agam le baill tofa údarás áitiúil sa bhliain 1970-71 agus chuir mé na moltaí seo os a gcomhair, agus an rud ba thábhachtaí ná go raibh mé ag éisteacht.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis na mílte ball tofa sna húdaráis áitiúla agus cruthaíodh domsa ó shin i leith cé chomh tábhachtach is a bhí an córas rialtais áitiúil agus cé chomh feargach is a bhí na comhairleoirí tofa, fiú amháin ag an am sin, maidir leis an easpa cumhachta agus an easpa tionchair a bhí acu ar an gcóras agus cé chomh scoite agus a bhí an gnáthphobal ón chóras rialtais.  Na moltaí a bhí faoi chaibidil agam ag an am sin, níorbh iad siúd na moltaí a shocraigh mé féin nuair a bhí neart staidéir eile déanta agam ar an gcóras agus nuair a bhí an éisteacht agus an staidéar críochnaithe agam, staidéar ar cad a bhí déanta ag tíortha eile agus cad é an toradh a bhí ar na hathruithe sna tíortha eile.  Tá mé céad faoin gcéad taobh thiar de na moltaí atá sa leabhar atá foilsithe ag Tomás Barrington agus a choiste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> Ba mhaith liom a chloisteáil ó na páirtithe eile atá páirteach sa díospóireacht seo cad a mheasann siadsan faoi na moltaí atá curtha chun cinn ag coiste Barrington. Sin an easpa is mó a fheicimse ar an díospóireacht go dtí seo, nár dhírigh na páirtithe a n-aire ar an gceist sin dáiríre fós.  Baineann sé sin leis an pháirtí eile atá sa Rialtas linn, chomh maith leis na páirtithe eile.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil a lán nithe sa tuarascáil sin nach bhfuil curtha os comhair na Dála fós, agus nach bhfuil sa Bhille seo ach cuid de na moltaí agus de na hathruithe.</P>
    <P>Tá bóthar fada le siúl fós sula mbeidh an Páirtí Daonlathach sásta leis an gcóras rialtais áitiúil.  Ba mhaith liom a chloisteáil ó na páirtithe eile cad a mheasann siadsan, cad iad na tuairimí atá acu, nó an bhfuil aon tuairimí acu.  Cén mhaith a bheith ag cur ama amú anseo le 26 huaire a chloig ag labhairt faoi rudaí nach bhfuil sa Bhille seo agus nach bhfuil aon tionchar ag an mBille seo orthu, Teachtaí ag labhairt ar dheacrachtaí áitiúla, ar staid na mbóithre agus an easpa seirbhísí; sin é an fáth go bhfuil gá le córas éifeachtach rialtais áitiúil.  Tá seans againn rud éigin éifeachtach, fiúntach a dhéanamh agus an cheist seo á plé againn sa Dáil.  Mar sin, cuireadh Teachtaí a gcuid smaointe os comhair na Dála.  B'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh athrú meoin ar Fhine Gael agus go mbeidh siad sásta dul i gcomhar leis na páirtithe eile chun na fadhbanna seo a fhuascailt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which deals with local government reform.  When I was in the Custom House I was involved in the reform of local government.  This Bill does not deal with the kind of local government reform I should like to see introduced; it merely trims around the edges of what is there already.  When one looks at the nitty-gritty of the Bill one can see that there will be no real reform down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes proposed in the Bill in regard to the <i>ultra vires</i> rule.  I do not think anyone would dispute this change.  It was specifically recommended <Col N="518" /> in 1985 that the structure of county councils in the greater Dublin area should be changed.  The Government may refer to this as a new reform but it is not a new reform.  It was recommended in 1985 that there should be a large number of councillors so that there would be a provision laterally to set up other county councils. This is not a new reform and the Government should not be saying it is a new reform.  The Minister should know that it is not a new reform.  However, he may have been too busy in 1985 signing manifestos which misled people to have read this proposal</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the proposals in regard to section 4 motions.  I am not happy with the proposal that section 4 motions must have the support of 75 per cent of the members of local authorities. Members on the Government benches refer to the expert committee but I prefer to refer to them as the Barrington committee, which is what they are usually called.  I suppose we are all experts on something or other but I am wary of expert committees.  This committee recommended that section 4 motions be removed.  The Minister got up here and thumped his craw about section 4 motions.  I have been a member of the corporation for a long number of years and I did not vote for or against a section 4 motion, unlike the Minister who sought support for section 4 motions.  He now has the neck to come in here and talk about the damage they have done.  Of course, they have caused damage.  They discredited the entire local authority system.  While I am glad that this procedure is being amended under the Bill it should have been removed altogether. However, the problem is that people want to hang on to as much power as they can.  That is not what reform is about; reform is about genuine change.  We should look at local government reform in the context of the society in which we live today and not in an historical context. We should look at how local government meets the needs of a modern Ireland within the context of Europe.</P>
    <P>The expert committee recommended that managers be appointed for seven <Col N="519" /> years.  It is accepted within the Civil Service that seven years is the appropriate limit for top level appointments.  No reference is made in the Bill to a term of seven years.  It is wrong that the Minister should have a say in such matters as he could extend the term of office of one of his buddies in a county council and not extend the term of office of someone he does not like for whatever reason.  I do not think this power should be given to the Minister.  We should be consistent in this matter.  The established principle in the Civil Service should be adopted here.</P>
    <P>We brought forward a Bill in 1985 which provided that committees be based on proportionality.  This is only correct. I do not see any reference to a similar provision in this Bill.  Perhaps it is included but I cannot see it.  I regard this as a sinister move.  The Government seem to be returning to their old ways &mdash; if they have a majority they can steamroll through what they wish.  It is ironic that the Government should be trying to do this at a time when they are talking to people on the other part of this island about power sharing and how it should be on a proportional basis.  I do not see any reference to proportionality in the Bill.  This is a scandal.  It is not reform, it is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The expert committee recommended also that apart from additional money the chairmen of local authorities be given additional powers and status.  Chairmen of county councils have a difficult and onerous job and it is only right that they would get some compensation for this.  A previous speaker suggested that county councils be given more powers.  This is an area which should be looked at.  Given that this was also recommended by the expert committee, I wonder why no proposal was put forward in the Bill in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that Ministers and Ministers of State should no longer be members of local authorities. I think we would all agree that this is a long-overdue proposal.  Even though none of us like leaving local authorities it is only <Col N="520" /> right that this provision be included in the Bill as there can sometimes be a conflict of interest.  I am not casting a reflection on them, but I want to ask the Minister if the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad can stand for local elections.  We have to be consistent in regard to such matters when we are dealing with legislation.  Both those office holders hold positions of immense importance and they should be excluded from standing in local elections.  Apparently the Ministers did not even have some say in that.  County managers always hid behind the <i>ultra vires</i> rule to avoid becoming involved in decision making in certain areas.  The <i>ultra vires</i> rule should be looked at again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Opposition speakers talked humbug but I did not hear the Minister say much about local government reform.  The Minister did not mention the 1971 White Paper which brought a huge reaction as soon as it was published.  The White Paper was buried and it was never seen or heard of again. That was the Minister's contribution to local government reform and he had the gall to criticise what happened in 1985.  I do not take the Minister seriously.  It is hard to listen to him talking about the Progressive Democrats and the section 4 motions when he himself is involved in section 4 motions.  He should be ashamed to mention the name of a former Minister for the Environment in this House seeing that he tried to besmirch his name.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have become moribund over the last number of years mainly through lack of finance.  The Minister said that to start talking about money in relation in this Bill would be putting the cart before the horse.  I do not agree with that, unless the Minister can tell me what one can do without money.  Without money one cannot do much more than go for a walk or a swim.  Without the readies, the mare will not go.  Local authorities will not function without money, despite this Bill.  Councillors will naturally want to spend money even if they do not have the responsibility for raising it.  If I do not have to make a bob, I can <Col N="521" /> tell everyone how it should be spent and why it should be spent, but if I have to raise it and tell those who elected me why I am imposing charges on them, it would put manners on me.  Let us not cod ourselves; without some financial arrangements we are not serious.</P>
    <P>We are tinkering with local government reform on the eve of an election. The fuss that this side of the House made about the Bill annoys me because the publicity gives it a sort of credibility it does not deserve.</P>
    <P>I do not have any problems about the drawing of the boundaries.  Those elected to this House to do a job should act responsibly in drawing boundaries.  I stood over boundaries drawn by my officials, although some of my people were not happy about them.  I was never in favour of setting up a commission to draw the boundaries.  I suffered because of boundary commissions but that is not why I am against them.  Politicians are elected to do the job and we should not pass thorny problems on to somebody else.  If I were on the Government side of the House I would be prepared to draw boundaries and to do the job fairly and without malice.  It is not possible to gerrymander the local elections in a society as small and open as ours.</P>
    <P>There is not much reform in this Bill. This is not the sort of Bill we want.  Should we not, in the European context, have produced a larger Bill than this?  The Bill refers to eight regional areas but they will be just talking shops.  They will not have any power.  It is a nice concept to have regional authorities co-ordinating local effort but these will be just talking shops and nothing else.  I am in favour of structured regional assemblies.</P>
    <P>I favour the idea of 150 councils under a system of regional government.  Local government was damned not just because it was starved of cash but because it had become too political.  Because of that, local authorities did not properly serve local needs.  The 150 councils should be non-political councils.  They should comprise of people who are not political hacks but people who are committed to local government and to serving their local <Col N="522" /> communities.  They could have a major role in planning, environment protection, the provision of libraries and all the things needed in communities.  They could operate under a regional set up which was properly structured.  That sort of set up would be a start towards decentralisation so that, for instance, the IDA would not have a palatial office in Wilton Place but would operate down the coal face.</P>
    <P>Tourism would be taken on properly at a local level, as would industry.  These regional councils would be dynamic development councils involved in tourism, the environment, commerce and everything required to make a region tick over.  Councils would not get funds just because they were poor but only on the basis of putting up proposals for structural development, industrial development or whatever that could stand up. They would make a good case and on that basis they would get the necessary funds.  They would also have their own funding arrangements.  Within that there would be a series of committees with a full-time paid chairman whose report would be adopted.</P>
    <P>Something like that is obviously necessary for the future but regionalisation is important in the context of the island of Ireland.  We would then have something in place where people could participate, not necessarily totally, but in part.  Regionalisation would draw us closer together.  We are now in the big league of Europe and we must start thinking larger.  Regional councils, as well as making their case to national government, would be entitled to make a case to Brussels for funds.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance like to feel that there is no other way to do things other than through that Department.  I do not accept that.  If we had properly structured elected assemblies in the regions, they could make their case.  In the case of health, for example, rather than having a plethora of health boards, it would come under that system.  The Garda could operate in the regions in the same way as could the IDA and Córas Tráchtála and so on.  All of these bodies <Col N="523" /> could participate as non-voting members in any committee that was set up.</P>
    <P>What this country needs is greater public involvement in the whole generality of life.  This is lacking because we do not have good local government and what we have in this Bill is more of the same.  It is but a continuation of what has gone before with one or two things tidied up. That is not reform.  What I am talking about is the establishment of a large number of councils that can play an active role in stimulating their own communities to improve their quality of life.  Communities are doing that today but their efforts need to be harnessed and pointed in the right direction and the establishment of regional councils is the way to do that.</P>
    <P>What we have here provides for about 34 local authorities and a myriad of other situations.  Unless we look beyond that I do not think local government would be much different in five or ten years time. We must now, in the European context, think of regional assemblies properly structured and not in the haphazard way local authorities are run.</P>
    <P>What I want to see is a highly competitive situation with councils competing for funds.  Funds should not be handed out willy nilly.  They should only be given for specific reasons.  This would stimulate industry, tourism, etc., and remove the dead hand of centralism from the country. Central Government then could act as a stimulant to regional government by way of policy and planning.  However, central Government are so tied up with all sorts of bits and pieces today that they cannot set down a proper strategy for the country as a whole.  That is what the role of central Government should be &mdash; prodding and encouraging the regions to develop.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that that in itself is the solution to local government reform.  I am putting this forward as an idea and this is what this debate should be about.  It is about ideas as to how local government should develop.  I understand there will be further Bills but if we are only going to tinker at the edges then in ten years <Col N="524" /> time we will be back to square one and no different than we are today.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to have to come into this House and criticise the lack of reform, but Fianna Fáil were never a reforming party.  The Progressive Democrats like to talk about reform but do nothing about it.  They talked about tax reform but nothing is happening.  There may be good reasons for it, but tinkering at the edges of taxation is not reform.</P>
    <P>We have the same situation with regard to local government reform.  We are not really taking it seriously.  There is a local election coming up and we have to be seen to be doing something.  Something had to be done about the local government anyway because it was stated categorically in 1985 that that would be done and these councils would be set up.  There is nothing new there.  The Government now want to return to the old way where they could dominate committees instead of going back to the drawing board.</P>
    <P>The only area that was not changed then was education.  That should be changed now.  Otherwise we are not serious about reform.  The local elections are coming up and we want to be seen to be generating some activity.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the fuss being made on this side of the House is giving this Bill far too much credibility altogether and that is what annoys me.  People think there is some sort of reform coming up when there is not.  There is no point in the Minister, or the Minister of State, stating that this is a great Bill and that it will revolutionise the system.  I regret to say, it will not.</P>
    <P>I have made my views on the Bill known.  I have put forward a few ideas as there is a duty on those of us who oppose the Bill to make some proposals.  I do not mind if these are rejected as at least the collective wisdom of the House will have been brought to bear on them.</P>
    <P>It is superfluous to go back over the arguments about whether adequate time was allocated for this debate but I contend one cannot publish legislation on a Friday afternoon and expect to take it the following Tuesday afternoon particularly if it is put forward as the engine <Col N="525" /> with which to reform local government. It sets a dangerous precedent.  The publication of the explanatory memorandum on Tuesday afternoon is a clear indication that the Bill was rushed.  It is bad legislation.</P>
    <P>I have been down this road before.  It is ridiculous to suggest that we should postpone the local elections for 12 months to allow us introduce reforms.  I suggested a similar move and I do not intend to run away from that fact.  We should permit the local elections to go ahead next month and then carry out a comprehensive review over a period of five years.  The question we must ask ourselves is whether this legislation will cater for the needs of society into the next century, given that it lays down the ground rules.  I do not think it will and I suggest to the Minister that we should take this matter seriously for the next five years and introduce radical reforms.</P>
    <P>We need to get communities involved and generate activity.  There is a tremendous reservoir of talent in the country but it has to be harnessed into a unifying force in each of the four or five regions. If we do this in ten, 15 or 20 years time our society will be booming and buzzing with people with ideas wanting to participate with central Government at the top, prodding, probing and encouraging and getting away from the idea of the all powerful father handing out diktats to the people below.</P>
    <P>The people of this country looked to central Government for everything for far too long.  They should be encouraged instead to consider how they can make a positive contribution within their regions. If we do this together &mdash; I am not talking only about this side or the other side of the House &mdash; we will get something worthwhile.  The State agencies have looked upon Europe as a benevolent benefactor instead of asking what contribution can we make in Europe.  One cannot blame people, therefore, for thinking that the Government in turn are also a benevolent benefactor who hand out goodies instead of encouraging people to be responsible.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Bill.  It <Col N="526" /> seems we cannot prevent it from being passed but this should not be the end of the matter.  Once it is enacted we should look at the issue again in the context of regional planning and development.  If we do that we will have done something worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is the first step in reforming local government.  I listened with interest to Deputy O'Brien who, like Deputy Quinn, has long experience of central Government.  He is also a former lord mayor of Dublin.  He is aware of what can only be described as the massive inertia which befalls local government.  I have been a member of Dublin Corporation since 1985 and I am aware, like every Member of this House who is also a member of a local authority, that it takes a considerable amount of time to get something done.  It appears to be very difficult to get the machinery crankedup. The reason for this is the relationship between local government and central Government.  For instance, if Dublin Corporation decide to erect a library the plans have to be submitted to the Custom <Col N="527" /> House and there may be much toing and froing.  Indeed, it may take years to complete the process.</P>
      <P>This is unnecessary given that we have the necessary skilled architectural and enginering staff.  All we need is the money.  As I said, the plans are sent back and forth from the Department of the Environment who often use this as a pretext for delaying the process of issuing their imprimatur.  Dublin Corporation are not the only body who have encountered this problem.  It occurs with every local authority.  Such matters as amenities as small as public toilets in villages have to be referred to the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien referred to the regional tier of Government.  There is no point in putting in a regional tier of Government if it is to be another block to progress on the ground.  In the Bill these regional tiers are more or less coterminous with the health board regions, and that is a good thing.  Health boards and local authorities in the Irish saying, Tá siad fite fuaite trí na chéile. Health boards can make decisions about moving people out into the community from psychiatric hospitals.  It is up to the local authorities to provide the housing and often a health board will make this decision and the local authority will not have the money or wherewithal or will not have the housing in place.  If we are to institute regional committees perhaps the membership of health boards and the membership of the regional committees should be as far as possible the same people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to regional committees, I noticed that Meath would be in the eastern region.  In the Eastern Health Board Meath is in the north-east region.  That will have to be examined.  Deputy Dempsey said this morning that decisions taken in County Dublin spill over into County Meath and <i>vice versa.</i>  House building in County Meath has been halted because more housing means more septic tanks and that could endanger the water table in that area.  Without adequate sewerage facilities, which most efficiently <Col N="528" /> come from the County Dublin and the city of Dublin area, Meath cannot progress further.</P>
    <P>We in this House have not made up our minds about the powers of local authorities and how much political power we are going to allow them.  For many reasons, not the least being that many a Deputy in Dáil Éireann would be nervous of a power base arising in his constituency that would not be of his own making, talk of root and branch local government reform without constitutional reform is not on.  Across the water recently the Prime Minister of the day, in her zeal to bring in local government reform that was fiscally based, found herself in early retirement.  I would say any Minister for the Environment would have taken that lesson on board, whether in a Fianna Fáil Government or a Coalition Fine Gael-Labour Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how progressive, we are all politicians.  Any Government of the day is going to handle local government reform with a very long pair of tongs.  Again, I appeal to the Fine Gael Members of the House to realise they may have missed a great opportunity in not agreeing to setting up an all-party committee, such as we had on the Child Care Bill and Foreign Adoptions Bill, where the pros and cons of local government reform could be thrashed out around a table.  The country as a whole and Fine Gael may pay for this later, because decisions will have to be made. There is an inertia about local government that will have to be tackled if we are to bring not alone services but decision-making right down to the people who are affected by the decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we going to do with our local authorities?  Are we going to regard them in this House as providers of services and not policy making bodies?  In this Bill we regard them as providers of services and by omission Dáil Éireann as the maker <Col N="529" /> of policy.  This is as it should be until we go down the road of major institutional reform in regard to the method of electing Members to Dáil Éireann, their responsibilities, what decision-making powers they would have and whether Members of Dáil Éireann should be members of local authorities.  As things are at the moment unless one is a Minister or a Minister of State or has an extremely high profile it is necessary for one to be a member of a local authority if one is to be elected to the Dáil.  The route to Dáil Éireann is through one's local authority. Therefore, we find the decision-making power is concentrated in quite few hands.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that councillors do not have enough power.  In fact, they have quite wide ranging powers, but the problem facing councillors is that there is no glory or honour for them in exercising these powers.  We hide behind a managerial system at times.  Deputy Doyle, who is in the Chair at the moment, will remember a recent episode in Dublin Corporation when the raising of rents on local authority houses ranging from 50p to £1.50 was opposed by the council when everybody on the council knew that was a managerial decision.  The manager exercised his right to raise rents.  I was pilloried on a &ldquo;drop-in&rdquo; around my constituency recently.  I was accused of moving the motion to raise the rents.  I had no power at all in the matter.  The manager did it; but the councillors, while saying one thing, were quite willing to acquiesce in something quite different. Of course, without control of their own money councillors do not have power. Money is power and when you control it you can spend it as you like.  I am chairman of the finance committee of Dublin Corporation for my sins, and one thing that amuses me is the accounting system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two sins we in Dublin Corporation did not commit.  Deputy Doyle will be glad to agree with me and take some credit for <Col N="530" /> the fact that we did not bring in local charges and that rates have been kept within cost of living increases every year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very good action on the part of all councillors in Dublin Corporation.  I was about to refer to the accounting system of local authorities.  It reminds me of when I worked in the building trade years ago and a type of glass that was called &ldquo;clear obscure&rdquo;.  The books of any local authority are clear as to the fact that money was spent.  Every penny a local authority receive is accounted for.  They are very obscure as to how it is spent because there are cross references all the time.  When we come to Committee Stage I hope some light will be cast on how the money is spent. The accounts should be visible, clear and unambiguous and easily understood by people such as myself who have no accountancy or financial training.</P>
      <P>One finds that a certain sum is allocated for a specific purpose but then the money is spent under different subheads and it is very difficult to ascertain exactly how the total sum was disbursed.  One must have faith that the officers of the county council or corporation properly expended the funds.  I have no doubt that this is always the case but it is not possible to find out whether the local authority has obtained value for money.  This complaint has been made since 1985.  When Fianna Fáil obtained a near majority on Dublin Corporation we as a group sat down on many a long winter Saturday and went through the books to find out what was happening.  Councillors felt that they could run a reasonably efficient system without bringing in charges.</P>

      <P>Provided housing maintenance was abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure on housing maintenance amounted to £25 million, of which only a minuscule proportion was spent on materials.  The staff of the <Col N="531" /> corporation provide a good and caring service for the people, but work practices cost us more than maintenance.  Those work practices shoot up maintenance costs.  What Deputy O'Brien was really calling for was an all-party committee to discuss this matter.  There are Members who have great experience of local authorities and people on the Opposition side who have served in the Department of the Environment know the story from both sides.  They could bring this experience to bear in advising how we should provide services and deciding what powers and functions local authorities should have.  The demands upon a local authority in a rural area are not the same as those in Dublin.  It should also be said that local authority needs in the north inner city of Dublin are not the same as in Pembroke.  We have in this House the intelligence, experience and political ability to implement local authority reforms.</P>
      <P>A lot of angst is generated by the use of section 4 motions.  In Dublin Corporation we tried to use one once and it was opposed on all sides and defeated.  Maybe in the corporation area we have different problems from those in rural Ireland.  We have multi-million pound development schemes which can only be evaluated with professional expertise.  Environmental impact studies are necessary, as well as surveys of sanitary services and power requirements.  This process should be seen to be open so that members of the public can follow each step as it goes through.  Often people do not wake up until a scheme has gone through the whole planning process and been finalised. The debate on the draft development plan has been going on since last summer but people are suddenly expressing great dissatisfaction.  If there is a duty on politicians and public representatives to debate matters in public, it is also the duty of the public to take note of what is being debated and to get in on the discussion if they want to make an input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boundary advisory committees have a very difficult task.  My opinion of the last boundary commission, which affected my <Col N="532" /> constituency more than somewhat, as Damon Runyon would say, would not be repeatable on the record of Dáil Éireann or even in polite society.  Perhaps boundary commissions should be constituted by Members of the Dáil on an all-party basis.  At least the people most affected would have some input.  The present system is a bit much.  Deputies are full-time practising politicians who deserve to be treated like other people in full-time employment.  Some consideration for the future well-being of their families, if not for the Deputies, would be in order.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a first step in tackling local government reform, which is not an easy task.  It is bound to upset a lot of people.  We saw across the water that an attempt at local government reform ended in disaster for the reformer.  That is not on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>To ask this House to debate local government reform while people want houses built, roads fixed, water mains laid and sewerage provided, as well as other services, is like rearranging the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i> half an hour after the iceberg had been struck or passing around a dinner menu in Bangladesh or Ethiopia.  That is how irrelevant this Bill is to the people in the street, the homeless and those who have to tolerate potholes on every side road.  Here we are living in cloud cuckooland, in a totally different world, talking about local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the four years of government of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, an average of 265 houses per year were built in County Donegal.  During that time among the critics of the Government for not building enough houses, was myself. I kept agitating and lobbying the Minister for the Environment and the Government, of which I was a supporting Member, for more money to build houses because we could not meet the target necessary to house the homeless in County Donegal.  We had Fianna Fáil members hysterically claiming that 265 houses per year was not enough and that more money would have to be found for housing.  In the last three years, under <Col N="533" /> the Haughey Administration, an average of 68 houses per year have been built. That is an indication of how bad the situation is in County Donegal and the position is no better or no worse in any other local authority.  Because of the deliberate decision of this Government not to build houses, to abandon their responsibility to the homeless, they have left 600 families in County Donegal without homes that would have been built had a different government been elected in 1987; yet now we find ourselves talking about local government reform.</P>
    <P>During the seventies, Fianna Fáil in panic did more to reform local government by abolishing the rates than all the gobbledegook in this document.  Fianna Fáil panicked when they found themselves in Opposition for the first time in 16 years and, believing that the Government led by Liam Cosgrave would be reelected, brought in what is now referred to as the infamous election manifesto of 1977.  They abolished the rates, abolished tax on motor vehicles and handed out goodies that possibly attracted the attention of the most bigoted Unionist in the North who said: &ldquo;God, if that works we will all want to be part of a united Ireland&rdquo;.  Those policies did not work. Now we have a Government who plan to build just so many houses; they have abolished house improvement grants which restored derelict, useless or uninhabited houses to a standard where families are now living in them.  A newly married man who could not repay a mortgage of £24,000 or £25,000 borrowed £4,000 or £5,000 and bought a derelict house, received a grant of £8,000 and proceeded to refurbish it; the cost to the State was £8,000.  Fianna Fáil abolished the home improvement grant and instead proposed to spend £25,000 to £30,000 to build a new house, but they never got around to that.</P>
    <P>The roads are so bad that they are impassable.  If we go to a local community meeting, we will find high on the agenda the bad condition of the roads.  I recall the former county manager, Mr. J. D. <Col N="534" /> Williams, calling councillors into his office in 1977 when he was first told of the revolutionary advance thinking of people like Dr. Martin O'Donoghue, who was then Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  We were told we would not have to maintain our county roads every seven years, that we could do it every nine years.  The county manager, in his wisdom, told us that this was not possible but that we would not notice the problems for seven, eight or nine years. Sure enough, in the mid-eighties, we saw the first potholes because instead of a seven year maintenance programme we started a ten year cycle.</P>
    <P>Now we are told that Donegal County Council receive fractionally more than half the amount they need to maintain the roads, thus leaving engineers with the choice of maintaining half the roads to a good standard or all of the roads at half the required standard.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is aware, the decision was to keep roads between towns and roads travelled by fast moving traffic pothole free.  No one has ever said it but the extension to that argument is that you abandon roads, and that is what happened.  Against this background the present Government are postponing local government elections for one year, county council elections for one year and urban council elections indefinitely to introduce a Bill which has as much relevance to the needs of local society as a Mickey Mouse cartoon.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for almost 30 years and during that time I have never heard a debate that was so irrelevant to the needs of society, when the only escape for our young people is the emigrant ship to Britain, America or the Continent; where there is no hope of jobs for school leavers, where young couples living in caravans, mobile homes and houses which are totally unfit to live in, despair of getting suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>Against this background the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government <Col N="535" /> are introducing legislation to reform local authorities.  I have not been stopped in the streets of Letterkenny or Buncrana or Carndonagh and told we need to reform local government.  I defy any Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrat Member to say he or she has been lobbied by a constituent seeking reform of local government, there is no demand for it, good, bad or indifferent.  In my clinics many people ask me how they will get a house, when will the road past their home be fixed, if we are doing anything to help them.  Of course, members of county councils and Opposition Deputies share the blame in the minds of the general public when, in fact, they have been starved of funds by an uncaring Government.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago the Taoiseach invited us to see his new offices which cost £17.5 million to refurbish.  I heard Deputies from all sides saying how necessary it was to have such facilities for visiting dignataries.  I am sure no matter what decision is taken it can be justified.  If I was talking to the Taoiseach I am sure he could tell me all the places he visited, what he had seen and the comforts that were afforded to him as a visiting Head of State which we could not meet in this country and that therefore we needed to improve the facilities for visiting dignitaries. That is a very strong argument, but it is immoral if you provide the facilities at the expense of the homeless.  That is what we have done.  The Government have abandoned the poor and the needy in our society.  I have made the argument strongly that if all the homeless in County Donegal were living in one electoral area, the Fianna Fáil candidates in the local elections would be doing a great deal more about the problem than they appear to be doing at present.</P>
    <P>The pitfall of campaigning for the homeless is that as soon as a homeless person gets a house he is no longer a part of the housing action committee.  Human beings behave like that, regrettably. However, people can take a certain <Col N="536" /> amount and no more.  Human beings behave like that when Governments ignore them in a minor way and when they build just short of enough houses to meet the needs.  When the Government have totally abandoned housing construction, have abolished house improvement grants and have given so little money to local authorities that they are not able to repair a window or a door in a local authority house, it is time to call halt.  I think the general public have taken note of this fact.  I believe there will be a very strong protest vote in the local elections.  People are not interested in local government reform.  They do not care who represents them in the county council or who is county manager because what the people want are the services they need.  Any civilised society should be expected to provide certain services. It is not good enough to treat people like this.  About 18 months ago I had occasion to visit a house outside Carndonagh.  In this very small house, which we in Donegal call a cró of a house with a small kitchen, a father and mother and their three children, and she was expecting a fourth, had to live.  I was not in the House for more than ten minutes, yet I came out of it with a headache because of the lack of oxygen.  I asked my friend how a marriage can survive in such circumstances. I now ask the House how a marriage can survive when the young couple are deprived of their basic rights that a civilised society owes them.</P>
    <P>We may not have the money to house everybody but there are a great many homeless people who have the energy and initiative to build their own houses if they had the money to do so.  It makes a great deal of sense to me and to many of the people with whom I talk that instead of spending £30,000 on building a local authority house we provide the young family with a substantial grant to build their own house.  Other family members would help them to build the house. Indeed, our great grandparents and the generation behind that had to build their own house.  They had to go out and collect the stones and the other building <Col N="537" /> materials.  Granted, the houses were not elaborate, but they met the needs of the day.  People got by.  Nowadays everything is prefabricated, cement blocks, windows, doors, floors.  An engineer can tell you how many cement blocks you would need and the volume of cement, sand and gravel and other building materials you would need to build a house.  And he can also tell you the cost of it.</P>
    <P>I know of a case where the county council were building a local authority house for a family who were living in a house that can only be described as no better than a pigsty.  I do not exaggerate. The roof was propped up by a branch of a tree which was nailed to the window frame.  This family comprised of four grown boys and a young father, all of whom were unemployed and walking around doing nothing while the county council were paying a contractor to build a house for them in another corner of the field less than 100 yards away.  I believe it would have made sense if that family were given a grant to built their own house under the supervision of the county council.  The local authority would then have money to give grants to at least two more families to build their own houses. In that way the local authority could provide at least two and a half times the number of houses they provide.  The type of argument I am making is made year in year out no matter who is in Government. I am asking the civil servants in the Department of the Environment to use a little bit of commonsense and to harness the energies of the homeless people who are available to build houses and employ them to build their own houses.  It would make sense if a Bill of that nature was brought before us but this Bill makes no sense to me.  It is total and absolute hypocrisy and is designed by people who are living in a world of make believe and not the real world.</P>
    <P>We have totally abandoned repairing our roads.  When a grant is given to fix a road the councillors get into their cars and drive like hell so that they will be the first to tell the people the road will be fixed.  They believe they have convinced the people that they were responsible for <Col N="538" /> getting the road fixed.  Of course, they do not tell the people when the road is not going to be fixed because the Government did not provide the money.</P>
    <P>I tried to sell the idea of shared ownership to my own party.  I think I may have persuaded the Minister for the Environment through force of argument &mdash; although I would be the first to admit that I had made a strong argument during the visit of the deputation from Donegal County Council.  If a rich man's son or daughter is getting married the family step in and help them to purchase a house or in the construction of the house.  If someone from a middle class background builds or buys a house, there is a fair chance that their parents will be able to help them in some way when buying or building the house.  But the working class have nobody to help them.  They depend on the goodwill of the Government in power to provide them with the house. We know that at the rate the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government are building houses at present, there are people on housing waiting lists who will never have the privilege of living in a local authority house.  They do not know that and they live in hope.  However, our rate of progress is so slow that it is beyond the wildest dreams to hope that everybody will be housed.</P>
    <P>There are 1,800 people on the waiting list in County Donegal, 1,100 of them described as being in chronic need.  And when the county council engineers, the environmental health officers, and the county medical officers described a case as being &ldquo;chronic&rdquo;, they mean chronic. In spite of that, this caring Government built 68 houses in Donegal in the past three years.  I sincerely hope that when Fianna Fáil candidates go knocking at doors looking for votes they will be told: &ldquo;We voted for you before, but not this time.  We are registering a protest on behalf of the homeless of County Donegal, whom you have so shamelessly ignored&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has taken on board the shared ownership scheme I spoke of before.  The idea is that a local authority or the Government <Col N="539" /> would buy half a house and rent it to a tenant.  The tenant, being the purchaser of the other half of the house, would be someone who was not in a position to repay a total mortgage but might be in a position to repay half of it.  The scheme makes sense, and I applaud the Minister for introducing it.  However, I am not told that, after my having spent two years trying to persuade the Minister of the idea and after his going to the bother of having the scheme included in the budget and circulated in a very glossy magazine, there is no provision that would enable the scheme to be brought into operation. It seems strange that no one had thought of that until civil servants were told to operate the scheme and someone at local government level asked what powers there were to allow the operation of the scheme.  The Government suddenly realised then that there were no such powers and that they would have to introduce amending legislation.  Would it not make much more sense to bring in amending legislation this week rather than bringing in this lot of nonsense?  I sincerely hope that the Minister will bring in amending legislation.  The idea of shared ownership has a lot to offer to those on the lower income brackets.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned section 4 motions and said he was about to abolish them.  Of course the Minister is not abolishing section 4 motions.  I have used section 4 motions but not indiscriminately. I hope that I have never used such procedure without first going to the county manager, the county engineer or the county planning officer to speak about the problem and then, having failed to persuade them of my opinions but still feeling strongly about the issue in question used this section 4 motion procedure.  I do not apologise to anyone to making applications under section 4, because very often &mdash; and I repeat that it is very often &mdash; the matter under question involves the private opinion of one individual against the opinion of another individual. On several occasions officials in the council welcomed my making an application under section 4 because that <Col N="540" /> let them off the hook.  They knew that the regulations by which they were found were not fair.  There are many positive arguments in favour of section 4 motions. As Members know, the concept of section 4 applications was introduced by the late Deputy Pa O'Donnell, who was a colleague of mine in County Donegal during the first nine years of my membership of the House.  He was the first Member from Donegal to serve in Government.  During his term of office he asked local authorities whether they wanted that power.  They told him they did.  In my early years as a member of a local authority section 4 motions were very seldom used.  It would be reasonable and honest to admit that the procedure was very often abused, but it was available to and used by members only when it was impossible to persuade planning officers of minor details relating to planning applications, such minor details having the effect of the refusal of a planning application.  For the Minister for the Environment to say that he has abolished the measures contained in section 4 or has amended them to such a degree that they are not acceptable is, of course, an untruth.  The present system is that three members of a council sign a section 4 motion.  If one-third of the members are present and voting the motion can be passed or rejected.  The Minister of State, who is a member of a local authority, Donegal County Council, like myself, knows that when a section 4 motion is dealt with on the council's agenda everyone votes for it.  Very seldom is a section 4 motion rejected.  It is more the case that the movers of a section 4 motion, having received an undertaking from the county manager, the county secretary, or the county planning officer, withdraw their application.  A good amount of responsibility is involved when dealing with section 4 motions.  I understand that the Bill is providing that three-quarters of the members from the electoral area involved have to sign a section 4 motion. That means that in a four-seat electoral area the three members signing will get a motion on the agenda.  If Fianna Fáil members make up three of the four <Col N="541" /> members, it follows that the party with one member will not be able to avail of the section 4 provision but that Fianna Fáil will.  In several electoral areas the Government would have the majority of members and, consequently could take full advantage of the powers contained in section 4.</P>

      <P>Absolutely, because that is the purpose of the measure.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy who is trying to view the issue objectively and to understand what the Government are trying to do in this reform of local government, I am at a loss because I start off with the great disadvantage that the Minister, who set out to design new constituency boundaries, discovered that the population of Mayo was sufficient to elect five Deputies to the House and proceeded to scissor off parts of Galway in order to protect the six seats in Mayo.  That was not done in the interests of the people of Mayo, nor, indeed, in the interests of those who hold seats in that constituency.  It was done to protect a Government majority of four out of six.  I do not want to be unfair when the Minister for the Environment is not present and I do not want to be over-critical, but I cannot ignore the fact that the Minister now asks me to take on face value what he proposes to do in relation to section 4 motions and in relation to drawing electoral area boundaries when a perfect example of his conduct and behaviour was demonstrated in the past year or so in which he was guilty of crossing from one province to another, bringing Longford into Connacht for electoral purposes, these being the protection of the Government majority.  When an individual thinks in that way one has to treat everything he does with suspicion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have liked there to be local government reform along the lines negotiated by Councillor Bernard McGlinchey, Councillor Harry Blaney, and myself, and which worked very well for the Donegal County Council for a number of years.  We took pride in the fact that we had removed contentious <Col N="542" /> politics, in so far as they could be removed, from the county council by agreeing to a system of quota representation. We decided that the life of the council would be five years and membership would be 28.  Every six members would be entitled to one quota of everything that arose.  They would make up one-fifth of the membership of a committee and have an equal turn at being chairman and vice-chairman.  I was the architect of this suggestion and argued strongly for it for a number of years before I succeeded in getting independent Fianna Fáil and official Fianna Fáil to agree that it was worth trying.</P>
    <P>We want to create an atmosphere in this State that will attract the attention of one million people in Northern Ireland who do not want to be part of the Republic.  Does anybody think these people are going to be attracted to a society that behaves in the way the Minister, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, has behaved in redrawing the boundaries of Mayo or introducing Government reform at a time like this when houses are needed, roads have to be repaired and money is needed for water supply and for the provision of better sanitary services?  Is anybody crazy enough to think that any percentage of that one million people in Northern Ireland would be attracted to the South?</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I believe a great opportunity is being missed by the present Government in not including in this Bill rules and regulations which would compel members of local authorities to behave in a certain way.  I say that because there is the temptation to be the majority group in local authorities, whether that group be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any other political party. They try to manoeuvre in such a way that they grab all while minorities have no say whatever.  I am a great believer in trusting human nature but I would not go so far as to trust the actions of a politician or a group of politicians, no matter what county they are in and no matter what local authority or what parliament they belong to &mdash; politicians who try to manoeuvre into a position of centre stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> The quota system in Donegal to which I referred was agreed in the first instance by the late Deputy Liam Cunningham, an honourable man, by the then Senator McGlinchey and myself.  On that occasion the Blaneys and the independent Fianna Fáil Party were not treated very well by the Fianna Fáil groupings.  It was to the credit of the Fine Gael group that we changed that position the first opportunity we got.  When the bitterness died down between independent Fianna Fáil and official Fianna Fáil they went back to their old ways. They decided that they owed nothing to the Fine Gael group and that they would give them nothing.  They ignored not alone the elected representatives but the people themselves, and did so in such a blatant way that it probably would have made people who were accused of discrimination north of the Border blush with shame.  The strange thing is that the politicians on this side of the Border who are more vocal in their criticism of the behaviour of the Unionist Party in Northern Ireland for discriminating against Nationalists are the ones who are most guilty of discrimination this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>The debate here is about central Government <i>versus</i> local government. The powers of local government now as compared with those when I was first elected in 1960 are very different.  In those days councillors were asked to strike a county rate and as a result every one of them behaved in a very responsible way.  Looking over their shoulders were the ratepayers who were prepared to pay only what they could afford or what they thought they could afford.  That sense of responsibility made good councillors out of people elected to the local authority. As I have said, Fianna Fáil, by doing away with rates at the stroke of a pen, did more to amend local government legislation than this Bill is meant to do. Once the rates were removed it was a free-for-all.  Central Government had to provide the money; the responsibility was no longer on the council.  The ratepayers <Col N="544" /> were no longer looking over their shoulders. People in the community were asking elected representatives to get as much as they could and a halt had to be put to that.</P>
    <P>The rating system was not a very fair one.  The unfairness of that system was argued for many years.  As we know, all families, no matter what their income, paid the same rates.  The poor law valuation introduced under Griffith's law in 1854 was still in operation 120 years later. It was never meant to perform the functions that it was performing in the seventies. That was not foreseen by Griffith or by the people who planned it.  I have to conclude that it was much fairer than the charges that are now imposed on householders.  Whether you live in a house with three bathrooms and a couple of shower rooms or in a house with an outside toilet you pay the same water rates.  Whether you are earning £100,000 a year or £10,000 a year &mdash; a number of people are living on a lot less &mdash; you pay the same water charges.  There is nothing fair about that.  The quantity of water used in a big house in infinitely more than the quantity used in a small house.  With all the experience we had, we made no improvement on Griffith's valuation.  It could be very strongly argued that we made a mess of it.  Of course, the same applies with refuse charges. In a small house very little refuse is left at the front door while in a large house much more is left there; but the people pay the same refuse charges.</P>
    <P>Every item of expenditure of the county council has to come through the Department of the Environment.  If we want to build a toilet in the most remote part of our local authority area the Department of the Environment must give approval.  The same applies to a traffic sign.  The cost of administering all this is unacceptable.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, we have not made up our minds in regard to the powers we want to give local authorities.  The Minister wants to give certain powers to local authorities but to keep as much power as he possibly <Col N="545" /> can in central Government for the purpose of keeping political control over the local scene.</P>
    <P>I could say a lot more but I would be merely repeating what was said by other Deputies.  I am disappointed, to say the least, that we did not have time to debate the housing crisis, roads and sanitary services. Considering that county council elections were postponed for 12 months and that urban district council elections were postponed for an indefinite period, it seems unfair that the Bill to reform local government was announced last Friday, the memorandum circulated on Tuesday, the Bill debated today and being forced through the House tomorrow. Is it not time to talk about central Government reform?  We need a lot of reform to change the system which allows a Bill to be initiated on a Friday evening and debated the following week particularly when, as a number of Deputies said, it is a blueprint for the 21st century. I have been in this House for 30 years and we have not made progress during that time.  It is sad to have to record that.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for not making progress. When Fianna Fáil came into office in 1987 this party stood by them in the difficult policies they had to pursue to make the country financially healthy again.  There is no desire on the part of Opposition Deputies or parties to behave in any way other than responsibly, to ensure that the country is protected and that we are led in the right direction. There has been no acknowledgement from the Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil Cabinet or the members of the Progressive Democrats of the courage displayed by Deputy Dukes and the Fine Gael Party in backing the Government in times of stress.  A number of people, even Fine Gael supporters, criticised us for not treating Fianna Fáil in the way they treated us when we were in Government.  Every Wednesday night the Visitors' Gallery in the House was packed with nurses and members of various trade unions who were told what Fianna Fáil would do for them when they were back in office.  In spite of that, Fine Gael in Opposition <Col N="546" /> were responsible, in total contrast to the behaviour of Fianna Fáil in Opposition.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Bill I wish that the same responsible behaviour was demonstrated by the Minister for the Environment, that he would reassure Deputies that what he did in Mayo to protect his own seat and those of the other Fianna Fáil Deputies in the county, was a once off mistake on his part, that he did not really know what he was doing.  Of course, we all know that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, was doing it with the consent of the Cabinet and, ultimately, with the consent of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party.  As James Dillon once said: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil's motivating strength is that they want to stay close to the loot&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte must have a very short memory in talking about gerrymandering because the most notable gerrymander was in the mid-seventies, although it totally backfired.  He cannot accuse any Minister of any Government of attempting to gerrymander because it can be dealt with by the electorate, who are the best judges of any decision taken by a Minister at any time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation.  It is a change to see a Bill brought into the House which is aimed at making a start at reforming local government.  The reform of local government has been talked about since I entered politics in 1974.  When I stood for election in 1974 I heard some of the then members of the local authority to which I sought membership talk about the need for local government reform. There was no significant attempt to reform local government until this Bill was published.  People have said that there is not enough time to debate the legislation.  That does not arise.  Indeed, the attendance in the House shows that many people are not very interested in the legislation, despite the fact that it will affect most of them on 27 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the forthcoming local elections we will be seeking election to local authorities which we hope will have more teeth and power and which will be more <Col N="547" /> effective than those which we will leave. It is important that power should be handed back to the local authority members because they face the electorate on a regular basis and are forced to give an account of their stewardship.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Harte in relation to local authorities where harmony prevails and where there is an equal distribution in relation to committees and sub-committees of authorities.  There is now a better working relationship.  I was a member of a local authority for five years and my colleagues in the party were not allowed on even one committee of the authority.  Yet the chairman of that local authority boasted at the time that because his party were in control they should have absolute control.  That is wrong.  I am glad that the Bill will ensure that committees will operate on an equal basis so that minority groupings will have a fair say.  This is important if local government is to have a function in this day and age.</P>
    <P>The efforts being made to improve the effectiveness of local government should be accepted without question.  All those who have been members of local authorities for the past number of years have seen the need for some action to be taken to improve the lot of local authority members.  The need for this legislation has been accepted by Members of this House for a long time.  It is ironic to hear Members on the opposite side of the House criticising this legislation when we had to sit here on numerous occasions on the Order of Business and listen to them asking when the legislation for the reform of local government would be introduced.  Now that the legislation has been introduced, it is like a poison pill to them &mdash; they do not want to accept that the Government and Minister of the day had the courage to bring in the legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation is long overdue.  I know the public recognise that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and his two Ministers of State have bitten the political bullet which previous Ministers for the Environment were afraid to bite <Col N="548" /> over the years.  The Opposition parties were asked to make a contribution to local government reform but they put forward all sorts of excuses to avoid playing an active role in this regard.  The main Opposition party are most guilty of this. If we want to reform local government it is important that all parties make a contribution in the initial stages.  Indeed, there is much to be said for the setting up of an all-party committee to deal with local government reform.  This proposal should be considered by all parties in the House.</P>
    <P>The delay in introducing this legislation for a number of years was not in the best interests of local authorities and their members.  It is the first in a series of Bills on local government reform which will have to be brought before this House in the coming years.  It is the first phase in badly needed reform of local government.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the administration of local government.  The amount of resources spent on non-capital works is of concern to every member of local authorities.  In some cases the amount of money spent on non-capital work can be as high as 70 per cent.  This is totally unacceptable.  However, under the present system there is very little we can do about this.  It is also time for some of the work carried out by local authorities to be put to tender.  For example, my local authority decided to put to tender the contract for road works which needed to be carried out.  They found that the cost of carrying out the works by a private contractor would be much less than if they carried out the work directly themselves.  We hear so much about local government finances that I wonder how local authorities can function in many cases.  My local authority has 700 ratepayers in total.  They could get more in rates in Grafton Street than they would in County Leitrim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The population of County Leitrim &mdash; I am sure the Deputy is very <Col N="549" /> interested in this in view of his recent questions in regard to County Leitrim &mdash; is approximately 24,000.  Therefore, smaller local authorities are entitled to receive preferential treatment.  They have to provide services over a very wide area and do not have the same concentration of people in one area as local authorities in Dublin and larger towns have.  Consideration should be given to the equalisation of funding for local authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte and other Deputies have been moaning about the condition of our roads for a long period.  I am beginning to think that they have very short memories. Leitrim County Council received no resources in 1985 and 1986 for the repair of county roads.  At least in the past three years the Minister for the Environment has provided money so that local authorities can deal with the problem of potholes. I should like to point out that no one has referred in this House to the fact that the Government inherited the potholes from the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government who did not provide sufficient funds for the upkeep of our roads.  They did not give local authorities the necessary resources to improve our roads so that they could cater for the increasing volume of traffic. Opposition spokespersons have tried to lay the blame for this at the door of the present Minister for the Environment.  I believe members of local authorities can see that our roads are being improved. Perhaps these improvements are not being carried out as quickly as everyone would like, but at least improvements are being made.</P>
      <P>Many of the local authorities who complain about the state of our roads were prepared to spend their resources, on less essential services.  Despite what some Members on the opposite side of the House have said, I believe that the stewardship and accountability of the Fianna Fáil controlled councils will be acknowledged by the electorate in the local elections.</P>

      <P>The results of the local elections will tell all the stories.  My local authority have dealt effectively with the problems they inherited and have made good use of their resources.  The progress made in recent years in the housing area has been much better than that which has been accredited to the Minister.  No matter how much funding is provided it will never be enough.  Those who believe anything else are not being truthful.  In the past couple of years my local authority have managed to take people off the housing list who had been on it for eight to ten years.  This is an achievement because they did not receive sufficient funds for local authority housing in the mid-eighties.</P>
      <P>This Bill will do a number of very good things.  The establishment of regional committees is long overdue.  The co-ordination of effort in a region is very important. I hope that in years to come the legislation will enable my local authority to co-operate with local authorities on the Northern side of the Border.  The Sligo-Leitrim-Donegal region has been an effective region for a number of years. It is the present health board region, it is part of the one region for tourism purposes and part of the same IDA region. The development of regional committees will be in the best interests of the area which I represent.  As I have said, I hope the Bill will enable my local authority to extend the olive branch to the people to whom Deputy Harte referred, the members of Northern Ireland local authorities. They are willing to co-operate and I know that that co-operation can only be strengthened in the weeks ahead. The ongoing talks on Northern Ireland have shown that people are now prepared to sit down and discuss the problems facing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference is made in the Bill to county managers.  For many years county managers were selected and appointed to counties.  They sat in the manager's chair in the knowledge that they could not be removed at any stage.  The proposal that their term of office should be for seven years, the same as a secretary of a Department, will mean that at the end of <Col N="551" /> their term of office they will have to give an account of their stewardship as managers of local authorities.  Section 47 leads the way in making the manager perform for the county and the council.  It is questionable whether seven years is too long. Perhaps five years before reappointment would lead to more effective action by county managers.</P>

      <P>Everyone in the House would love a five-year term just like Deputy Byrne would.  Local authority terms have been varied.  There was an increase in the present one when the Minister last year decided to extend the lifetime of the councils elected in 1985. Local authorities have a duty to perform. Local councillors, corporation members, town commissioners and urban councillors have been the butt of jokes for many years.  It is said that they are only seen at election time but that they do nothing in between.  Anybody who is prepared to go into public life at local or national level makes sacrifices as do their families and they deserve a gold medal for it.  Local councillors have been portrayed as people who do not carry out their duties but irrespective of what party they represented they have always given an account of their stewardship at election time.  Those who do not perform do not return to the council.  Councillors have not earned the criticism to which they have been subjected over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities have a role to play with regard to local development, tourism and industrial development.  This Bill will give them an opportunity to play their role in the development of industry and tourism.  They will have an opportunity to have a significant input.  The local authority in an area are the best body to identify an area's ability to cope with problems and to identify tourist attractions and so on.  For many years local authorities have been hindered in playing a major role in industrial promotion. It is time the chains that bound <Col N="552" /> them were cut away.  This Bill is a first move towards revitalising the local authorities, giving them a full role in industrial promotion.  That might seem critical of the IDA.  They have a role to play but in many cases their guidelines are such that they cannot help the smaller industries.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with comittees of local authorities.  I agree with that.  The decision to remove the committees of agriculture, the health committees and other committees was not in the best interests of local government.  I am glad that in future the people who sit on local committees will be elected representatives or people with a good knowledge of what the committee will be discussing.  In the past people who were not suited to the job were appointed to committees.  They were people with vested interests who looked through a narrow focus and were not prepared to be broadminded when dealing with committee business.  The fact that elected members will now constitute those committees is important for local democracy. Local authority members face the electorate and have to give a regular account of their stewardship, as have the Members of the House.  Only those who do the job well will remain there indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Local government funding will have to be looked at in the not too distant future. Local authorities need revenue and the question must be considered at an early date.  If local government is not to fall around us in the years ahead it will need funding.  We should look to find the best source of funding.  Taxation such as that introduced across the pond is not the sort of taxation we would like to see here.</P>
    <P>People have talked about local authority charges.  For years, people in rural Ireland have been paying charges for group water schemes &mdash; for their installation, maintenance and annual charges. They have not complained.  People will have to accept that the day of the &ldquo;freebie&rdquo; has long since passed.  I am anxious that all local authorities would have an efficient and effective waiver scheme for hardship cases.  The local authority of which I am a member have been very <Col N="553" /> sympathetic towards hardship cases and were prepared to waive charges in respect of those who were not in a position to pay.</P>
    <P>Local authority members view with horror the local authority audit.  Local authority audits are carried out two, three or sometimes five years after the money has been spent.  The local authorities are audited under an antiquated system of eight headings where nobody knows where anything is spent or whether the amounts provided under each head were spent under that head, or whether part of the provision under the head was charged to some other service.  It may be time to introduce independent auditors who would audit the accounts of local authorities on a yearly basis and present the full audit within three months of the completion of the financial year and this in turn could be checked and verified by the local government auditors.  It is wrong to have the local government audit taking place after the money has been spent.</P>
    <P>We all accept the need for greater accountability.  We all accept the need for local authorities to be efficient, but the present local government structures do not lead to efficient cost control or to the efficient use of money.</P>
    <P>There has been reference in the past few days to section 4 motions which have become a major football in local government over the past number of years.  The local authority of which I am a member have not resorted to a section 4 motion since I became a member 17 years ago because we have been able to iron out, by negotiation, all the cases that would have justified section 4 motions.  If there was a little more co-operation with officialdom in many counties, the section 4 motions would become a rarity.</P>
    <P>The requirement that three-quarters of the members of the local authority must have voted for a section 4 motion is important.  The section 4 motion is a very useful power for members of local authorities. What worries me, however, is that when section 4 motions are passed they are appealed to An Bord Pleanála and the legal advice available to the local <Col N="554" /> authority members leaves much to be desired.  If there was a little more co-operation on the part of planning officers and engineers many of the section 4 motions that councillors are blamed for would not be necessary.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with the future of local government.  Local government needs a new lease of life if it is to be successful in the nineties.  This is the first attempt to do something real with local government, the first attempt to give it a new lease of life and to return power to the members.  After the local elections all the members of local authorities should be informed of their rights as a local authority and made aware of their functions and those of the manager.  In many cases they are left ignorant of what they are entitled to do and in many areas they are hoodwinked.  It is, therefore, important that the Department of the Environment would take the initiative and explain to newly elected members, and even outgoing members, of local authorities what their full powers are.</P>
    <P>If the general public are to participate actively in local government the local authorities must have the power they need.  That should be the aim of future local government reform.  If the power is returned to the members they will become practitioners of local politics at a level that has not been seen before in this country.  They will be accountable and those who abuse their powers will have no further role to play once the electorate get an opportunity to remove them.</P>
    <P>I fully support this Bill.  It is good legislation. It is a start in dealing with the problems of local authorities and there will be a number of other Bills in the not too distant future.  Deputy Harte referred to the housing programme.  The sooner legislation is brought in to deal with the present anomalies the better.  The new roads authority Bill will be in the best interests of the country.  The Department have done a good job in improving access to the city by providing by-passes of some of our towns to speed up the movement of traffic, but that is something for another day.</P>
    <P>On a final note, this is the first attempt <Col N="555" /> to deal with local government reform. Members on the opposite side who have been so critical should give it a chance and see how it works.  If it does not work they will have the opportunity, if they ever come to power, to bring in amending legislation.</P>

      <P>We should be thankful for small mercies.  Many of my parliamentary colleagues agree that local government as it has existed during my time on the city council and as it exists today is almost a farce.  The explanatory memorandum attempts to explain what this Bill is all about and says that it is designed primarily to strengthen local democracy. When we read that, we should all stand up and cheer, because we all believe that local democracy does not really exist. The memorandum goes on to say that the key is to give local authorities the capacity to serve the interests of their communities more effectively.  They are fine sentiments and nobody could disagree with them.  There is full support for those sentiments.  However, the reality is that at local government level no local democratic input is allowed.  In short, local government is a farce as it is structured today.  We should all be open about it and tell the electorate that this is the case.  We should shout it from the treetops so that when people take the trouble and inconvenience of coming out once every four, five or in this case six years to cast their votes they will not feel they have been fooled and that they are voting people into something that does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there is no real representation of people at local level on local councils.  As far as power is concerned, the Minister for the Environment controls 75 per cent, 20 per cent would be held by the manager and managerial team and approximately 5 per cent is in the hands of the locally elected representatives. Everybody knows that at local level one cannot scratch oneself without referring back through a bureaucratic structure at local level up an endless pipe which presumably finishes up on the desk of the bureaucrats in the <Col N="556" /> Department of the Environment.  There could be months or maybe years of deliberations over requests to build a local authority house or instal or set up traffic lights or requests for permission to go to tender on a refurbishment programme. If it were not so serious it would be hilarious.</P>
    <P>The system as it operates at the moment must be reversed.  If the sentiments in the explanatory memorandum represent a light at the end of the tunnel, if they mean that we have grasped the nettle and are doing something about the lack of local democracy, then we should all wholeheartedly welcome the Bill before us.  Section 5 (3) in Part II of the Bill provides that the making of a decision by a local authority in relation to representation of the views of the local community shall, under that section, be a reserved function.  Obviously, it would be more useful to tease this out on Committee Stage and find out how we can involve local people in the deliberations of local authorities.  That would be for another day.  The desperate need is for the Minister to afford far more powers to local authorities.  In saying that I am not calling for powers to be handed straight over to the managerial system.  What I am calling for is the transfer of powers to the people, to the residents associations, tenants associations, environmentalists and conservationists; in other words, to give groups such as An Taisce, ACRA and NATO a role to play.  Effectively, the only option open to these organisations is to strongly lobby politicians.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that there is a housing crisis in Dublin city, it is farcical that there are large plots of land lying derelict around the city.  The one thing people on waiting lists, the homeless and those living adjacent to derelict sites in the ownership of Dublin Corporation which are rat infested and overgrown with weeds cannot understand is why the corporation are not proceeding to build houses on these sites.</P>
    <P>A tortuous procedure must be gone through.  The corporation must first seek the permission of the Department of the Environment to draw up a plan.  If <Col N="557" /> granted, the plan must be submitted to the Department who will decide then if the plan can proceed to contract stage. In the meantime, those on the waiting list have to continue to wait.</P>
    <P>I also find it difficult to explain to people that neither they nor the local politicians have any input into the decisions made by the Minister and his Department who seem to work on the basis of directives issued to the county managers.  One such incredible directive instructed the local authorities to make a £5,000 grant available to those tenants who were prepared to vacate their local authority house.  That directive led to the destruction of a large number of communities in the city.  Indeed, those communities are still reeling from the effects of that decision and the decision of so many people to vacate their local authority houses and move to private housing. I am convinced that that policy was conceived at the behest of the Construction Industry Federation with one aim in mind, the creation of an artificial demand for private housing.</P>
    <P>I will not bore the House by going into the details except to say that that was a slap in the face for the local authorities and it has led to many communities being left leaderless and to the destruction of their social fabric.  It is doubtful if they will ever recover.  The point I am trying to make is that we are supposed to have a system of local government and local democracy, yet the elected members of city councils and county councils have no input into the directives issued by the Department of the Environment which the local managers must comply with.</P>
    <P>Depending on which way one looks at it, Dublin Corporation's tenant purchase scheme initiated in 1988 has been very successful.  Approximately 9,000 units will be sold under that scheme.  However, it needs to be pointed out that we will not be able to spend the moneys raised under that scheme to build new housing stock as, once again, the Minister for the Environment has issued a directive to local authorities on how to spend this money.  Needless to say if the Minister wants a local authority to do something <Col N="558" /> without the need to issue a directive he can always turn to the members of his own party who control many of the councils, with the result that instead of those members representing the interests of their town or city they comply with the wishes of the Minister and act just like puppets on a string.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation used to set aside a sum of £400,000 for the community grants scheme.  That was an extremely valuable source of funding for communities in the huge housing estates in the outer suburbs and in the inner city flat complexes.  When it was decided to slash the rates support grant one of the first victims of the cutbacks was the community who lost the sum of £400,000 which was used to finance the appointment of community development workers in deprived areas.  The Minister for the Environment, with his surplus funds from the lottery, used to demand that people make their application to him for grant assistance for community and leisure facilities.  Obviously, he discovered he was being bogged down with a huge number of applications.  The Department seemed totally incapable of handling the applications for lottery funding and, at the stroke of a pen, approaching Christmas two years ago, he decided to pretend to be a democrat.  He pretended to bring about what had been demanded, that the local authorities would have some say in how lottery money was spent.  He instructed the local authorities to process each application for lottery money.  Officials of the community section of Dublin Corporation had to work overtime almost through Christmas trying to comply with this directive.  The net effect is that while we used have our own £400,000 to spent we are now like beggars pleading with the Minister to release some of the money which is available under the amenities and recreational facilities grant scheme.</P>
    <P>This Bill is all about democracy.  It refers to returning some power to local government and involving the people.  If there is one power that should be returned to Dublin Corporation and local authorities it is that they by virtue of <Col N="559" /> being in receipt of a block grant from the Department out of lottery funding should be empowered to decide who is to benefit from this money.  Let us consider the farcical, totally undemocratic, destructive position today.  Last year the Minister had £6.5 million to spend nationally under the amenities and recreational facilities grant scheme and Dublin Corporation submitted projects totalling £4.5 million.  We managed to get funding for projects to the tune of £897,067.</P>
    <P>Local authorities know their areas well and their community development sections know every residents group, voluntary group, club and people seeking funding.  It would be logical to enable local authorities to direct who is to be grant-aided as was the case previously. This year Dublin Corporation are presenting to the Minister for the Environment 264 applications for lottery funding, for genuine projects to the value of £7,222,651.  Each of those 264 projects is deserving of some form of funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister is playing the game of retaining the power to himself, of deciding whom he is going to grant-aid, informing his party members, TDs and councillors before the public get to know to whom he is going to allocate money. He will leak the information to selected TDs and councillors so they will put out the good word that the Minister is a marvellous man, that a project is to receive £10,000 or £15,000, that Fianna Fáil are a wonderful party and were it not for them they would not receive the grant. While that gimmickry continues local government will be seen as a farce.  We will be merely reinforcing the gombeen, backwoodsman image of city and county councillors and town commissioners, the type of image we are trying to break away from.  I appeal to the Minister to help us reverse this image of our councillors and, instead of playing this cat and mouse game for a few votes here and there, to realise, as some of his party members on Dublin City Council realised when they saw applications for funding from their areas, that they cannot all be grant aided. If there is only £4 million to be spent this <Col N="560" /> year and Dublin City Council are looking for £7 million it is inevitable that Fianna Fáil councillors on Dublin Corporation will lose out in this game.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I would be grateful if he would come to deal with the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I thought my comments were relevant because the Bill refers to giving back power down the line.  I was giving the Minister a good example of where he might give block grants to local authorities so they can spend the money on deserving groups.</P>
      <P>I question the powers that may be given to city and county councillors.  The biggest agenda we have at local level is that for the meeting of the roads and traffic committee.  That speaks volumes.  Politicians at local level are being lobbied heavily by residents' groups, and individuals about traffic rat running, lack of pedestrian crossings, the need for traffic lights, double yellow lines and residential disc parking.  At the same time we hear of local authorities working off plans conceived 40 years ago.  I am speaking about local authority road building programmes. If people are to be involved in decision-making and given a say in how their city is developed it is not good enough that the power is transferred to public representatives.  We must use sections of the Bill to involve in a structured way the same residents' groups who are for ever being led in by the hand by politicians to meet either Ministers or the city manager.  Politicians should not have to act like a wet nurse for their constituents. Certain senior politicians, former Ministers and TDs feel a need to hold their constituent's hands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in Fishamble Street pretending their role is to get them a house.  They bring in mothers and daughters to sit down before the housing advisers.  That is an abuse of their position. That is not what democracy is about.  Democracy is about empowering people to use the structures that exist and not requiring the intercession of councillors, former Ministers and so on.  Too often there is a cliental approach to residents' organisations.  There should be structures in legislation empowering them to play a role.</P>
      <P>There is much use of the term &ldquo;democratic centralism&rdquo;.  There is nothing as centralist as the current position where all power seems to lie in the hands of the Minister for the Environment and the city manager.  There are no powers of real substance in the hands of elected representatives.  We must stop the suffocation of local government and give a breath of fresh air to city and county councillors.  Unless they are given responsibility there will be no improvement.</P>
      <P>I attack the decision of central Government to reduce Dublin city's rate support grant to £57.8 million.  What democratic procedure created the situation where there is no money for housing or community grants?  We have a very fine art gallery but there is no money to purchase works for it.  The cutbacks which devastated local government resulted in job losses of 18 per cent in Dublin Corporation. We have lost 1,455 workers and the benefit of their services.  Who are the victims?  If one is unfortunate enough to live in the middle of a multi-storey block of flats and the tenant at the top has a burst pipe or blocked sewerage, one finds that the local authority do not have an emergency service at the weekend.  That is the effect of the cutbacks on Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How are we to improve the position? The Bill does not touch on the question of funding.  This is clearly the missing link.  If we succeed in devising structures which will involve people in the democratic process but fail to provide adequate <Col N="562" /> funding, the whole thing will be a paper exercise.</P>
    <P>Our vision of local government is that it will be a hive of democracy where at every level, in every street, housing estate, town, parish, county and region the people will be making decisions.  They will be involved in the planning process and in the delivery of services.  They will be in control of facilities such as parks, schools, libraries, the police and the shopping centres.  No institutions, public or private, should be exempt from the democratic will of the people.</P>
    <P>Groups of people often come together to make submissions on, say, the draft development plan.  They go to tremendous lengths to engage architects or town planners.  They collectively submit volumes of material which is given scant regard at local government level.  It is a sad reflection on the existing system that nobody is interested in giving consideration to the representations made by citizens.  It is too laborious a job for part-time or very busy politicians and would have to be done by full-time councillors. We abdicate our rights and responsibilities and leave the decision making to the planners and the city manager and hope they will come up with some fair representation of what constituents are looking for.</P>
    <P>There is a semblance of democracy in regard to development plans.  They go on display in public libraries and people make their submissions, but we must be honest and admit that their contributions are not given serious consideration.  I do not know how to overcome this problem or if we should advocate a role for local councillors in a full-time capacity.  That is certainly not envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that Dublin city and county comprise the one area which has reversed the incredible decision to impose service charges.  I am not happy that there are various interpretations as to whether one should have such charges. It is disgraceful that people are being sent to jail because they refuse to pay.  That element of compulsion, particularly with regard to service charges, must go and the Bill must address that issue.  It is sad <Col N="563" /> that the scheme was initiated but even sadder that it was suggested to the electorate before the last election that Fianna Fáil would remove service charges if returned.  They have not been removed but I am happy to say that where The Workers' Party have been strong in Dublin city and county we have been successful in having the charges removed, much to the pleasure of our constituents.</P>
    <P>It is important to structure local government in such a way that people can make a contribution to the planning and development of their area.  People in John Dillion Street may feel they have a contribution to make regarding the amount of traffic in their area.  People in Oliver Bond flats may want to make a contribution to the management of their estate.  People in other flat complexes might want to have a role in developing policy regarding the letting of flats.  We must create the structures to involve people.  We have nothing to fear from their involvement and those of us who are councillors should play a supportive role.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned NATO and ACRA.  There is a group in Dublin South inner city called SICCDA, the South Inner City Community Development Association.  If the Department of the Environment are interested, as they claim to be, in the creation of a greater social mix, community stability and selfmanagement of schemes and so on, why is the south inner city community development association not an integral part of the local government structure? These people know their area, they know the problems, they know the people, they have a tremendous input to make.  We should have a structure whereby the local councillor would not be fearful of giving them some power.  The more power we can afford to give the greater and stronger will be the democratic structures in operation in our cities.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to see both yesterday and today and at other times during the year the number of school children who are brought here by politicians &mdash; and I, too, have brought some.  It always amazes <Col N="564" /> me that you will find the Dáil chock-a-block with school children.  The fundamental problem in Ireland &mdash; and I suppose the elected representatives are aware of it &mdash; is whether we have any democracy at local government level. When it comes to voting there is an average turn out of about 50 per cent at local government level; that low turn out speaks volumes.  I think it suggests that people are saying: &ldquo;What is the point of going out to vote in a local election when the people we are voting for have no power?&rdquo;  This Bill may go some way to correcting this by giving us more power.</P>
    <P>The public perception of what a local authority does will have to be cleared up. I am delighted to see the children taking an interest in central Government politics, but why are the schools not teaching children about local government?  There is an incredible level of ignorance in the minds of people, school teachers and children about what is local government as against what is central Government. They blend them all together as Government, saying there is no real difference, they are all the same, when in fact that is not the case.  The educational system should have a very close look at the reason people do not understand the difference between central and local government.  I would be happy to see the day when busloads of children would be accommodated in the Mansion House, in City Hall, in Fishamble Street, the headquarters of Dublin Corporation, and where people would appreciate that local government is all about the provision of services &mdash; for example, fire services, fresh water supply at the tap.  I wish more politicians would take on board the exercise of educating the children of this country in regard to the differences between central and local government.  Hopefully, when it comes to local elections these young people will be capable of deciding on whom to vote for and what they might obtain by way of properly functioning councils.</P>
    <P>Much more could be said about local government and I have a lot of notes here which I will sacrifice because, unfortunately, I have to attend a citizens' <Col N="565" /> advice bureau at 7.30 p.m. and I would hate to have people queueing up outside it at this hour of the evening.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will probably do that tomorrow morning.  I would like to take the opportunity to welcome this Bill.  It is important that the House and people realise that this Bill is in many respects an enabling measure.  It is a Bill which creates a legal framework for further reform to take place in the local government area.  When introducing the Bill the Minister made it clear that local government reform is an evolving process, it is not something that can happen overnight or by one single Act.  He has given himself powers in the Bill to take further action in future years to devolve powers to local authorities or to bring in further reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also that we try to put the Bill and the debate into perspective. Having looked at many of the contributions to the debate I am struck by <Col N="566" /> the fact that most people did not concentrate on the subject matter of the Bill &mdash; namely, local government reform &mdash; but began to digress and go down various paths relating to housing and the particular problems in their own constituency. We have got a litany of problems and we have been given a grand tour of Ireland by many Deputies in respect of their constituencies.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to establish for the first time on a statutory basis the representational role of local authorities.  It has been bandied about in this House that local authorities do not have power and that they are basically a talking shop and a waste of time.  I question that viewpoint because, while undoubtedly we do have a considerable degree of centralisation in Ireland, it must be put on the record that local authorities do have powers and that councillors under the present arrangements have powers.  But I question whether councillors want to exercise those powers or whether they want to be put in a position where they have more powers and be in a position to exercise them.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience in Cork that one of the major reserved functions of any council is to prepare the annual book of estimates &mdash; in other words, to determine the level of expenditure which any council may engage in from year to year, to determine current revenue, receipts and so on.  Invariably what happens is that the city manager produces a draft book of estimates which to all intents and purposes becomes the real book of estimates at the end of a week, with minor adjustments made by the councillors.</P>
    <P>The reality is that under existing arrangements the councillors have the power to form an estimates committee, to prepare their own estimates, to put them to the manager for ratification and to play a much more involved role in the preparation and compilation of those estimates.  The estimates must be passed by a vote of the majority of the councillors. During my six years in Cork Corporation I have witnessed the manager's estimates emerging, not the council's <Col N="567" /> estimates.  Deputies have argued that councillors do not have power.  I argue that they have certain powers but they are not prepared to exercise them.  It may be that the dice is loaded against councillors in many respects &mdash; and we must be fair to them &mdash; in the sense that the manager has all the aces in terms of a full-time staff behind him and expert advice and that councillors may not have access to independent advice or have the same amount of time to give to the preparation of estimates.  However, there is room for greater involvement of councillors in the preparation of estimates.</P>
    <P>Let us take another reserved function, which is very important, the preparation of a city or county development plan.  My experience has shown that, even though councillors have the overriding power to prepare, produce and pass that plan, invariably they leave the bulk of the work to the management staff or the planning department of their respective local authorities. In our own case in the preparation of our five year plan we received draft chapters from the planning department which were produced at seminars.  We attended lectures, we had question and answer sessions and we gave our opinions as to what we thought of the draft chapters; but there was no commitment by the manager or his staff that they would take on board those sentiments.</P>
    <P>Essentially what happens is that the draft chapters become the actual chapters of the city development plan and go on public display.  The point I am making is that preparing the development plan is a very powerful right which councillors have.  The five year plan determines the zoning of a city, where development may take place and the type of development that may take place in a certain area.  It also determines the road policy for an area, the housing and amenity policies, the waste disposal policy and so on.  The plan determines the very issues that should be on the agenda during the local elections but are not.  Yet, we find that councillors refrain from getting involved in the nitty gritty of producing the five year plan and leave it to the manager and <Col N="568" /> the planners to come up with the plan. There is little point in Members talking about providing extra powers for councillors if councillors are not prepared to use the powers they already have.  They have powers, and it is important that I put that point on the record.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with the use of section 4 motions.  While I agree with the Minister's provision in regard to section 4, particularly in regard to planning matters, councils under the old legislation will still be able to invoke section 4 for non-planning issues.  Some councils have never used a section motion 4.  When a councillor in such a council has the temerity to invoke this provision some of the more senior members gasp in horror that a councillor could do such a dreadful thing.  It is not a dreadful thing to do; it is a power that councillors have under the Act.  There should be a healthy tension between the manager and the elected representatives. If the relationship is too cosy I suspect that people are losing out somehow.  What amazes me is that at times councillors seem afraid to use the powers they already have or they pull back from using their powers.  Section 4 motions are a case in point.  Only three or four councils use section 4 motions in planning decisions; and I do not approve of the extent to which it has been used in planning decisions in those counties.  The measure introduced in the Bill is quite correct in that respect.  However, I make this point to support my overall view that councillors have had powers for the past ten to 30 years which, for varying reasons, they have not used.</P>
    <P>My fourth point is that councillors should have access to independent expert advice and I ask the Minister to consider this.  They also need access to independent sources of information because too often in a range of policy areas councillors have access only to expert inhouse advice.  They are advised by the management team, either in the planning section, the engineering section, the housing section, the architect section or whatever.  Councillors have to question this advice on the basis of their own experience.  I believe that too often they <Col N="569" /> lack independent expert advice &mdash; for example, in the formulation of a transport policy for a city or county.</P>
    <P>When listening to a discussion on transport policy on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the other morning I was struck by the fact that the two lecturers &mdash; one from Trinity College and the other from UCD &mdash; had views on a transport policy for Dublin city markedly different from the views emanating from Dublin Corporation management.  It was well worth listening to their views.  They were very informative because they had a European perspective on the issue.  I suggest that if the councillors in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council had been exposed to that type of alternative thinking on transport policy they might have come to different conclusions whenever the decisions were made to do what they are now doing.  We might have had a healthier approach to the formulation of local government policy.  I think the Minister should consider this point.  I have spoken to him already about it.  I think we could make greater use of the existing third level colleges in pursuing this objective and I recommend that strongly indeed.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, there should be a tension between the city manager and his staff and the elected councillors. I was amazed when Deputy Byrne said the Minister has all power in the local government system.  He really does not have this power.  I think the most powerful man or woman &mdash; although there are very few women county managers, but that will probably change &mdash; in the local government system is the city or county manager.  There is no question about that.  The city manager has incredible power.  Indeed, he has far more power than individual Members of the Legislature. That is worth looking at.  The city manager is the final planning officer in any city or county and has tremendous power of leverage.  If a manager and council are not enjoying a harmonious relationship we tend to get a difficult situation emerging.  The present system <Col N="570" /> depends on a relationship between the manager and the councillors.  There must be a meeting of minds but under the present system the manager has the majority of powers and this should be looked at.  I welcome the provision which sets a time limit on the term of office of a city or county manager.</P>
    <P>People tend to have a negative perception of local authorities.  I think this results from the conflict between councillors and management.  The councillors are in constant contact with the people. They are out at resident association meetings, meet various deputations and so on. They hear the perspective of people on the ground.  The city manager and his staff are that little bit more removed from the reality and very often tend to override the opposition from community groups. I think that is unhealthy.  Many of the difficulties in Cork Corporation over the marsh plan, the car park and the city dump, arose because the full-time officials who have the greater power are removed from the people.  Because they do not have to depend on the people to hold their positions they tend to ignore their views or fob them off.  That is an unhealthy aspect of our present local government system.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attempted to address this in the Bill and the enabling powers which he has given himself should enable him in future legislation to take power from the manager and give it back to the elected councillors.  In his speech the Minister stressed that he wanted local authorities to be the voice of the people and that he did not want councils to be alienated from the people.  There must be something wrong at council meetings when the galleries are full of people from a given area who are very strongly opposed to a plan emanating from City Hall.  There is a breakdown in the system. This is happening in too many councils throughout the country and it illustrates the reason that councils and corporations have generated this negative perception of themselves.  As the Minister has said, local authorities are doing tremendous work in many areas &mdash; for example, in regard to urban renewal, providing <Col N="571" /> amenities, playing pitches and so on. Yet the overriding public perception of local authorities is negative and I think this is due to the situation I outlined earlier in my speech.</P>
    <P>The question of funding local government is not a primary issue in this Bill. The Minister made a valid point in his speech that there is very little point in dealing with a fundamental review of the financial provisions for local authorities if the structures are not in place.  In other words, we must reform the structure and put new structures in place before we begin to look at the financing of those structures.  Studies have been carried out and, indeed, the London School of Economics have prepared a report.  One report comes to the conclusion that our existing system is not that terribly bad and that it stands up quite well in the European context.</P>
    <P>Many misleading and insincere comments have been made in the House and elsewhere about the system of funding local government. Everyone is agreed that some system of local taxation is needed, but no one will actually specify what they mean.  People have attacked service charges and so on, but service charges have been in place since 1983. They were brought in by the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government of the time &mdash; Deputy Spring was then Minister. No party &mdash; not the Labour Party, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats or Fianna Fáil &mdash; have committed themselves to repeal or abolish service charges.  They may have done so for earlier elections, and were probably wrong in doing so but the bottom line is that the consensus emerging is that service charges are better than any other system.</P>
    <P>Moves were made to set up an all-party committee on local government financing but Fine Gael did not want to participate, because, I suggest, they did not want to be involved in the reintroduction of rates. A common view held at the time was that rates would have to come back in order to fund local government.  In my view it is not politically palatable to bring back <Col N="572" /> rates.  People looking at what happened in England with the poll tax suddenly began to realise that any attempt to bring back a property tax, rates, or a tax on houses, would be opposed very strongly by the people.  Service charges probably represent the lowest form of local taxation. Anyone who really wants to abolish service charges is talking about a form of local taxation that would have people paying more than they are paying at present; it is worth bearing that thought in mind.  No one on the Opposition benches has yet come up with an alternative system of funding local government. The Workers' Party talked a while ago about a marvellous vision, in which literally everybody was involved in local government.  Again it was not specified where the money would come from.</P>
    <P>In the past three years the lower band of income tax has come down to 29 per cent.  In 1983 people argued that service charges were wrong because they represented a dual form of taxation, double taxation.  I ask a question &mdash; I asked it before but I have not had an answer &mdash; to what level must income tax be reduced before service charges become acceptable? Should the Government bring income tax down to 25 per cent or 20 per cent?  The Government have significantly increased the yield from corporation tax; we intend to continue to reduce PAYE tax down to 25 per cent and down to 50 per cent at the higher rate; the farmers have been put on their own system of taxation to which they object strongly; the self-employed have also been put on their own system of taxation; a sum of £500 million was taken in in the amnesty. I mention those points to illustrate the overall picture that significant movements have been made on the tax front since 1987.  The reason for opposing service charges in 1983 are not as strong today as they might have been then because of the reforms that have taken place in the taxation system, not to mention the reduction in VAT of four points in the past two years.  It is up to those who want to abolish service charges to put forward specific proposals for funding <Col N="573" /> local government.  They have not done so to date and do not seem likely to do so.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat taken aback yesterday when listening to a colleague from Cork, Deputy Allen, speak about the Bill.  He spoke about the service charges.  His was an incredible speech that was more designed to get headlines in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> than it was designed to make any worthwhile contribution to the Bill. About five times he called on the Minister to resign.  All I can add is that I am thankful the Minister's tenure of office will be much longer than was Deputy Allen's on the Fine Gael Front Bench. The Deputy went over the top in the comments he made about the Minister, particularly those in relation to service charges.  He accused the Minister of jailing people, although he knew that was not quite the position.  He himself voted for service charges, and his own party at the moment believe in service charges and have not put forward any opposing views on them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen made nonsense of the social housing plan announced by the Minister for the Environment.  That plan does deserve consideration.  It will have an impact.  For the first time in many years a multipurpose approach to the provision of housing has been offered.  Gone are the days of building huge green field housing estates.  The building of such huge housing estates brought in its train many social problems, and it should never be repeated.  The Minister is giving people options.  We have come down in favour of the view that as many people as possible should own their own homes and that the shared ownership concept is worth pursuing.  Likewise, the incentive of £3,300 for people to leave local authority houses and purchase a private house is a good one.  The proposal that if people on the housing list bring a house up to a certain standard they can come off the housing list will also help.  We are not getting rid of our building programme, we are building houses in a more select and planned way, particularly in inner cities.  There should be more concentration on building up the inner cities. There are several schemes on hold in <Col N="574" /> particular areas of inner cities that should be accelerated.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities are a little reluctant to send up schemes from the inner city areas because of their higher cost, because of their infill nature, and because the authorities would prefer to get a little more money for green field sites.  Ministers should note that; they should actively persuade local authorities to send up schemes in relation to the inner city areas &mdash; maybe 20 or 25 houses in designated areas to try to complete the work achieved under the designated area schemes.</P>
    <P>It makes me sick to hear people toss aside the Government housing policy in one sentence and say it is a load of rubbish, particularly when those people were at a meeting with the Minister for the Environment held some months ago in Cork and welcomed his proposals.  Fine Gael people, Labour Party people and Fianna Fáil people all said that the proposals were excellent, a great idea, and congratulated the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is very true.  This must be the most anticlimactic debate in the House for a long time.  The run up to the debate was incredible.  Allegations were made that the Minister was giving himself draconian powers and that the Bill would mean increased centralisation of local government.  Deputy Allen and other Deputies argued that they did not have enough time to prepare their contributions on the Bill.  Local government reform has been heralded for many a year, and the Government made their intentions known well in advance. Indeed, the expert committee published their report which is there for everybody to peruse.  The financial report that had been asked for was also published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March the Government made known their intentions that they would introduce the Bill and indicated broad outlines.  It is absolutely ridiculous for people to suggest that they did not have <Col N="575" /> enough time to prepare informed comment on the Bill.  In my view, this was political posturing, more to do with local elections or a personal vendetta against the Minister than with any substantive reason.</P>
    <P>An important issue dealt with in the Bill is the establishment of boundary committees to deal with extensions of city boundaries.  In the Bill the Minister has made it clear that where there is disagreement between two local authorities a boundary committee will be formed, which will make recommendations and have a determining influence on the way the matter evolves.  Such a measure is long overdue.  It is about time that the boundary of my own city, Cork, was extended.  The city has expanded substantially in recent years, with huge sprawling housing estates down to Rochestown, Douglas, Grange and Frankfield, back down towards Togher, and the surrounding areas of Ballyvolane, etc.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made, from the point of view of the logical management of affairs, for extending the city boundary in that direction, and the Bill will permit councils to make such submissions.  The Minister should address that.  I am not talking about electoral boundaries but administrative boundaries and about the proper management of our affairs. County Cork is a huge county and the county council cover a wide area.  Very often the interests of Bantry or Schull are not the same as those of Douglas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would mean that Deputy Sheehan would have more resources if we brought Douglas or Rochestown into an enlarged city boundary. Deputy Sheehan would not object to such a move.  The Minister should address that matter.  It is one in which I am particularly interested.  The central objective of the Bill is to promote the democratic representational role of members to the forefront in future local authorities.  In other <Col N="576" /> words, councils, as opposed to city managers or officials, would be seen as the real local authority.  It is amazing that for the first time we are giving statutory recognition to that and that previous legislation did not allow for it.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill the Minister proposes setting up regional authorities and these authorities will be formed from members of the existing local authorities.  There was some criticism during the week about the designation of regions by the Minister in his speech, but we are quite happy with the south-west region.  The only difficulty I have is that the function and role of that regional authority is not properly spelled out.  It is important that we have regional authorities to co-ordinate the role of the various county councils and local authorities in a given region.  For example, if we look at the major economic issues which affect the south-west tourism is a principal factor and, therefore, access transport to the region is vitally important. It is important to have a regional authority that will concentrate on those macro issues.  That section is somewhat vague.  The role of the regional authorities should be spelled out.  I know this is a process that will evolve over time but the regional authorities could very quickly become talking shops if they are not given a specific role.  I suggest that they should take a more regional approach to transport, tourism, infrastructure and so on.</P>
      <P>The counties of Meath, Kildare, and other counties, have been included with Dublin as one region and that has generated some heat.  A number of Dublin Deputies were upset at the fact that Dublin is being included with other counties. The geographical position is not the primary issue but rather the role of the various authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the distinction between local government and local administration.  Local authorities could do much more about the way they present themselves to the people.  For example, most local authorities have no public relations officers working for them.  The Minister, in his speech, dwelt on the negative perception which people have <Col N="577" /> of councils, and that could be overcome if there was a greater use of public relations officers.  The Bill deals with the role and functions of local authorities.  Unfortunately, local authorities in the past have been seen as providers of services such as water, waste disposal and refuse services, but in the changing economic climate and changing trends in the world local authorities and councils must become much more developmental as regards tourism and so on.  They must become more than just builders of roads and providers of sewerage works.</P>
    <P>Tourism policy should come under local authorities.  There is too much duplication in this area.  I would argue that Cork Corporation have done more in many respects than the local tourist body as regards tourist promotion and the improvement and enhancement of the city.  Local regional tourism bodies should be subsumed into local authorities. In that way there would be better co-ordination and better promotion of a city or county.  There would be better integration in relation to sign posting, the planning of hotels or whatever and the promotion of cities abroad.  Local authorities should be given a greater role in those areas.</P>
    <P>In recent years Cork Corporation gave grants to various groups and bodies to promote tourism and I wondered why they did not take on this task themselves. We have been particularly strong in our support of the Arts.  The Arts represent a very important economic dimension of any city.  In Cork we are now becoming involved in the purchase of an opera house, acquiring almost two-thirds interest in it and spending £1.2 million over six years.  In addition, we spend over £100,000 a year on other artistic activities in the city.  It is not just Arts for Arts sake.  The Arts help to retain a living, vibrant city.  They bring people into the city centre at night and help to keep inner city areas from going into decay.  It is extremely important that such areas are developed more and that councils have a greater role in them.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be seen in the overall context as a Bill designed to create a <Col N="578" /> framework under which future local government reform can taken place.  It is not the Bill to end all Bills.</P>

      <P>We may have a beauty contest this week to decide which of the Cork city Deputies should be promoted as the next Cabinet Minister.  They will all have their own backing groups, not as in musical backing groups for the pop stars but financiers, &ldquo;tacateers&rdquo; and so on.  It is extraordinary that Cork is the best at virtually everything, be it hurling, football, rugby or soccer, but when it comes to Fianna Fáil politicians they fall flat.  However, I do not wish to be unkind because Deputy Martin's contribution was constructive.  Neither do I wish to be over-critical of the Bill because Bills generally are disappointing, irrespective of Governments or Ministers.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority, a county council or an urban council for 15 years and I have been a member of either the Dáil or Seanad for the past 18 years.  I have also been in Government. This legislation is really upside down.  It is supposed to be about local government reform but neither local government nor any other system lower down on the scale of priorities can be reformed unless central Government is reformed.  To talk about local or regional committees is a bit nonsensical until government is reformed at the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We inherited our system from the British in 1922 and while they have changed their system, which was suited to an industrialised, heavily populated country, we have slavishly held on to the system which is antiquated and totally unsuitable for a rural, agricultural and very thinly populated country with very little industrialisation.  The frustration of being in here day in, day out, year in, <Col N="579" /> year out, is awful and it is time we started at the top.  We should reform the Dáil and Seanad before we tinker with lesser bodies.  I do not mean any disrespect to the people who serve on these bodies, as the vast majority are genuine, hardworking people.  However, they are handicapped from the very first day because the heavy hand of central Government hangs over all those bodies which are starved of cash and, as a result, of power.  You must give power and responsibility to people to get the best type of public representative.  My experience over the last ten or 15 years is that local authorities, instead of being given a realistic amount of power, are having their powers diminished daily.  It is a very regrettable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I want to make an accusation which is well founded and well known to people who have worked in the system at all levels.  It is that the Department of Finance go out of their way to stifle any extension of the powers of local representatives or, for that matter, of representatives at national level.  It is all about money and power vested in the hands of a few people, mainly in the Civil Service, although some of them are at a higher political level.  That is frustrating to people who have to work the system down the line.  I am not blaming the Minister for the Environment &mdash; or the junior Minister &mdash; for an inadequate Bill; I blame politicians for not starting at the top and doing a job which we all know needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen a little imagination and inventiveness in this Bill.  There was a lot of scope for that but it did not materialise.  I do not know what Committee Stage will yield, probably nothing because there will be a series of votes and anything constructive which we propose will be defeated.  Because of time constrictions half the Bill will be debated and the other half will be guillotined.  That is the way political life operates and we may well have done the same when we were in Government.</P>
    <P>The people at the top have been seriously negligent, not just in the last <Col N="580" /> year or two but over many years.  We do not have a political system, nationally and locally, which is relevant to the people's needs.  The Bill provides that local authorities be accountable to the people for how they perform on their behalf.  They should be accountable but I do not think they are.  In my experience, a county or city manager has infinitely more power than all the councillors put together on any body.  These reserved functions, which members are supposed to have, have been so eroded that they are virtually irrelevant.  The functions which the senior officials, particularly city and county managers, have are so immense that they have tremendous power.  However, they are not elected, so you cannot talk about accountability where local representatives are concerned if they do not have power.</P>
    <P>Instead of reducing the powers of senior officials and giving it to the elected representatives, the reverse is the case and legislation like this does not help the situation.  There is a type of &ldquo;lackeyism&rdquo; in this country whereby people, instead of fighting for rights and standing up for people's rights, grovel to senior officials for favours who, in turn, will be reelected at the next election.  That appertains not just to local politicians but also to national politicians.  Deputy Byrne alluded to it earlier.  This country is too exposed to the influence of individuals and pressure groups who do not represent anybody except themselves.  The politicians do not have the type of power which would give them the courage to tell those pressure groups and individuals to hump off, that politicians will run the country as they see fit.  There is a system of patronage which lends itself to abuse of politicians instead of respect for them. We will never have a proper system until we get rid of that type of system, locally and nationally.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance are only interested to see that as little money as possible is spent at the discretion of local or national representatives.  The Department of Finance want to have complete control over the spending of every single penny.  This defeats the very basis of <Col N="581" /> democracy.  It is an issue that will have to be faced up to and changed.  In the time that I have been a member of this House and, earlier, of the Seanad I have not seen anyone who was willing to face up to this issue.  We talk about it but we do nothing to change it.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Local government is, after all, the level of government which relates most clearly to the day to day lives of the people.  If we allow flaws in the system to create a sense of alienation between communities and the representative authorities, a great disservice will be done to our whole democratic system.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was the Minister or one of his civil servants who phrased that statement but little did he know that what he said is correct in an inverse way. We are undermining democracy because we are not allowing the decision to be taken by elected representatives.  No official in the Department of Finance nor no city or county manager should be able to over-rule or dictate to elected representatives. However, this is what they are doing and it is undermining our democratic system.  Unless we change that system, it will blow up in our faces one of these days.  The extreme Left, the agitators and pressure groups, are all out to cause as much trouble as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of cynicism among members of the public towards politicians which is decidedly unhealthy.  We have no one to blame for this but ourselves. The sooner we come to realise that instead of strengthening, enforcing and helping democracy, we are undermining it by our ineptitude and lack of courage, the better.  Social unrest and upheaval occur when people sit back and allow faceless people to make the decisions. Elected representatives, whether they are members of urban councils, county councils, corporations or Dáil Éireann should be the people who make the decisions.  Day in, day out we walk through the lobbies rubber stamping highly technical legislation about which <Col N="582" /> many of us know virtually nothing at times.  It is time we set about making this House more meaningful to the general public.</P>
    <P>Talking about local government reform is almost pointless &mdash; I would not say totally pointless &mdash; if we do not change the system of central Government and the system of financing local government. I would love to see an indepth debate taking place in this House on the structures of the Houses of the Oireachtas, with a series of proposals emanating from Members.  I do not know why everyone got hot and bothered about this Bill as it is pretty minor and irrelevant. A few innovative proposals could have been included in the Bill.  One simple one would be the proposal that county councils be elected on the basis of a one seat electoral division, based on a single transferable vote?  We have spoken about this in the context of Dáil elections, but why should we not start at local level? One of the things which tears the heart and soul out of good men and women is when they go into elections with the sole objective of beating their running mate from their own party, not the opposition party.  I suppose there is a word for this.  If you kill your brother it is called fratricide and what Saddam Hussein did is called genocide.  There should be another word with &ldquo;cide&rdquo; at the end of it which describes this political infighting.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the reform, if one can call it such, did not extend to urban councils and town commissioners.  I am not saying that the Minister was wrong in not having considered changing the format of local councils.  There is much to be said for a district council rather than an urban council or a town commission.  The suburbs and environs of a town are part of a town and they should be considered when it comes to representation and dealing with their problems.  There are local district councils in Britain.  This is not a bad concept and I believe it is what the Minister has in mind.  It is not always possible to frame these types of proposals at relatively short notice.  I presume those elections will take place next year.  It will be interesting to see what form these district councils will take.</P>
      <P>Urban councils have an element of autonomy.  When I say &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; I mean relative autonomy because no body, whether it is the Dáil, Seanad, county councils, corporations or urban councils have any real autonomy.  They are hamstrung &mdash; officials, Ministers and the senior officials in the Department of Finance tell them what to do.  In the context of autonomy as we know it, urban councils have some powers &mdash; they can spend a few pounds on lights, road repairs, water schemes, house repairs and other items which affect people's every day lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest nonsense of all time are town commissioners.  I hope that in the forthcoming reform of local councils and local district councils a new format will replace town commissioners.  Hopefully some of the larger town commissioners will be upgraded to the status of urban councils or urban district councils.  Perhaps the small town commissioners will be integrated into a district council, as they are called in Britain.  As they are presently constituted, town commissioners do not have any reason for <Col N="584" /> existing, they do not have any powers. The others have little enough, but for God's sake give people in those small towns presently controlled by town commissioners some sort of representation and some powers that are meaningful.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the section of the Bill which advocates the setting up of a boundary commission. That is covered in sections 27 to 35.  It is very desirable because the present system of getting a boundary extension is so drawn out and so difficult and gives rise to such aggravation between adjoining local authorities.  I look forward with pleasure to seeing this section coming into force.  As things stand, the last extension of a boundary related to Drogheda back in the seventies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was more recent, but it was by agreement.  There was another one in Waterford, but the last one which gave rise to aggravation was when Drogheda extended its boundary area into County Meath.  The then Minister for Local Government, the former Deputy Tully, was caused some pain by this because he had to take a chunk of County Meath out and give it to Drogheda Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the adjoining local authorities do not agree on the changes the procedures involved are pretty awful.  They are so drawn out that it can take from ten to 15 years to get the change.  There may be a public inquiry and they may have to go to the courts.  It was messy and difficult. It is a very good idea to put this proposal for a boundary commission into the Bill. There has been a problem in Cork for 20 or 30 years because the city has been unable to expand into the county.  There has been a problem in Limerick where the corporation cannot extend into County Clare which is their natural hinterland. There is a problem in Waterford city where the uniform development of the city cannot take place.  The Waterford <Col N="585" /> County Council agreed ten years ago to give the corporation a huge hunk of the county, about three times the size of the city at the time, and they can expand readily into County Waterford. However, they cannot get any concession from County Kilkenny.  Half of the development should go into the Waterford county area and the other half should go north into County Kilkenny, but they cannot get the extension because Kilkenny County Council will not agree. In that type of situation a boundary commission with the right to make a binding decision is extremely desirable.</P>
    <P>Parts of the Bill are a bit mealy mouthed &mdash; for instance, in relation to setting up committees.  The Minister might not be aware, but in recent years two of the statutory committees of county councils have been abolished &mdash; county committees of agriculture and health advisory committees.  Here is an interesting story which perhaps does not reflect well on me, but confession is good for the soul.  I was the Minister who ostensibly abolished county committees of agriculture.  That sounds contradictory with regard to what I am saying now; but the fact is that the Department of Finance decided to do that and it was at their behest that I did it.  This sort of legislation tackles the problem from the wrong end. There should be reform in central Government not in local government. There cannot be proper reform of local government while we are hamstrung and controlled by central Government, particularly the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to how many committees should be set up.  Can the local authorities, under section 37, form an infinite number of committees and what form should they take?  Perhaps the Minister will answer that when replying, because we might never get to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The biggest thing going for county councillors at the moment are sheep <Col N="586" /> dipping committees.  The statutory committees have been abolished and committees which were never heard of before, such as sheep dipping committees, have assumed a new importance. There are sensitive and serious talks going on about the North, which were referred to as &ldquo;tripartheid talks&rdquo; at one stage.  If councillors really want to get a trip around the country they will have tripartite talks with their fellow sheep dipping committee members in Donegal and Kerry and they will have reciprocal visits every now and again.  We have the greatest nonsense of all time.  I will not go into the background of it and I will not mention anybody by name.</P>

We also have harbour authorities.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Sheehan is right.  He is an authority on matters like that.  There are those three committees &mdash; vocational education committees, library committees and harbour authorities &mdash; which still exist.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what other committees are envisaged under section 37 of this Bill.  There could be an infinite number of committees.  A peculiar structure is proposed.  It is that two-thirds of the members of those committees, a majority, can be non-elected members without voting rights.  That seems extraordinary. I am not in favour of any members of any committee who are not elected.  If the Minister had given power to local authorities people would go forward and fight for positions as they never fought before, because they would be determined to have a say in what was happening.  They would not be willing to look on from outside.  This is all about responsibility.  What is happening, however, is that there is no power and no responsibility as things stand, and this Bill does nothing to change that.  That is my primary objection to the legislation. Whether we bring in this legislation or not, my primary objection to the system is that I do not subscribe to the theory that people should be put on committees without having to face the public.  Non-elected people should not be entertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to section 43, which deals with the establishment of regional authorities.  I was a member of a regional authority in the form of a health board, the South Eastern Health Board, for three or four years.  The Minister may or <Col N="588" /> may not know that health boards consist of 31 members, 16 of whom are elected representatives from the constituent local authorities in the region and the other 15 of whom are non-elected members who represent various interest groups within the medical profession.  Nobody will convince me other than that that was a serious mistake initially.  My experience has been that quite a number of the non-elected representatives have no interest in the general working of such a board or authority.  They have a purely sectional interest.  If something happens that affects their own small grouping then they will get involved.  Possibly I just had a bad experience which might not be typical, but I found that they were not concerned.  I do not care whom I offend, and I may offend some very good people who are non-elected representatives, when I say that the majority are not interested.  Such people will say they were elected from within their own organisation, but the people who elected them might only amount to half a dozen people.</P>
    <P>People running the affairs of this country should be elected by the public.  That is democracy and anything else is an undermining of democracy.  We are being attacked from both ends of the scale.  We are being dictated to by the Department of Finance and we are having to suffer non-elected members from various bodies and committees.  That is not the way it should be.  Everybody should have to stand before the public.  This very system which we are tolerating, encouraging and expanding is contrary to the public good and to the democratic system.  The sooner we face up to that the better.  If I had my way I would disband all the health boards in the country, whatever about the other regional councils &mdash; I was not a member of any of them. Maybe some of them are better, but my experience of that particular one was awful.  I would not want to see it done ever again.  I am therefore very much against section 43 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> Section 38 refers to joint committees and that can be quite desirable.  Joint committees of different local authorities can be helpful.  They need not consist of all the local authorities but could consist of one electoral division in a county meeting with the adjacent electoral division in another county to discuss matters of mutual interest, particularly where water schemes, sewerage schemes and road networks are concerned.  This could be particularly advantageous and there is a necessity for it.  Such meetings have been held informally over the years and it is a good thing that they are being put on a formal footing.  Again, if care is not taken one could have ridiculous situations. There could be joint committees of a number of local authorities.  For example a county like Tipperary, which is surrounded by seven counties, could theoretically have seven joint committees with the seven adjacent county councils. However, the local joint committee idea is commonsense and should have been done long ago because it is a good idea. It is one of the points in the Bill that I certainly would find favourable.  Overall I am not diametrically opposed to the Bill.  There are some good things in it.</P>

      <P>There are some good things in it, but the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will have to appreciate that I have an overriding objection to the lack of power vested in members of local authorities and, for that matter, Members of the Dáil.  Until such time as we get rid of the dominance of the Department of Finance we will have problems and we will never be the masters of our own destiny in this House or in the county or urban councils.  We will always be hamstrung and starved of money.  We will always be powerless and that is not the way it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister contradicted that.  He said: &ldquo;Another popular cliché in recent <Col N="590" /> times has been the claim that local authorities have become powerless; the facts, however, do not support this&ldquo;. That is totally incorrect.  I served as a member of two local authorities for 15 years and people who have been serving on the local authorities since I left them in 1982 tell me that things have got far worse.  They are getting less money and their meetings are quite often just a farce. So, I say to the Minister, that statement is incorrect.  Local authorities are very close to being powerless.  The only thing which has changed in the Department of the Environment in recent times is the name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise the matter of the boarding of a yacht, <i>The Lady Irene,</i> last Sunday afternoon by Royal Marines from the gunboat which is permanently stationed in Carlingford Lough.  The occupants of the yacht were approached and asked for permission to board.  Even though they had not been given consent the Royal Marines went on board to search the craft.  One of the Royal Marines went into the galley with Mrs. McGrady, one of the occupants, while another stayed on deck.  The occupants were asked to give their names but one of them, Mr. Des Gorman, refused on the basis that the Royal Marines had no legal right to request people on board an Irish yacht sailing in Irish waters to give their names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Royal Marines then took the helm of the boat but it was obvious to the people on board that he did not know how to sail it.  As a result of a jibbing manoeuvre, one of the occupants Mrs. McGrady, was struck on the head by the boom, which swung around at a 180º angle, as she came out of the cockpit and was knocked out temporarily.  Her <Col N="591" /> husband took control of the helm and sailed into Warrenpoint on the northern side of the Lough where an ambulance was waiting to take Mrs. McGrady to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.  She was later released.</P>
    <P>This is just one of a number of incidents which have occurred during the years where British Royal Marines boarded yachts entering and leaving the Lough. The reason I raise the matter tonight is that I and my constituents would like to know once and for all if the British Royal Marines stationed in the Lough have the legal right to demand that people heading towards the southern side of the Lough identify themselves.  I suggest to the Minister that he raise this matter with British Navy personnel and the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and suggest to them that, in the event of a person refusing to give their name and address when questioned on the Lough by British Royal Marines, instead of creating an incident similar to the one which occurred last Sunday, which could have been much more serious, the Royal Marines should allow the yacht to continue on its journey on the understanding that Garda or Irish Army personnel would be alerted and would question the occupants and search the boat, if necessary, when it docked eventually on the southern side of the Lough.  I think this would be acceptable to most of the people who use the Lough. The fact is that the occupants of each boat, commercial or private, are questioned as to their purpose for going out on the Lough.  This also goes for dinghies.</P>
    <P>I was reluctant to raise this matter because of the publicity it could engender, but this is a very serious matter and some of my constituents have made the point that a serious incident could occur and that this could be the first such incident.  Thankfully, no one was seriously injured apart from Mrs. <Col N="592" /> McGrady, who received a number of stitches in her head.  The strongest possible protest should be made by the Department of Foreign Affairs through the Anglo Irish Secretariat so that the British authorities are made aware of our serious concern about the boarding of yachts and other craft on the Lough.  They should be asked to consider an arrangement along the lines suggested where the Garda or the Irish Army would be involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the concern expressed by the Deputy over this latest incident involving the British Army in Carlingford Lough. Deputy Ahern has already been in contact with my Department about the incident. The matter was raised immediately with the British authorities and a full report on all the circumstances was sought.  I understand that the RUC have begun an investigation into the incident and that the crew have reported the matter to the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>The British authorities have responded to our inquiries to the effect that at approximately 3.50 p.m. on 5 May the vessel in question was boarded by British services personnel, despite the objections of the helmsman who maintained that the boarding team had no right to board as the yacht was in Irish waters.  The British allege that the crew were unco-operative. They say that the soldiers making up the boarding party decided, for reasons which have not been made clear, to take the vessel to Warrenpoint but that on the way the helmsman altered course to the South.  He was instructed by the soldiers to change course back to the North.  The British allege that the helmsman refused to comply, that he abandoned the wheel and went below deck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the British, the boarding party then took the helm in order to re-establish a northerly course.  They say that while the yacht was being turned to port a female member of the crew appeared from below decks.  A warning <Col N="593" /> was shouted to alert her to the fact that the boom was swinging around but she failed to duck in time and the boom struck her on the head.  We have been given to understand that she was taken to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry, accompanied by her husband, where she was treated for her injuries and released.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects to this response which call for further clarification and the Deputy has referred to some of these in his remarks.  As he also pointed out, there have been other incidents on the Lough which have given rise to concern in the past.  In view of the disquiet caused by this and other incidents on the Lough the matter will be taken up again with a view to getting a fuller explanation of why this incident developed as it did.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked what legal authority the British have to board and search Irish vessels in Irish waters.  The position in relation to Carlingford Lough is that the waters of the Lough are disputed and are bound up with the political problem of Northern Ireland.  The Government are very concerned about the operation of British patrols on the Lough and, where incidents occur, these are raised in forceful terms with the British authorities.  While the question of Naval Service patrols on the Lough is a matter for the Minister for Defence, I understand that Naval Service vessels do patrol the Lough periodically.  I will have the Deputy's suggestion that Irish personnel search vessels when they dock in Irish territory examined.</P>
    <P>The Government are most anxious to ensure that there should be no unwarranted interference with vessels using the Lough for legitimate recreational or business purposes.  We will be pursuing this aspect of the question with the British authorities, with particular reference to the forthcoming sailing season on the Lough.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the points he has made will be taken up with the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter in the House.  I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House but I felt it was necessary to bring to the Minister's attention a couple of matters relating thereto.</P>
      <P>Question No. 204 was to ask the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a social welfare officer called to a person (details supplied) in County Meath during the course of his work on a social employment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>Question No. 210 was to ask the Minister for Social Welfare the current position in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who is on a FAS course and recently had a visit from a social welfare investigator whose attitude seemed to indicate a threat to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance continuously from 1987 until 15 November 1990 when he commenced a social employment scheme.</P>
      <P>He was observed in a working situation by a social welfare officer on 2 November 1990 and, in the light of this, an investigation into his entitlement to unemployment assistance was undertaken. As part of this investigation it was necessary to interview the person concerned.  A call was made to his home on 14 March 1991 and the social welfare officer was directed to the place where she was engaged on a social employment scheme project.</P>
      <P>As a result of the investigation the person concerned has been disallowed unemployment assistance for the dates on which concurrent working and claiming has been established and an overpayment has been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> I want to raise two points in relation to this question.  I mean no criticism of the Minister and I realise fully that social welfare investigating officers have a very difficult job to do.  We all recognise they have to do it and we support them fully.</P>
    <P>However, there are ways and means of doing a job and on this occasion I felt the officer concerned was overly zealous in the performance and pursuit of his duty, particularly so when it came to light on foot of information being made available to the constitutent that for part of the period during which he was disallowed unemployment assistance it was discovered that he was on a Jobsearch course as directed by the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour.  That being the case, I would have to conclude that either an error was made or, due to pressure of work perhaps, the individual concerned was not fully able to establish whether the person was working or not and may have made a mistake.  However, the attitude to the constituent during the period when the investigation was taking place was not, to my mind, in the best interests of getting co-operation from the public or in the best interests of the Department concerned.</P>
    <P>I have the height of respect for the Minister in the way he runs his Department and I know full well he himself would be displeased to think anything untoward happened.  I do not wish to make any further allegations other than to say I felt the manner in which the constituent was approached was not in keeping with the guidelines and rules which are understood, more especially when it has transpired that for part of that period notice has already been served on the constituent to the effect that he now owes the Department a sum of money in respect of the period during which he was allegedly working.  Obviously, if the individual concerned was on a Jobsearch course &mdash; I have submitted information to that effect to the Department &mdash; there <Col N="596" /> is obviously an error, an overlapping.  I have to conclude that if the investigating officer was wrong in respect of part of the period in which he alleged the individual was working he could very well be wrong about the entire affair.  When it was suggested very strongly to the individual concerned that he was working the person concerned strenuously objected, and still objects, to the allegation.  I have no reason to disbelieve him.  It may well have appeared as if he were working at the time, but he was not.  He has taken very seriously the allegation that has been made against him.  I feel the Minister should take the matter up and have it resolved as amicably and as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>An investigation carried out by an officer from the Special Investigation Unit into the entitlement of a man who had been in continuous receipt of unemployment assistance for nearly four years gave rise to this question.  The Deputy has already received a full explanation in reply to these two parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>The investigation established that the person concerned was working for an employer on a number of dates on which he also drew unemployment assistance. It had been established that the person concerned was participating in deliveries to various locations.  He had also accepted deliveries on behalf of the employer at company headquarters on several occasions over a considerable period.  The social welfare officer visited the person concerned on 14 March 1991 to give him the opportunity to outline his version of events.  The officer was aware that the person was by that time engaged on a FÁS scheme and consequently he decided to visit him after normal working hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the officer called to his home between 7 and 7.30 in the evening he learned that he was still at work and was directed to his place of employment by <Col N="597" /> a member of the household.  When the officer made contact the person concerned chose not to co-operate and the officer withdrew.  He reported the result of his investigations to a deciding officer in my Department for determination. The person's claim was subsequently disallowed for each of the dates for which there was evidence that he had worked. An overpayment was assessed for the amount paid to him on those dates.  It was open to the person concerned to appeal against this decision and he has not done so to date.</P>
    <P>In raising this case in the context of an Adjournment debate, I can only assume that the Deputy does not share my concern to combat this kind of possible abuse in social welfare.  I note from what the Deputy has said that he feels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have taken action over the past few years to counteract abuse in the social welfare system.  Special units have been established to carry out investigations. These include the Special/Joint Investigation Unit and the External Control Unit.  Both units operate on a nationwide basis and have been very successful.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation/Joint Inspection Unit, is made up of inspectors from my Department as well as inspectors of taxes.  This unit combines the legislative powers and the resources of the two Departments in tackling abuses in social welfare and in tax evasion.  There are 58 social welfare officials and 15 tax officials in this unit.  It has been operating nationwide since January 1990.  This unit's activities saved the taxpayer £8.5 million in 1990.</P>
      <P>There are 23 officers in the External Control Unit.  They are based in social welfare offices throughout the country and their primary objective is to ensure that those signing on the register are genuinely unemployed.  They review claims to ensure compliance with the conditions governing eligibility for payment.  The control operations of this unit since 1987 have achieved savings of almost £30 million.</P>
      <P>Provision has also been made in this year's Social Welfare Act for a number of measures which are designed to eliminate abuse in the social welfare system.  All the social partners are committed to reducing the effect of the black economy.  These measures represent an important element in a major new crackdown on PRSI related abuse which is currently under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tackling social welfare abuse serves <Col N="599" /> two important functions.  It maintains the confidence of those who pay social welfare and those who contribute directly by way of social insurance contributions or directly by way of taxes which are then used to finance social welfare payments. In addition, the resources available to provide social welfare services can be targeted towards those in genuine need.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy and other Members of the House that I am very serious about tackling abuse of the social welfare system.  I am concerned that any work done in this area be proper and in accordance with the legislation.  My record shows how serious I am.  Under the legislation officers from my Department must carry out investigations.  They must ask questions where there is doubt about a person's entitlement to a social welfare payment.  These investigations can be difficult but officers are sensitive to the rights and dignity of the people being interviewed.  I am satisfied from my examination of this case that this investigation was conducted in a proper manner.  I am determined to ensure that abuses of social welfare are eliminated.  I am serious about this campaign.  I have to ask Deputy Durkan to accept and support what I am doing.  I am sure nobody holds a brief for anybody who would defraud the taxpayer or abuse the system. I have noted the points made by the Deputy but I am limited in the information I can supply.  If the amnesty is not availed of, the case will go to court.  It is not spread over ten days but rather over a long period of deliveries.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Barrett has given notice of his intention to raise the problem relating to a Chinese student who has spent the last six months in Mount joy Prison without being charged with any offence because the Department of Justice are awaiting documentation as to whether or not he should be granted political asylum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity.  Like thousands of other people who read in the newspaper this morning about this very sad case I was horrified to think that such a thing could happen in this country and that an individual could spend six months in prison without a charge against him.  I would describe this as internment without trial. If a similar incident occurred abroad involving an Irish citizen the people here would be marching in the streets and this House would be in chaos every morning as assurances would be sought from the Taoiseach and Government of the day that the rights of a citizen would be protected. It is extraordinary that it took a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> to bring to public attention the fact that this man has spent six months in prison.  I hope the Minister will give an assurance that tomorrow morning he will make arrangements to use his powers under the Aliens Act to release him.  I understand that four <Col N="601" /> requests have already been made to the Minister for Justice to take such action.</P>
      <P>There is no justification whatever for putting this man in prison without charge. According to reports he has suffered a great deal in his own country fighting for democracy and now he finds himself incarcerated in another democracy.  It is accepted that information must be sought in cases where a person seeks political refuge, but there are agencies such as the Irish Red Cross, the Eastern Health Board and Amnesty who could have taken this person under their supervision. He should have been offered hostel accommodation over the past six months. I understand an official of the Department stated that they were awaiting correspondence from the UN High Commission for Refugees.  Why leave somebody in prison if it takes six months to gather the necessary documentation?</P>
      <P>Apart from the human aspect of the question, it costs about £600 a week to keep a prisoner in Mountjoy.  It emerged at recent conferences held by prison officers and gardaí that convicted prisoners are being released after serving short periods of their sentences because there is no room to keep them any longer. Yet we can keep this man for six months, against whom no charge has been made. It is absolutely extraordinary that procedures could not be put in place whereby this person could be kept in a hostel or some other type of accommodation pending completion of an investigation.</P>
      <P>This is a flagrant abuse of human rights and it is the second time in 12 months that this Government have been responsible for such a situation.  We should have learned from the case 12 months ago involving a man from Somalia.  Deputy Carey pursued that issue for weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can understand the fear in the mind of that student, whose 21st birthday will occur on 17 May.  He probably does not speak English and does not understand our culture.  He has nobody to mix with and has been imprisoned for six months simply because he is seeking political <Col N="602" /> asylum.  Maybe he is not entitled to it, but surely we should respect human rights to a greater degree than displayed in this case.  The Minister should give an assurance for the sake of our reputation abroad that never again will this be allowed happen.  I want an assurance that the lock will be opened tomorrow morning and the man put into proper accommodation pending the outcome of an investigation into his case.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to respond to the comments made by Deputy Barrett on this case.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to place on record certain factors which should be borne in mind by all concerned when discussing matters of this kind.  First of all, I believe that the name and nationality of any applicant for asylum should not be publicly disclosed.  I say this for two reasons &mdash; firstly in the interest of the applicant whose application may be refused, leading to his return to his country of origin.  The fact of his having applied for asylum might cause difficulties for him or her either from the authorities or from friends and associates or from potential employers.  Secondly, the fact of the application having been made, whether successful or not, could cause difficulties in the country of origin for the family, friends and associates of the applicant.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that I am not suggesting that the unfortunate publication of certain personal information which has occurred in certain cases has ever led to these consequences but it is something that should be borne in mind by everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to reassure the House that the procedures we follow in these matters involving, as they do, consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner and the Department of Foreign Affairs, have not been found wanting in any respect and were endorsed by the United <Col N="603" /> Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at a meeting in Brussels in March of this year.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific case raised by Deputy Barrett, the position is that the person in question presented himself to an immigration officer at Dublin Airport on 25 October last after arriving from Amsterdam.  He presented a Japanese passport and an onward ticket to London.</P>
    <P>Closer inspection of the passport led the immigration officers to believe that it did not refer to the person who presented it.  When he was questioned by the immigration officer with the assistance of interpreters it emerged that he could not speak Japanese.  He was refused leave to land and placed in custody so that inquiries regarding his nationality could be carried out.</P>
    <P>On the following day members of his family, some of whom were resident in the United Kingdom, telephoned and stated that the person's intention was to visit his family in Manchester.  Later that evening three people who identified themselves as relatives of the person arrived in Dublin from Manchester.  They stated that it was the person's intention to travel to the United Kingdom via Ireland.</P>
    <P>On 27 October last, solicitors acting on behalf of the person indicated their intention to apply for asylum in Ireland. On 4 December last this application was received and inquiries concerning it, involving the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Department of Foreign Affairs, are still continuing.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that there are a number of aspects to this case which will require careful study before any decision regarding refugee status can be made.</P>
    <P>During the course of proceedings in the High Court, in the context of the continued detention of this person, it was accepted by the court and by counsel acting on his behalf that the detention was in accordance with law.  The court also said that the detention could be <Col N="604" /> ended by the withdrawal of the application by the person concerned in which event the arrangements for his removal, suspended while his application is pending, would be renewed.</P>
    <P>In connection with the possible release of the person while his application is being considered, the Deputy and the House will appreciate that, in the event of the application being refused, we would be obliged to make arrangements for his removal, not least because of our obligations to the Geneva Convention and to those recognised as refugees under it.  I am not satisfied, given the evidence of his ticketing arrangements and the statements of his family that he intended to visit them in Manchester or that he would remain in this country until his application for asylum is decided upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter tonight.  It is now nine years since the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> sank at the entrance to Castletownbere Harbour and the wreck is still there occupying almost half the harbour entrance.  It has for that period posed a serious threat to ships and craft entering and leaving the harbour. Numerous requests have been made by Cork County Council and fishing cooperatives in Castletownbere to the Minister for the Marine and his Department but all to no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal representative for the Bantry <Col N="605" /> Harbour Authority had lengthy and protracted correspondence with the Minister and the Department of the Marine dating back to 1983 but without success.  I ask the Minister to let the House know the answers to the following questions: first, why did the Department of the Marine refer to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, when the harbour commissioners have powers under the Harbours Act, 1946, to remove wrecks?  Second, have the Department of the Marine knowledge of the identity of the owners, the mortgagees, the charterers, the insurers, the shipping agents or any other parties having an interest in the craft?  Third, what efforts have been made to have the wreck removed by any party interested in it or to have it removed by the Department of the Marine and to recover the expense from any of the interested parties? Fourth, is there a limitation period where the owners or insurers can discard their liability to the wreck and, if that is the case, why was action not instituted within the limitation period?</P>
    <P>Finally, I call on the Minister to take positive steps to move the wreck immediately and thereby safeguard the passage of ships and craft entering and leaving the harbour at Castletownbere.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I would first like to remind the House of the background to this case. Following a fire on board, the vessel <i>Bardini Reefer</i> sank off the coast at Castletownbere, County Cork, in December 1982.  The wreck lies outside the limits of Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre and parts of it are visible at low tide.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the vessel has been buoyed and marked by the Commissioners of Irish Lights and is marked on navigational charts so its existence should be known by seafarers.  There are no reports of accidents or collisions as a result of any possible hazard posed by the wreck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of removal of the wreck is <Col N="606" /> estimated at between £0.5 million and £1.0 million pounds and could be higher. I informed Deputies on 10 March that, due to cost, I had no plans to remove the vessel.</P>
    <P>The wreck has been mentioned in the local newspapers from time to time and Cork County Council have been in regular communication with my Department regarding the removal of the wreck. Despite protracted correspondence between the Department and solicitors acting for the insurers, the latter are not prepared to finance the cost of removal of the wreck.  This position is not acceptable to me or my Department.  I wish to inform the Deputy that the matter is being pursued further with the insurers concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now almost two years since the embargo on the issuing of fishing licences was introduced by the Government and it has led to great confusion, uncertainty and, indeed, stagnation in the development of the Irish fishing industry.  At present I understand there are about 200 applications for fishing boat licences languishing on the Minister's desk and there seems to be an unwillingness or an inability at departmental and Government level to do anything.  We have now reached the ridiculous situation where young fishermen, many of whom have successfully completed a skipper's course and are fully trained, cannot take up fishing as a livelihood due to this incredible embargo.  What advice would the Minister give to a young man today who wants <Col N="607" /> to purchase a new fishing boat and earn his living as, perhaps, his father before him did?  Do we expect him to continue to accept the answers he has been getting during the last two years, namely, that his request is impossible and that he cannot have a boat of his own?</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that there are structural gaps in our fishing fleet and that the profile is not entirely suitable to our changing requirements.  We have too much capacity in certain areas and too little in others.  However, the Department seem to be powerless to address this problem and it has led the industry up a <i>cul-de-sac.</i>  It is no wonder we have so many young fishermen emigrating to as far away as Seattle and Japan and applying their skills there.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry has tremendous economic and employment potential. Our fishing grounds are one of the great natural resources.  Unfortunately, it is becoming impossible for us as a nation to reap these benefits while this crazy situation is allowed continue.  I appeal to the Minister to immediately take action, to break the logjam in issuing licences and to allow the industry develop to its full potential.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I have explained already on numerous occasions in this House the fishing boat licensing policy at present in force and the background to the policy.</P>
      <P>Licences are, generally speaking, allocated on a replacement basis only, that is, an applicant must offer to withdraw equivalent capacity from the fleet to that which he or she proposes to bring in.</P>
      <P>The rationale for this policy derives from both national and Community considerations. To allow additional capacity into many segments of our fleet where stocks are under pressure would simply undermine the viability of existing fishing activity.  Moreover, there are constraints arising from the policies of the European Community which entail maintaining strict control on the development of the fleet.</P>
      <P>The framework for the evolution of the Irish fishing fleet over the next five years is at the moment the subject of discussions with the European Commission and I am pressing strongly in that context for scope for additional capacity in those areas of the fleet where there is potential for development.</P>

      <P>I have had a number of meetings with the previous and present Ministers with responsibilities for education in Northern Ireland.  These meetings have led to the establishment of very worthwhile cross-Border projects.  Also my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, on an ongoing basis, seek to identify areas in which cross-Border co-operation and contact between pupils and teachers can be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools in the North and South as well as in England are already co-operating in the European Studies Project.  The aim of the project is to encourage pupils in the participating schools to explore the shared elements and the rich diversity in their heritage in a local and a wider European context.  The project is co-funded by the Department of Education in Belfast, London and ourselves and a contribution is made by the Commission of the European Communities.  Much of the exchange in the project takes place through the use of electronic mail but the project also involves residential programmes where pupils from the participating schools work together on topics involving history and geography.  I intend <Col N="456" /> to continue this programme into 1992 and then I plan in conjunction with the Departments of Education in Belfast and London to disseminate the results of the project.  A detailed evaluation of the project is also being carried out at present and future policy will be influenced by the results of this evaluation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education in Belfast and ourselves are also initiating an environment education project involving 24 schools from North and South this school year.  The project will be jointly funded by both Departments.  A pilot programme of teacher exchanges between North and South is also being operated for the first time this year.  The scheme will involve 20 teachers in the current school year.</P>
    <P>Many schoolchildren participate in cross-Border exchanges under the schemes administered by the Youth Exchange Bureau on behalf of my Department and steps are being taken by the Youth Exchange Bureau and the Central Bureau for Educational Visits in Belfast to improve the quality of these exchanges in the future.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides funding to Co-operation North towards the cost of their youth links and school links exchange schemes.  I intend to continue this funding for the foreseeable future as I feel that the Co-operation North exchange schemes makes a valuable contribution towards mutual respect and understanding on this island.  Regarding sporting activities, many sporting organisations are actively involved in promoting their own sport at school level and cross-Border co-operation is common in the areas of sporting knowledge and expertise.  I am also aware of numbers of children from the North visiting outdoor education centres here which are funded by my Department.</P>

The following locations have been designated as regional centres: <Col N="458" /> Cork; Athlone; Galway, Sligo; Waterford; Limerick; Tallaght National Basketball Arena; Baldoyle National Badminton Centre and Morton Stadium, Santry.  In addition, local sports centres are being established at various designated locations countrywide.</P>
      <P>Progress on the planning and construction of these centres in any year determines the annual financial allocation required.  The total capital allocation for 1991 in respect of all these projects is £10.454 million.</P>

      <P>In so far as second level teaching staff for VECs is concerned, a pupil-teacher ratio of 19:1 for recruitment purposes is being phased in over 1991 and 1992.  As a first step towards the full achievement of this ratio, a PTR of 19.5:1 for recruitment purposes has been introduced for the 1991-92 session.  The &ldquo;retention ratio&rdquo; of 19:1, which was introduced for the 1990-91 session is also being continued for the 1991-92 session. My Department are currently examining arrangements for the phasing in of ex-quota vice-principal posts, to commence in 1992-93 as provided for in the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting of EC Education Ministers of 6 October 1989 referred to by the Deputy adopted conclusions on co-operation and Community policy in the field of education in the run-up to 1993 which stated that &ldquo;Five objectives shared by the Community member states can be identified as a basis for future co-operation activities.  They will contribute to drawing the states <Col N="463" /> closer together in the field of education and training and thus to bringing about a Europe of knowledge and cultures&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The five objectives are: 1. A multicultural Europe based on: strengthening young people's sense of belonging to a European community by developing the European dimension in teaching and teacher training; the progressive achievements of genuine multilingualism by promoting foreign-language teaching in school, university and vocational-training section; taking the variety of cultural approaches into account in education and training systems; drawing educational and training establishments closer together in the interest of mutual enrichment and the enhanced integration of children and citizens of the Community member states, in particular within the school environment, with due regard for their linguistic and cultural identity.</P>
      <P>2.  A mobile Europe ensured by: the free movement of persons and ideas, encouraged in particular by the systems for recognition of diplomas and for the equivalence of professional qualifications; support for the organisation of youth exchanges and for the training periods abroad for teachers, instructors, pupils, students and education administrators; the introduction of procedures providing teachers with the opportunity to teach temporarily in educational establishments of the Community member states.</P>
      <P>3.  A Europe of training for all based on: the offer of high-quality education and training to all young people in the Community, which should, in the long term, contribute to reducing regional disparities; the development of appropriate teaching and training for disadvantaged children and of measures to combat failure at school; equality of access of high-quality education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  A Europe of skills secured by: constantly improving the quality of basic education; providing young people with a better preparation for working life and giving them the opportunity to adapt to economic, technological, social and cultural developments, developing all the <Col N="464" /> educational sectors which are vital for the future of Europe, in particular technical and vocational training and higher education; adapting the content and methods of training to technological change; improving the initial and continuing training of education staff.</P>
    <P>5.  A Europe open to the world, which seeks to: intensify co-operation with international organisations dealing with education and training; strengthen links with other states and evolve new forms of mutual support with developing countries.</P>
    <P>The conclusions go on to instruct the Education Committee which is composed of representatives of all 12 Education Ministries to: examine the proposals that the Commission will submit to the Council.  In particular on the basis for communication on medium-term guidelines and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 2 above; promote exchanges of information on the activities undertaken in the member states to achieve the objectives adopted, in particular through the organisation of regular meetings among those responsible at the political and administrative levels; examine other ways of improving procedures currently followed and developing future co-operation in the field of education, having regard to the need for effective management of co-operation activities and value for money, and to the need to recognise the limitations on resources.</P>
    <P>I stress the context of the objectives in these conclusions of the Ministerial discussion because they are intended as guidelines for the Commission and the Education Committee in furthering work on education co-operation in the Community. They were not intended as a set of prescriptive norms for individual member states which were to be given priority in individual member states.  It is true to say that all the aspirations and objectives contained in the five points are part of the ongoing education policy of my Department and are reflected in many concrete initiatives and they will be reflected in the Green Paper on education currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> The five objectives to which the Deputy refers were, however, given very serious consideration during the Irish Presidency in the first half of 1990.  For example Ireland chaired several EC meetings which were held to progress the Commission's proposal for a second general directive on the mutual recognition of professional and technical qualifications which complements the General Directive on Higher Qualifications.</P>
    <P>The Education Committee under the Irish Presidency focussed the Community's attention on a range of the issues contained in the five objectives and the Education Council of 30 May 1990 over which I presided considered the following matters all of which reflect aspects of the five objectives: the integration of children and young people with disabilities into ordinary systems of education; the enhanced treatment of equality of educational opportunity for girls and boys in the initial and in-service training of teachers; distance education and training; education for enterprises; and quite significantly in the context of the five objectives the institution of regular meetings of senior officials of the Education Departments of the Twelve to improve the quality of co-operation in education at Community level and to ensure that educational reforms within member states can be designed in full awareness of the experience of other member states.</P>

      <P>To extend the nearest service so as to provide a home pick-up for the child in question, would involve advancing the present timetable to a 7.09 a.m. start. Such a move would inconvenience nine other pupils on the service which already has a very early start and I would be reluctant to initiate such a change without the agreement of the parents of these children.</P>

      <P>There are no reciprocal arrangements at present for transferring pension rights of teachers between this country and other EC member states. Any such proposals would have to be considered in a public sector context and this is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a reciprocal transfer agreement with other EC member states it would not be appropriate to amend Irish public sector superannuation schemes to allow credit for service with organisations in these countries on a &ldquo;one-way transfer&rdquo; basis.

      <P>Official policy in relation to the issue or refusal of a work permit is based on the need to ensure that, in accordance with relevant EC rules, job opportunities which arise within the State are, as far as possible, reserved for Irish or European Community (EC) nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While sympathetic consideration is given to work permit applications in respect of persons who are the spouses of Irish nationals, each case must be considered on its merits.  It is not possible to <Col N="478" /> say in advance whether an application will be successful or what the outcome of any particular application might be.</P>
    <P>The granting of a work permit is generally not considered unless the employer can show that, despite all reasonable efforts, there are no suitably qualified Irish or EC nationals available for the position in question, or that special circumstances apply; for example: (i) that the prospective employee is a key employee and that a substantial amount of high quality employment for Irish/EC nationals will arise as a result of his or her employment; or (ii) that the prospective employee is coming as part of a recognised exchange programme; or (iii) that the prospective employee is officially recognised by the Minister for Justice as being a refugee; or (iv) that the prospective employee is married to an Irish/EC national or is a dependent child or child under 21 of an Irish/EC national.</P>
    <P>If the person in question is an EC national he does not require a work permit unless he is a national of Spain or Portugal who still require work permits.</P>

He appealed against this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and he was referred for a further medical examination by a different medical referee on 22 January 1991 when he was again deemed to be capable of work. Subsequently representations were received on his behalf concerning the extent of his illness, as a result of which the appeals officer deemed it necessary to have further medical inquiries carried out.  The case has, therefore, been referred for a further examination by a medical referee which will take place shortly.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment benefit is limited in duration to 15 months benefit in any one claim and before benefit can become payable again 13 PRSI contributions must be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1968 the maximum duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit <Col N="480" /> was 156 days &mdash; six months.  A claimant who had been paid his full entitlement to 156 days unemployment benefit could not requalify for benefit until 13 contributions were paid by him after the 156th day of unemployment, the last day of his claim.</P>
    <P>The duration for payment of unemployment benefit was extended to 312 days &mdash; 12 months &mdash; in 1968 and to 390 days &mdash; 15 months &mdash; in 1976.  However, the requalifying condition was not changed in that contributions paid after 156 days benefit counted towards requalifying for benefit.  This resulted in persons, in intermittent employment, who had been paid their full entitlement to benefit being able to requalify for benefit on foot of social insurance contributions which had been paid before their entitlement has ceased.  In effect, this operated to negative the general requalification condition imposed on fully unemployed persons who have to find insurable employment for 13 weeks after the end of their claim before they can requalify.</P>
    <P>This anomaly was removed by this year's Social Welfare Act which now requires that the 13 requalifying contributions must be paid by all claimants after the 390th day of payment of unemployment benefit thus bringing the treatment of persons in intermittent employment into line with claimants generally. This arrangement is also in line with that applying to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>People working in a continuous week-on, week-off arrangement will requalify for unemployment benefit on payment of 13 contributions after exhausting 390 days benefit.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that persons on a week-on, week-off arrangement are not at this time treated as other systematic short-time workers who are on a reduced working week.  The latter are persons who for the time being work a reduced working week &mdash; usually two or three days.  They are paid unemployment benefit for either two or three days only at a daily rate equal to one-fifth the weekly rate.  They are not entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>Short-time workers on a week-on, <Col N="481" /> week-off arrangement are not subject to these limitations on their entitlements. They also have certain advantages in relation to income tax in that their benefit is not regarded as taxable income and they are given tax-free allowances in respect of their weeks off which reduce their tax liability on their weeks at work.</P>

      <P>There is no trace of a claim to disability benefit from the person concerned.</P>
      <P>To qualify for disability benefit a claimant is required to have at least 39 reckonable contributions paid since entry into insurance in addition to having 39 contributions of the appropriate class paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Claims to benefit made in 1991 are governed by the 1989/90 contribution year.</P>
      <P>The Department's records indicate that the contribution record of the person in question consists solely of 52 self-employment contributions recorded in the year 1988-89.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 6 December 1990 on his return from England.  His means, derived from the benefit of his wife's income, were assessed at £94.40 per week.</P>
      <P>The means assessed were halved to £47.20 per week as he was not entitled to an adult dependant increase for his wife who has earnings over the dependency limit of £55 per week.  As this means assessment exceeded the maximum weekly rate of £45 payable in his case he was not entitled to any payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>He appealed his means assessment to the independent social welfare appeals office.  After further inquiries an appeals officer confirmed the means assessment at £94.40 per week from 6 December 1990.</P>

      <P>The detailed policing arrangements for particular areas are a matter for the Garda authorities who inform me that every effort is made to maximise the number of gardaí assigned to foot patrol duties and other outdoor operational duties in Cork.  The local Garda officers are satisfied that the best use is being made of available resources at present in meeting the policing needs of the city.</P>
      <P>The community policing scheme, which was extended to Cork in November 1990, has an important role to play in the policing arrangements for residential areas.  Gardaí assigned to such duties perform foot patrols in their assigned areas during their tour of duty and the scheme has proved very successful in fostering closer Garda/community relations and providing the reassurance of a more visible Garda presence in local neighbourhoods. At present, eight gardaí are assigned to community policing duties in Cork city and an extension of the scheme to the Glen/Farranree Farrancleary area will take place shortly.  Further extensions of the scheme in Cork will take place as circumstances allow.</P>

      <P>I met my counterpart, Mr. Jeremy Hanley, MP, Northern Ireland Minister with responsibility for Health, on the occasion of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 9 April last.</P>
      <P>During the course of our meeting we discussed the scope for further development of the present arrangements for co-operation in the provision of highly specialised treatments on an island-wide basis, co-operation on European initiatives and co-operation in the procurement of equipment and supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to record that existing well established and wide-ranging co-operation between the two Health <Col N="493" /> Departments and their respective health services in areas such as health promotion, cancer registration, emergency planning and dental research was commented on favourably by the Conference.</P>
    <P>Significant initiatives in this area over the last year, for instance, have included an overlapping campaign to encourage the uptake of measles, mumps and rubella vaccination, a &ldquo;Lifewise&rdquo; campaign run by the Mid-Western Health Board which was based on a similar initiative in Northern Ireland and the provision of training in University College, Cork for Northern Ireland personnel involved in a survey of child dental health.</P>
    <P>Co-operation at all levels in the health area is a process which leads to important benefits to both sides and it is my intention to encourage and develop it.</P>
